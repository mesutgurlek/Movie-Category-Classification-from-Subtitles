1
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:18,479
and the light shines in the darkness and
the darkness has not seized.

2
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:41,979
House

3
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:10,942
Lisa, please forgive me.

4
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,151
Please.

5
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,775
Everything is good.

6
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:34,756
Are you really all that good for us?

7
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,652
Not for us.

8
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:40,590
Is it okay?

9
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:44,209
It is fine for me!

10
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:00,806
You can not murder me. .

11
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,084
I am your wife!

12
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:10,575
Sorry.

13
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:20,882
What if I take the card again?

14
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:40,401
Hey, go even slower!

15
00:04:42,244 --> 00:04:44,380
We would now almost be.

16
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:46,512
You are lost.

17
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:49,116
No, I am never lost.

18
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:53,735
Ahh super...

19
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:56,861
What?

20
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,958
Police...

21
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,953
Slow down!

22
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,417
Jack!
What?

23
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,101
Slow down!
Look, I'm busy!

24
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,023
What was that again?

25
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:26,049
You drove too fast,
he wanted you out of the window.

26
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,221
You are lucky that you have received no summons.

27
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:29,938
Fine.

28
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,541
Can we please
just listen to the radio?

29
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:38,530
You do not want to listen to your wife's' greatest hits'?

30
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:53,726
Jack!

31
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,685
Have not seen you wreck?
- No

32
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,590
What's the matter with you?

33
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,199
You drive like a madman

34
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,749
Could you pin not see it?
Take it still wants you!

35
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,244
Try not to tell me
I still should be.

36
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:37,272
Sorry officer, I saw this movement are not pawns.

37
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,690
I see your license.

38
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,053
I said I had to see your license, now!

39
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:45,712
Yes sir.

40
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,622
I hope nobody injured agent.

41
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:02,085
What is your name?
-Stephanie Singleton

42
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,326
Lift you up with him?

43
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,368
No we are married.

44
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:10,584
Where are you going?

45
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:15,410
Montgomery.
Montgomery...

46
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:21,719
You are on the wrong track
to Montgomery, then.

47
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:26,491
We had an appointment with the Mayor
Jack and lost on purpose

48
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,395
Actually, if you give us the quickest way back
to the highway could tell

49
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:34,140
I would greatly appreciate agent.

50
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:51,269
There is a quicker way... .

51
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:11,159
Were you not even Mrs Lachebek...

52
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,023
I tried to us a fine save.

53
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:22,421
This is our chance to save $ 400.

54
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:23,879
What do you think?

55
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,705
Is that the way back to the highway?

56
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:31,850
It said that, first left at the top of the hill.

57
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,272
Unless you really want to get our deal.

58
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:39,843
Let's go home then

59
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:52,642
Slow down!

60
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:55,177
Why not call you out
and cancel your session ok?

61
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,417
Great, no reception...

62
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:33,443
The band is leak...

63
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:40,141
and if the rear.
- Did we not reserve?

64
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,563
No, I do not have any two.

65
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:54,641
What have we become?

66
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:57,838
Looks like some scrap iron
a truck has been dropped.

67
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:04,742
I think not
we the only lucky.

68
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,230
No receipt?

69
00:10:21,402 --> 00:10:22,692
Hello?

70
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,385
Is anyone there?

71
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,509
Maybe the driver did get a tow truck.

72
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:09,527
I can not on the road map.

73
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,828
Maybe we get back
to walk to the agent.

74
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:15,221
In the rain?

75
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,513
Jack, we can not stay here!

76
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,554
Ok, you stay here and I should get help.

77
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,180
Don 't blame me if you wet?
Keep your mouth.

78
00:11:33,464 --> 00:11:35,697
This is a bad idea, we had
never to leave the main road.

79
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:39,201
Can not you just stop whining?
I have a lot to have to shoot.

80
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:42,079
Oh yes, 50 dollars shared with a band and free beer.

81
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:15,445
I do not believe that we have come along.

82
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,203
Looks like a "bed and breakfast"

83
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,202
No cars.
That is weird.

84
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:32,223
We have only one phone.

85
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:45,166
Hello?

86
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,567
Hello?

87
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,889
Today's date.

88
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,194
Fortunately we are not the only one here.

89
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,324
Hey, are you in management?

90
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,853
Oh no no, we are only
looking for a phone.

91
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,510
You will Randy and Leslie are.
- Is a bus.

92
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:16,048
Hey I'm Jack Singleton?
How are you?

93
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:22,037
This is Stephanie, I mean...
-His dear wife.

94
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,003
So you have to check?

95
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:27,739
- It is raining outside fool,
who will come here on holiday?

96
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:30,883
This place is not bad
corn bread with his charms.

97
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:31,884
Randy buys motels.

98
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,959
I buy some spots,
for them to snap.

99
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,107
Jack has been on the road.

100
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,578
A few farm parts?

101
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,598
Are you on the BMW then?
-Yes

102
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,084
Your lights are on.

103
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:49,339
Do you know who is the boss?
I have seen in anyone.

104
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,918
The staff will be gone, because there is none.

105
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:59,220
But check this out,
it looks like a museum.

106
00:14:10,827 --> 00:14:12,624
The table is covered for 4.

107
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:28,233
View this chandelier agree.

108
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:33,159
It looks like the crystal eight.

109
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,585
Is not that where people
eventually die?

110
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:42,177
I think the generator is gone.

111
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:48,681
Come on Jack,
You girls stay here.

112
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:52,346
Look what happened.
Come on Jack.

113
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,345
Is it?
Not really...

114
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,346
Come on Jack

115
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:14,127
Here is one.

116
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:18,911
Did you hear that?

117
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,471
The sound of the house.

118
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:24,648
Help me want you.

119
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:33,008
Since there is a sting in the same.

120
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:39,249
You're quickly scared man.

121
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:53,243
Here...

122
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:02,183
Hello?

123
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:19,420
What do you two like.

124
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:22,148
Jack is a writer. He publishes thrillers.

125
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:25,981
I am a singer.

126
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:28,786
Oh yeah?

127
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,000
I have heard one of your...
- Not yet.

128
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:37,850
I studied Psychology in Auburn.

129
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,812
Look what I found.
- My hero!

130
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:58,417
You better hurry.

131
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,437
Hello there!

132
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:10,996
Sorry Madam, there was nobody at the reception.

133
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:15,998
The name is Betty, just Betty.
And this is our site.

134
00:17:16,592 --> 00:17:16,592
This is my son Pete.

135
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:24,304
And Stuart is below
fuses to check.

136
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:27,604
Ah look at that.

137
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,112
We are not so many guests
in this time of year.

138
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:34,475
It just rains too much.

139
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,778
Are you both put in the registry?

140
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:40,711
Yes Madam, that we are.

141
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,212
$ 20 per night.

142
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:47,199
Per person, low season rates.

143
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,880
Is there food?

144
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:50,278
We have enough to eat.

145
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:56,894
That you should clean
we are like pigs.

146
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,313
Food around the trough.

147
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:07,473
Why are you do not refresh?
A bathroom in the hallway, the other up.

148
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,879
Actually, we do not stay overnight.

149
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,057
We would just like to use
of your phone.

150
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:14,831
Our tires are puncture and we want to call a tow truck.

151
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:16,463
Tires leak?

152
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,388
Are you sure?

153
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,359
Pete.

154
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:25,823
Assign this woman as the phone.

155
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:32,353
25 cents for local calls.

156
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:43,765
But I can say with certainty...
that there is no sleepwagens come here tonight.

157
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,861
You can you do better just to refresh.

158
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,364
You look clean enough.

159
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,072
Help me even in the kitchen sweetheart.

160
00:19:06,482 --> 00:19:08,698
I do not bite.

161
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:22,792
We stay here really do not eat right.
- Okay.

162
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:29,197
Hey Pete, you might have a list of garages
or a phone for me?

163
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:37,321
This place makes me scared.

164
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:40,784
It's okay, we are not alone.
- Randy and Lesley?

165
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:46,769
He lult but what and it is curious.
Have you seen how they looked to us?

166
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:50,892
No it is not noticed me.
Well you are in its least noticed.

167
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,784
Hey Pete, are you sure this thing works?
There is no ringing in.

168
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,661
Sometimes he does it, sometimes not.

169
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:12,412
If he does...

170
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,581
you will regret it!

171
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:18,496
I tell you Jack,
there is something wrong with those people.

172
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:21,169
What are you talking about?
That old lady is ok.

173
00:20:21,768 --> 00:20:24,924
Maybe a little crazy.
But we must stay here.

174
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:27,214
I do not understand how we are
verzeild have to get.

175
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:28,983
Oh so now is a flat band officially my fault.

176
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,317
You had to go through to Montgomery.
You would not!

177
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:32,985
Because you did not want!
-You know what...

178
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:35,761
I'm tired and I got hungry, ok?

179
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:40,367
I hate you Jack.

180
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:44,708
Ok, hate me.

181
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:02,108
You are really a temptation sweetheart, right?

182
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:11,729
Shall we then?

183
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:16,098
Excuse...
No thank you, I must watch my figure.

184
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:17,633
Do not mold!

185
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:23,506
You are as slim as an eel.
You better eat if you still melting away.

186
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:31,692
It looks good from it.

187
00:22:35,073 --> 00:22:36,937
Stuart!

188
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:49,686
Here Stuart,
for the man of the house.

189
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:55,611
You are beautiful.

190
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:02,568
Thank you. Randy and I thought about
by the national forest travel...

191
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:05,129
What time do you...
- Are you married?

192
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,423
Not yet.

193
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:09,826
Jump your woman abuse
in one of our rooms?

194
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:11,196
Stuart.

195
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:13,827
Keep your own issues.

196
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,964
Sorry honey,
some people have no manners.

197
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:21,829
I would like her mama!
I know you want it.

198
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:29,590
He will be beaten,
that is the problem.

199
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:36,326
Hey dude, it is outside your reach,
stay away from her.

200
00:23:45,143 --> 00:23:47,533
Let me give you some more ice.
I did not really thirsty.

201
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:50,048
The ice melts al

202
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,385
You are beautiful.

203
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:10,560
Can I marry you?
-I 've been busy.

204
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,675
She is caught, any way.

205
00:24:13,676 --> 00:24:15,465
Thus it is enough.

206
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:24,965
Melissa?
-Stephanie?

207
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,752
No!

208
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,323
You must first ask
before you leave the table.

209
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:38,947
Stephanie.

210
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,563
They know it?
What?

211
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,564
The accident!

212
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,712
How should they know of the accident?
- Because you told them!

213
00:24:45,713 --> 00:24:47,003
I told them nothing!
- I go here.

214
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:49,307
Whether you come or not.

215
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:51,063
Have I said something wrong.

216
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:52,959
Stephanie

217
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:58,926
Come inside!

218
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,507
What is wrong?

219
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:03,310
What have you done?

220
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:06,782
What do you mean 'what have we done?

221
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:11,431
You have brought him.

222
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:13,965
Who brought?
- Still he is coming.

223
00:25:15,989 --> 00:25:17,515
Who is there?

224
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,770
Hey, where are you doing?
Quiet!

225
00:25:25,488 --> 00:25:27,009
You know who that is?

226
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:52,724
Give me the keys!

227
00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:56,392
Close all doors off!
Who's there?

228
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,538
If he comes here...
Are we all as good as dead!

229
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,856
Stop, you try us
just fear to hunt, right?

230
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,118
He is on my porch!

231
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,562
Trying to enter.

232
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,085
What is that?
These articles...

233
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,630
It's about a missing couple.

234
00:26:56,631 --> 00:27:00,692
Agent Laudale
and his wife were reported missing...

235
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:06,227
He will murder us.

236
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:13,928
Their car was found in a
abandoned farm on Highway 82

237
00:27:14,098 --> 00:27:15,394
We were on Highway 82.

238
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:21,292
Is this the farm?

239
00:27:21,912 --> 00:27:23,789
Is this the farm?

240
00:27:26,426 --> 00:27:28,921
I think so.

241
00:27:36,506 --> 00:27:38,461
Go back!

242
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:39,462
Come run!

243
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:52,529
Do you cut?
- No, it does so.

244
00:27:57,064 --> 00:27:57,826
Hey!

245
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,308
What are we to do?

246
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:02,245
What?

247
00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:10,301
Some call him the "Tin Man"

248
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:14,256
It is said that he was on the 'guilty' hunts.

249
00:28:17,728 --> 00:28:18,832
She talks about us.

250
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:24,261
I say just what other people say.

251
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,380
There is something written.

252
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:52,056
Ok

253
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:55,163
Welcome to my house.
House rules:

254
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:59,391
Line 1: God came into my house and I killed him.

255
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:06,824
Rule 2: I will everyone who enters my house
murder with God as I did.

256
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:17,990
Rule 3: Give me 1 dead body before sunrise
and then I run rule 2.

257
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:24,166
It is ok Steph.

258
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:26,773
It will be a sick joke or something are you?

259
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:30,615
Sick joke?

260
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:33,065
He was not playing, he shot at us

261
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,030
Can he come over?

262
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,477
I told Stuart that the windows
up close to.

263
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,656
The attic is properly completed.

264
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,254
Where you keep your weapons?

265
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:49,948
Where you keep your weapons?

266
00:29:49,949 --> 00:29:52,918
Stuart has a few shotguns,
in the basement.

267
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:54,040
Take me there!

268
00:29:55,747 --> 00:29:56,934
Let me see where the basement!

269
00:29:56,935 --> 00:29:58,837
Randy keep quiet!

270
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,815
As long as he is excluded, we can
maybe wait until it goes away.

271
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:03,976
We have an agent on the road.

272
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,271
Perhaps he sees our cars
and we find here.

273
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:10,369
I'm not going to 'maybe this' and
'if that' wait.

274
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:15,578
Where is the basement, old lady.
-Randy!

275
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:17,879
Jeff is right. We must not
panic.

276
00:30:18,003 --> 00:30:20,653
If this is really a game,
can we better stick together.

277
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,150
You listen to them?

278
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:24,456
You would not even know
what they said about you.

279
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:38,613
Do you have more guns down there?

280
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:41,396
Yup, but I think we have
but necessary.

281
00:30:41,817 --> 00:30:43,234
Yes but I get there too.

282
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,734
I said we needed one!

283
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:47,856
Calm down man!
Come back now!

284
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,774
Relax!
Back now!

285
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:54,947
Stuart...
Go back there!

286
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:57,902
What are you doing man?

287
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,408
Hey calm down!
He will protect us.

288
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:05,187
What were the "Tin Man" this time?

289
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:08,342
A dead body, before sunrise.

290
00:31:11,772 --> 00:31:13,405
Let this great man than address.

291
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,710
Relax!
-Stop it, what are you doing do you think?

292
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:21,673
Watch him,
he's as scared as a weasel.

293
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:24,424
Betty.

294
00:31:26,147 --> 00:31:27,953
Stuart say that he should stop.

295
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,337
Stuart

296
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,070
Stop again!

297
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:36,346
Because if you shoot one of them

298
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,869
you murder them all!

299
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:50,349
Let's do it in the refrigerator.
Not so fast yet.

300
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:51,911
You gotta be kidding me!

301
00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:56,290
Come on inside you!
You too girl.

302
00:31:59,131 --> 00:32:01,676
Why are you doing this?
We have done nothing.

303
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:03,223
You have difficulties.

304
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:06,135
As a dog fleas meedraagt.

305
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:07,959
The pile zieligste sinners
that I have ever seen.

306
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,518
You can not keep.

307
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,608
Oh we will get you well!

308
00:32:13,904 --> 00:32:15,373
About two weeks or something.

309
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:18,848
I would actually have to pop off now, Randy'tje.

310
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:20,590
Randy'tje!

311
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,223
You're just a little girl!

312
00:32:25,363 --> 00:32:27,386
You are nothing!

313
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:30,902
Randy get the ax!

314
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:08,499
Steph, Go!

315
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,306
Go!

316
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:19,598
You can not escape.
You are as good as dead!

317
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,307
There are guns below. Come on.

318
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:30,802
I get you do.

319
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:30,828
We must not forget the girls.
First guns, then the girls.

320
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:33,579
Come on!

321
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:44,222
Did you hear that?

322
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,807
They try to escape.
Let's go.

323
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:51,376
Here.

324
00:35:02,694 --> 00:35:03,700
Melissa

325
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:19,411
Jack.

326
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,576
Jack!

327
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,396
Jack!

328
00:35:57,986 --> 00:36:00,952
This freaks worship the devil.
- Oh god, it's black art.

329
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,323
Find something for them to break.

330
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:14,087
No reflection.

331
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,945
Yes it is a magic mirror.

332
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:22,278
There is something wrong with this place.

333
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:30,202
I go back for Steph.

334
00:36:30,203 --> 00:36:32,667
Watch out for that fool with his rifle.

335
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,058
Randy them coming!

336
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,498
Papa?

337
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:35,984
Melissa!

338
00:37:41,712 --> 00:37:43,219
Melissa!

339
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:01,106
Jack?

340
00:38:20,488 --> 00:38:22,323
Are you gonna let him?

341
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:33,276
Yep.

342
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,270
The door to the southern corridor is open.

343
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:46,801
Go look.

344
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:21,042
I'm home

345
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:36,008
Papa?

346
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,654
Let me see who you are.

347
00:40:39,968 --> 00:40:42,574
Shows!

348
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,972
Mama?

349
00:41:07,413 --> 00:41:10,154
Eat your cake in honey.
I bought especially for you.

350
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,670
You're a sweet girl.

351
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:21,529
It is our little secret.

352
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,895
Good.
There's more.

353
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,838
Busy Jack.

354
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:04,795
Busy busy Jack.

355
00:42:05,846 --> 00:42:06,728
Here

356
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,673
Papa do you want me to go skating?

357
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:34,958
Papa?

358
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:39,883
Sorry honey, daddy is just as busy.
Mama is with you.

359
00:42:39,884 --> 00:42:42,899
Please, Daddy, Mommy is always busy.

360
00:42:43,331 --> 00:42:45,363
Stop typing.
It is her turn.

361
00:42:47,082 --> 00:42:48,607
Daddy, please?

362
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:53,132
Steph, Melissa wants to go outside,
you take her?

363
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:56,446
One moment.
Mama to the call.

364
00:42:59,683 --> 00:43:00,522
No!

365
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:16,981
Melissa!

366
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,622
Oh I know...

367
00:43:22,712 --> 00:43:23,622
I know

368
00:44:02,202 --> 00:44:03,250
<i> kill her. She Melissa die &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

369
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,487
Melissa!
-Jack!

370
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:19,722
Papa?

371
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:29,031
Melissa?

372
00:44:36,193 --> 00:44:37,078
Melissa!

373
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,523
Sorry, I'll hurt you.

374
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,219
My name is Jack.
What is your name?

375
00:45:56,737 --> 00:45:57,666
Susan.

376
00:45:58,351 --> 00:45:59,494
Hello Susan.

377
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:04,399
It goes well with Melissa.

378
00:46:05,531 --> 00:46:06,748
What did you say?

379
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:09,924
You called it right?

380
00:46:16,258 --> 00:46:19,260
Nothing wrong.
Will it be a fuse.

381
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:21,839
He is.

382
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:26,159
He likes the dark.

383
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:27,473
Who?

384
00:46:28,633 --> 00:46:29,456
The Tin Man.

385
00:46:30,248 --> 00:46:31,990
We must keep moving or he will find us.

386
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:42,402
Come on.

387
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:53,377
How are you down here... .
- Ssst, he is close.

388
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:02,418
Randy

389
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,467
Pa?

390
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:20,165
Randy, I do what you have learned.

391
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,586
That is he.

392
00:48:07,279 --> 00:48:09,503
Randy, look son, there is he.

393
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,216
Come on, shoot him.

394
00:48:20,802 --> 00:48:24,174
Stupid jerk you are. You shoot as
a little girl.

395
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:26,751
What is wrong with you boy?

396
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:29,031
Sorry.

397
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,268
I do what you have learned.

398
00:48:36,303 --> 00:48:37,490
Come on now.

399
00:49:07,886 --> 00:49:10,310
Enough now!
Where are you!

400
00:49:11,996 --> 00:49:14,369
You forget the game boy.

401
00:49:15,554 --> 00:49:16,681
I forget nothing.

402
00:49:16,682 --> 00:49:18,329
You lose your father made.

403
00:49:18,364 --> 00:49:21,559
Listen to me, Jack will murder you if
you do not make first hand.

404
00:49:33,331 --> 00:49:35,649
The shots came from there. Come on.

405
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,802
We can not go back.

406
00:49:38,612 --> 00:49:40,999
Susan, you can trust me ok?

407
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:45,062
Come on.

408
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,502
Find your mother's pies are not good?

409
00:50:02,662 --> 00:50:03,911
Do you like my room nice?

410
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:08,382
I got it specially for you.
Exactly as I thought you would find fun.

411
00:50:18,631 --> 00:50:20,783
I do not like him Pete.

412
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:35,844
Sorry Pete.

413
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:38,550
Do you like me?

414
00:50:38,551 --> 00:50:41,057
Euhm Well, I know you do not really Pete.

415
00:50:43,722 --> 00:50:45,431
I mean...

416
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:46,432
I had an uncle named Pete.

417
00:50:49,528 --> 00:50:52,006
But I no longer talk with him.

418
00:50:52,974 --> 00:50:54,102
I want to marry you.

419
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:55,326
You know I do not agree.

420
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:57,970
Sorry.

421
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:01,453
Sorry Pete.

422
00:51:03,037 --> 00:51:06,214
You, Stuart and Betty are all family?

423
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:07,978
Ma has ever killed a man.

424
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:09,939
Just like you did.

425
00:51:11,523 --> 00:51:15,824
Temptation is the greatest sin of all.
People talk over so they do what you want.

426
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:18,700
In their beds to sleep!

427
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,464
I use my life, you pig!

428
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:24,435
I know what you've done to me
and I am stronger for that.

429
00:51:24,436 --> 00:51:27,381
I'm glad you're dead,
I had you should already have been murder.

430
00:51:31,252 --> 00:51:33,175
Wait, did you hear that?

431
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,327
Stephanie?

432
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,328
Steph!

433
00:51:47,557 --> 00:51:49,432
Jack! Beware.

434
00:51:50,688 --> 00:51:52,733
You'll get lost, or worse.

435
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:56,009
Jack, that road leads to him.

436
00:51:56,306 --> 00:51:58,136
Wil you tempted?

437
00:51:58,496 --> 00:52:02,044
No!
Leave me alone.

438
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:04,303
Say it.
Say that you are guilty.

439
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,125
Jack, you do not have much time.

440
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:13,345
Say it.

441
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:16,920
You are so beautiful.

442
00:52:18,574 --> 00:52:19,742
You are a temptation.

443
00:52:19,743 --> 00:52:20,594
Say it.

444
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:27,370
Jack!

445
00:52:38,668 --> 00:52:39,713
Stop!

446
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:43,876
Finish him off please!

447
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,949
What happens to us?

448
00:52:52,689 --> 00:52:54,879
Jack, they know things about me.

449
00:52:57,671 --> 00:52:58,535
Who is that?

450
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:01,526
I found her when they are clogged.

451
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:02,639
What if one of them?

452
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:04,891
No, she is not.
She hid for them.

453
00:53:04,892 --> 00:53:07,071
Jack, Betty was also OK first.

454
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:11,782
Do you think I am poor Jack?

455
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:16,836
No, I do not think Susan.

456
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,051
Watch out!

457
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:24,608
I see you've found her.
The schreeuwerd!

458
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,855
Do they know the way out.

459
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:28,438
Leave her alone!

460
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,413
Go away!

461
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:48,334
Two hours to dawn Randy.

462
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:20,613
Where is Susan?

463
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,138
Sorry that I have killed him.

464
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,052
It is good.

465
00:55:01,785 --> 00:55:02,481
Thank you.

466
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,750
We better go find the others.

467
00:55:40,673 --> 00:55:43,873
Jack will murder you
unless you kill him earlier.

468
00:56:01,152 --> 00:56:02,385
Where are you Randy?

469
00:56:04,517 --> 00:56:06,080
Randy...

470
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:11,180
Now you are nothing more hey!

471
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:29,749
You were right. They really know things about us.

472
00:56:30,992 --> 00:56:33,898
I saw my daughter drown while
Stephanie was on the phone.

473
00:56:35,874 --> 00:56:37,950
Jack, you two have had yet therapy right?

474
00:56:37,951 --> 00:56:40,008
Yes more than enough. But the
has not been resolved.

475
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:55,261
Randy.

476
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:21,851
Is it?

477
00:57:26,301 --> 00:57:28,859
I fell through the roof.

478
00:57:32,378 --> 00:57:33,732
I thought I was dead.

479
00:57:35,389 --> 00:57:36,568
I saw Melissa.

480
00:57:37,797 --> 00:57:38,330
Who is Melissa?

481
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:40,895
My daughter.

482
00:57:42,136 --> 00:57:42,792
She is dead.

483
00:57:45,305 --> 00:57:46,623
She is not alone.

484
00:57:47,979 --> 00:57:49,632
I love Stuart shot.

485
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:51,729
We need him
do not worry more to do.

486
00:57:52,134 --> 00:57:53,530
Where is Jack?

487
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:56,631
The coward has run away.

488
00:57:57,611 --> 00:57:59,865
Hey, I know that door that is a way out.

489
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:28,648
What?
-No!

490
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:54,282
<i> Give me 1 dead body before sunrise
and I rule 2, &lt;/ i&gt;.</i>

491
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:03,134
I'm already in the therapist since my 13th.

492
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:07,301
Maybe they us
file managed to get?

493
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:09,426
There must be a rational explanation for this.

494
00:59:09,674 --> 00:59:10,427
Rational?

495
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:14,328
You've seen what looks like her head was.
There is not much to Neels ratio.

496
00:59:15,595 --> 00:59:16,889
This place is as hot as what.

497
00:59:17,856 --> 00:59:20,231
That is because we in the boiler room.

498
00:59:29,406 --> 00:59:30,341
Run!

499
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:41,074
Randy, open the door!

500
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:41,947
Open the door man!

501
00:59:43,571 --> 00:59:44,085
Learn to do this!

502
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:46,550
Open the door man!

503
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:52,363
Give him his jacket back, stupid bitch.

504
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,466
What is wrong with you man?
You saw us!

505
01:00:02,401 --> 01:00:03,443
Looks like you've found a gun.

506
01:00:04,193 --> 01:00:05,680
Everything we now have
do is get here, right?

507
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:06,490
No. I already have a way out.

508
01:00:08,012 --> 01:00:09,862
A dead body before sunrise.

509
01:00:21,554 --> 01:00:22,513
Huh?

510
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:30,665
What is wrong?

511
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:32,245
I do not know what is going on,
but I'm not.

512
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,177
Randy, do not listen to him.
He is trying to lice.

513
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:36,456
Put the gun away Randy!
-Shoot him!

514
01:00:36,906 --> 01:00:38,062
Randy put that gun away!

515
01:00:38,063 --> 01:00:39,016
Enough!

516
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,295
Wait!

517
01:00:45,034 --> 01:00:45,741
Shoot him Randy!

518
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,249
Wait, Jack is that you?

519
01:00:47,765 --> 01:00:49,145
No, it is not Stephanie!
Can you not see that?

520
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,466
If you really are,
look at your hand!

521
01:00:53,152 --> 01:00:54,578
He smokes at all!

522
01:00:57,004 --> 01:00:59,706
Look, he's just like Betty,
Stuart and Pete!

523
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,328
No that's impossible.
This may not be true.

524
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:06,051
Steph, this is not real.
Look.

525
01:01:06,765 --> 01:01:09,451
Ask me something.
Ask me about the cabin.

526
01:01:09,452 --> 01:01:10,650
I remember the hut.

527
01:01:10,651 --> 01:01:12,372
And Melissa, I remember Melissa.

528
01:01:12,373 --> 01:01:14,305
Remember that we are skating
bought for her birthday?

529
01:01:14,306 --> 01:01:15,306
Melissa is here.

530
01:01:15,307 --> 01:01:17,387
I saw her!
They punish me!

531
01:01:17,388 --> 01:01:18,388
I saw her Jack!

532
01:01:20,012 --> 01:01:21,659
That's because you've killed her, Steph.

533
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:24,680
You've killed our daughter!
-Shut up!

534
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,681
You would have to murder her Jack!

535
01:01:26,254 --> 01:01:26,682
No, I never can.

536
01:01:28,928 --> 01:01:31,582
Randy Kill them!
Kill them both!

537
01:01:31,863 --> 01:01:32,583
Randy!

538
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,296
Evil leaking black smoke, right?

539
01:01:34,563 --> 01:01:36,662
No, no, no Randy!
Do not listen to him!

540
01:01:36,663 --> 01:01:37,189
He is lying!

541
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,500
Look, I can prove that I really am.

542
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:49,631
Spanish!

543
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,546
That proves it!

544
01:01:52,745 --> 01:01:53,691
Randy Kill them!

545
01:01:54,636 --> 01:01:56,274
He also leaking smoke!
-Kill them both!

546
01:01:56,275 --> 01:01:57,137
They both smoke!

547
01:01:58,017 --> 01:01:59,136
Shoot them Randy!

548
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:01,522
They try to provide me lice.

549
01:02:02,034 --> 01:02:02,523
This is impossible!

550
01:02:03,532 --> 01:02:04,376
Shoot them!

551
01:02:04,976 --> 01:02:06,043
You put both!

552
01:02:14,552 --> 01:02:16,096
Randy put that gun away!

553
01:02:17,808 --> 01:02:19,243
I killed you both!

554
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:20,536
He put you out!

555
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,695
He makes murderers of you all!

556
01:02:25,971 --> 01:02:27,392
He used the house to you!

557
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,624
Steph, this is Susan.

558
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:34,271
Happy!

559
01:02:35,762 --> 01:02:36,292
He is coming!

560
01:02:37,226 --> 01:02:38,174
Come on.
We gotta get outta here!

561
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:39,175
Otherwise something terrible happens.

562
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:40,342
Listen to me!

563
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:43,655
Hey, who's there?
I'm a cop!

564
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:44,672
The police!

565
01:02:49,317 --> 01:02:50,126
Come on!

566
01:02:52,448 --> 01:02:54,035
Get us out of here before they murder us!

567
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:57,131
You go to hell!

568
01:03:00,638 --> 01:03:02,740
Get out of here!

569
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:05,086
Who was that?

570
01:03:13,684 --> 01:03:14,756
The door is closed!
How are you received?

571
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:15,757
I came through the garage.

572
01:03:17,748 --> 01:03:18,414
Over here!
Come on!

573
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:27,713
Jack, I've already seen this truck.
In that accident!

574
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:33,485
Steph hurry!

575
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:52,730
Open the door!

576
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:01,480
We got him!
Take care Randy!

577
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:05,693
We have 'Tin man' murdered.

578
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:10,740
He still moves.

579
01:04:14,316 --> 01:04:15,509
Is it girls?

580
01:04:16,387 --> 01:04:16,975
Yes.

581
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:21,976
He is chained!

582
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:41,695
Hey!

583
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,109
Why is he chained?

584
01:04:57,667 --> 01:04:58,284
The agent of the wall!

585
01:04:59,859 --> 01:05:01,048
The missing woman!

586
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:04,708
Agent Lawdale.

587
01:05:14,816 --> 01:05:15,744
He shot at you!

588
01:05:19,865 --> 01:05:21,967
You were on the bridge with Betty and Stuart!

589
01:05:27,593 --> 01:05:28,986
Who are you?

590
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:40,563
Go back inside!

591
01:05:55,438 --> 01:05:57,575
God came to my house and I killed him.

592
01:05:59,495 --> 01:06:01,609
I will murder anyone
my house was.

593
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:02,932
As I have killed God.

594
01:06:11,245 --> 01:06:15,132
Give me one dead body
before sunrise and you can go.

595
01:06:18,895 --> 01:06:20,063
You certainly do now...

596
01:06:20,901 --> 01:06:22,814
If I can just to Montgomery
was run.

597
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:29,078
A session with the therapist relationship
had not been so bad.

598
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:38,976
There is nothing Mr. Pig leukt you find.

599
01:06:39,684 --> 01:06:40,580
Let me go please.

600
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:43,721
You are alone with him for the money!

601
01:07:14,644 --> 01:07:16,958
You are here as at home as they do!

602
01:07:19,492 --> 01:07:22,413
All as guilty as sin itself.

603
01:07:23,483 --> 01:07:27,502
This house is a manifestation of your own eyes!

604
01:07:28,858 --> 01:07:30,570
You are all sinners!

605
01:07:31,907 --> 01:07:34,015
Are you willing to do what is necessary...

606
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:37,702
your soul to get here?

607
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:47,523
Three minutes before sunrise.

608
01:07:49,218 --> 01:07:50,639
A dead body.

609
01:07:52,939 --> 01:07:55,740
Lawdale played your game,
and you let him not go!

610
01:07:57,009 --> 01:07:59,728
Mrs Lawdale survived
two minutes after sunrise.

611
01:08:00,926 --> 01:08:02,105
Not make the same mistake!

612
01:08:21,746 --> 01:08:23,217
Play the game!

613
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:24,299
He is a liar!

614
01:08:24,761 --> 01:08:25,891
He breaks his own rules.

615
01:08:26,454 --> 01:08:28,064
You do not listen to him.

616
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,401
You!

617
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:34,585
was not invited!

618
01:08:39,705 --> 01:08:40,080
Jack

619
01:08:40,861 --> 01:08:41,719
Trust me!

620
01:08:43,645 --> 01:08:44,686
Do not listen to her.

621
01:08:45,105 --> 01:08:45,861
You listen to me!

622
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:54,317
What light?

623
01:08:54,318 --> 01:08:55,318
There is no light!

624
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:56,319
What light are you talking about?

625
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,019
Susan What light?
What light!

626
01:09:01,007 --> 01:09:02,324
No!

627
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:04,842
Leave her alone!

628
01:09:09,183 --> 01:09:09,845
No!

629
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:53,164
This is my house!

630
01:09:57,399 --> 01:09:58,382
I am the one who he wants!

631
01:10:11,225 --> 01:10:12,447
Kill her!

632
01:10:12,448 --> 01:10:13,389
Get her!

633
01:10:14,014 --> 01:10:15,736
Kill her!

634
01:10:15,925 --> 01:10:17,751
Kill her!
Kill the girl.

635
01:10:18,502 --> 01:10:19,669
You do not listen to him.

636
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:22,334
He free from threats!

637
01:10:22,335 --> 01:10:25,178
Have you in you, Randy?

638
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,144
No Randy.

639
01:10:43,498 --> 01:10:44,788
Do it!

640
01:10:46,766 --> 01:10:47,421
Jack!

641
01:10:48,227 --> 01:10:49,574
Jack,
listen to me!

642
01:10:49,575 --> 01:10:51,193
I know you me
Melissa's death is bad.

643
01:10:51,194 --> 01:10:52,489
I find myself...

644
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,237
Steph, that is not over!

645
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:56,703
Listen to me, I've seen how it happened.

646
01:10:58,645 --> 01:11:01,475
If anyone should die for Melissa's death,
let it be me.

647
01:11:05,316 --> 01:11:06,259
It is good.

648
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:08,722
No!
-Kill the girl, Randy!

649
01:11:10,492 --> 01:11:13,404
It is the only way!
You need her murder.

650
01:11:19,379 --> 01:11:20,494
Kill her!

651
01:11:38,814 --> 01:11:41,194
I'm just...
angry!

652
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,261
100%

653
01:11:52,052 --> 01:11:53,879
No!
Stay away from me!

654
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,719
Do not touch me!

655
01:11:56,494 --> 01:11:57,689
Randy!

656
01:11:59,175 --> 01:12:01,263
Someone must die!

657
01:12:05,656 --> 01:12:06,862
You're right!

658
01:12:13,457 --> 01:12:17,798
You go to hell.
You both!

659
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:39,060
Now I am killing you.

660
01:12:39,346 --> 01:12:40,061
Go ahead!

661
01:12:42,097 --> 01:12:43,082
Who are you!

662
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:45,601
Melissa!

663
01:12:47,212 --> 01:12:48,521
I am not Melissa!

664
01:12:49,425 --> 01:12:51,820
But she is safe.
And she loves you.

665
01:13:02,284 --> 01:13:03,183
You!

666
01:13:03,521 --> 01:13:04,865
Do not invited!

667
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:12,015
This is my house!

668
01:13:21,832 --> 01:13:23,646
No!

669
01:14:18,782 --> 01:14:20,961
Susan!

670
01:15:11,811 --> 01:15:13,638
Light destroys the Darkness!

671
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:28,584
Jack!

672
01:15:29,871 --> 01:15:30,956
The Light!

673
01:15:53,101 --> 01:15:55,297
She is gone.
You can not retrieve it!

674
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:58,388
Now you are on.

675
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:47,324
Come on!
Beware!

676
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:00,508
Do not look back!

677
01:17:14,521 --> 01:17:15,501
Hey!

678
01:17:22,532 --> 01:17:23,418
Hey agent!

679
01:17:25,852 --> 01:17:26,145
Come!

680
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:39,654
Hey this was not here first.

681
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,540
Agent, since there is a house...

682
01:17:48,106 --> 01:17:50,661
It seems that the Mustang a flat tire
and then got past the BMW schuurde.

683
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,290
You have your lights still on!

684
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:52,850
When he kantelde.

685
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:53,851
Wait, that's not what happened!

686
01:17:53,852 --> 01:17:54,852
The door could not open.

687
01:17:54,853 --> 01:17:56,386
This is the sad part.

688
01:17:57,289 --> 01:17:59,045
I do not think we are the only one with bad luck.

689
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:03,511
The occupants were probably
still alive when the gas exploded.

690
01:18:07,843 --> 01:18:09,099
That is just bad.

691
01:18:12,843 --> 01:18:13,815
We have identified the driver.

692
01:18:14,478 --> 01:18:15,730
A businessman from Tuscalusa.

693
01:18:16,395 --> 01:18:18,149
Do what hotels just outside Birmingham.

694
01:18:18,872 --> 01:18:19,944
The girl was his girlfriend.

695
01:18:20,245 --> 01:18:22,169
We have two bodies here.

696
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,615
Jack!

697
01:18:36,903 --> 01:18:38,527
Jack look!

698
01:18:49,733 --> 01:18:52,058
Steph!
Steph!

699
01:18:56,417 --> 01:18:57,528
Stay away from her!

700
01:18:59,006 --> 01:19:00,377
Steph!

701
01:19:00,839 --> 01:19:01,457
Steph!
-Jack!

702
01:19:03,544 --> 01:19:04,678
We were in a house.

703
01:19:05,622 --> 01:19:06,610
A spooky house.

704
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:07,611
I know, but we are not affected.

705
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:09,018
She has saved us.

706
01:19:10,072 --> 01:19:10,906
She said...

707
01:19:12,644 --> 01:19:14,038
She said that Melissa was safe.

708
01:19:15,471 --> 01:19:16,994
And that they keep us!

709
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,178
I love you!
