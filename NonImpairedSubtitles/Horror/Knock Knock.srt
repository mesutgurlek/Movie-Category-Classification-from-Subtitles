1
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,521
I'm sorry.

2
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,648
- Oh, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, baby.

3
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,005
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking shoulder.

4
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,524
Keep going.

5
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,930
That's helping.

6
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,806
Never.

7
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,724
Just a little bit. Just to clean it up.

8
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,086
I'm not cutting it.

9
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,163
But you'd look so hot with short hair.

10
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,129
- Oh, would I?
- Yeah.

11
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,611
- Thank you.
- No, no, no...

12
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,645
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.
You are hot.

13
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,610
You are the hottest.

14
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,525
- Keep going.
- You and your gorgeous,

15
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,160
thick, long hair.

16
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,641
- Continue...
- I just fucking love the way it's long.

17
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,767
Yeah?

18
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,288
Happy Father's Day, Daddy!

19
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,044
Kids, we said after breakfast.

20
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,123
I want cake for breakfast.

21
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,921
Wow! Chocolate with sprinkles!

22
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,241
My favorite.

23
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,242
Happy Father's Day!

24
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,448
- Open it! Open it! Open it!
- Open it! Open it! Open it!

25
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,329
I am, I am.

26
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,006
I like building up the anticipation.

27
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,330
Oh, you guys...

28
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,885
- You like it?
- I love it.

29
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,122
Muah! I love it.

30
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,924
- Thank you.
- Mom helped us.

31
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,129
No, I didn't. It was all their idea.

32
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,607
- Right, kids?
- Right.

33
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,928
- Cake! Cake! Cake!
- Cake! Cake! Cake!

34
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,248
- Okay, okay.
- Cake! Cake! Cake!

35
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,004
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

36
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,743
Oh, look at that beautiful looking cake!

37
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,088
Who did this to monster!

38
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,964
Oh, you can't hide from monster!

39
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,282
Monster can smell you!

40
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,471
Run! Run! Monster's coming!

41
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,523
Argh!

42
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,205
Monster made kids disappear.

43
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,691
And...

44
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,571
Monster wanna finish what we started.

45
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,567
Too late, the kids are awake.

46
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,165
Monster sad.

47
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,926
I'm sure monster can wait till Monday.

48
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,367
Monster been waiting three weeks.

49
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,648
Yeah, but with the kids
and my exhibition

50
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,524
I cannot keep everybody
happy all the time.

51
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,842
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,162
Monster doesn't want to start a fight.

53
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,051
Okay. Sorry, me neither.

54
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,606
I promise we'll finish this
as soon as I get back.

55
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,648
Oh, monster happy.

56
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,826
Monster happy.

57
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,391
Monster very happy.

58
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,524
Yeah, Mommy.

59
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,764
- Gracias.
- De nada.

60
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,287
- Everybody packed?
- Yeah.

61
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,010
Monkey, good boy.

62
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,766
Dad, why can't we take
Monkey to the beach with us?

63
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,166
Yeah, you know he loves the beach.

64
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,971
Monkey needs to stay here
and keep your dad company

65
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,487
so he doesn't stay
all alone during the weekend.

66
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,728
- That's unfair.
- Knock-knock.

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,961
Hey, Louis!

68
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,510
Hey, guys, hot off the presses.

69
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,761
- What's going on, Louis?
- What's shakin'?

70
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,490
What's going on, little guys?

71
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,051
Mr. Webber, how are you, sir?

72
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,770
Morning, Louis.

73
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,287
I'd offer you a hand, but all
I can lift is this coffee.

74
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,650
Oh, that's what happens when you try
to impress girls in the bat cage.

75
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,371
I wasn't flirting,
I was being a gentleman.

76
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,603
Yeah, I'm sure she was
a poor helpless 25-year-old.

77
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,707
Yeah, helpless.

78
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,965
Do you know what this is?

79
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,771
Is it a Father's Day present for Daddy?

80
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,564
No. No, this is Mommy's catalog.

81
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,291
Assuming they got the color
right this time.

82
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,204
Oh, let's hope.

83
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,044
I think they did.

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,607
It's a little bit magenta,
but it's almost perfect.

85
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
- What's magenta?
- This color.

86
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,481
Honey, it's perfect.

87
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,529
Mom, can Louis come
to the beach with us?

88
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,806
Yeah.

89
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,091
No, Louis needs to stay here
and do some work.

90
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,611
Just like your daddy.

91
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,522
That's correct.

92
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,842
I have to come back with all
the alcohol for the super-secret

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,128
Father's Day party that me
and your dad are gonna have tonight.

94
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,645
Louis! Shh!

95
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,280
- Oh, come on.
- You're not having a party.

96
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,326
I'm not having a party,
I'm working very hard.

97
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,289
Did you pack your gun?

98
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,442
- Yes.
- Did you pack the bomb?

99
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,886
- Yes.
- Have you packed the cannon?

100
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,202
- Yes.
- Have you packed the chainsaw?

101
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,931
You didn't pack the chainsaw?

102
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,765
Go get the chainsaw, man!

103
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,809
The cement still hasn't dried, but it
should be fine by tomorrow night.

104
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,961
Okay.

105
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,930
Still, it's extremely fragile
and I don't trust those movers

106
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,411
after the mess they made at the gallery.

107
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,449
Mmm-mmm. No, I'll take care of it.
Don't worry.

108
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,967
Okay, gracias, I'll have it
all packed up for you.

109
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,167
Okay.

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,283
It's almost dry though.

111
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,209
Yeah, so I'll just text you
when it's at the gallery.

112
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,850
Don't worry about anything,

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,368
I got it all under control.
You have a good weekend at the beach.

114
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,090
Enjoy yourself. I'm out.

115
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,049
Gracias, Louis.

116
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,248
- Mr. Webber, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

117
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,402
I mean, "tonight"
for the super-secret party.

118
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,210
- Louis...
- See you, kids.

119
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,442
- Bye, Louis.
- Super-secret party?

120
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,762
- Super-secret party.
- Okay.

121
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,126
Is this the last one?

122
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,850
- You like it?
- I love it.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,128
- Good.
- I think it should be bigger.

124
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,841
- You think so?
- Yeah, then we can get the pool.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,651
Okay, I'll do it bigger next time.

126
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,564
I told Vivian tomorrow at 2:00.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,007
I don't need her therapy
anymore, it's healing.

128
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,725
Tell that to your shoulder.

129
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,611
Dad, are you sure
you can't come to the beach with us?

130
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,410
I would love nothing more, sport.

131
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,404
But if Daddy doesn't work this weekend,
we'll have to live in a box.

132
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,085
Do you guys want to live in a box?

133
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,526
- No.
- No. Not really.

134
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,603
Me neither. Unless I designed it.

135
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, say goodbye to Daddy.

136
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,605
Bye, Daddy.

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,450
Say goodbye to Monkey.

138
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,170
Bye, Monkey.

139
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,971
Daddy, don't forget to send all
your party pix on Instagram.

140
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,360
Okay.

141
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,806
Call me when you get there.

142
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,689
I will. I love you.

143
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,365
- I love you.
- I love you.

144
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,531
Bye, guys.

145
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,488
- Bye.
- Bye, Daddy.

146
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,290
Get a haircut, Dad!

147
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,810
Well, Monkey...

148
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,167
Looks like it's just me and you, kid.

149
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,250
Hey, baby.

150
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,642
How's the house?

151
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,484
Hi! It's perfect.

152
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,371
Look. Kids, say hello to your dad.

153
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,010
- Hi!
- Hello.

154
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,604
All it needs is you.

155
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,208
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

156
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,846
Miss you.

157
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,965
Good night.

158
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,210
Who's there?

159
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,488
Just one second, sir, please.

160
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,522
- Hello?
- Could I use your phone, please?

161
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,766
Yes?

162
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,530
We're so sorry to bother you, sir,

163
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,160
but could you please tell us
where the Gregorys live?

164
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,481
This is the third house we've tried.

165
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,569
Looks like everyone's gone
for the long weekend.

166
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,849
The Gregorys?

167
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,085
No, I don't know anyone
around here by that name.

168
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,569
What's the address?

169
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,331
Um,

170
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,130
I honestly don't know.

171
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,891
My phone got wet
and she left hers at her house.

172
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,761
The taxi just dropped us here. We've been
walking around for, like, 20 minutes.

173
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,526
Yeah, my feet are, like, dying.

174
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,043
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.

175
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,526
Bless you.

176
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,405
Here.

177
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,405
Thank you.

178
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,765
Well, if you guys want
you can come in and use my phone.

179
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,366
Oh, thanks, but...

180
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,727
All our contacts are on our phones.

181
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,771
I... I don't even know my own number,
can you believe it?

182
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,968
Maybe Ashley's on Facebook chat?

183
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,605
Ah, genius.

184
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,443
Actually, would you mind
if we just used your computer for a sec?

185
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,805
We don't want to impose.

186
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,447
We'll just get the address
and be out of your hair.

187
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,888
Yeah. Sure.

188
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,087
Come in.

189
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,445
Thank you.

190
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,563
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

191
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,085
Oh, I don't mind.

192
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,248
We don't want to mess up your house.

193
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,402
Yeah. Excuse me.

194
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,688
Um, thank you so, so much.

195
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,491
- I know this is so random.
- It's fine.

196
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,527
Hang on, I'll get you
an iPad and some towels.

197
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,250
Thanks.

198
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,810
Nice house.

199
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,764
Thanks.

200
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,331
Girls?

201
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,005
We're in here.

202
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,609
I'm so sorry, it was warmer here.

203
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,091
Hope you don't mind.

204
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,481
We were freezing.

205
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,766
Here.

206
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,325
Oh, my God. Thank you.

207
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,847
This is beyond embarrassing.

208
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,805
Don't worry about it.

209
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,088
Make yourselves at home.

210
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,563
I'm Bel, by the way.

211
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,886
Evan.

212
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,441
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

213
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,565
Ashley's online.

214
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,650
Cool.

215
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,488
You're a life saver, Evan.

216
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,009
Not everyone would just let two total
strangers into their house these days.

217
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,091
Well, you don't look that dangerous.

218
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,170
Worst case scenario,

219
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,080
I know I can take the both of you.

220
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,526
I'm not so sure.

221
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,324
I do air boxing.

222
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,211
- Air boxing?
- Yeah, like, you know?

223
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,250
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

224
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,490
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

225
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,961
- What's the address?
- His name's Evan.

226
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,485
Evan?

227
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,410
458 Canter.

228
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,529
Wow. We're like, far.

229
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,967
It was Kantner, not Canter.

230
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,561
The cab must've misunderstood us.

231
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,124
I told you that he was
going the wrong way.

232
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,282
That guy barely spoke English.

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,970
I mean, his English was worse than mine.

234
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,451
This is so retarded.

235
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,080
Don't worry about it. I'll call an Uber.

236
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,004
No. No, no, no.

237
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,686
We can find a cab outside.
It's no problem.

238
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,320
Not around here, you won't.

239
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,682
Trust me, it's the only reliable way.

240
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,731
You sure? I feel like such an idiot.

241
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,166
We don't want to ruin your night.

242
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,408
No really. It's fine.

243
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,002
It's looking for a driver.

244
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,491
And it'll be here in...

245
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,121
45 minutes.

246
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,365
That long?

247
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,201
The rain.

248
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,600
We're lucky we even got one.

249
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,441
What?

250
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,167
Um, I know this is gonna sound weird,

251
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,644
but could we maybe throw our clothes
in your dryer just for, like, 10 minutes?

252
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,689
We really don't want to go
to a party soaking wet.

253
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,921
No.

254
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,211
Please?

255
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,651
Sure, sure. Um...

256
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,166
We have some extra robes.
I'll, uh, go get them.

257
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,163
- Thank you.
- Yay.

258
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,800
This is literally saving our lives.

259
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,650
Yeah, we could get sick and die.

260
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,571
You have your phone?

261
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,529
Uh yeah, why?

262
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,880
I can try and fix it.

263
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,244
Really? Oh.

264
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,088
My kid dropped mine in the tub,

265
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,684
and you won't believe this, but if you
put it in rice it kinda dries it out.

266
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,202
- That would be awesome.
- Rice?

267
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,529
Oh, my God, you're like a MythBuster.

268
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,081
Thank you so much, Evan.

269
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,165
You're welcome...

270
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,843
- Genesis.
- Genesis.

271
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,731
Yeah, like the beginning of time.

272
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,324
In the beginning.

273
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,089
Sorry. Yup, that was...
You're sick of that.

274
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,687
Thanks.

275
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,965
I'll, uh...

276
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,251
I'll go get you some.

277
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,089
Hey, Evan?

278
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,409
Where should we put these?

279
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,686
Oh, I'll take them.

280
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,047
No, we can do it. We don't mind.

281
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,050
I got it.

282
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,807
I made you some tea.

283
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,644
- Thank you.
- Thank you, that's nice.

284
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,961
- So sweet.
- I'll trade you.

285
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,690
Uh, okay.

286
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,606
Gracias.

287
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,171
Excuse me.

288
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,930
Oh, my God.

289
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,245
Oh, sorry.

290
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,681
We were trying to warm up.

291
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,446
Yeah, I mean, we've never seen
one of these before.

292
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,489
- A real one.
- It's okay.

293
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,211
Just be careful. It's old.

294
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,530
I see you've met Monkey.

295
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,603
Yeah, this is Monkey.

296
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,811
It's time for Monkey to go to bed.

297
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,162
- Bye, Monkey.
- Night-night, Monkey.

298
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,084
- Night-night.
- Sweet dreams.

299
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,480
Bye, Monkey.

300
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,730
All right, Monkey.

301
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,690
Go home, Monkey.

302
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,203
You have so many records.

303
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,403
Sorry. We had to try one.

304
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,483
Stop apologizing, it's okay.

305
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,611
I love this album. You have good taste.

306
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,650
This is like...

307
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,167
An insane collection.

308
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,721
- Yeah.
- It must be worth a fortune.

309
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,248
Well, everything's online now, so...

310
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,163
But, uh, I love the sound of vinyl.

311
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,643
You're really into music.

312
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,163
Well, it used to be my job.

313
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,270
What? Like a record salesman?

314
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,525
- I was a DJ.
- Oh, my God. That's so cool!

315
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,091
You're like Major Lazer!

316
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,525
It was in my 20s.

317
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,127
It's really a hobby now,
I haven't had a real gig in years.

318
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,204
Wait, how old are you?

319
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,370
I'm 43.

320
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,524
- No fucking way.
- I can't believe you're 43.

321
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,923
I thought you were, like,
28 or 30 at the most.

322
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,487
Well, I got married when I was 30.

323
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,730
Where's your wife?

324
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,848
She's at the beach with my kids.

325
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,170
We were gonna spend Father's Day there,
but, uh, work happened.

326
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,687
Oh, my God, you are all
alone on Father's Day.

327
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,360
Poor Evan, we'll keep you company!

328
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,329
Hugs!

329
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,165
No, it's fine.
We celebrated this morning.

330
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,567
Whoa, you're not 43.

331
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,324
You must work out, like, every day.

332
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,522
Yeah, I keep in shape.

333
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,411
Not like when I was
in my 20s, but, uh...

334
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,489
Come on, any guy that ripped
is more into his own ass than yours.

335
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,329
Yeah, I mean, like, seriously,
is that all you do?

336
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,290
Oh, my God, I remember
I fucked this model once,

337
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,204
and while we were having sex
I caught him doing crunches in the mirror.

338
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,443
It was the gayest thing ever.

339
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,331
I'd take somebody that's older
and more experienced

340
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,960
over an Abercrombie model any day.

341
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,690
Yeah.

342
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,087
Well, hopefully one day
you'll find both.

343
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,121
I don't know.

344
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,290
Underwear models are the kind of guys
you fuck when you're 14.

345
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,602
That's a statement.

346
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,408
- This is your wife?
- Yup.

347
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,130
I want to see it.

348
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,167
Wow! She's so pretty.

349
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,290
She's beautiful. You're a lucky guy.

350
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,010
Yeah, I certainly am.

351
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,530
I'm just an architect, but, uh,
she's the real deal.

352
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,008
Most of what you see is hers.

353
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,444
- She made all these?
- Yeah.

354
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,165
Wow.

355
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,926
They're so pretty.

356
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,163
I love these colors.

357
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,725
Red's my favorite.

358
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,245
This is amazing.

359
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,249
I actually studied art history.

360
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,801
I'm no expert, I was only
there for a semester, but,

361
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,366
this...

362
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,522
This is like a Gaudi building, but small.

363
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,968
Yeah, my wife loves Gaudi.

364
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,562
She was, uh, she was born in Barcelona.

365
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,290
Like me?

366
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,210
English, English.
You guys sound too sexy.

367
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,284
That's about the extent
of my Spanish anyway.

368
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,642
My kids speak it perfectly.

369
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,282
Your wife's an amazing artist.

370
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,886
Why are these sculptures here?

371
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,762
They should be in like, MOMA.

372
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,128
Actually, um...

373
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,842
It's not exactly MOMA...

374
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,364
But she's having a
big gallery show in LA.

375
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,011
Karen Alvarado.
That's such a pretty name.

376
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,924
An architect and an artist.

377
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,128
You guys are like the perfect couple.

378
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,647
And she's so hot.

379
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,768
You must have sex, like, all day.

380
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,251
- Bel!
- What?

381
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,930
I would.

382
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,081
That's Belly for you.

383
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,447
She sees a hot girl
and chases after her.

384
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,251
Well, it's okay. I have no complaints.

385
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,322
Sorry, I was just being honest.

386
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,728
No, no. It's fine.

387
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,611
Um, but, uh...

388
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,168
I must say

389
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,881
I'm not used to girls just
being so open about that.

390
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,445
About what?

391
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,840
Sex?

392
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,207
No, I mean... Yes.

393
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,204
- Yeah.
- Yes.

394
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,730
It's just sex.

395
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,406
Right.

396
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,283
Now you seem old.

397
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,925
Sorry. So sorry.

398
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,204
Twenty minutes away.

399
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,766
How long have you
and your wife been together?

400
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,243
I was 29 and she was 20.

401
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,686
It's been awhile.

402
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,011
So you haven't been with anyone else
in all those years?

403
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,844
Fourteen years, nope.

404
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,286
Wow.

405
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,051
How is that even possible?

406
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,926
Well, when you love someone...

407
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,081
Come on, Evan.

408
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,806
Humans are the only species
that practice monogamy.

409
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,850
I mean, we're animals.
We're more animals than animals.

410
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,126
It's in our DNA.

411
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,765
Like, being with one person
your whole life,

412
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,446
is going against your own nature.

413
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,685
Look.

414
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,085
It's like this.

415
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,924
I understand men.

416
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,844
I know whenever I get married,

417
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,401
my husband is gonna want to be
with other girls.

418
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,962
So, I want to get comfortable
with having threesomes now,

419
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,886
because I know that's the only way
he'll never cheat on me.

420
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,882
Wow.

421
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,288
So, are you guys... What do you guys do?

422
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,047
I mean, are you...
Are you in school or something?

423
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,004
I mean...

424
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,162
Actually, we're flight attendants.

425
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,401
Really?

426
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,847
What would you like
for your entree, sir?

427
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,286
We have chicken...

428
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,604
And pasta.

429
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,008
Please buckle your seatbelt, sir.

430
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,606
We may be encountering some turbulence.

431
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,725
So...

432
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,285
Where you guys based out of?

433
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,726
Everywhere.

434
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,486
Last weekend we were in
New Zealand for 24 hours.

435
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,880
It was awesome.

436
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,930
Wow, how was that jet lag?

437
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,610
We don't sleep.

438
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,128
It's like being a fake rock star.

439
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,328
You know, you fly
around the world first class,

440
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,290
drinks are on the house
and they pay you for it.

441
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,250
I'm jealous.

442
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,161
I once got offered a tour
when I was a DJ.

443
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,164
Not like you guys, but, uh,
Tri-State area.

444
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,370
Yeah, well, I think traveling is
the best way to get life experience.

445
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,483
Especially when you're
only there for 24 hours.

446
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,768
You really make the most of it.

447
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,160
Yeah, we make the most of it.

448
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,443
Unlike that fucking
starfish we work with. Ugh.

449
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,360
Ugh, starfish.

450
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,841
- Starfish?
- This girl we work with...

451
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,529
She doesn't have to do anything in bed,

452
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,167
she just lies there
like a fucking starfish.

453
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,527
Hence, starfish.

454
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,125
I mean, who'd want to fuck that?

455
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,647
I don't understand girls like that.

456
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,046
When I'm with a guy,
I want him to have the time of his life.

457
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,361
- No rules.
- None.

458
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,887
Nothing's off limit, sexually.

459
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,441
Sex with boundaries isn't really sex.

460
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,961
If our bodies are capable of doing it,

461
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,441
then we were meant to. Right?

462
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,805
Oh, Evan? Can I use your bathroom?

463
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,161
Of course. It's, uh, down
the hall on the right.

464
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,845
Thanks.

465
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,688
I don't know any of these.

466
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,006
Well, I have pretty eclectic taste.

467
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,568
You have Spanish music.

468
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,929
Chilean, actually.

469
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,481
My wife loves her, Fran Valenzuela.

470
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,090
Can you put it on?

471
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,605
Sure.

472
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,844
She's really talented.

473
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,401
She started composing when she was 13.

474
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,791
This is her third album.

475
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,327
Wow!

476
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,562
How did you know that would mix?

477
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,331
DJ'ing is like mixing a drink.

478
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,091
First you find the right ingredients,

479
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,129
then you find the blend.

480
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,846
Evan, I have something to confess.

481
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,721
Yes?

482
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,360
I'm glad we knocked on your door.

483
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,564
I'm having a way better time here

484
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,929
then at that stupid party
we were supposed to go to.

485
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,690
Well, I have to confess,
it's not usually this exciting around here

486
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,484
at 1:30 in the morning.

487
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,369
It's like destiny
that we were meant to meet.

488
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,161
Do you believe in destiny, Evan?

489
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,604
I'm an architect.

490
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,651
So obviously I believe
that things happen by your own design.

491
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,482
Well, I do.

492
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,484
I don't think people just meet randomly.

493
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,811
I think that if we are here, together,

494
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,686
it's because

495
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,002
there's something we have to
learn from each other.

496
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,570
Discover.

497
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,131
It's here.

498
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,884
I'll go get Genesis.

499
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,327
I'll get your clothes.

500
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,770
What the fuck!

501
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,645
Guys!

502
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,164
Guys, the car's outside.

503
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,931
Guys, I have your clothes,
they're pretty much dry.

504
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,368
Guys!

505
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,729
All right, I'm coming in,

506
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,326
I'm not looking, so excuse me.

507
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,683
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

508
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,846
What the fuck are you doing?

509
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,089
- Come on, Evan. Join us.
- Yeah, join the party.

510
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,891
- Come here.
- The car's outside.

511
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,883
The car can wait. Come on.

512
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,762
I'm gonna tell the driver
that you're coming out.

513
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,601
Get dressed. Now.

514
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,326
Please. Here's your clothes.

515
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,891
Evan. Look at us.

516
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,846
Come on...

517
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,889
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Stop. Stop.

518
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,963
I can't do this. I'm married.

519
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,565
Happily. Okay?

520
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,687
Yes. You can.

521
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,604
Hey, it's our little secret.

522
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,444
Whoa, stop. Stop.

523
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,045
It's just sex. We're all adults here.

524
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,531
I'm flattered.

525
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,650
But really, I can't.
Please, get dressed.

526
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:29,088
- Yeah, you can.
- Come on, just one day.

527
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,607
Just relax and enjoy it.

528
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,485
You like this?

529
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,442
Have you ever had two girls
do this to you before?

530
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,170
- Happy Father's Day!
- Happy Father's Day!

531
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,481
It's time for the Family Feud!

532
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,086
Introducing the Levy family!

533
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,686
- Morning, Daddy.
- Evan! Evan! Watch this!

534
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,923
Belly! Belly! Catch! Catch!

535
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,842
Sorry, Belly.

536
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,890
I thought you guys left.

537
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,767
- We made you breakky.
- I'm not hungry.

538
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,001
Monkey, that's mine.

539
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,245
And the star of Family Feud,
Richard Dawson!

540
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,730
You two live together?

541
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,886
Yeah.

542
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,685
Where?

543
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,284
Why, Evan?

544
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,640
So I can drive you there.

545
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,087
I haven't been home in like four years.

546
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,204
This could be our home.

547
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,646
I'll drive you wherever you want.

548
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,248
Did I say something funny?

549
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,726
Mmm-hmm.

550
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,049
I want to go to Paris, Evan.

551
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,929
No, let's go to Tokyo.

552
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,082
London.

553
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,188
Rome.

554
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,528
Don't let your breakky get cold.

555
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,605
Hey, baby.

556
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,131
Hey, you're alive.

557
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,171
Yeah, ah, barely.

558
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,207
I forgot how strong Vanessa's weed was.

559
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,767
I just woke up.

560
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,365
You are such a lightweight.

561
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,163
- How are the kids?
- Not so good.

562
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,045
- What happened?
- Evan!

563
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,521
Jake got stung by a jellyfish.
He was crying.

564
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,924
- Oh, no!
- Yeah.

565
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,320
Poor little guy.

566
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,289
- He's okay now.
- Where is he?

567
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,407
He's back at the beach.

568
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,691
It was a little bit hairy for a while,
but now he's okay.

569
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,365
What about you? How's your project?

570
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,727
Great. Great. Great.

571
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,809
Uh, I'm in a really good groove now,
so, home stretch.

572
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,968
Okay, then don't let me interrupt you.

573
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,441
Let's talk later.
You seem a little distracted.

574
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,761
No. That's not what I meant.

575
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,365
It's just...

576
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,970
I just want to finish so I don't have
to think about it, you know?

577
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,126
Maybe if I get done early,
I can, I can drive out there.

578
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,203
Baby, I get it. Don't stress.

579
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,731
Do what you have to do.

580
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,003
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

581
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,969
Don't smoke all our weed.

582
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,249
I won't. I promise.

583
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,530
- Bye.
- Ciao.

584
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,606
Shit! Shit! Shit!

585
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,445
Are you hungry now?

586
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,523
Get up! And get dressed!

587
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,727
Right now!

588
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,127
Excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where Evan is?

589
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,760
You know, that sweet guy that
saved two girls from the rain?

590
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,729
He's gone. Get the fuck up.

591
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,845
Let's go.

592
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,729
I don't appreciate your tone of voice.

593
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,041
Go!

594
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,680
Come on, Belly. Looks like
Evan lost his sense of humor.

595
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,346
Go!

596
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,725
Hello!

597
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,450
Let's go!

598
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,930
Where's Bel?

599
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,730
I don't know, she's not my friend.

600
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,365
Bel!

601
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,365
Bel!

602
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,040
Bel?

603
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,727
What the fuck are you doing?

604
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,564
You tell us to get dressed.

605
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,049
Come on. Playtime's over.

606
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,970
Evan, can you hold me?

607
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,640
Please, just once more.

608
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,167
- Please, I miss your hugs.
- Bel. Listen to me.

609
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,970
You're leaving. Now.

610
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,161
Get dressed.

611
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,606
- I love you.
- Bel...

612
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,330
- I love you.
- No!

613
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,450
I love you so much.

614
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,082
God damn it! Fuck!

615
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,921
I love you. I can't help it.

616
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,802
I'm crazy about you.

617
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,204
You have three minutes!

618
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,085
I'll be outside!

619
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,405
Get dressed!

620
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,490
Let's go!

621
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,808
What in the fuck are you doing!

622
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,808
You have any idea what you've done?

623
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,803
Yeah. It's called art.

624
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,167
We were inspired
from last night. Remember?

625
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,845
I'm calling the fucking police.

626
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,490
Go ahead.

627
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,530
What the fuck is so funny!

628
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,489
I just have a funny story for them.

629
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,370
It's called "To Catch a Predator."

630
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,123
What the fuck are you talking about?

631
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,601
Fifteen to 20 years?

632
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,330
I think it is 20.

633
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,323
Fifteen gets you 20, right?

634
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,169
- I don't believe it.
- You don't have to.

635
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,210
The jury will.

636
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,930
Statutory rape, Evan.

637
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,566
Twenty years behind bars.

638
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,285
And that's just for one of us.

639
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,011
And I'm not planning on taking a shower.

640
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,485
I have evidence.

641
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,606
Really?

642
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,491
So how could you be a flight
attendant if you're only 15?

643
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,849
What the fuck! What?

644
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,482
We saw that in a movie, Evan.

645
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,404
I told you he'd believe it.

646
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,846
Do you want to check my ID?

647
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,683
She doesn't have one, she's too young.

648
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,970
Okay.

649
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,246
What do you want?

650
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,801
We want to make breakky
for you every morning.

651
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,762
Come on.

652
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,644
Just tell me. How much do you want?

653
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,330
Don't be mad, Evan.

654
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,527
That's not you.

655
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,722
- You're different from the others.
- Yeah.

656
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,161
How much!

657
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,761
What do you think we are, hookers?

658
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,490
Jesus, Evan, we're not fucking whores!

659
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,841
Yeah.

660
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,764
You're the fucking whore!

661
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,081
Whore!

662
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,766
Evan? It's Vivian!

663
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,611
Do not move!

664
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,005
Evan!

665
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,924
Evan, I'm so sorry I'm late,

666
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,282
but that storm blew
branches out all over town.

667
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,647
It even knocked two traffic lights out.

668
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,451
I swear, I swear I was sitting
there for 15 minutes

669
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,728
and I was trying to navigate,
but there was repair trucks.

670
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,285
It's fine. It's fine.

671
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,602
Actually, I'm feeling much better.

672
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,041
Oh, then that's really good
because then this'll help.

673
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,726
I'll give you a relaxation massage,
it'll help circulate.

674
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,562
Actually... Karen should have told you,
I have a lot of work to do this weekend.

675
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,121
I love Karen. I love her
so much, how is she?

676
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,487
She is so talented.

677
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,051
I cannot wait to see her exhibition.

678
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,486
In fact, you know what?

679
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,563
Jim and I are going
to drive up for the opening

680
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,845
if I can get out of that conference I have
in Sonoma with those massage therapists.

681
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,570
You know how that can be.

682
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,402
He doesn't want your massage.

683
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,726
Do you, baby?

684
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,808
Get back inside.

685
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,010
Don't let me get cold.

686
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,847
This is really upsetting, okay?

687
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,161
I'm here to heal,

688
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,721
but this is really... This is upsetting!

689
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,087
- It's upsetting!
- It's not what you think.

690
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,004
No, no. It's exactly what I think!

691
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,605
But you know what? It's your life.

692
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,922
- Vivian, please.
- I... Don't. It's your relationship, Evan.

693
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,801
Look, I'm a DJ like Evan!

694
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,371
Why didn't you let your girlfriend in?

695
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,329
Are you ashamed of us?
Or are you fucking her, too?

696
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,811
- Get out of my house!
- Be careful,

697
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,042
these two cute little girls
can put you behind bars

698
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,611
- for the rest of your life!
- Get out of my house!

699
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,001
What would your client say?
Your neighbors?

700
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,969
What would your wife say if we told her
everything we did last night?

701
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,803
Get out!

702
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,522
It's gonna be such a shame
to see your wife divorce you!

703
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,683
And your business ruined
over a single night of perversion!

704
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,923
You wanna go door-to-door telling your
neighbors you're a child molester?

705
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,650
What would the other parents do?

706
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,201
Let their kids play here if
you're a convicted pedophile?

707
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,681
There's Evan!

708
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,723
I didn't think you had it in you.

709
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,003
911, what's your emergency?

710
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,249
I'd like to report a break-in.

711
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,731
You're calling from 458...

712
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,810
Can you give us a ride?

713
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,805
Let's go.

714
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,282
Well, this isn't awkward at all.

715
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,005
Cool car, Evan.

716
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,085
This one on the right.

717
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,280
Out.

718
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,680
You're not gonna get out and say bye?

719
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,410
Go.

720
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,329
Don't you want to come in
and meet my mom?

721
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,203
- Oh!
- Bye!

722
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,647
Send our love to Karen and the kids!

723
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,525
Bye!

724
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,005
Hello?

725
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,130
Oh, my God!

726
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,843
What the hell are you doing?

727
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,525
Genesis, please,
this is crazy, untie me!

728
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,163
What's the point of this?

729
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,445
I'm a good person.

730
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,170
I made a mistake.

731
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,721
We can forget this ever happened.

732
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,164
Please! Please!

733
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,728
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

734
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,881
Daddy!

735
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,042
Oh, Daddy!

736
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,526
Look what I found.

737
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,120
Oh, my God!

738
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,245
You take that off.

739
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,482
That's my daughter's. You take that off!

740
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,002
You like how it fits me, Daddy?

741
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,125
- Look.
- Take those off,

742
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,970
you fucking crazy bitch!

743
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,965
Okay.

744
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,966
You know, every girl's first love

745
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,604
is their daddy, huh?

746
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,565
You're sick.

747
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,810
You like what you see?

748
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,841
Huh? You like what you see?

749
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,365
Daddy?

750
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,204
- Huh?
- No.

751
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,004
Bel.

752
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,446
Untie me.

753
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,407
Untie me, please.

754
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,085
If you really love me,

755
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,530
untie me.

756
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,090
Ignore that asshole.

757
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,845
He's not an asshole.

758
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,050
He's my Daddy.

759
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,848
You don't listen to her, Daddy.

760
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,083
She doesn't love you the way I do.

761
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,045
I love you, Daddy.

762
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,290
I've loved you ever since
Mommy brought you home.

763
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,486
Remember that night
when we were all alone

764
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,409
and you snuck into my room?

765
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,162
And I pretended to be asleep.

766
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,729
But when you took off my clothes,
I couldn't pretend any longer.

767
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,043
We did things you and Mommy never did.

768
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,324
I hope you're not angry
at me anymore, Daddy.

769
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,845
I only did that to Mommy
because I wanted you all to myself.

770
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,446
Bel, Bel, untie me, please?

771
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,485
Please.

772
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,525
You can tuck me in like you always did.

773
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,764
What's wrong, Daddy?

774
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,524
Huh?

775
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,567
Don't you want to fuck
your little girl again?

776
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,883
Did you forget what you did
to me all those years?

777
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,329
Why did you do that to me?

778
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,570
Why did you do that to me!

779
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,926
- Bel...
- Why?

780
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,125
Stop! Bel!

781
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,282
Stop! Bel! Bel, stop!

782
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,647
Why did you do that to me!

783
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,121
Why! Why did you do that to me!

784
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,645
Stop! Stop!

785
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,802
Bel! Stop, please!

786
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,048
Stop it! Stop it!

787
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,926
Untie me.

788
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,120
What the fuck is that?

789
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,204
You're not hiding something,
are you, Evan?

790
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,045
What are you hiding here, huh?

791
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,129
Come on, where is it, Daddy?

792
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,683
It's Karen on FaceTime!

793
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,922
- I've been dying to meet her.
- Answer it.

794
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,605
- Let's get to know her.
- No! No!

795
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,366
You're right, this could get awkward.

796
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,409
- What are you doing?
- Much better.

797
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,686
Don't!

798
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,211
Can a cock answer an iPhone?

799
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,930
Yes, Belly, but it's gotta be hard.

800
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,650
Okay.

801
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,965
No! Please!

802
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,726
- It could be my kids!
- Hi Evan, welcome back.

803
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,769
So? Have they ever seen
a cheating dick before?

804
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,649
How about covered in her lipstick?

805
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,088
Okay! Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay. Please.

806
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,041
Bel, I'll do whatever you want.

807
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,571
Yes! Yes!

808
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,645
Okay. Okay.

809
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,689
Now, fuck me, Daddy!

810
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,366
- Fuck me!
- Attaboy, Evan.

811
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,567
Fuck her.

812
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,768
Fuck her like it was last night.

813
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,889
Yeah, fuck her good!

814
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,726
Fuck me, Daddy!

815
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,541
Fuck me like you fuck
your little daughter!

816
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,410
Doggy style, Belly!

817
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,844
You want something to eat, Bel?

818
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,325
No, I'm okay.

819
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,124
Okay.

820
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,530
Fuck me, Daddy!

821
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,523
Fuck me like you fuck Mommy!

822
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,090
Yeah, Daddy's little girl!

823
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,601
You're a good little girl!

824
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,167
- Fuck me, Daddy!
- Yeah!

825
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,005
Fuck me like you fuck Mommy!

826
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,968
My scar! My scar! My scar!

827
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,690
My surgery!

828
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,362
You've been a very bad boy, Evan!

829
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,763
Please, please, please
take it out! Take it out!

830
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,890
Oh, my God!

831
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,610
Oh, my...

832
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,885
...God!

833
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,764
Why did you hit me, Daddy?

834
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,850
Now we have to punish you.

835
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,850
Welcome to America's favorite game show,

836
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,480
Who Wants to be a Pedophile!

837
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,405
Where we give the audience
what they want!

838
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,201
The chance to punish a pedophile.

839
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:18,162
But first, let's welcome our lovely,
beautiful and charming,

840
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,130
Ms. Bel!

841
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,850
Hello, Ms. Bel.

842
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,686
For tonight's contestant,
we have a very special one,

843
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,446
he's not only an architect
but also a DJ,

844
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,326
a husband, a father of two,
possibly three.

845
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,045
Four.

846
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,729
All the way from one percent land,

847
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,089
Mr. Evan Webber!

848
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,522
Ms. Bel, would you please
get our contestant ready?

849
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,727
Sure.

850
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,364
You're both crazy fucking bitches!

851
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,044
You look 21, you lied to me!

852
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,850
Oh, like you lied to your wife?

853
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,123
What I tell my wife is none
of your goddamn...

854
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,168
God! God!

855
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,649
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
My ears! My ears!

856
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,609
I'll go deaf! I'll go deaf!

857
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,524
This is fucking serious!

858
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,920
I could go deaf!

859
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,003
The game hasn't started yet.

860
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,202
Our first category...

861
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,484
Schoolyards.

862
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,049
How far away from school
will Evan have to pick up his kids?

863
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,805
100 yards?

864
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,770
500 yards?

865
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,770
Or two miles?

866
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,127
This is fucking sick!

867
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,767
Wrong answer. Correct answer is

868
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,888
you can't pick up your kids from prison.

869
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,042
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

870
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,571
Please!

871
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,370
What's our next category, Ms. Bel?

872
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,090
I love this one.

873
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,290
Daddies.

874
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,082
Evan, this should be easy for you.

875
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,048
How many family men
have survived this game?

876
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,610
None.

877
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,881
What was that?

878
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,607
None.

879
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,205
Correct!

880
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,684
- Next question.
- Genesis.

881
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,890
You've proved your point.

882
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,491
God! I can't hear! I can't hear!

883
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,805
Please stop!

884
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,484
All you have to do is
answer the question, Evan.

885
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,242
Okay.

886
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,448
Well, ask it, for fuck's sake!

887
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,651
What's the proper punishment
for a pedophile?

888
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,970
Is it prison where
you get raped every day

889
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,884
and you never get to see
your family again?

890
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,610
Castration?

891
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,570
Or death?

892
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,529
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tick-tock.

893
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,369
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

894
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,124
Ten seconds.

895
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:53,210
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

896
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,247
Well, looks like it's time for
our first commercial break.

897
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,290
We'll be back after a message
from our sponsors.

898
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,090
Hello. It's me, Louis!

899
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,846
Mr. Webber?

900
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,450
Who's Louis?

901
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,450
Fucking douche bag.

902
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,523
Get that sheet, cover him up.

903
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,770
- You must be Louis.
- Yes.

904
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,365
I'm Bernadette. I'm Uncle Evan's niece.

905
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,641
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

906
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,087
Obviously, you're with Uncle Evan.

907
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,163
Sorry, we're shooting a music video.

908
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,926
Well, you guys picked
an awesome location.

909
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,286
Come on in.

910
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,689
So where'd you come in from?

911
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,241
- Dallas.
- Oh? I used to live in Austin.

912
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,526
Oh, I've never been.

913
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,523
Well, it's fun when you're in college.

914
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,330
Yeah, I went to Parsons.

915
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,801
Oh, great school. I went to SVA.

916
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,162
- Hi.
- Hi.

917
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,526
- I'm Louis.
- Hi.

918
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,364
- Hi. I'm...
- She's Macarena.

919
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,682
- She's my friend from Spain.
- Oh.

920
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,045
- He's here to pick up...
- The art work outside.

921
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,770
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

922
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,001
- Somebody touch this?
- We didn't touch it.

923
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,083
It's Aunt Karen's stuff,
we wouldn't go near it.

924
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,770
I did see Evan in here earlier,
maybe he did.

925
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,806
Okay,

926
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,564
'cause it's not supposed
to be like this.

927
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,007
It's supposed to be bubble-wrapped
and packed up and ready to go.

928
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,771
- Why would Evan do this?
- She said it wasn't us.

929
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,001
Okay.

930
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,209
Oh, fuck.

931
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:02,044
Oh, my God.

932
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,324
What the fuck did y'all do?

933
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,244
What the fuck is this shit!

934
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,327
We didn't want to tell you, someone
broke in and that's why Evan's out.

935
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,447
- He was chasing them.
- Yeah.

936
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,931
Shut the fuck up!

937
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,690
Shut the fuck up, both of you right now!

938
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,285
Nobody fucking move!

939
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,447
I'm calling the cops right now.

940
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,364
Please don't tell Karen.

941
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,882
This could be our little secret.

942
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,763
Bitch, you're barking up
the wrong fucking tree.

943
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,445
I'm from Oakland, ho!

944
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,166
I know two ghetto ass
hos when I see 'em!

945
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,527
Come to think of it,
Evan doesn't even have any fucking nieces.

946
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,842
Who the fuck are you?

947
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,526
You better hope the police
get here before Karen does.

948
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,604
- What the fuck was that?
- Nothing.

949
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,761
- Hey, wait.
- Wait.

950
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,720
- It's nothing.
- Get out of my way!

951
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,549
Shit.

952
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,930
Shit!

953
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,490
Mr. Webber!

954
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,165
Are you okay? Oh, fuck!

955
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:21,049
They're crazy!

956
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,122
Close the door. Close the door.

957
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,850
Louis!

958
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:25,888
Louis, no!

959
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,646
- I gotta stop these crazy ass bitches.
- Louis, forget it!

960
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,848
They're dangerous!

961
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,131
No! No! Stop!

962
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,691
Stop it!

963
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,649
What are you doing!

964
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,525
Looking for this?

965
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,048
Louis! Be careful!

966
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,690
They're crazy!

967
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,282
Monkey in the middle!
Monkey in the middle!

968
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,169
We can't say that, Belly, it's racist.

969
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,084
Okay, man in the middle!

970
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,091
Give it to him!

971
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,844
No, Genesis, give him that!

972
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,045
Louis!

973
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,124
Louis!

974
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,925
Genesis! Please, this isn't his fault!
Please call an ambulance, help him!

975
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,961
Fucker!

976
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,531
Bel, please help him!

977
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,001
Call an ambulance,
I promise I won't say anything!

978
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,441
Bel, Genesis!
Call an ambulance, for fuck's sake!

979
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,001
I think it's a little late
for an ambulance, Evan.

980
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,128
He tripped, it's his fault.

981
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,008
We were just playing
monkey in the middle.

982
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,003
I mean, man in the middle.

983
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,110
Oh, my God!

984
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,442
You killed him!

985
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,884
Your wife killed him
with her shitty sculpture.

986
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,405
This shit's dangerous, Evan.

987
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,642
How can you keep this here with kids?

988
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,564
That's irresponsible parenting.

989
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,563
Yeah maybe your wife
should stick to painting.

990
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,767
Get the fuck away from me!

991
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,564
Where do you think you're going, Evan?

992
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,165
Get the fuck off me! Leave me alone!

993
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,446
Wanna go for a little ride?

994
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,364
You can't run away from us, Daddy.

995
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,090
You can't escape.

996
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,884
This is what happens when
you break the rules of the game, Evan.

997
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,842
This is just like art class.

998
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,370
What I did to Karen's statue

999
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,648
is nothing compared
to what I'm going to do to you

1000
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,690
if I ever see your
fucking lying face again.

1001
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,162
I trusted you both,
how could you fuck my wife?

1002
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,084
Never come near my family again.

1003
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,082
Disappear or you're fucking dead.

1004
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,245
Which way is MOMA?

1005
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:12,171
It's more like "momma."

1006
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,286
Ronnie is gonna have
a field day with this one.

1007
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,204
Yeah, I'm sure he will.

1008
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,964
That guy's a magician.

1009
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,201
Yeah.

1010
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,048
He can make anything disappear.

1011
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,247
Let's finish this.

1012
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,091
Wow, those were some
really long commercials.

1013
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:55,205
Thanks to our sponsor Louis
for that little lovely break.

1014
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:05,402
Now! Back to our
million dollar question.

1015
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,562
What is the proper punishment
for a pedophile?

1016
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:12,890
Please.

1017
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,805
I love my children. I love my wife.

1018
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,929
I'm a good father.

1019
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,129
How can you judge anyone?

1020
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,884
You're murderers.

1021
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,326
Is that your final answer?

1022
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,171
Cause you're gonna go deaf
in about 10 seconds from now.

1023
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,731
Please, Genesis!

1024
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,325
I'm a good father!

1025
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,249
Until yesterday.

1026
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,920
That doesn't change
how much I love them!

1027
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,081
Do you really love them, Evan?

1028
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,127
Really?

1029
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,848
More than anything in the world.

1030
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,766
So why didn't you think of
them when you were inside us?

1031
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,365
Yeah, why, Evan?

1032
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,210
Last night had nothing
to do with my family.

1033
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,408
Damn right it didn't, Evan!

1034
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,887
It had nothing to do with them.

1035
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,929
Your family are victims.

1036
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:13,005
Victims of your sleazy,
disgusting, perverted behavior.

1037
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,969
Jake. Lisa.

1038
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,368
They don't deserve a father like you.

1039
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,887
This is what you did to your family.

1040
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,764
You pervert.

1041
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,602
Genesis, please, this isn't the answer!

1042
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:37,806
Wrong answer. Correct answer is death.

1043
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,767
We'll be back
after this commercial break.

1044
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,445
Death?

1045
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,770
Death?

1046
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,004
You're gonna kill me?

1047
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,004
You're gonna fucking kill me!

1048
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,687
Why? Why! Because I fucked you?

1049
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,320
You fucked me! You fucked me!

1050
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,404
You came to my house! You came to me!

1051
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,647
I got you a car,
I brought you your clothes,

1052
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,882
you took a fucking bubble bath!

1053
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,289
You wanted it! You wanted it!
You came on to me!

1054
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,684
What was I supposed to do?

1055
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,248
You sucked my cock, you both
fucking sucked my cock!

1056
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,768
It was free pizza! Free fucking pizza!

1057
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,283
It just shows up at my fucking door!

1058
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,363
What am I supposed to do?

1059
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,171
"We're flight attendants.
Come on, fuck us!

1060
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,324
No one will know. Come on, fuck us!"

1061
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,649
Oh, twosomes, threesomes.
It doesn't matter!

1062
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,610
Starfish! Husbands!
You don't give a fuck,

1063
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,570
you'll just fuck anything,
you'll just fuck anything!

1064
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,882
Well, you lied to me,
I tried to help you!

1065
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:47,130
I let you in, I was a good guy,
I'm a good father!

1066
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,362
And you just fucking fucked me!

1067
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,046
What? Now, you're gonna kill me!

1068
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,009
You're gonna kill me? Why?

1069
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,401
Why? 'Cause you fucked me?

1070
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,087
What the fuck-fuck-fuck,
this is fucking insane!

1071
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,527
You're to be executed at dawn.

1072
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,609
If I were you,

1073
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:16,162
I wouldn't waste my last
few hours crying about it.

1074
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,491
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1075
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,765
It is the only way.

1076
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,570
Bel?

1077
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,004
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1078
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,324
Oh, my God!

1079
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,966
FaceTime. Karen!

1080
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,163
FaceTime. Karen.

1081
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,401
Digging a grave is fucking tiring.

1082
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:58,608
And filthy. Your wife's clothes
are gonna need dry cleaning.

1083
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,410
What's that?

1084
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,364
You can't have access to an iPad, Evan.

1085
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,761
You could be trying to reach a child.

1086
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,685
Let's face it, Evan. You're a monster.

1087
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,090
Or should I say monster!

1088
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:21,406
What?

1089
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,163
Monster surprised?

1090
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,931
How do you know about that?

1091
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,721
Oh, monster confused!

1092
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,611
How the fuck do you know that!

1093
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,888
Monster will be quiet!

1094
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,407
You spied on me?

1095
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,326
On my kids?

1096
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,969
Oh, my fucking God!

1097
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,929
Oh, my fucking God! Jesus!

1098
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,605
I'm so fucking stupid!

1099
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,961
Yeah, you are.

1100
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,361
Monster retarded.

1101
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,451
Let's change, I feel gross.

1102
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,728
Look at all this shit.

1103
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,284
This is you, Evan.

1104
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,644
This is gonna be your little fucking head,
you fucking cheater!

1105
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,603
I love this color! Red's my favorite!

1106
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,924
Time for a haircut, Evan.

1107
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,770
Gotta be pretty for your funeral.

1108
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,042
He's so hairy.

1109
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,964
You don't wanna lose an ear.

1110
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,645
Hold still.

1111
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,841
There we go. You look pretty.

1112
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,889
There's Evan cutie!

1113
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,930
There you have it.

1114
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,009
Oh, now we see your pretty face.

1115
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,764
Fucking bitches!

1116
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,644
"I love the sound of vinyl. I'm Evan."

1117
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,930
Watch this, Evan.

1118
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,010
Jackpot!

1119
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,249
Is that real?

1120
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,764
What a clever way to hide
this from the kids, Evan!

1121
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,889
You know, most firearm deaths
are a family member of the gun owner.

1122
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,965
I don't own a gun.

1123
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,445
It's dangerous.

1124
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,087
Untie him.

1125
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,524
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1126
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,847
Genesis, please don't point that at me.

1127
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,407
I know, it's cheating.
We still have 90 minutes.

1128
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,807
But you were keeping secrets
from us, Evan.

1129
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,129
Had you gotten to this before us

1130
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,851
I don't think we'd be
having this conversation.

1131
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,240
And you wouldn't do the same?

1132
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,885
I'm not like you, Evan.

1133
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,721
I don't own a gun, I don't shoot people.

1134
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:00,006
I sure as hell don't bend the rules
for my own convenience.

1135
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,490
Untie him, Belly.

1136
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,490
I don't want him to kick me.

1137
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,281
He won't.

1138
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,010
He kicks, I shoot.

1139
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,731
He knows that.

1140
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,445
Don't you, Evan?

1141
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,690
What do you want?

1142
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,087
I wanna play hide and seek.

1143
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,521
What?

1144
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:33,007
Thirty seconds. Only inside the house.

1145
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,083
You leave the house, I shoot.

1146
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,367
What're you gonna do when you find me?

1147
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,331
Well, if we don't find you by sunrise,

1148
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,327
we'll leave.

1149
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,251
- Bullshit.
- Thirty seconds. Go! Go!

1150
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,129
- Go!
- Go!

1151
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,566
30, 29...

1152
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:58,004
28, 27...

1153
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,447
26, 25...

1154
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,127
24, 23, 22...

1155
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:11,929
Go!

1156
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,606
Ready or not? Here we come!

1157
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,641
Evan!

1158
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,207
You can't hide from us.

1159
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,291
Here we come.

1160
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,442
Evan?

1161
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,048
We can smell you, Evan.

1162
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,281
Daddy?

1163
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,761
Psst! In here.

1164
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,810
- Evan?
- Oh, Evan?

1165
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,083
Are you here, monster?

1166
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,050
Evan?

1167
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,445
Evan?

1168
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,810
Shit!

1169
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,444
Evan!

1170
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,649
Yeah, there he goes! Stop!

1171
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,689
Evan! Stop!

1172
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,131
Oh, fuck!

1173
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,884
Don't fucking move!

1174
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,242
Help me! Help me!

1175
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,488
- Scream all you fucking want!
- Help me!

1176
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,530
No one's fucking home!
We tried every house!

1177
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,251
Are you ready!

1178
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,050
Please don't do this!

1179
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,324
- Time to say goodbye!
- Please! Please!

1180
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,050
Help!

1181
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:46,284
Help me!

1182
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,442
Please, somebody help me!

1183
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,962
Help! Please somebody, help!

1184
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,088
Please, let me go!

1185
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:58,528
Help! Please help me! Somebody help me!

1186
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,484
No! Help me!

1187
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,802
No! No! No! No! No!

1188
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,043
No, help! Help!

1189
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,885
One, two, three!

1190
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,203
Whoopsie-daisy!

1191
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:16,766
So Evan, did we hurt your shoulder?

1192
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,404
We want you to be comfy, Evan.

1193
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,326
Help! Help!

1194
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,325
Help! Help!

1195
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,604
Don't move, Evan.
You might get dirt in your eyes.

1196
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,330
Yeah, close your eyes, baby.

1197
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,051
Help! Help!

1198
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,690
Help!

1199
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,918
Help! Help! Help!

1200
01:27:52,018 --> 01:27:55,098
Help! Help!

1201
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,362
Please. Please.

1202
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,409
Please. Please, don't do this.

1203
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,085
Please! Bel. Please.

1204
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,882
It looks like he's trying
to communicate.

1205
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,810
Please.

1206
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,371
If you promise to behave,
I'll take out the gag.

1207
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,400
Okay.

1208
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,562
Don't do this. Please?

1209
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,729
I'll do whatever you want.
I'll do whatever you want.

1210
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,450
Whatever!

1211
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,722
Even calling your family and telling them
everything you did to us?

1212
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,041
Yes.

1213
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:47,000
Yes. Yes. Yes. I'll tell them.
I'll tell them.

1214
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,321
Okay, let's give him a lifeline.

1215
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:54,210
I love the lifeline part. Let's see.

1216
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,529
But the lifeline is a phone call.

1217
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,245
Not FaceTime.

1218
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,205
Your wife's not gonna see you like this.

1219
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,282
Hi, this is Karen Alvarado,

1220
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,917
please leave a message
or send a text. Ciao.

1221
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,324
Go ahead, talk.

1222
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,042
Honey. I'm sorry for
what I'm gonna tell you.

1223
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,726
They made me.

1224
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,891
Fuck!

1225
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,730
Call 911!

1226
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,326
- Call 911! I've been kidnapped...
- Evan, Evan...

1227
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,005
- ...by two girls!
- Evan!

1228
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,730
Call 911!

1229
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,490
- Call 911!
- No, no, no, Evan!

1230
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,291
- You broke the rule.
- Evan, why did you do that?

1231
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,843
Well, now she'll fucking find you!

1232
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,047
Not really.

1233
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:40,370
I hung up as soon as it hit voice mail.
I knew you'd pussy out.

1234
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:45,690
You fucking whores!

1235
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,324
You fucking whores!

1236
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,522
I'll fucking kill you,
you fucking-fuck bitch cunt!

1237
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,603
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bitches!

1238
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,082
Oh, there's Evan. There he is!

1239
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:00,730
We missed you.

1240
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,325
Fucking whores!

1241
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:06,766
Knock-knock!

1242
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,691
I said knock-knock.

1243
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,927
No!

1244
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,650
I don't think he can talk.

1245
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,365
Okay. Knock-knock.

1246
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,851
Who's there?

1247
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,002
- Cheating Evan.
- Cheating Evan who?

1248
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,242
Cheating "Evan-tually" gets you killed.

1249
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,682
No! No!

1250
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,280
- Ready, Evan?
- No!

1251
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,686
No!

1252
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,410
- One!
- No!

1253
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,971
- Two.
- Do it!

1254
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,929
- No! No!
- Three!

1255
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,408
Look at his face.

1256
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,689
We got you good.

1257
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,531
You didn't really think we
were gonna kill you, did you?

1258
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,250
We're not animals.

1259
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,289
It was just a game, Evan.

1260
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,330
A game? A game?

1261
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,084
You know what?

1262
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:05,210
For a moment, I thought
you were the one who'd say no.

1263
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,523
And now we have to play
a game with someone else.

1264
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,251
You know what's funny?
They never say no.

1265
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,004
No matter who they are.

1266
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:19,164
No matter how much
they love their families.

1267
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,045
You're all the same.

1268
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,567
Bye, Evan.

1269
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,689
You were my favorite.

1270
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,765
Oh!

1271
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,521
Wish me happy birthday.
I turn 22 next week.

1272
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,250
Yeah.

1273
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,448
I freaked out when I turned 18.

1274
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,001
But you made me feel 15 again.
Thanks, Evan.

1275
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,644
Let's get out of here.

1276
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,849
Oh, I almost forgot. Yes, your phone.

1277
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,561
You know you really should be
more careful with Facebook.

1278
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,371
If you don't log out someone
could do terrible things with it.

1279
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:01,966
Post something really personal
for all your friends to see.

1280
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,764
Look closely. So you'll remember us.

1281
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,247
- Yes, Evan, fuck her!
- Fuck me, Daddy!

1282
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,640
Okay.

1283
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,884
Attaboy, Evan. Fuck her!

1284
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,523
Fuck me! Fuck me!

1285
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,490
I'm sure you'll get
a lot of likes though.

1286
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,205
Doggy style, Belly!

1287
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,725
Enjoy!

1288
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,531
Oh!

1289
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:32,241
Bye, Evan! Muah! We'll miss you!

1290
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,125
Oh!

1291
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,310
No!

1292
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,362
Oh, no!

1293
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,488
Fuck me, Daddy!

1294
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,881
God, God!

1295
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,363
Take your bags to your rooms.
Then go use the bathroom.

1296
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:07,171
And then we're gonna
go see Monkey, okay?

1297
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,364
- Are you guys tired?
- Yeah!

1298
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,204
Monkey?

1299
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,328
Monkey?

1300
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,963
Daddy had a party.
