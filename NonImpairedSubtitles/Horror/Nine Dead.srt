00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,050
- Because l'm
a fucking genius, okay?

168
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,485
- Yeah, well,
anything is possible.

169
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,250
- l had a customer
a couple of weeks ago

170
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,291
threaten to kill me

171
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,689
when l cut him off at the bar.

172
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,621
But then he drove his car
into a building.

173
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,024
- Maybe this is all just
a mistake.

174
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,265
- What, do you think he
kidnapped all of us by mistake?

175
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,601
Look, he's obviously crazy,

176
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,164
so that's something we can
use to our advantage.

177
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,302
- Are we supposed to think
of a crime that's so horrible

178
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,039
that he would kill nine people
as a result,

179
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,047
some horrible crime that we did?

180
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,353
- l'm sorry, Father,

181
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,983
but the worst
thing one person

182
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,686
can do to another

183
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,753
is child molestation.

184
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,163
- Never.

185
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,860
l never would do such a thing.

186
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,098
- l have.

187
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,001
- Was it, like, boys or girls?

188
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,510
- Does it matter to you?

189
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,047
- No, no.

190
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,082
- Me neither.

191
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,673
[chuckles]

192
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,775
- Oh, you sick son of a bitch.

193
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,080
- You put me in a room
with you

194
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,518
and no windows and no doors,

195
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,556
and you're gonna wish
that you were never born.

196
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:49,617
- Sweetie, we are in a room
with no windows or doors,

197
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,528
and the only thing you're gonna
do is try to survive,

198
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,656
just like me.

199
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,199
- Maybe you deserve to die.

200
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:59,033
- What l've done might have
gotten me here,

201
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,096
but you two

202
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,039
and all of you...

203
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,577
What have all of you done

204
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,240
to deserve
the death penalty?

205
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,147
Hmm?

206
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,714
- My name is Eddie Vigoda.

207
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,885
- Hi, Eddie.

208
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,866
- Maybe that helps somebody.

209
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,366
- No, Eddie.

210
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,494
No, it doesn't.

211
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,946
[clock ticking]

212
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,798
l'm Dean Jackson.

213
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,292
- l'm Kelley Murphy.

214
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,428
l'm an assistant
district attorney

215
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,473
for Los Angeles County.

216
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,269
- Can you think of anyone
you've put away

217
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,106
that would want revenge,
like a crazed killer,

218
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,874
you know, some escaped psycho?

219
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,279
- Take your pick.

220
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,078
l mean, l've made more
than a few enemies,

221
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,880
but there are people that keep
tabs on parolees

222
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,648
that might come after me.

223
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,279
And no one saw this guy coming.

224
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,351
Jackson, anything you'd
like to add?

225
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,122
- Huh?

226
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,331
- l know you.

227
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,960
- Says you.

228
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,665
- We did some business together
years ago.

229
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,604
l'm sure it was small-time stuff
for you,

230
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,370
but it was pretty big for me.

231
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,640
My name
is Christian Collinsworth.

232
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,044
- What kind of business
are you in?

233
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,514
- Sully's with the mob.

234
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,483
You know, it doesn't surprise me
that you don't remember me.

235
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,543
lt's been a long time.

236
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,146
- What's your name, anyway, man?

237
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,590
- Sully Fenton from Vegas.

238
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,992
- What kind of business
did you two do together?

239
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,030
- Ask the kid.

240
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,291
Hell if l know.

241
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,360
- A deal came my way,
some pharmaceutical-grade speed.

242
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,366
l was about five grand short,
so l went to Sully.

243
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,500
l heard he was in the business
of loaning money for drugs

244
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,009
for part of the product
and profits.

245
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,876
- l'm sure five grand sounded
pretty sweet to me at the time,

246
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:22,936
especially selling meth.

247
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,483
- So what happened?

248
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,781
- l sold the stuff
to these two cool guys

249
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,913
who turned out to be
undercover cops.

250
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,855
And l went in for three years.

251
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,517
- But you still paid me, right?

252
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,823
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

253
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,420
Everybody knows what happens
when you don't pay Sully Fenton.

254
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,465
l'm not stupid.

255
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,159
- Are you sure about that?

256
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:46,227
- l had nothing going
into prison.

257
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,465
l had even less getting out.

258
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,565
But l got what l needed

259
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,542
as soon as l hit the streets
in May.

260
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,580
You were paid
by the end of the month.

261
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,615
Now l'm an actor and bartender
in Hollywood though.

262
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,480
- Good for you.

263
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,780
- l'm gonna miss
my sitcom audition.

264
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,619
- Your audition?

265
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,022
Where the hell do you think
you are?

266
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,617
- Jesus, will you
cut the kid some slack already?

267
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,684
- We're all scared here.

268
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,094
He's doing his best.

269
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,961
- [sighs]

270
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,129
- Hey, is Sully the only one
who's not from Los Angeles?

271
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,932
- Uh-uh.

272
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,700
My travels have
taken me all over,

273
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,106
including Los Angeles.

274
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,167
More than a few prisons.

00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:34,548
l have Catholic parish
in the San Fernando Valley.

277
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,145
- Eddie, where are you from?

278
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,252
- Barstow.

279
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,089
- You guys forgot about me.

280
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,595
- You said you ain't talking.

281
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,221
l just figured you're
from Los Angeles,

282
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,129
since, you know,
the city's chock-full

283
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,599

- Excuse me.

287
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,769
Excuse me.

288
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:03,179
No one appreciates your
pissing match more than l.

289
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,944
But l think we're forgetting
about someone.

290
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,521

291
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,578
English?

292
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,852
- Say something.

293
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,655
l know you understand us.

what this language is?

Anyone know what it is?

- Chinese, l think.

298
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,338
- How the hell do you know?

299
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,805
- Old-school kung fu flicks.

300
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,468
- lt's annoying, whatever it is.

This has absolutely nothing
to do with the cops.

00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:49,719
shoots the gun up into the air,
and we all think he's dead.

331
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,255
- Yeah, that's what
he's gonna do.

332
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,416
He's gonna sweat us.
That's what he's gonna do.

333
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,459
- You think?

334
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,550
- Yeah, he's gonna do that.

335
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:56,594
- Really?

336
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,425
- Come on, guys, come on.

337
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,759
We can do this.

338
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:00,798
Yeah.

339
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,924
lf he figured out

340
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,968
why we're all here,
we can figure it out.

341
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,697
- You know what?

342
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,935
l really appreciate
your can-do spirit,

343
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,635
but if this pig is wrong,

344
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,702
my name's Coogan.

345
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,441
And l got to say,

346
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,380
what a pleasure it was

347
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,887
to spend the last ten minutes
of my life with you all.

348
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,752
- Well, we still haven't
gotten your name.

349
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,121
- You didn't?

350
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,716
Miss chink over there said it
plain as day.

351
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,787
lt's what you
and everyone else think: nigger.

352
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:33,956
All right?

353
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,296
- Yeah, is that
with one G or two?

354
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,734
- Oh, that-that-

355
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,930
[laughter]

356
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,996
With two.

357
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,304
- You think this is funny?

358
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,673
This isn't funny.

359
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,268
- Hey, what else am l gonna do?

360
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,109
ln about three seconds
we're gonna find out

361
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,582
if Coogan's right about this
being a bust,

362
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,278
or we're gonna find
one of us dead.

363
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,560
[door clicking]

364
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,801
- Why are you here?

365
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,631
- You got to give us more time.

366
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,570
You're asking the impossible.

367
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,232
We're all willing to do
whatever you want.

368
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,900
But you have to give us
something in return.

369
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,945
[gun clicks]

370
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,144
- Okay, okay, okay.

371
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,550
Okay, okay.

372
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,487
How could l have known that?

373
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,585
Please just wait a second.

374
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,629
Please don't!

375
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,663
[gunshot]

376
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,699
- [screaming]

377
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:50,966
- What are you doing, man?

378
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,307
God!

379
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,347
[woman crying]

380
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,586
- [laughs]

381
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,626
Fuck.

382
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,499
Sorry to see him go,

383
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:21,301
but that's one less
to worry about, right?

384
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,806
- As l said,

385
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,776
you have to know why l brought
each and every one of you here

386
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,972
in order to survive.

387
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,844
lf you want to walk
out of here alive,

388
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,885
you'd better figure out
why he was here as well.

389
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,988
[door slams]

390
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,717
[door slams]

391
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,192
- l can't die like this.

392
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,233
- Please, God.

393
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,268
We ask that you-

394
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,769
[muttering]

395
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,271
- Hey, Father.

396
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,398
You think we can toss the idea

397
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:00,935
of him faking the killing
outside the door?

398
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,913
Who are you praying to?

399
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:07,748
God's not here.

400
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,081
- [muttering]

401
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,281
- You still think
this is the cops?

402
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,688
lf we don't figure out
what's going on

403
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,158
before somebody else dies,

404
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,785
we're not gonna get
out of here alive.

405
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:21,196
- Well, does anybody here
speak Chinese?

406
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,233
- l speak a little Spanish.

407
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,564
- <i>Habla español?</i>

408
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,730
- [speaking foreign language]

409
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,773
- Really?

410
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,001
Oh, oh.

411
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,100
No dice.

412
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,846
- Padre, you sure you didn't
touch no kids?

413
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,976
- l have never harmed a child
in my life.

414
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,952
Anyway, that thing over there,

415
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,386
he's already admitted
to the crime,

416
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,480
so stop looking at me.

417
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,218
- Hey.

418
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:48,987
Guys, l might be a little
screwed up,

419
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,721
but l just spent
five years in jail.

420
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,296
l'm trying to be a reformed man.

421
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,427
- What did you serve time for?

422
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,868
- Grand theft auto.

423
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,132
- Not child molestation?

424
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,367
- No, that's all they could
hit me with.

425
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,542
You see,
they couldn't find a body.

426
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,510
- Wow, you're a winner,
ain't you?

427
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,845
- Thank you.

428
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,521
- Piece of shit.

429
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,851
- l think it's about time
we heard from you.

430
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,122
- All right.

431
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,793
l'm Leon, from L.A.

432
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,961
My brother and l used to do work
up and down the West Coast.

433
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,198
- What kind of work did you do?

434
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,124
- Looking for this?

435
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,763
Don't give me those
fucked-up looks.

436
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,860
At least l never sexed
and killed no kids.

437
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,632
l never killed anybody.

438
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,038
But l'd rob your ass
if the price was right.

439
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,702
Cash is king,
and l stick to what works.

440
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,574
But guns?

441
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,547
Guns can be better
than cash.

442
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,584
- Kelley, did you ever
prosecute Leon?

443
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,414
- No, he doesn't look familiar.

444
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,851
- That's because
l never got caught.

445
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,650
- Yeah, well, our friend
out there caught you.

446
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,850
- Yeah, coming out the USC
library no less.

447
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,222
- The library?

448
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,228
- Yeah, it pays to do research
in my business.

449
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,628
- lf the cop and Kelley
know each other

450
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,294
and Christian and Vegas Sully
know each other,

451
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,740
then it would make sense
that we're all connected here,

452
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,742
whether we know it or not.

453
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:48,813
- Well, if l busted you,

454
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,177
you guys would know
better than me.

455
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,215
l mean, that list is long.

456
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,307
- Yeah, l'm in the same boat.

457
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,942
l wouldn't even know
where to begin.

458
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,452
But in my business,

459
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,647
we don't do this shit.

460
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,711
- l forget how you people

461
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,121
can be so thoughtless
and careless

462
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,556
when it comes to human life.

463
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,924
l spend every waking moment
serving God

464
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,327
by trying to help people
in my community,

465
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,457
and all you seem to do
is try to destroy life.

466
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,058
- You put yourself
up on a pedestal,

467
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,330
but you're here
just like the rest of us.

468
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,201
So why don't you stop talking
about why you shouldn't be here,

469
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,500
and let's figure out
why you are.

470
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,700
- Hey, Eddie.

471
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,332
Eddie.
- What?

472
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,140
- Nobody's stopping you
from talking, Eddie.

473
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,043
- l work for
a health insurance carrier.

474
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,081
l'm from Barstow.

475
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,673
- That's fascinating.

476
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,275
Any other useless facts
you'd like to pass around?

477
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,377
- l'm doing my best.

478
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,046
- Tell us about your work.

479
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,749
What do you do?

480
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,792
Come on, what do you do, Eddie?

481
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,121
- Okay.

482
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,491
[sighs]

483
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,861
A couple of years ago,
l helped out my brother-in-law.

484
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,331
He has colon cancer.

485
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,801
My company does a lot
of experimental medical work,

486
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,634
and l falsified his forms

487
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,141
so that he can get
the treatment.

488
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,804
But l did it to help
my brother-in-law.

489
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,813
l mean, this doesn't make sense.

490
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,314
l'm a good person.

491
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,645
l don't deserve to be here.

492
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:00,980
l shouldn't be here.

493
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,178
- Hey!

494
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,551
Relax there, leaky faucet.

495
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,826

l'm human.

497
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,328
- Jesus Christ, Eddie.

498
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,864
- So you know, l mean,
all right.

499
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,092
Everybody have a look.

500
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,997
You know, laugh.

501
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,035
But you know what?

502
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,668
lf we don't start confessing,

503
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,642
l mean,

504
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,644
we're never gonna
make it out of here alive.

505
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:32,206
Everybody-
everybody's got to help.

506
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,818
- Jackson and l
used to sleep together.

507
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,049
- Ooh.

508
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,058
- Yeah, until my wife found out.

509
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,060
- Would your wife go this far

510
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,561
to get back at you
for cheating on her?

511
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,563
- No, she divorced me
and moved to Arizona.

512
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:47,893
l think that's far enough.

513
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,161
Plus, she has no way of getting
us all here together.

514
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,202
And she has no reason to.

515
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,032
l pay my alimony.

516
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,128
l don't think
she hates me that much.

517
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,866
- No ex-wife would want
her man dead.

518
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,407
That's her money train.

519
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:02,640
- Look, no one knows you two,
so l doubt it's the ex-wife.

520
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,740
- And nobody really wants
to hear about your sex life.

521
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,182
- Yeah, well,
she's just pissed off,

522
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,480
'cause we got caught.

523
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,713
- Yeah, it was your
big mouth that got us caught.

524
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:10,755
- You know what, Kelley?

525
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,789
You're not the only one
who got hurt.

526
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,823
l lost my wife.

527
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,756
- Yeah, and l was labeled
the home-wrecking slut.

528
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,259
That did wonders for my career.

529
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,557
- And l wasn't the only person
you were screwing around with.

530
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,098
What was it, a month before
some judge knocked you up?

531
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,630
- Hey, kitty cats.

532
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,569
Why so hostile?

533
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,935
An affair is an affair.

534
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,668
- Now we're getting relationship
advice from a pedophile.

535
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:31,709

- No, l just realized
how l'm getting out of here.

542
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,904
None of you guys are gonna

Closest one to me.

next to go.

That means we have eight minutes

Some kind of shooting,

l prosecuted.

693

He went to San Quentin.

- Greeley, Wade Greeley.

696
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,545
He was a total punk kid,
20 years old.

A total loser.

That's why we're here?

Because this kid Wade Greeley

is pissed off that you sent him
to prison?

702

is a robbery and a name

703
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:47,053
and a whole hell of a lot
of unanswered questions.

Wade Greeley.

707
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,130
Does any of this
mean anything to you?

708

711
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,271
going to jail
is the end-all-be-all,

712
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,178

Ease up.

or something like that.

you people die,

Man, you fucking tripping.

last month.

00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,937
when it comes to upholding
the Lord's law.

824
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:00,238
My loyalty will not
be questioned.

825
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,505
My devotion does not exist

826
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,171
only when the situation deems
convenient.

827
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,112
- People are dead because
of you.

828
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,082
- You don't know that
to be true.

829
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,743
- The hell l don't, cocksucker!

830
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,480
Leon laid there dying,

831
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,351
but at least he had the balls
to speak his mind,

832
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,550
even though it went against
his own fucked-up judgment.

833
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,616
And now you're going to have
all of us die

834
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:17,854
because you're gonna keep quiet

835
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,793
behind some collar
and dusty oath?

836
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,491
- Sully, would you turn in
your brother

837
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,692
for a lighter sentence?

838
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,493
- My brother's dead.

839
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,639
- So then your father.

840
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,005
Would you give up your father
to save your own skin?

841
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,566
- l would never cross my father.

842
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:36,112
- So then you can understand
my situation.

843
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,704
- No, l can't!

844
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,344
- lt's like waking up from one
nightmare into another.

845
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,114
- Shut the hell up, Eddie.

846
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,656
- lf Father Francis
has made up his mind,

847
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,453
we're just gonna have to

848
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,857
get out of here
without him.

849
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,520
- What?
You're defending the cocksucker?

850
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,029
- No.

851
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,761
But l got a wife to get home to,
and we're wasting time arguing.

852
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,632
- To hell with Francis, okay?

853
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,034
lf he's not gonna talk,

854
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,198
we're never gonna figure out
why he's here.

855
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,106
So if we want to live,
we're gonna have to escape.

856
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,610
Okay, we're gonna have
to take him down.

857
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,670
And we have to face the fact
that we may have to kill him.

858
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,682
- On, l ain't got no problem
with that.

859
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,377
- Okay, hold on.

860
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,385
What do we know?

861
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:19,013
We know Greeley robbed
Chan's liquor store.

862
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,818
And we know Kelley
prosecuted him.

863
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:24,725
- Okay, well, that's two
out of nine, Eddie.

864
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,524
- Maybe there's more to it.

865
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,531
Maybe it goes beyond
those people

866
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,693
who are directly responsible
for him going to jail.

867
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,396
Maybe he's thinking
in bigger terms.

868
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,835
- Yeah, maybe we're not

869
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,202
all connected in this.

870
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,741
Maybe he's going after everybody
that's ever done

871
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,276
anything wrong to this guy.

872
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,245
- We need to come clean.

873
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:48,546
Completely clean
about everything, right now,

874
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,087
all of us.

875
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:54,124
[clock ticking]

876
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,630
- All right.

877
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,967
You want a story?

878
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,199
Eight years ago

879
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:13,937
this old man came in
and slapped me around

880
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,239
in front of my crew.

881
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,473
Some crazy bastard
who owed me money

882
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,574
came in and tried to punk me
in front of my people.

883
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:26,018
l went back to his pawn shop
that night.

884
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,526
Yeah, l went back,
and l firebombed it.

885
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:30,560
Boom!

886
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,754
[laughs]

887
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,495
The problem...

888
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,233
the problem...

889
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:47,471
l didn't know he lived upstairs
in an apartment

890
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,875
with his grandkids.

891
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,021
That's why l deserve to die.

892
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:17,306
- lt was my first year
on the force,

893
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,705
l was working
the valley division,

894
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:24,772
and my partner got into it
with this speed freak.

895
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:25,837
lt was bad.

896
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,076
The kid was all tweaked out,

897
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:29,244
and my partner was having
a really rough day.

898
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,718
The kid took a swing
at my partner,

899
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,090
and that was it.

900
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,288
He beat the hell
out of this kid.

901
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:44,096
l really wanted to stop it,

902
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:49,105
but he looked up at me.

903
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,231
He looked at me,

904
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,672
and he asked me
if l wanted to join in.

905
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,142
- You joined in?

906
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,441
- Yeah, l didn't want
to hurt my reputation.

907
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:57,673
You know, l mean,

908
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,375
it was my first year
out on the street.

909
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,541
l mean, you know what l mean,
Kelley.

910
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,982
- So you beat the kid.

911
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,849
- Yeah, but God damn it,
l'm not proud of it.

912
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:05,718
- Well, did you go
to lnternal Affairs?

913
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,849
- No.

914
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,690
l stuck around
for two more years

915
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:13,593
and got transferred
out of there.

916
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,655
- So why would your old partner
pull you down here

917
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,666
if you never turned him in
or told anyone?

918
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,429
- lt wasn't my partner.

919
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,666
l was thinking maybe the kid
finally tracked us down

920
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,572
not for beating him up.

921
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,234
For blinding him.

922
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,438
- That's awful.

923
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,946
What was the kid's name?

924
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,915
- Alfie Martinez.

925
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:38,045
And l don't know if that's
the reason why l'm down here,

926
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:41,682
but that's what haunts me
every day of my life,

927
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,022
that l didn't stand up.

928
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:47,393
l didn't have the courage
to do anything,

929
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,399
to stand up to my superiors.

930
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,560
- So if your old partner
is still alive,

931
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,627
wouldn't it make sense that
he'd be in here with us?

932
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,640
- Yeah, that's just a dead end,

933
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,902
another dead end.

934
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,739
- l'm telling you,
we're wasting time.

935
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,904
We've got to find our own way
out of here like Leon did.

936
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,107
- Yeah, that worked out
real well for him.

937
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:08,913
- [speaking foreign language]

938
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,578
- Yeah, sing it, sister!

939
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:11,621
Hallelujah!

940
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:12,655
Right, cocksucker?

941
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,625
- Shut the hell up, Sully!

942
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,191
- We got to think of something.

943
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,465
l just thought of something.

944
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,837
l don't know if this
is anything,

945
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,570
but since we're confessing
our sins,

946
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,475
and there is a priest here-

947
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:37,410
- All right, just spit it out,
Eddie.

948
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,415
- When l was in college,

949
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:42,145
we had some girls-
strippers over for a party.

950
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,379
We were all drinking,

951
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,819
and l spent some time
with one of them.

952
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,449
We both got really drunk, and-

953
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,514
- And you banged her.

954
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,652
- Yeah, but she said
it was rape.

955
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:54,924
- Oh, and here all this time
we thought you were so perfect.

956
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,626
lt turns out you're just another
asshole frat boy.

957
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,635
- They dropped the charges
due to lack of evidence.

958
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,330
- Mom and dad must have been
so proud.

959
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,838
- l'm just trying to help.

960
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,066
- l mean, something might click.

961
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,438
lsn't that the whole point?

962
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,374
- No, you're getting us further
away from the point

963
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,502
l was trying to make.

964
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,046
- Guys, look,
this is about the robbery.

965
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,103
We're missing something.

966
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,649
l know we are.

967
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,344
- No, there's nothing else with
the robbery; l promise you.

968
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,410
- [scoffs]

969
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,616
- What was that, Francis?

970
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,821
- You know we're going down
the wrong road, don't you?

971
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,659
- Yeah, 20 years of poker tells
me that's a ''yes.''

972
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,028
What do you know, Father?
- Forget about the robbery!

973
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,225
Okay, it doesn't matter
what he knows.

974
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,358
- Shut up, Kelley!

975
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,300
- You were about to beat
that kid to death,

976
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,735
and now you won't help me
kill the guy

977
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,999
who's ready to execute us all?

978
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,199
What the hell is wrong with you?

979
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,298
What's wrong with all of you?

980
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,637
- Hey, l'm with you, Kelley.

981
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,575
But this cocksucker here
is about ready to crack,

982
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,636
and l'm pretty damned interested
to hear what he has to say.

983
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,773
- l know you want to tell us,
Father.

984
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:46,816
- Aw, come on.

985
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:47,850
You ready to break
that oath, Father?

986
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,153
- This isn't easy, okay?

987
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,414
- Just say it.

988
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,183
- lt's the right thing to do.

989
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,690
- What if l said
that l knew for a fact

990
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,193
that Wade Greeley did not
rob Chan's store?

991
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,228
- Bullshit.

992
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,661
Chan was the eyewitness.

993
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,892
Greeley didn't have an alibi,
and l had the evidence,

994
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,433
concrete evidence.

995
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,661
- Did Greeley say
he was innocent?

996
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:06,703
- Of course he said
he was innocent.

997
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,101
Everybody's innocent.

998
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,765
Nobody wants to be convicted
once they're caught.

999
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,809
- What do you know about it,
Father?

1000
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:13,865
- No, l'm telling you.

1001
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,411
Greeley was guilty.

1002
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,138
- Son of a bitch.

1003
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,048
- What?

1004
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,346
- One of us confessed
to the crime

1005
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,909
in Father Francis' confessional.

1006
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:24,954
l bet that's it.

1007
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,887
- ls that it?

1008
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,049
ls it, Father?

1009
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,353
- Whatever Father Francis knows,

1010
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,586
he knows from the confessional.

1011
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,957
Otherwise, he would tell us.

1012
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,394
- Has anyone ever been
to confession

1013
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,794
in the San Fernando Valley?

1014
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,264
- Yeah, right.

1015
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,322
- No.

1016
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,368
- Christian!

1017
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,402
[chuckles]

1018
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,993
lt has to be Christian.

1019
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,633
- You all saw the father's face

1020
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,231
when l couldn't remember
the Hail Mary.

1021
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,332
l reminded him of Christian.

1022
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,741
He forgot
the same prayer earlier.

1023
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:48,778
Remember?

1024
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,812
What could Christian have told
Father Francis?

1025
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,645
- That he robbed
the liquor store.

1026
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,457
- You've known this whole time?

1027
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:08,998
- l did not know the whole time.

1028
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,591
lt wasn't until after Chan came
up with the robbery

1029
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:12,930
that l knew for sure.

1030
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,231
- Cocksucker!

1031
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,169
- l told you you wouldn't like
what l had to say.

1032
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,433
- Are you absolutely positive

1033
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,771
that it was Christian
in the confessional?

1034
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:26,940
- The Lord is with thee.

1035
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:30,384
Dude, how does the rest
of that go?

1036
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,479
- lf l had a Bible,
l would put my hand on it.

1037
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,524
- You got the wrong man,
prosecutor.

1038
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,650
Wade Greeley's the wrong guy.

1039
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,455
- l had the evidence
against him.

1040
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:41,088
- Regardless, l mean, this is
a whole new ball game now.

1041
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,598
- Holy shit.

1042
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,634
Sully.

1043
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:45,668
- Yeah?

1044
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,760
- Christian got out of jail
the same time

1045
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,328
Chan's store was robbed.

1046
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:50,964
- So what does that
have to do with me?

1047
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,475
- What happens to people
who don't pay you?

1048
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,670
- lf they owe a little,
l go for their knees.

1049
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:58,236
lf they owe a lot,
l go for their jugular.

1050
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,577
- Yeah, well, does Christian

1051
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,083
look like the type of kid
that could take a beating?

1052
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,811
- So what?

1053
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:05,855
What are you saying?

1054
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:06,889
- Christian robbed Chan

1055
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,585
to get you the money.

1056
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,820
He said that he got
out of jail in May

1057
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:12,862
and paid you soon after.

1058
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,419
How else could he have gotten
the money?

1059
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,626
lt fits.

1060
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,831
- Wait a second.

1061
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:23,998
So you're telling me,

1062
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,405
of all the fucked-up shit
l've done

1063
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,069
through the course of my life,

1064
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,635
l loaned some dead dumbass
five grand,

1065
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,203
and that's what
l'm gonna die for?

1066
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,248
- The kid needed a motive.

1067
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,339
l think you're it.

1068
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,441
- [laughs]

1069
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,283
That's goddamn ridiculous.

1070
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,050
You're serious?

1071
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,620
All l did was give him
some cash.

1072
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:44,660
l got to die for that?

1073
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:45,820
That's bullshit!

1074
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,523
- The connection between you
and Christian

1075
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,224
has been there the whole time.

1076
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,698
We just never thought
anything of it.

1077
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,758
- Oh, and l still don't.

1078
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,361
Of all the shit l-

1079
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,133
oh, hey there, asshole!

1080
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,174
- Why are you here?

1081
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,333
- You know what?
We don't know.

1082
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:00,376
But guess what.

1083
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,967
l don't give a fuck.

1084
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,910
l don't know what kind of shit
you got going on here,

1085
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,969
but l'm sick of it.

1086
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,015
You've got me sweating,

1087
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,175
rethinking all the horrible
things that l've done in my life

1088
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,411
and all the people l've crossed.

1089
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,680
For what?

1090
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,244
For some dumbass that l loaned

1091
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:15,257
$5,000 to?

1092
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,792
Well, guess what.

1093
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,090
That's how l do business,
and that's how l get shit done.

1094
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:21,027
l don't apologize for shit.

1095
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:24,624
- Knowing what you know,
knowing how your life will end,

1096
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,259
would you change the way
you do business?

1097
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,167
- Hell no!

1098
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:29,330
l don't regret anything.

1099
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,431
l wouldn't do a damn thing
different.

1100
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:34,170
[laughs]

1101
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,677
What's the matter?

1102
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:38,976
You don't like that, do you,
you dirty revenge-seeking pussy?

1103
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,313
l don't regret anything.

1104
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,818
What, you want me
to regret my life?

1105
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,252
Fuck you.

1106
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:48,849
Oh, you want the satisfaction
of me begging for my life,

1107
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,290
don't you?

1108
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,089
Fuck you.

1109
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,925
You want the satisfaction
of killing all of us,

1110
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:55,430
thinking it's gonna change
our lives.

1111
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:56,465
Whah, whah, whah.

1112
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,263
Well, fuck you!

1113
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:04,034
l take that back.

1114
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:05,768
l take all that back.

1115
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:09,639
Yeah.

1116
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,203
l'm not gonna give you
the satisfaction

1117
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:16,685
of me being pissed off
while l die.

1118
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:21,315
Of all the shit
you could have killed me for,

1119
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,792
five grand?

1120
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,830
[laughs]

1121
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,326
Fuck you!

1122
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,229
Come on, bastard.

1123
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,740
Let's do this.

1124
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,969
Hit me right here in the head,
just like my brother.

1125
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,739
Reunite me with him.

1126
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:43,836
Come on, asshole!

1127
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:44,880
Pull the trigger.

1128
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,344
- But it's not your turn.

1129
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,477
lt's Eddie's.

1130
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,488
- Me?

1131
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,219
No, no, no.

1132
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,321
Please, no.

1133
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,490
No, no.

1134
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:03,532
Don't kill me.

1135
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,000
Just tell me why l'm here.

1136
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,972
[gunshot]

1137
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,007
- Damn it!

1138
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:15,772
One person dies
every ten minutes.

1139
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:16,971
That's what you said!

1140
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,639
Father Francis is dead.

1141
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:19,909
You cannot take Eddie now.

1142
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,356
- Really?

1143
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,688

00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,570
lf this is the end for you,

1148
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:43,196
you'll want to make
every minute count.

1149
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,234
- This doesn't
have to continue.

1150
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,643
Okay, we know why
you brought most of us here,

and we know what
you must have been feeling,

what you must be feeling now.

Okay, l think l speak for all
of us

1154
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,313
when we say we wish we could
go back and change history,

Wade Greeley?

1158

Whatever it is that you think
we've done to you, whatever-

1159
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,061
whatever it is
you've done here today,

1160
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,104
we can make right.

1161
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,502
You just have to talk to us.

1162
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:17,540
Look, we can help.

1163
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,734
l can help.

1164
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:20,935
Okay, whatever it is you want,

1165
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,535
we-we-
l can make that happen.

1166
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,774
Do you understand
what l'm telling you, Wade?

1167
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,945
- l'm not Wade Greeley.

00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:53,132
This doesn't make any sense.

1173
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,575
- There's way too many
coincidences for it not to be

1174
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:56,805
this guy, Greeley.

1175
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,814
- l've spent five grand
on a bottle of whiskey

1176
00:56:58,882 --> 00:56:59,906
without a care in the world.

1177
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,575
- Sully, we get it.

1178
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,175
- l'm telling you,
he's gonna kill us all.

1179
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,881
Okay, he doesn't care
if we come up with his plan.

1180
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:10,255
- lf he just wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead already.

1181
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,487
He's here to make a point.

1182
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,462
But do we really think this
isn't Greeley?

1183
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,260
- lf it isn't, it has to be
somebody close to him,

1184
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,095
somebody that could help him
plan this.

00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,398
Kelley, back at the trial,

1186
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,732
was there anyone there?

1187
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,329
Were there any friends
or family,

1188
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:24,532
anyone who stood by him?

1189
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,837
- No, no, he didn't have
anything or anyone.

1190
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,208
l don't even think he made bail.

1191
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,541
- Can you give us a few more
details?

1192
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,808
- Jeez, this was so long ago.

1193
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,008
Do you realize how many trials

1194
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,448
l've had since then,

1195
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:36,485
since before then?

1196
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,748
- Okay, let's think.

1197
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,586
Leon said that he'd been
planning this for two years.

1198
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,319
When did Greeley's case
go to trial?

1199
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,657
- l don't remember.

1200
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,218
- Can you at least tell us

1201
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,857
how many years
he got in prison?

1202
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,561
- Armed robbery, assault,
no plea.

1203
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,102
Five years, maybe.

1204
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,734
- Well, then the years
don't add up.

1205
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,400
lf l was wrongly convicted
of a crime,

1206
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,775
l would start plotting my
revenge the day l was convicted.

1207
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:03,813
- That's what l'm saying.

1208
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,541
Nothing about this makes sense.

1209
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,277
The only way we're gonna get
out of this is if we escape.

1210
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,412
- Was Christian in the lineup
when Chan picked Greeley?

1211
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,887
- No, if Christian was
in the lineup,

1212
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,322
Chan would have recognized him
when we pulled the hoods off.

1213
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:18,053
- She didn't recognize Kelley
until later.

1214
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,094
- Well, maybe she did.

1215
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,322
l mean, nobody understood
what she was saying.

1216
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,727
- Mrs. Chan?

1217
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,992
- Give it up.
We're getting off track.

1218
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,192
- l'm just coming up
with possibilities.

1219
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,201
- Well, to hell
with your possibilities.

1220
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,169
- Why are you pissed at me?

1221
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,570
- Because maybe we still
don't know jack about you!

1222
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,870
- Are you really that stupid
to think l'm hiding something?

1223
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,170
l told you everything
that l can think of,

1224
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,211
so don't blame me.

1225
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:36,245
- Something about you

1226
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:37,540
still doesn't
sit right with me, Eddie.

1227
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,013
- You know,
you've been riding me

1228
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,515
and picking on me
this whole time.

1229
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,550
What is your problem?

1230
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:42,585
- l might be dead
in ten minutes!

1231
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:43,619
That's my fucking problem!

1232
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,551
- l think we all know
who's next.

1233
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,352
- Calm down.

1234
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:49,516
- What about you, Jackson?

1235
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:50,957
We still don't know
why you're here.

1236
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,756
All we know is that you
beat a kid blind

1237
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,023
and cheated on your wife.

1238
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,292
- Well, look who's
grown some balls.

1239
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,890
- l think l got it.

1240
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,491
- You better watch
your tone Eddie,

1241
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,730
or l'm gonna start thinking
you're the psycho's partner,

1242
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,772
or at least until l see your
brains against the wall.

1243
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,398
- Yeah, yeah, well,
not if l see yours first.

1244
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,442
- Fine, go ahead!

1245
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,476
Sign me up!

1246
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:08,738
- Hey, shut up!

1247
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,109
All right, you guys are worse
than my strippers.

1248
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,273
Now listen.

1249
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,146
Leon said that
he killed his brother

1250
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,413
and dumped him during the
Cinco de Mayo parade, remember?

1251
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,715
- So what?

1252
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,756
- Well, Christian said
that he got out of jail in May.

1253
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:21,881
- And?

1254
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,222
- What if that was around
the same time?

1255
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:27,161
Look, Christian
got out of jail, right?

1256
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,597
And he said he got my five grand
right afterwards, right?

1257
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,966
Well, if we go back
and think about it,

1258
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,096
Christian said that he had
nothing when he left jail.

1259
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:40,003
- l had nothing
going in to prison.

1260
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,771
l had even less getting out.

1261
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,438
- But somehow he was able
to pull off

1262
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,141
this big liquor store
robbery heist?

1263
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:48,581
Where did he get a gun

1264
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,312
to rob Mrs. Chan?

1265
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:52,946
- Leon said the easiest product
to move were guns.

1266
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:56,816
- Guns can be better than cash.

1267
00:59:56,893 --> 01:00:00,488
- So you think Leon sold the gun
to Christian

1268
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,190
that he used to rob Chan's
liquor store?

1269
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,403
- So Sully gave Christian
the motive for the robbery.

1270
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,532
Leon gave him opportunity.

1271
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,600
Chan identified the wrong man.

1272
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:15,837
Kelley locked him up.

1273
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,380
And Father Francis didn't
go to the cops

1274
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,506
after he found out the truth.

1275
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:26,212
Okay, so that leaves Jackson,
me, and Coogan.

1276
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,416
But we can all agree that this
all started with Christian

1277
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,617
borrowing money from Sully.

1278
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:32,388
Between that and Greeley
going to jail

1279
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:36,057
is our new time line.

1280
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,430
When Christian borrowed
the money from Sully,

1281
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,664
l was studying
pharmaceuticals in Arizona.

1282
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:45,765
- Okay, well, Christian said
that he was dealing drugs.

1283
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,173
Could he have gotten them
from you?

1284
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,608
- No.

1285
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,043
l didn't have any access
to drugs.

1286
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,411
- All right, all right,
we've narrowed this down some.

1287
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,744
- Narrowed it down?

1288
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,809
All we got is a robbery,
drug dealing, and a pedophile.

1289
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:58,854
Sorry, buddy.

1290
01:00:58,921 --> 01:00:59,888
- Buddy?

1291
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,014
- Look, Sully is a criminal.

1292
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,421
Okay, he's a killer.

1293
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,687
We would have taken him down
100 times if we had the chance.

1294
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,160
Now he's your best friend?

1295
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,457
- Oh, l'm sorry
for liking the guy

1296
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,588
who's trying to save my life.

1297
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,257
- Thank you.

1298
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,494
And for bacon,
you're not so bad yourself.

1299
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:13,535
- Look, our only chance

1300
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:14,968
is that we think
Eddie might be next.

1301
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:16,733
And then hopefully after that,
Sully's next.

1302
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:17,966
So you and l can take him down.

1303
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,635
- God, you are one twisted
home-wrecking bitch.

1304
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,905
- Oh, well, it's good to know
it only takes a gun to your head

1305
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:23,946
for you to speak your mind.

1306
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,004
- You know what?

1307
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,777
The worst thing l did was not
beating that kid

1308
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,817
till he was blind.

1309
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,512
lt was fucking the lawyer.

1310
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:31,553
- [laughs]

1311
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,781
- Oh, ouch, that hurts.

1312
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,289
Jackson, l hope you die
for getting me into this.

1313
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,382
- What are you talking about?

1314
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,290
l didn't get you into this.

1315
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,953
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

1316
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,189
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1317
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,459
You just said that Jackson
got you into this.

1318
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,125
What does that mean?
- What does what mean?

1319
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,499
We have, like, seconds left
till he comes in.

1320
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:56,412
[door creaking]

1321
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,875
- Why are you here?

1322
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,919
- Because this bitch
knows something,

1323
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:06,113
and she won't talk!

1324
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,935
- [speaking foreign language]

1325
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,556
[gunshot]

1326
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:50,025
- Please, please!

1327
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,532
l beg you!

1328
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,592
You can't kill me.

1329
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:55,000
You have to let me go.

1330
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,369
My child needs me.

1331
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,704
Okay, my son needs his mommy.

1332
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:02,703
You're a human being.

1333
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,905
You can understand.

1334
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,380
You can't take a mother
away from her son.

1335
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,814
- Your son William goes
to the Sacred Heart School,

1336
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:14,755
where he is picked up every day
by your hired help.

1337
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,123
And when was the last time

1338
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,455
you actually spent time
with him?

1339
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:19,654
And how long will it be

1340
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:23,187
before you pack him off
to some boarding school?

1341
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,564
Do not use your child
as an excuse.

1342
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,604
lt pisses me off.

1343
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,432
And it should piss you off
as well.

1344
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,485
[door slams]

1345
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:42,746
[door slams]

1346
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,582
- What was he talking about,
Kelley?

1347
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,884
- [crying]

1348
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,719
- lt looks like you might be
a dad, Jackson.

1349
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,783
- Billy's mine?

1350
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,123
l didn't think l could.

1351
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:56,461
My wife and l,
we'd been trying for-

1352
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,829
l didn't think it was possible.

1353
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,094
- Yeah, well, it's possible.

1354
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,898
Maybe if you had spent a little
less time with me

1355
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:02,938
and a little more with her.

1356
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:07,271
- How could you do that to me?

1357
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:12,007
How could you just
keep that from me?

1358
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:14,413
l know our relationship,
the breakup was bad,

1359
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,577
but how could you just
cut me off like that?

1360
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:19,553
- l had to do what was best
for me.

1361
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:22,386
Okay, jackass over there was
never gonna leave his wife.

1362
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:23,720
He would rather just lead me on.

1363
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:24,953
So when l found out,

1364
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,155
l just blamed it
on someone else.

1365
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:33,260
- What you did was wrong
and downright selfish.

1366
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,997
You need to start talking.

1367
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,904
And it doesn't matter
what you're holding back.

1368
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,236
l don't care.

1369
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:40,400
l forgive you,

1370
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:41,909
but we have to get
out of here alive.

1371
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,409
- Do you want to die?

1372
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:47,540
- l might as well be dead
if this gets out.

1373
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:50,108
- Before, you said Jackson got
you into this.

1374
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:51,551
How?

1375
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:55,284
- Look.

1376
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,259
Wade Greeley was picked up
two miles from the liquor store.

1377
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:01,319
He was a good match
to Chan's description.

1378
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,695
And no one could verify
his lame-ass alibi.

1379
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,761
And then Chan picked him
out of the lineup.

1380
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,397
l had him.
l had to have him.

1381
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,306
You remember what l was
going through, Jackson.

1382
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,310
The mother and son,
the abortion case:

1383
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:16,504
two in a row lost.

1384
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,173
- l was just getting
into the life

1385
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,274
that l had worked so hard for,

1386
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:25,081
and l felt the pressure.

1387
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:26,712
You know, l had to have
a conviction,

1388
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:27,778
or l was on my way out.

1389
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,256
l was the lowest
on the totem pole,

1390
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,350
and no one was
taking me seriously.

1391
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,562
l had to win at all costs.

1392
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,161
- Losing cases
doesn't make you incompetent.

1393
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,172
- No, but combine that
with budget cuts

1394
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,298
and an affair with Jackson

1395
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:46,864
that was growing more public
every day,

1396
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:47,910
and it doesn't look good.

1397
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,176
- What did you make me do,
Kelley?

1398
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,276
- l had Chan's testimony,
but it was shaky at best.

1399
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,516
l would never be able convince
a jury that a 60-year-old woman

1400
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,250
could positively identify
someone,

1401
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,919
especially after she'd been
pistol-whipped.

1402
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,655
l had to put Greeley
at the scene.

1403
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:10,062
During the struggle,

1404
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,566
Chan grabbed Christian
by the head

1405
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,761
and got a few couple hairs.

1406
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:15,827
So l knew l just had to
get some of Wade's hair

1407
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:20,001
and make the switch.

1408
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,874
So l snuck the sample
out of the lab.

1409
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,970
l got a few hairs
from Wade's comb.

1410
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:29,040
And-

1411
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:32,519
and l couldn't get the sample
back into the evidence room.

1412
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:40,790
- And l thought me and Coogan

1413
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,728
were the most fucked-up two
in this room.

1414
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,097
- Don't you realize that you
helped kill these people?

1415
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,570
How could you not
tell us this before?

1416
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,608
[clock ticking]

1417
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,512
- Look, if the truth ever gets
out of this room, l'm over.

1418
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:07,578
l'll lose my job.

1419
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:08,623
l'll go to jail.

1420
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,056
l'll never see my son again.

1421
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,252
l might as well be dead.

1422
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:12,954
l committed a felony.

1423
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,462
- Yeah, welcome to my world.

1424
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,090
- You know, l know we're not
a team or a family,

1425
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,292
but we have a child together.

1426
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,200
Doesn't that mean something?

1427
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,261
- No, he's my son, Jackson,
okay?

1428
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:24,306
You're not a father.

1429
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,340
You'll never be a father.

1430
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:26,932
You were just a dick, literally.

1431
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,876
You're fucking unbelievable,
Kelley.

1432
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:31,037
- You're not a father.

1433
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,047
- What?

1434
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:34,082
- No, no, no.

1435
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,344
Hear me out for a second.

1436
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,751
Greeley said that he wasn't
Wade Greeley.

1437
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:42,313
- l'm not Wade Greeley.

1438
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:47,657
- Did you see how upset he got

1439
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,096
when Kelley tried to use her son
for pity?

1440
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:53,727
- Do not use your child
as an excuse.

1441
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:55,498
lt pisses me off.

1442
01:07:58,407 --> 01:07:59,635
- l mean,
if it's not really Wade,

1443
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,938
then maybe it's his father.

1444
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,138
- Has anybody thought about what
happened to Wade Greeley

1445
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:06,238
after he went to prison?

1446
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:09,284
[clock ticking]

1447
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,761
- Remember when l said

1448
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,707
Wade Greeley going to prison
was the end-all-be-all?

1449
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,471
Well, l could have been wrong.

1450
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:39,881
- Jackson was on to something
a minute ago.

1451
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,416
We've been trying to see how
Coogan and l

1452
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,112
fit into the time line before
the trial.

1453
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:46,017
We weren't thinking
about what happened

1454
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:48,249
after prison.

1455
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,288
You said that Wade
was in San Quentin.

1456
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:55,091
Did Christian say what prison
he was in?

1457
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:56,791
- No, but the sick fucker
over there

1458
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,356
said he'd been to a couple
of prisons.

1459
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:01,198
- My travels have
taken me all over,

1460
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,704
including Los Angeles.

1461
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,740
More than a few prisons.

1462
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,768
- This must mean something.

1463
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,108
- Christian couldn't have known
Wade Greeley.

1464
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,170
Christian got out of prison

1465
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,877
before Wade Greeley went in.

1466
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,818
But Coogan
knowing Wade Greeley,

1467
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,480
that's a possibility.

1468
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,023
- That just leaves me.

1469
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:26,027
[clock ticking]

1470
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,062
- Wait, wait!

1471
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:28,960
We need more time!

1472
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,228
- Why are you here?

1473
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,669
- Look, we think it has
something to do

1474
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,730
with what happened to your son
after he went to prison.

1475
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,240
- lsn't this what you want?

1476
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:41,970
You want us to think about our
lives

1477
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:43,102
and our actions and crimes

1478
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,669
and how they've affected
other people?

1479
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:45,975
Well, that's what
we are doing,

1480
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:47,276
and it's killing us.

1481
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,512
- Look, no one has suffered
like you and your son.

1482
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:51,917
Okay, no one here was on trial.

1483
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,478
No one here was punished
for their crimes.

1484
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,616
We've just gone on with our
lives and never looked back.

1485
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:00,890
But you have to look back
every single day.

1486
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,555
Look, you asked Sully
if he would change,

1487
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,155
knowing what he's done.

1488
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,224
Well, l guarantee,
you ask anyone in this room now,

1489
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:07,929
and we would change.

1490
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,129
We would change for the better.

1491
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,730
- Now, speak for yourself,
kiss-ass.

1492
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:16,540
Kiss my ass.

1493
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:21,106
- You could have died finding
some humanity or humility.

1494
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,174
- l'd rather go out in style.

1495
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:27,956
[gunshot]

1496
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:35,263
[laughing]

1497
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:54,750
[door creaking and slamming]

1498
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:58,151
[door creaking and slamming]

1499
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,189
[clock ticking]

1500
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,022
- Maybe we do deserve to die.

1501
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,030
- l just wish l knew why.

1502
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,862
- What, you two are ready
to give up?

1503
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,664
You're both ready to die?

1504
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:16,102
Well, fuck you both.

1505
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,435
Okay, never give up.

1506
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:19,872
l've lived through
worse than this,

1507
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,000
and l'll live through this.

1508
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,373
- Worse than this, Kelley?

1509
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:25,072
What could possibly be
worse than this?

1510
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,842
- Well, back when you and l
were still dating,

1511
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:30,646
l was stupid enough in this day
and age

1512
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,279
to think that l could walk
to my car

1513
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:36,950
alone at night.

1514
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:42,123
Some sweaty, bald-headed bastard
grabbed me from behind

1515
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:46,395
and threw me in his van.

1516
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,368
He bashed my head
on the steel flooring.

1517
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:49,404
l was dazed, but l could see

1518
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,769
that there was already
blood there.

1519
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,865
This wasn't his first time.

1520
01:11:56,912 --> 01:12:00,109
He put his hand over my face
as he ripped my clothes off.

1521
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:07,211
lt's like my-my brain didn't
really register the pain.

1522
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:10,383
l just kept thinking

1523
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:13,189
about how l was gonna
get this guy,

1524
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,526
this thing, you know.

1525
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:17,565
And l was gonna put him away
for the rest of his life.

1526
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:18,930
l kept imagining the courtroom

1527
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,198
and how l would be looking into
his eyes, and l would say,

1528
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,707
''l'm the one
that ruined your life.''

1529
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:30,302
But then l realized we weren't
in a courtroom.

1530
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,974
There was no judge,
no jury.

1531
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,210
lt was just me and this
shit head who thought he could

1532
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,379
put his hands all over me.

1533
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,788
Who the fuck was this guy
to violate me, to take my life?

1534
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,827
What right did he have
to touch me?

1535
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:52,093
l wasn't scared.

1536
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,259
l was furious.

1537
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,860
- Why didn't you tell me,
Kelley?

1538
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,428
We could have done something
about that.

1539
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,303
- You could have searched
everywhere.

1540
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,366
You never would have found him.

1541
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:05,937
When he was done,
he rolled off me,

1542
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:10,075
and l saw that there was
a baseball bat in his van.

1543
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:13,644
And l grabbed it,
and l hit him hard.

1544
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:19,160
Then l stepped back,
thinking someone must have seen,

1545
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,492
someone must have heard.

1546
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,155
And as l waiting for someone to
come help me,

1547
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,565
l hit him again.

1548
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,296
And then l hit him again.

1549
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,860
And l just kept swinging.

1550
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,270
And he just kept screaming.

1551
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:33,330
You know, and he begged.

1552
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,376
He begged.

1553
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:35,842
Can you believe that?

1554
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,539
l swear, l think that made me
hit him harder.

1555
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:41,947
And then-

1556
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:44,781
and then he just
stopped screaming.

1557
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,083
He stopped moving.

1558
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:50,319
And l looked around again,

1559
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:54,158
and still no one was there.

1560
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:56,390
[sniffling]

1561
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:57,432
No one heard.

1562
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,399
No one cared.

1563
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:04,838
So l went home,
and l cleaned up,

1564
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:09,105
and l burned the bat
in my fireplace.

1565
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:11,874
And l just went on with my life
like that.

1566
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:14,211
lt was just over.

1567
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,547
And the next day when they found
his body,

1568
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:22,818
l made sure no one went looking
for his killer.

1569
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:27,089
And now l'm here.

1570
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,096
And l promise you,
l promise you,

1571
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:30,290
l will live through this,

1572
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:34,358
and l will survive at all-
at all costs.

1573
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:44,412
[clock ticking]

1574
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,979
- What about rape?

1575
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,247
We all heard Coogan.

1576
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,720
He didn't care if it was boys
or girls.

1577
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,484
And if he was in the same prison
with Wade,

1578
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:56,717
why not a 20-year-old kid?

1579
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:02,925
- We did this to him.

1580
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:05,364
- How could l have known
what was gonna happen to him?

1581
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:09,097
- Think about Wade Greeley,
an innocent kid

1582
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,162
and all the things
he went through.

1583
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,731
And think about his father

1584
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:17,245
having to think about
what happened to his son.

1585
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:18,779
Think about that.

1586
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,077
- When Coogan was shot,

1587
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:22,639
when Greeley came in here
and shot him,

1588
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:23,844
what did Coogan say?

1589
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:25,216
- l don't remember.

1590
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:26,584
- What are you thinking?

1591
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:29,852
- He said something about
a splatter and killing everyone

1592
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,586
or something like that.

1593
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:35,187
- Maybe you should move them
out of the way of the splatter.

1594
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,095
l'd hate to see somebody die

1595
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:39,429
before you get a chance
to kill 'em yourself.

1596
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,332
- Yeah, he was being
a smart-ass.

1597
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,734
He was talking about the bullet,

1598
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:45,932
if it went through him
and killed somebody else.

1599
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,635
- l thought the same thing.

1600
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,677
But what if that's not
what he meant?

1601
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,576
What if the joke
was about something else?

1602
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,576
His blood, for instance.

1603
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,141
His infected blood.

1604
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,584
What if Coogan had AlDS?

1605
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:00,383
- Whoa, that's a big stretch,
Eddie.

1606
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,889
- Not really.

1607
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:07,224
That's the final piece
of our time line.

1608
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,264
lt starts with Christian
borrowing money from Sully.

1609
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:10,298
- l know you.

1610
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:11,730
- Says you.

1611
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,598
- No, we did some business
together years ago.

1612
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,036
- But then he loses that money
after a bad drug deal

1613
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:18,936
and ends up in jail.

1614

When he gets released,

1615
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,476
he buys a gun from Leon,

1616
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:24,205
uses it to rob Chan's
liquor store,

1617
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:25,678
'cause he still owes Sully
the money.

1618
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:29,183
Then Chan picks Wade Greeley
out of the lineup.

1619
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,583
Kelley makes sure the evidence
fits her case

1620
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,553
and uses Jackson to secure
that evidence

1621
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,352
against Wade for the trial.

1622

Father Francis learns the truth
during confession

1623
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,688
but being bound by God,
says nothing.

1624
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:45,957
So Wade ends up in prison

1625
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:49,265
where he has a run-in
with Coogan.

1626
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:50,771
And that's how l'm tied
into all this.

1627

- So why are you here?

1628
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,666
- Back around the time when Wade

1629
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,610
would have been released
from prison,

1630
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,443
my company had acquired
the exclusive rights

1631
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:03,075
to an experimental drug therapy
for AlDS patients.

1632
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:06,052
lt was said to prolong the life

1633
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:09,386

1634
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,221
lt was very new expensive.

1635
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,523
l think Coogan infected
Wade Greeley with AlDS.

1636
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:15,222
And the reason Wade's dad waited
two years

1637
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,060
is because that's exactly how
long his son lived

1638
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,999
outside of prison
before he died.

1639
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:24,232
- lt's his father
acting out revenge

1640
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:27,639
for the death of his son.

1641
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,439
- Wade must have been one
of the applicants

1642
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:32,810
for the new AlDS drug.

He contracted it in prison

My son was a very brave

1775
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,393

1776
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,452

Hear it callin' my name

You are the cause
of the fightin'

1783
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:10,264
You force my rage
out of hiding

1784
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:11,764
Don't care what you say

1786

You talk about me
but you don't know who l am

1787
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,298
Don't care what you say

You talk about me

Talk about me

Talk about me
