1
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,593
- What's the score, Doc?
- Twins. Cutest things you ever saw.

2
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,477
Hey, they're keeping you busy these days.

3
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,790
It's the desert.
Gives people wonderful ideas.

4
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,836
- Check the ship, will you?
- You betcha.

5
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,192
Hiya, Doc.
Phone's been ringing like crazy for you.

6
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,918
Sheriff's half out of his mind.

7
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,036
- Call him for me, will you, Josh?
- Yeah.

8
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,470
- I'm ringing him, Doc.
- That's fine.

9
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,713
- He's on, Doc.
- Thanks, Josh.

10
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,679
Hello, Jack. What's up?

11
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,234
Can you come over right away, Doc?

12
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,998
I hate to bother you.

13
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,800
I know you've been up all night,
but this is important.

14
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,589
Okay.

15
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,038
Doc, sure sounded worried, didn't he?

16
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,317
Someday, you old codger, you're going
to hear something you won't like.

17
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,914
Are you inferring that I was listening in?

18
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,515
Yeah.

19
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,878
Hi, Jack. What's all the excitement about?
Who's sick?

20
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,552
- Nobody.
- Huh?

21
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,108
The boys found a man near the highway
this morning.

22
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,673
- Run over?
- No.

23
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,315
- Well, then?
- That's why I called you, Doc.

24
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,278
- What's it look like?
- Like nothing I've ever seen before.

25
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,429
Who is it?

26
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,911
Well, he has the same general build
as Eric Jacobs, but I'm not sure.

27
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,475
I don't follow you.

28
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,028
There's something about his face
says he's Jacobs...

29
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,828
but maybe he ain't.

30
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,199
Look, Jack, I'm lost.

31
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,198
You remember Jacobs, don't you?

32
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,953
Yeah, he's the biologist.
Works for Prof. Deemer.

33
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,473
Met him a couple of years ago.

34
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,518
He's over at the undertaker's.
You'd better have a look.

35
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,559
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.

36
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,437
I phoned Deemer right away.

37
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,715
He said he'd be over to see if this is him.

38
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,199
You know Deemer, don't you?

39
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,431
Yeah. When I opened my office
I went out to pay my respects.

40
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,839
He was polite enough...

41
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,480
but I had the feeling I wasn't welcome,
so I never went back.

42
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,199
Some of these big brains
never learnt manners.

43
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,793
Here he is, Barney.

44
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,279
- Hi, Doc.
- Hello, Barney.

45
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,555
You figure this one out and you're good.

46
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,835
Now you know why I'm not sure.

47
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,756
That's not Jacobs.
This man has had the disease for years.

48
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,988
I saw Jacobs last month.
He looked okay then.

49
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,991
BARNEY: They're in the back room,
Professor.

50
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,514
It's Eric, all right.

51
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,555
He was my friend for 30 years.

52
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,917
SHERIFF: You better come outside,
Professor.

53
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,109
Yes.

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,319
- You all through in there?
- Yeah.

55
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,356
Leave us alone for a minute,
will you, Barney?

56
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,873
Yeah, sure.

57
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,313
Professor, I have to know all about it.

58
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,593
Why he looks that way, why he was missing.

59
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,999
Sheriff, have you ever watched...

60
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,958
a friend dying before your eyes
and not been able to help?

61
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,119
That's the worst of it.

62
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,874
Being helpless.

63
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,035
It's particularly tough
when you're a physician...

64
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,678
and you know what's wrong with him.

65
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,150
And there isn't a single solitary thing you
or anyone else can do.

66
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,238
When I saw the body,
I though it was acromegalia.

67
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,594
But that's not possible.

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,033
Acromegalia?

69
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,830
The pituitary gland goes haywire, Jack.

70
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,354
It distorts the face, neck, hands, and feet.

71
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,668
I met Jacobs a couple of years ago
at your place.

72
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,396
The sheriff saw him about a month ago.
He looked normal then.

73
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,752
It is acromegalia.

74
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,988
But in every case I've ever heard of...

75
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,150
it's taken years to produce the deformity.

76
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,354
I know.

77
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,911
The history of medicine
is the history of the unusual.

78
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,758
Perhaps Eric had been ill for years.
Who knows?

79
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,515
But it was only four days ago that
he began to complain of muscular pains.

80
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,353
Neither of us thought too much about it.

81
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,239
These things happen as you grow older.

82
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,993
And the next morning he began to...

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,879
To change.

84
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,513
Maybe we'd better do an autopsy
just to make sure.

85
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,272
I don't think that'll be necessary.

86
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,669
I was in attendance,
and I signed the death certificate.

87
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,749
I see.

88
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,957
How come we found him on the desert?

89
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,508
Dr. Jacobs became delirious last night.

90
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,397
Broke out of the house
and ran into the desert.

91
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,950
Are you certain he hadn't complained
of anything before that time?

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,554
There's nothing I can add
to what I've already said.

93
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,999
Eric had no family.
I'll arrange for the funeral.

94
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,871
Thank you for calling me so promptly.

95
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,996
- Goodbye, Dr. Hastings.
- Professor.

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,115
Acromegalia.

97
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,077
- You heard the man.
- I sure did.

98
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,470
A young fellow like you can't stack
what he knows against the professor.

99
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,755
The trouble is, Doc,
you hate to admit you're wrong.

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,752
We all make mistakes, Jack.
This isn't one of mine.

So you escaped the fire?

Let me see those paws.

Come on, Coco.

You've got that look

If there's anything a man hates...

120
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,478
it's to be told he's wrong
when he knows he's right.

121
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,994
I knew Deemer had burnt your tail.

122
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,953
Listen, I'm just a country doctor,
but I know what I know.

123
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,830
And I know acromegalia doesn't turn up
in four days out of left field.

124
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,955
So?

125
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,077
So I went to the medical library in Phoenix
and read up on it.

126
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,999
There wasn't one single recorded case
in medical history...

127
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,152
where a malformation developed as fast
as Deemer said Jacobs' did.

128
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,038
- You mean he was lying to us?
- I don't know.

129
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,997
But I'd like to know why
he was in such a hurry to bury Jacobs...

130
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,150
and why he didn't want me to do
an autopsy.

131
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,870
The man's an M.D. Like you.
He's entitled to his opinion.

132
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,192
Or do you want me to charge him
with confusing a country doctor?

133
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,758
There's nothing like the safety of prestige,
is there, Sheriff?

Let's skip it.

Everything's clean and legal...

136

to stick your neck out for anything.

Pinch him because I don't like the way
he parts his hair?

139
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,150
Have you ever asked yourself
what Deemer and Jacobs...

140
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,514
were working on in their lab?

141
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,996
No, and I don't intend to jimmy open
a window to find out, either.

142
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,554
Deemer's speciality is nutrient biology.

143
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,551
Jacobs is a leader in the same field.

144
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,075
Now when two big shots like that
get together...

and hole up in the desert,
20 miles from civilization...

146
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,031
I'd say they might
be working on something...

147
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,554
they're not too anxious to talk about.

148
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,956
You think whatever they might be doing
ties in with what killed Jacobs?

- I forgot to tell him about Jacobs.

158
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,918
Only what I haven't found out for myself.

159
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,434
I sneaked a look at the death certificate
over at Barney's.

160
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,795
Got the personal dope on him
out of Who's Who.

161
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,759
How often does this acromegalia occur, Doc?

162
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,157
Not very.
First time I've seen it, as a matter of fact.

163
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,073
BURCH: My dictionary says it's chronic,
it doesn't mention death.

164
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,318
Well, death doesn't usually come
from the disease itself.

165
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,078
It's caused by suffocation.

166
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,758
What do you mean, suffocation?

167
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,390
The tongue becomes enlarged.
The throat, the thorax, the heart...

168
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,357
everything gets pushed out of place.

169
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,030
What do you think
Deemer's been working on out there?

170
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,917
MATT: That I'd like to know.

171
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,629
I'll hop out with Ridley, grab a couple
of pictures, and see what I can find out.

172
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,914
By the way, Doc...

173
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,549
how long had Jacobs been dead when
our friend here remembered to call you?

174
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,200
- Will you lay off?
- Eight or ten hours.

175
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,555
Thanks, Doc.
I'll be sure to spell your name right.

176
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,631
As for your friend,
it might just slip my mind...

177
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,439
to support him the next time he comes up
for election.

178
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,192
Say, that's a good idea, Jack.
Him going out to Deemer's.

179
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,598
Joe will get him so riled up with questions,
he may take to me.

180
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,436
If you go into the hotel, miss,
they'll tell you the best way to get there.

181
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,919
Thank you.

182
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,350
I wonder if you might tell me the best way
to get out to the Deemer place?

183
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,590
- It's about...
- I know where it is.

184
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,557
Is there a bus or cab available?

185
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,950
Well, yes, but there won't be any buses
through anymore today.

186
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,432
Then would you mind calling a cab for me?

187
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,114
I wouldn't mind it a bit.
But it wouldn't do no good.

188
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,515
Because Jasper, you see, it's his cab.

189
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,592
He's out at the Bar Six
and won't be back for a couple of hours.

190
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,033
Maybe longer.

191
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,478
Well, what'll I do?

192
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,509
Sit down and wait. That's all you can do.

193
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,039
Thank you.

194
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,191
You ain't come through here before,
have you?

195
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,554
No.

196
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,311
Didn't think I'd seen you.

197
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,595
You any kin to this man, Deemer?

198
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,593
No, I'm not.

199
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,035
He any kin to you? Oh, no.

200
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,436
- I don't suppose that...
- I doubt it.

201
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,714
Me, too.

202
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,069
[Door opening]

203
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,555
Josh, I'm expecting a call from Dan Simon.

204
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,312
Switch it to the Deemer place, will you?

205
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,719
You going out there?

206
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,109
- Just leaving.
- Take her with you.

207
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,314
Well, you see,
I was asking how to get out there, but...

208
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,118
Well, I wouldn't want to impose on you.

209
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,679
He won't mind.

210
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,278
No, I'd be glad to drive you.

211
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,828
- Well, if you're sure.
- Are these yours?

212
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,669
Hey.

213
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,628
Ain't you two going
to introduce yourselves?

214
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,869
- No.
- No.

215
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,430
Getting to be a fast world.

216
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,508
Think it's about time?

217
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,717
- Dr. Matt Hastings.
- Stephanie Clayton. "Steve."

218
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,233
I like Steve.

219
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,880
I'm really indebted to you,
Dr. Hastings, for this ride.

220
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,349
Or rather, I'm indebted to your friend Josh.

221
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,748
So am I.

222
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,394
I guess it's none of my business asking why
you're going out to Deemer's place, but...

223
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,595
Why not?

224
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,716
I'm doing graduate work in biology.

225
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,631
The professor teaches it, or he did.

226
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,593
I knew it would happen.

227
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,951
Give women the vote and what do you get?
Lady scientists.

228
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,511
Well, student so far.

229
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,195
You see, I wrote a paper on the nutritional
aspects of expanding populations...

230
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,113
and Prof. Jacobs read it
and offered me a job for the summer.

231
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,952
How about a place to live?

232
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,759
There are a couple of nice boarding houses
in Desert Rock.

233
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,195
- Cost less than a hotel.
- Well, no.

234
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,998
I'm going to stay at the professor's.

235
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,911
You see, it's all part of my contract.

236
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,629
I'll be laboratory technician, cook, student.
The whole works.

237
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,189
I see.

238
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,998
Well, it's one way of earning a master's.

239
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,834
And it's worth it working with people
like Deemer and Prof. Jacobs.

240
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,276
- How well did you know Eric Jacobs?
- I've never met him.

241
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,512
He just read the paper and liked it,
and that was that.

242
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,113
He's dead.

243
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,152
Died yesterday morning.

244
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,274
How?

245
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,350
Glandular condition called acromegalia.

246
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,678
Acromegalia? Isn't that a very rare disease?

247
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,113
Extremely.

248
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,073
Are you sure it was that?

249
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,677
No, I'm not sure at all.

250
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,595
He has a wonderful lab here.
One of the best.

251
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,877
Looks like nobody's home.

252
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,753
There must be someone.
That's Joe Burch's car over there.

253
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,675
Might as well.

254
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,829
The electric panel shorted.

255
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,150
And, well, you can see for yourself.

256
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,750
You estimated the amount of damage yet,
Professor?

257
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,797
The greatest damage, of course,
was to the work that was destroyed.

258
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,108
Let's get back to Jacobs.

259
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,270
- Why did he leave...
- I've told you all there is.

260
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,232
Will you gentlemen excuse me?

261
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,792
One more picture.

262
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,836
- Pat the monkey, Professor.
- I said that was all.

263
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,592
I think that ought to be enough, Joe.

264
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,797
- Professor's had a rough couple of days.
- Yes. Thank you, Dr. Hastings.

265
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,191
Thanks for the story, Professor.
I didn't mean to add to your troubles.

266
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,395
Come on, Ridley.

267
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,232
- See you later, Matt.
- See you, Joe.

268
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,956
I thought I'd never get rid of them.

269
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,271
You must forgive an old man.

270
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,753
- Have I met you before, miss?
- No.

271
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,594
This is Stephanie Clayton.
It seems Prof. Jacobs wrote for an assistant.

272
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,558
- She's it.
- Yes, Eric told me you were coming.

273
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,391
But I didn't expect to see a biologist
that looked like you.

274
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,956
That was intended as a compliment.

275
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,476
- I'm afraid I've gotten a bit rusty.
- Well, thank you, sir.

276
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,395
Well, I don't know that you'll want to stay on
with all that has happened...

277
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,198
You're welcome to, of course.

278
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,708
But Eric...

279
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,712
I know. Dr. Hastings told me on the way out.

280
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,229
I see.

281
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,475
Well, with Eric gone, I'm alone.

282
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,073
I'm sure I can be of service.

283
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,390
I mean,
if you're going to continue with your work.

284
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,758
Yes, indeed. For Eric's sake, if nothing else.

285
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,395
Wasn't Paul Lund working with you,
Prof. Deemer?

286
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,515
Paul...

287
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,272
STEVE: Yes, he was studying
for his doctorate...

288
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,395
when I was a freshman.

289
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,597
STEVE: I'd heard he came here.
DEEMER: Yes, of course.

290
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,911
Paul Lund. No, he's not with us anymore.

291
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,389
Well, come now, Miss Clayton.
Let me show you my lab.

292
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,631
- Are you interested at all, Doctor?
- Yes, of course.

293
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,628
I've put all I own into this.

294
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,319
It's my life.

295
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,798
Everything that I have and care for is here.

296
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,753
Unfortunately, part of it has been destroyed.

297
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,555
I see.

298
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,191
What's in the vial, Professor?

299
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,475
DEEMER: A nutrient.
STEVE: You mean a synthetic?

300
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,519
DEEMER: A completely nonorganic
food concentrate.

301
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,477
Medicine has lengthened the life span,
and people live longer.

302
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,358
But the food supply remains fairly static.

303
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,512
World population is increasing
at the rate of 25 million a year.

304
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,277
An overcrowded world.

305
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,115
That means not enough to eat.

306
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,995
The disease of hunger,
like most diseases, well, it spreads.

307
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,914
There are 2 billion people
in the world today.

308
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,556
In 1975 there will be 3 billion.

309
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,839
In the year 2000,
there will be 3 billion 625 million.

310
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,510
The world may not be able to produce
enough food to feed all these people.

311
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,918
Now perhaps you'll understand
what an inexpensive nutrient will mean.

312
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,719
Well, not many of us look that far
into the future, sir.

313
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,357
Our business is the future.

314
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,836
No man can do it on his own, of course.

315
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,718
You don't pull it out of your hat
like a magician's rabbit.

316
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,997
Well, you build on what hundreds of others
have learnt before you.

317
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,837
I thought that synthesis was impossible
without a bonding agent...

318
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,478
to hold everything together.

319
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,914
And we use the simplest of all: The atom.

320
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,319
Let me show you.

321
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,072
MATT: That's an isotope, isn't it?
DEEMER: A radioactive isotope.

322
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,874
DEEMER: Ammoniac.

323
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,748
- And that's what binds your solution?
- Binds it and triggers it.

324
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,276
Using it, Eric's dream and mine
may be a reality before...

325
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,839
[Telephone ringing]

326
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,189
Excuse me.

327
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,429
Hello?

328
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,115
Yes.

329
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,874
It's for you, Doctor.

330
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,828
Thank you.

331
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,754
Hello? Hi, Josh.

332
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,549
Of course.

333
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,108
Call her back.
Tell her I'll stop by on my way home.

334
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,515
Bye.

335
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,352
Sorry to break this up.

336
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,393
Thanks for the tour, Professor.

337
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,072
Maybe one of these days
you'll invite me back.

338
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,718
Why, yes, of course.

339
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,313
Professor, I...

340
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,476
I'm still puzzled by the speed with which
Jacobs' malformation developed.

341
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,754
Can you explain it?

342
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,796
Eric is dead and he shouldn't be.

343
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,548
But the cause was acromegalia.
Nothing else.

344
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,674
It seems such a deviation
from the classic cases.

345
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,516
You're being very diplomatic, Doctor.
Why don't you speak up?

346
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,391
Don't you think, sir,
this time you might be wrong?

347
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,119
In this case, no.

348
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,676
You want to do an autopsy. Why don't you?

349
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,035
- Well, you objected.
- I was upset.

350
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,790
Eric was not only my colleague,
he was my closest friend.

351
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,278
- You have my permission.
- Well, thank you, sir.

352
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,277
I'll let you know what I find.

353
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,715
And please, don't forget to invite me back?

354
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,758
- Well, now I'll show you to your quarters.
- All right.

355
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,310
MATT: That you, Jack?
SHERIFF: How're you coming?

356
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,277
MATT: Be right with you.

357
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,234
What you got?

358
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,029
I'll give it to you fast, Jack. Nothing.

359
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,118
Nothing?
You mean the professor was right?

360
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,313
Couldn't have been more right.

361
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,549
Well, how do you like that?

362
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,030
You make a big thing out of it, show Deemer
up for maybe a murderer and then...

363
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,031
You want me to go ahead
with the interment, Jack?

364
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,829
You might as well before this amateur
gumshoe gets any more bright ideas.

365
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,953
The case is closed.

366
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,791
And the next time I need a doctor,
I'll call one in from Phoenix.

367
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,000
You know,
I don't think Jack's too happy about all this.

368
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,752
I don't blame him.

369
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,671
But I still can't figure it out.

370
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,230
Slowly, slow.

371
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,229
That's good.

372
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,959
Take your time, Steve, take your time.

373
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,310
We have nothing except time.

374
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,750
And we won't have that
if we make a mistake.

375
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,315
There.

376
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,956
- Am I doing all right, Professor?
- Fine!

377
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,000
Now lift the lid onto the vial.

378
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,073
DEEMER: Easy.

379
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,477
That's it. Now lift up the graduated glass...

380
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,916
and put it in the access chamber.

381
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,558
Well done, Steve.

382
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,751
Now lift up the chamber.

383
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,474
That's it.

384
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,833
Now we'll take this into the dry box...

385
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,434
where we can handle it safely.

386
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,037
You're getting quite expert at this.

387
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,190
I don't know what I'd do without you.

388
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,510
Now let's see how we make out.

389
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,232
It's one thing to develop a formula on paper,
another to make it work.

390
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,438
DEEMER: So far we've found an almost
consistent instability in the material.

391
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,353
One batch of nutrient varies sharply
from the next.

392
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,476
What do you want to try it on this time?

393
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,718
One of the baby rats?

394
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,274
Okay.

395
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,949
How long before we know anything,
Professor?

396
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,237
Well, there have been times
when the instability has caused death.

397
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,072
I meant, if it works.

398
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,799
Let me show you.

399
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,316
- You see that rabbit?
- Yes.

400
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,991
How old would you say he was?

401
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,673
STEVE: Four months.

402
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,589
DEEMER: Look at the chart.

403
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,353
Six days!

404
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,269
Is it normal?

405
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,591
I ran a reflex test on him
after you went to bed last night.

406
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,557
The only difference between him
and the others...

407
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,359
is that he's healthier and stronger.

408
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,034
All the same,
we mustn't be in too much of a hurry.

409
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,793
We've got to lick this problem of instability.

410
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,557
Once we can control that,
we're ready for the ultimate test: On humans.

411
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,037
There mustn't be a mistake this time.

412
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,759
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- All right, Steve.

413
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,308
Science is science,
but a girl must get her hair done.

414
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,868
You'd better hurry though,
if you're going to catch that bus.

415
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,996
- It only stops on signal, you know.
- I know.

416
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,672
- Anything I can get for you?
- No, thanks.

417
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,637
We'll run those tissue tests
when you come back.

418
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,836
- Right.
- Have fun.

419
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,353
Have the prescription refilled
and be sure she takes it after every meal.

420
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,876
Okay, Doc, but you know women.
Mary will just let it sit on the shelf.

421
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,235
Yeah, but she'll feel better
knowing it's there, won't she?

422
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,435
Yeah, I suppose so.

423
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,829
Say, when are you and me flying out
for some more fishing?

424
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,229
- It's been four or five weeks since...
- Excuse me, Jim.

425
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,309
Steve!

426
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,715
- Carry your books, miss?
- Thanks!

427
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,235
I haven't been walked to school
in a long time.

428
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,556
Hey, you dress up our town very nicely.

429
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,517
If you don't look out,
the Chamber of Commerce...

430
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,275
is going to list you
in their publicity with the local attractions.

431
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,119
Say, do you have to go right back?

432
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,989
No.

433
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,913
- Good, let's skip school.
- All right.

434
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,992
It's like an oasis.

435
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,908
- I bring all my patients here.
- I'll bet.

436
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,191
- How's this?
- Fine.

437
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,234
Not now, thanks.

438
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,632
How are you getting along with Deemer?

439
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,551
Half the time he doesn't know I'm there...

440
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,108
and the other half
he's worried I'll make a mistake.

441
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,475
- He's quite a guy, I guess.
- Yes.

442
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,799
Has he said anything more
about that assistant that left?

443
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,269
No.

444
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,791
How's the nutrient coming along?

445
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,678
Well, this is the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

446
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,872
How long does it take an ordinary rabbit
to reach full growth?

447
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,754
I don't know. Four or five months, I guess.

448
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,593
He has one there that's reached maturity
in six days.

449
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,111
- Six days?
- I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's true.

450
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,191
It's still so new and unpredictable.

451
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,555
There are all sorts of things
to take into account...

452
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,200
before we can even think
of experimenting on humans.

453
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,159
Some of the nutrient, when unstable,
has even been deadly.

454
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,429
But we do know that it's kept animals alive
that have been fed nothing else.

455
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,679
If I stay here much longer
I'm going to miss my bus.

456
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,433
Who can ask for a better opening?
I'm at your service, miss.

457
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,636
Are you sure your patients can spare you?

458
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,950
I'm such a good doctor, they never get sick.

459
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,437
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right.

460
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,272
No wonder you love the desert.

461
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,032
It's so beautiful.

462
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,711
Everything that ever walked or crawled
on the face of the earth...

463
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,438
swum the depths of the ocean...

464
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,159
soared through the sky
has left its imprint here.

465
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,394
Look.

466
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,675
Did you ever wonder
what piled them up like that?

467
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,637
Wind? Water? What?

468
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,231
I've never seen anything quite like it.
Can we stop?

469
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,469
Sure.

470
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,030
STEVE: All this was once an ocean,
wasn't it?

471
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,833
You can still find seashells
if you keep your eyes open.

472
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,912
- What's that?
- I...

473
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,629
- There he is.
- It scared me.

474
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,998
I'm beginning to see now
why you love it here.

475
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,473
Catching, huh?

476
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,955
I think I'll have that cigarette now.

477
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,993
Thank you.

478
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,999
You know,
it must look out of this world from the air.

479
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,833
- I'll show it to you sometime.
- Will you really?

480
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,759
What does it look like?

481
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,274
Like something from another life.

482
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,391
Serene, quiet, yet strangely evil...

483
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,996
as if it were hiding its secret from man.

484
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,277
You make it sound so creepy.

485
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,952
The unknown always is.

486
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,552
- Whatever could have started it?
- I don't know.

487
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,953
Well, I think I've had enough
of the unknown for one afternoon.

488
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,154
Something must have started it.

489
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,989
You can't second-guess the desert.

490
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,198
Rocks that have stayed for 1,000 years,
they just move.

491
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,711
There's no figuring it.

492
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,596
Well, the bus would have gotten me here
sooner, but I certainly enjoyed it.

493
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,717
- Give my best to the rabbits.
- Would you like to see them?

494
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,631
Now you're talking.

495
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,715
You can put them right there.

496
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,636
It's funny he's not here. Maybe he's resting.

497
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,393
- Do I get the guided tour?
- Follow me.

498
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,875
It wasn't like that when I left!

499
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,955
MATT: Are you sure it's the same one?

500
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,268
STEVE: Yes.

501
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,270
We injected a baby rat this morning.
Let's take a look at it.

502
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,349
MATT: This morning?
STEVE: It was a baby.

503
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,399
Matt, I tell you, this morning it was a baby.

504
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,119
And it doubled in size in a few hours?

505
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,316
Matt, you do believe me?

506
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,033
Of course I do.

507
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,838
[Telephone ringing]

508
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,629
Hello?

509
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,472
Yes, he's here. Just a minute.

510
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,358
It's your office.

511
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,949
Thanks. Hello?

512
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,559
Yeah, Josh.

513
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,951
I'll stop by on my way home. Thanks. Bye.

514
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,553
I've got to go.

515
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,035
That's one of the penalties
of being a doctor.

516
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,634
I never seem to find time
to finish a conversation.

517
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,438
What do you make of that baby rat?

518
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,953
I don't know.

519
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,918
Freaks of any kind give me the willies.

520
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,719
Well, I've heard of giantism,
but I've never seen it produced.

521
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,394
Why don't you have Deemer ask me out
in the next day or so.

522
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,755
- I'd like to discuss it with him.
- I will.

523
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,673
Besides,
it'll give me a chance to see you again.

524
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,239
Or don't I need an excuse?

525
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,039
- Now, what do you think?
- I'll call you.

526
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,718
My laboratory is not open to the public,
Miss Clayton.

527
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,633
Explain why you brought Dr. Hastings here.

528
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,280
- Sir?
- Dr. Hastings.

529
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,957
Will you please explain
why you brought him here?

530
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,476
He's very interested in your work,
sir, and I thought it'd be all...

531
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,916
Were you in the habit of conducting tours
at Owens University?

532
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,638
No, sir, but I thought it would...

533
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,359
Bringing him here
was a breach of my trust in you.

534
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,513
Experimental research is always confidential
be it here or anywhere else.

535
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,114
You didn't tell me it was confidential.

536
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,236
I didn't think I'd need to.

537
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,238
Professor, your face.

538
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,357
- That will be enough, Miss Clayton.
- Yes, sir.

539
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,990
- Boy, you got nerves. Simmer down.
- Where did you come from?

540
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,436
I was on my way to old Andy Andersen's
when I saw your car.

541
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,192
What are you doing here?

542
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,510
There was a landslide an hour or so ago.

543
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,558
- Came back to see what caused it.
- This is one of those days.

544
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,200
Old Andy called me in a sweat
and said to come a running.

545
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,157
Couldn't figure out
what he was yakking about...

546
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,595
but it seems like
something was eating his cattle.

547
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,750
- Eating them?
- Say...

548
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,072
He had sunstroke a couple of years back.
You don't suppose...

549
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,233
No, there must be something to it.
Said he had a stack of bones to show me.

550
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,709
You wouldn't like to come along,
would you?

551
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,519
You still trust my judgement
after the Jacobs business?

552
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,672
I ain't looking for medical advice, Doc.
Just company.

553
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,510
Glad you finally got here, Sheriff.

554
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,078
Hi, Doc. Didn't expect to see you.

555
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,958
Hi, Andy. Jack met me on the way.
Told me you've been having trouble.

556
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,316
- Yeah, darndest thing ever happened.
- Where's what we came for?

557
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,674
Let's go.

558
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,678
SHERIFF: I never saw anything like it.

559
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,354
No footprints, no blood, no sign of struggle.

560
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,750
The bones just stripped clean,
like peeling a banana.

561
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,270
About noon the boy here came up
from the lower section and found them.

562
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,510
I don't suppose
it could've been mountain lions?

563
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,431
I've ranched here 22 years now, Doc...

564
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,829
and I've had more than my share
of lions and wolves.

565
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,478
It wasn't them.

566
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,753
MATT: Where did that come from?
ANDY: It was there when the boy got here.

567
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,752
Stop worrying about that
and tell me what's picking my cattle clean.

568
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,478
That's all I want to know. What's doing it?

569
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,471
- Take it easy, Andy.
- They're not your cattle.

570
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,632
If it could happen last night,
it could happen tonight, tomorrow night.

571
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,517
It could wipe me out.

572
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,713
Aren't you going to do anything?

573
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,031
I'm up a tree, Andy, like you are.
I don't know where to start thinking.

574
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,031
You got any ideas, Doc?

575
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,869
Better round up what livestock you can
and stand guard.

576
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,951
If you see or hear anything,
ring me at the house.

577
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,110
I'll be there, just in case.

578
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,879
See you, Andy.

579
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,154
Hi, Jack.

580
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,199
Anyone pull through?

581
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,113
You kidding?
I want to show you something.

582
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,273
Morning, Doc.

583
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,398
The Sheriff tells me
you've seen something like this before.

584
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,595
Yeah.

585
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,348
You buying this accident business, Doc?

586
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,512
- Aren't you?
- Nope.

587
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,990
I can't figure it. There isn't a skid mark.

588
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,753
We ploughed through the wreck
and found the brakes still work.

589
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,196
It's just like something grabbed the pickup
and threw it 30 feet off the road.

590
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,271
Take a look at this, Doc.

591
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,436
I can't understand
why I didn't spot this stuff...

592
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,990
when I hauled those skeletons out of here
and stacked them on the other side.

593
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,389
- They were here?
- Yes, sir. Why?

594
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,032
There doesn't seem to be
any distinctive odour.

595
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,115
Wow.

596
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,119
Say, have you got a thermos
or a jar around here somewhere?

597
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,031
I think there's one over here.

598
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,556
- Same stuff we found at Andy's?
- Yeah, I think so.

599
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,710
Well, that makes three then.

600
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,915
Three?

601
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,594
Here, the stuff you saw yesterday,
and Andy's.

602
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,715
Andy?

603
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,234
His wife found him at the corral last night,
dead.

604
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,278
He'd been... Like the cattle and sheep.

605
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,274
There was a couple of gallons of this liquid
beside him.

606
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,476
I wish you'd give me a hand with this yarn,
Doc.

607
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,834
Stuff here I can't handle.

608
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,990
MATT: Maybe there's stuff here
none of us can.

609
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,719
If I were you, Joe,
I'd write this as a straight accident.

610
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,950
If you print anything as vague
as what we've got...

611
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,837
you'll scare half the state to death.

612
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,674
BURCH: News is news, Doc.
MATT: Guess and a half-truth aren't news.

613
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,069
Why don't you hold off
till we nail this down tight?

614
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,310
Maybe then you'll have the biggest story
of your life.

615
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,551
- What have you got, Matt?
- I don't know.

616
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,753
But we've got to keep our minds open
and our mouths shut till we do know.

617
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,353
Here you are, Doc.

618
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,668
Thanks.

619
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,189
Well?

620
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,874
I'm not sure.

621
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,555
It's impossible at this stage
to give you a positive answer.

622
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,437
But it's related to insect venom.

623
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,636
- Insect venom?
- Come off it, Matt.

624
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,836
I know. But it checks.

625
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,195
Acidic content, the whole works.

626
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,990
I'm not sure what kind of insect venom it is,
but...

627
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,877
Look, Matt, I'm willing
to play ball with you...

628
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,996
but there's a limit to what I'll swallow.

629
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,830
Check it yourself, Joe. I'll show you how.

630
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,273
You're having nightmares, Doc.

631
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,794
There's not an insect in the world
with that much venom.

632
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,236
All right, don't take my word for it.
Get someone else to analyse it.

633
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,550
- Who?
- Prof. Deemer.

634
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,552
Hey, that's a good idea.

635
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,710
I'll make a date with him. Take the stuff out.
Okay?

636
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,915
Okay.

637
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,309
- This time don't you forget to let me know.
- I won't, Joe.

638
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,359
Insect venom in the large economy size.
I've heard everything.

639
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,914
Give me Prof. Deemer will you, Josh?

640
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,797
[Telephone ringing]

641
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,034
Hello?

642
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,272
Hello, Matt.

643
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,149
No, I can talk. He's upstairs.

644
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,073
STEVE: I was hoping you'd call. There's...

645
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,000
Matt, I've got to talk to you.

646
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,357
Well, he's sick, Matt, terribly sick.

647
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,274
It's his face and his hands.

648
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,676
Yes. Well, I did.

649
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,672
I asked him to see a doctor,
but he won't do any...

650
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,996
Steve? Steve!

651
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,196
She hung up, Doc.
You want me to try to get her back?

652
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,958
Hurry, Matt!

653
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,753
- Are you all right?
- Something's happened.

654
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,637
He can hardly breathe!

655
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,548
Steve, get me some water, will you?

656
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,149
Don't you think we ought to get him
to a hospital?

657
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,199
There isn't anything they can do for him
we can't do right here.

658
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,670
Give him some water, Steve.

659
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,036
There's nothing you can do, Doctor.

660
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,839
- Don't say that.
- Nothing anyone can do.

661
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,995
Start with Jacobs, Professor.
He was the beginning.

662
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,078
Eric and I spent every waking hour
on this ever since our...

663
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,878
days at Oakridge.

664
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,508
But he was an impatient old man.

665
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,431
He was convinced that...

666
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,713
an occasional failure with the animals...

667
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,635
didn't necessarily mean...

668
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,032
that the nutrient would fail with humans.

669
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,628
Then...

670
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,475
one day when I was in town...

671
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,713
he and Paul...

672
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,872
injected themselves.

673
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,754
When did Jacobs inject himself, sir?

674
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,431
Four days before he died.

675
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,148
Acromegalia developed in four days.

676
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,788
The isotope triggered our nutrient
into a nightmare.

677
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,308
Then...

678
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,196
Paul went crazy and attacked me.

679
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,393
While I was unconscious,
he made sure that I wouldn't survive.

680
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,514
But I...

681
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,716
continued the experiment...

682
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,675
hoping that in the short time...

683
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,115
left to me, I'd be able...

684
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,238
to prove the...

685
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,079
nutrient...

686
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,749
would work.

687
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,830
You should have seen them.

688
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,110
You should have seen them.

689
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,113
You should have seen them before the fire.

690
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,793
They lived on nothing but our nutrient.

691
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,956
A rat eight times normal size.

692
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,712
A guinea pig big as a police dog.

693
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,318
A tarantula...

694
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,838
Lost, all lost.

695
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,511
What about the tarantula?

696
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,674
Burnt.

697
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,433
All burnt.

698
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,831
Let's take him upstairs.

699
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,678
- He'll sleep for a while.
- Is there any hope?

700
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,077
Here's something to relieve the pain.

701
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,071
Give him one when he wakes up.

702
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,957
Where are you going?

703
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,076
Well, the tarantula...

704
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,953
There's something I want to check on.
I'll phone you when I get back.

705
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,837
- Just set it up, Jean. Then you may go.
- Yes, sir.

706
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,639
Well, that was a pretty accurate analysis
you made, Doctor.

707
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,153
Then it is insect venom?

708
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,596
Well, not precisely.
It's from a species called arachnida.

709
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,558
- A spider?
- Well, a tarantula, to be exact.

710
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,156
But I've never seen venom
in such quantity before.

711
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,037
You know,
there's more venom in this test-tube...

712
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,917
than you'll find in 100 tarantulas.

713
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,959
You mean a tarantula that could secrete
that much venom, would be...

714
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,996
100 times larger than normal?

715
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,593
At least that.

716
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,429
What would you say, Doctor,
if I told you I found pools of that venom?

717
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,796
Four and five feet across,
two to three inches deep?

718
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,075
I'd say you'd been having a nightmare.

719
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,357
Or that you're the biggest liar
since Baron Munchausen.

720
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,032
It's a nightmare all right, Doctor...

721
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,509
but not the kind you mean,
and I'm not lying to you.

722
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,068
- The tarantula film is ready, Professor.
- Thank you, Jean.

723
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,754
Now look, I know you didn't fly 200 miles
just for a joke...

724
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,990
but I simply can't believe
all you're telling me.

725
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,230
- Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Jean.

726
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,154
Well, under the circumstances
we might find this interesting.

727
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,351
TOWNSEND: That's the largest of tarantulas,
from South America...

728
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,908
and it's only a foot in diameter
with its legs outstretched.

729
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,992
MATT: I know.
Our Arizona species is even smaller.

730
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,355
TOWNSEND: That's right.
Not more than three inches in size.

731
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,954
Now there it is, coming out of its burrow.

732
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,639
It's got eight legs
and can move faster than you think...

733
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,679
which assures him of a long life.
As long as 25 years sometimes.

734
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,390
That's the spider wasp...

735
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,471
the tarantula's deadliest enemy.

736
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,996
See? The wasp usually wins...

737
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,278
but don't count on it, because the tarantula
doesn't know the meaning of fear.

738
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,548
As you can see,
he'll back down a rattlesnake if he has to.

739
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,755
See?

740
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,599
MATT: They're flesh eaters, aren't they?

741
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,638
TOWNSEND: Yes, and desert beetles
are their usual diet.

742
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,871
Those powerful jaws are strong enough
to pierce a man's finger.

743
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,315
There. The venom is paralysing the victim.

744
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,269
Tarantulas predigest their food by flooding
the wound with a powerful solvent...

745
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,079
so that the flesh can be sucked
into the body.

746
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,798
MATT: That would account for the bones.

747
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,713
TOWNSEND: Dr. Hastings,
your imagination is showing.

748
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,437
So that's it, Doctor.

749
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,877
- How deadly is the venom?
- Not deadly at all.

750
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,997
About as poisonous as a hornet's.

751
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,355
No fun, mind you, but harmless.

752
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,188
The few deaths that have been reported
are the result...

753
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,953
of germs entering the wound
at the time of the bite.

754
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,918
- You make them sound like pets.
- Not pets, Doctor.

755
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,797
Just part of the world about us.

756
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,758
We must accept them as we do
the rest of God's creatures.

757
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,434
Each has a function in its own world.

758
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,912
But what if circumstances magnified
one of them in size and strength?

759
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,470
Took it out of its primitive world
and turned it loose in ours?

760
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,551
Then expect something that's fiercer...

761
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,599
more cruel and deadly
than anything that ever walked the earth.

762
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,836
How about Dr. Hastings' call
to Desert Rock?

763
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,911
I'm afraid I won't be able to get it for you.

764
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,036
The lines are down between Calamite
and Desert Rock.

765
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,714
Be about an hour
before they can resume service.

766
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,314
- How'd that happen?
- I really don't know, sir.

767
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,834
Do you want me to try again
in about an hour?

768
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,911
No. Never mind. Thanks.

769
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,432
ED: Here you are, Jeb.

770
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,391
Going to be a murky night.

771
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,195
Yeah.

772
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,957
ED: Do you think that was lightning we saw
over to the west?

773
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,999
JEB: If it was, it's the first time
I ever seen lightning throw off sparks.

774
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,993
ED: Maybe one of them college boys

[Plane landing]

780
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,713
MATT: I'm at the airport.
SHERIFF: Oh.

781
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,030
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah, yeah.

782
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,951
Jack, we haven't much time.

783
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,349
I want you to round up every available man.
Arm them...

784
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,510
Do what? What are you talking about?

785
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,919
Jack, do as I say.

786
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,673
Notify the State Police to meet you
at the Deemer place.

787
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,149
Notify the State Police? You must be drunk.

788
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,673
No. I haven't been drinking.

789
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,718
- All I want you to do is...
- I know. Just call the State Police.

790
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,233
Please, Jack. Believe me.

791
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,038
All right, I'll do it.

792
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,599
Thanks. I'll see you.

793

[Dramatic instrumental music]

796
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,190
He's coming, Matt, I can see it!

797
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,158
There's Matt's car.

798
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,631
- What's it all about?
- Jack, turn the cars around!

799
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,676
- What for?
- There isn't time. I'll tell you later!

800
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,432
Lieutenant, look!

801
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,877
Jumping Jupiter!

802
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,313
Get those submachine guns!
You boys, get back in the car.

803
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,799
They won't stop it!

804
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,158
Matt, if it follows the highway,
it'll come right into Desert Rock.

805
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,196
NOLAN: Doc, keys in your car?
MATT: Yeah.

806
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,157
NOLAN: Doc and Miss Clayton
are coming with us.

807
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,595
Get in. You boys, try to slow it down.

808
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:08,195
- If you can't, take Doc's car and follow us.
- Yes, sir.

809

[Machine guns firing]

810
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,112
- Come on. Start it, man!
- I can't start it.

811
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,553
Come on, you'll flood it.

That is correct.

815
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,115
You've got at the outside
30 minutes to get everybody out. Over.

MAN: [On radio] Desert Rock will be
cleared in 30 minutes. Over.

Do you think dynamite would stop him?

818
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,470
Get a truck over to Murphy's,
load up all the dynamite he has.

819
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,199
Bring it just north of Devil's Rock.
We'll be waiting for it.

820
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,795
Yeah, dynamite might work.
But what if it doesn't?

821
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,714
You got any other suggestions, Doc?
It'll be light soon.

822
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,109
If we could get a message to the air base
at Sands.

823
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,758
SHERIFF: How are you going to do that?

824
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,991
- Somebody could phone from town.
- Unless the lines are down.

825
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,709
Sergeant, I want you to phone
the commanding officer at Sands Air Base.

826
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,518
Any special instructions, Doc?

827
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,433
Yeah. If the boys have some napalm,
tell them to bring it along.

828
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,957
Sergeant, tell them to load up with napalm,
rockets, anything they've got.

829
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,669
Hurry it up, boys!

830
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,350
- That's the last of it, Mr. Murphy.
- That's it, Joe.

831
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,556
There isn't another stick of dynamite
in the whole town.

832
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,755
Here. Prime them on the way.

833
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,398
- See you later, I hope.
- You will.

834
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,232
All right. Let her roll!

835
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,390
Don't forget to prime them!

836
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,839
NOLAN: Pull her right in here, boys!
Pull her in here.

837
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,993
Right across the road. Come on!
Lend a hand, boys!

838
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,439
Watch it now! They're all primed!

839
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,555
Where do you want this dynamite?

840
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,631
- Across the road.
- Shake it up, boys! Lend a hand!

841
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,234
Watch it now! Put the boxes
right down there across the road.

842
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,072
All right, let's go.

843
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,991
NOLAN: Come on, boys.
Get them down here!

844
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,992
- All right. Here we go.
- Come on, get that dynamite down here.

845
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,674
All right. Beautiful.

846
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,998
- Do you think it will work?
- Dynamite's tricky stuff.

847
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,799
It may blow it up.
It may just blow the highway up.

848
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,836
Doggone, I wish we had some nitro.

849
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,150
I'll have to see that tarantula
before I believe it.

850
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,834
You'll see it, Joe,
and you'll wish you hadn't.

851
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,276
Let's go! Get those wires hooked up.

852
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,153
Here he comes!

853
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,234
Holy cow!

854
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,072
Come on! Get back!

855
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,633
- Let's go!
- Come on.

856
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,073
Get this truck turned around!

857
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,714
Let's go!

858
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,114
Hold it!

859
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,359
We've gotta hurry it up.

860
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,355
Hurry it up.

861
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,589
I got it.

862
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,434
Steady.

863
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,675
Now!

864
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,717
Let's get out of here.

865
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,109
What now?

866
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,394
- I don't know.
- We got to do something.

867
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,755
Biggest story of my life
and I won't get a chance to write it.

868
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,829
[Screaming] Look!

869
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,356
Look, here they come!

870
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,279
Look at them!

871
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,670
All right, Betts.
Fire two rockets on this first pass.

872
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,759
Here goes.

873
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,794
Dropping napalm. Follow in order.

874
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,793
Dump them all.
