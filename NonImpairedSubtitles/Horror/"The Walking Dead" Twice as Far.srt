As with any RPG, tabletop,
electronic, or otherwise,

143
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:18,878
the key to survival
is allowing oneself

to be shaped by the
assigned environment.

145
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,600
In doing so, a broad range
of capabilities are acquired,

146
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,935
allowing one to flip the script
and use said capabilities

147

to shape said environment
for maximum longevity.

You're gonna stay back, got it?

166
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:08,821
(mouths word)

167
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:25,004
Standard pin and tumbler.

168
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,724
Tick-tick-click,
easy peasy.

169
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,475
This the place?

170
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,060
It is indeed.

171
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:40,025
Okay.

172
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:41,777
You about ready
to spill the pintos

173
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,946
on what the hell it is
we're doing here?

174
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,033
Yeah.

175
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,651
Abraham:
Eugene.

176
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,225
We're gonna
manufacture bullets here.

177
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:58,761
<i>I've been chewing
the cud on this</i>

178
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:00,629
<i>for a few days now.</i>

179
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:03,465
<i>The Hilltop's dry,
our supply's finite.</i>

180
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,601
So not only are bullets
vital for defense,

181
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:07,302
but per the law
of supply and demand,

182
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:09,688
a full cartridge is now
the coin of the land.

183
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,723
Making bullets from scratch.

184
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,977
Spent casings, but the
innards are all us.

185
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,479
And by us, I mean me.

186
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:19,982
And you think you can do that...

187
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,734
here?

188
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:25,287
With just this?

189
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,823
Well, the digs will require
a thorough scrubbing.

190
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,911
We'll have to scare up a
hella ton of lead, but, yes.

191
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:37,299
I most definitely almost certainly
think I can do that here.

192
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:40,219
That, my friend,
is some damn fine

193
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:43,555
genuine outside-the-box
thinking.

194

(chuckles)

195
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:48,510
Where do we start?

196
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,479
Well, we should inform Rick,
talk with Olivia,

197
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,015
see what types of ammo would
be most valuable to produce.

198
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:56,018
I'm gonna hit pause so I can
kill that thing behind you.

199
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,854
Pump your brakes, Red.

200
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:00,772
I'm formally calling
dibs on this one.

<i>(walker snarling)</i>

00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:06,578
Well, be my guest.

204
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,863

Strike two.

208
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,608
Why did you--?

209
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,477
I called dibs.

210
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,315
You had zero
authority to--

211
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:44,650
To what?

212
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:45,901
Stop you from dying?

213
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:47,469
I had full control
of the situation.

214
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:51,240
You had better luck picking
up a turd by its clean end.

215
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:54,376
I'm gonna allow you to
apologize for saying that.

216
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:55,911
So how about
you do so right now?

217
00:17:55,913 --> 00:18:00,082
Timmy down there almost
ate your face, dumbass.

218
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:02,334
All due respect, screw you.

219
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,635
Beg your pardon?

220
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,888
Dispatching walkers
is well within my skill set,

221
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,589
so screw you
for suggesting otherwise.

222
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:09,258
Let me get something
straight, all right?

223
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,094
Using your<i> cabeza,</i>
this whole DIY ammo thing,

224
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,346

I could've told her I loved her,

331
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:20,405
but I didn't
because I was afraid.

332
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,741
That's what's stupid.

333
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:26,962
Not coming out here,
not facing my shit.

334
00:30:26,964 --> 00:30:29,147
And it makes me sick

335
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:30,799
that you guys aren't even trying

336
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:33,084
<i>because you're strong
and you're smart</i>

337
00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:35,086
and you're both
really good people,

338
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:36,838
and if you don't wake...

339
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,424
up...

340
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:42,477
and face your...

341
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:50,835
(cocking guns)

342
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:59,077
D:
You drop 'em now!

343
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:08,520
<i>(panting)</i>

344
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:23,852
Well, hell.

345
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:33,002
You got something to say to me?

346
00:31:33,004 --> 00:31:35,004
<i>You gonna clear the air?</i>

347
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:37,723
Step up on that high horse?

348
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:40,559
<i>No.</i>

349
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:43,045
You don't talk much.

350
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:00,262
Still getting the hang of her.

351
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:06,168
Kicks like a bitch, but--

352
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,937
- I should've done it.
-<i> Oh, what's that?</i>

353
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:13,575
Seriously, I didn't
catch what you said.

354
00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:15,911
I should've killed you.

355
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:19,415
Yeah, you probably should've.

356
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:24,420
<i>So, here we are.</i>

357
00:32:24,455 --> 00:32:26,922
<i>Kind of begs
the question, right?</i>

358
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:30,309
Who brought this on who?

359
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:35,197
<i>I mean, I get that you'll just have
to take my word for this, but...</i>

360
00:32:36,534 --> 00:32:39,201
she wasn't even the one
I was aiming for.

361
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:44,873
Like I said, kicks like a bitch.

362
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,627
It's nothing personal.

363
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:52,448
Look, this isn't how we like to
start new business arrangements,

364
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:55,551
but, well, you pricks kind
of set the tone, didn't you?

365
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:57,136
What do you want?

366
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:59,621
D: <i>I'm sorry, darlin', I
didn't catch your name.</i>

367
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:02,508
I'm D, or Dwight.

368
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,327
You can call me either.

369
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:07,930
So?

370
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:09,631
What's your name?

371
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,601
Rosita.
What do you want?

372
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,487
Well, Rosita...

373
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:18,157
it's not what I want.

374
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:21,360
It's what you and Daryl
are going to do.

375
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:24,029
You're going to let us
into your little complex.

376
00:33:24,081 --> 00:33:27,416
<i>It looks like it's just
beautiful in there.</i>

377
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:30,319
<i>And then you're going
to let us take whatever</i>

378
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:32,921
and whoever we want...

379
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:37,593
or we blow Eugene's brains out.

380
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:39,328
<i>And then yours.</i>

381
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:41,563
And then his.

382
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,134
<i>I hope it doesn't
come to that, really.</i>

383
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:47,136
<i>Nobody else has to die.</i>

384
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:50,639
We just try and start with one.

385
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,808
You know...

386
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,111
maximum impact
to get our point across.

387
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:59,848
<i>So what's it gonna be?
You tell me.</i>

388
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:03,185
You wanna kill someone,
you start with our companion

389
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,321
<i>hiding over there
behind the oil barrels.</i>

390
00:34:06,323 --> 00:34:09,558
He's a first-class a-hole and he
deserves it so much more than us three.

391
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:18,500
Go check it out.

How is he?

416
00:37:21,943 --> 00:37:23,013
Bullet just grazed him,

You found it.

Do you apologize
for questioning my skills?

I apologize

You know how to bite
a dick, Eugene.

<i>Could be 30 years for us here.</i>

That's still too short.

Come inside.

You were right.
