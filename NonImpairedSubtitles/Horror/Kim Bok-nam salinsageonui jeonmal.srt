1
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,294
The story of the week

2
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,097
Oh...

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,604
Here it goes

4
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:47,612
5 years ago, when I was 21...

5
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,516
Becoming a vegetarian
was a major trend

6
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:58,717
So I went on a vegetarian
camp for four days

7
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,319
As soon as we arrived,
we took a walk

8
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:07,025
The guide pointed to
a clover and said...

9
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,935
'We can eat this' and ate it

10
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:16,339
Then a few people tried it

11
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,742
It tasted strange and bitter

12
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,146
But we thought it was
a good experience

13
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,344
But they wouldn't
give us any food

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,650
When we asked at night
why there's no food...

15
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,054
He said, 'Didn't you eat
the plants during the walk?'

16
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,460
- Who? Who?
- What?

17
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,461
The darn guide said!

18
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,763
'Didn't you eat the grass
on our walk?'

19
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:51,974
Let go!

20
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,782
Help me!

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,894
BEDEVILLED

22
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,589
How many times did I tell you?

23
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,598
Low-income families can
get up to $30,000

24
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,794
But you have no income,
so the maximum is $20,000

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,998
But you said I could
I already moved

26
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,906
That was the maximum

27
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,207
Anyway, we can't lend you $30,000
so borrow it from someone

28
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,713
If I could, why would
I ask for a loan?

29
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,112
Then move to a different place

30
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:35,621
But I paid the deposit
and moved my stuff in!

31
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,521
So, try borrowing
from someone else

32
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,526
Who'd lend money to
a single, old woman!

33
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,722
You should've made sure
before signing the lease

34
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,231
But you said I could
have the money!

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,029
I never said that!

36
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:54,932
Ma'am

37
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,242
Hello? Stop calling, please

38
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,650
I'll be out for a sec
If the manager asks for me...

39
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,761
Please leave now, ma'am

40
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,660
Next Counter Please

41
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,464
I'm working

42
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:31,169
Sorry, but you're
always so busy

43
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,475
And you never write back
Can't you come fora visit?

44
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,980
I gotta go

45
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,187
They can't see me for sure?

46
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,289
Of course Strictly confidential

47
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,890
They look about right

48
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,090
You're right

49
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,994
Excuse me?

50
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,507
The victim's friends saw them
bothering her at a nightclub

51
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,708
Isn't that all you need?

52
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:08,508
But they didn't witness the assault
That's why we need your statement

53
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,914
But, I didn't get a good
look at their faces

54
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,016
Just try to remember

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,319
It's them, but we have no proof

56
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,619
Sergeant Choi!

57
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,121
Sorry, ma'am

58
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,130
- He doesn't have the ring
-A ring?

59
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:33,639
Yes One of them had
a ring with a skull on it

60
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,838
The doctor said it
looked like a ring, too

61
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,746
But it's hard to tell the shape
on multiple wounds

62
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:44,840
Don't contact me anymore

63
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,545
- But if you remember...
- Then I'll call you

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,951
But unlikely

65
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:16,372
You bastards!
Why won't you admit it! You did it!

66
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,579
I'll kill all you bastards!

67
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,286
- Please tell me everything!
- Please!

68
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,790
You said you saw them

69
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,192
Please tell me everything!
You saw them!

70
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:39,302
You saw them!
Please, say what happened!

71
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,206
You saw them! Please!

72
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:03,628
Let's not meet again
I got real scary buddies

73
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,631
Fucking up a bitch ain't nothing

74
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,441
- Did they say anything to you?
- No

75
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,140
Would you like to
go inside and talk?

76
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,742
No

77
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,675
-You're back
- She's still here?

78
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:55,874
Everything's set
Have your landlord sign this

79
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:05,289
Thank you very much!
Thank you so much Thank you!

80
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,985
What happened?

81
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,995
-What did you tell the manager?
- I didn't say anything about you

82
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,090
Ji-soo, you talk as if
I made a mistake

83
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,797
Of course not I just
felt so bad for her

84
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:24,400
Are you close with the manager?
Or close with all your male superiors?

85
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,702
Be careful

86
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,307
There's a limit to how far a flirt
can go in the financial world

87
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,531
Ji-soo...

88
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,336
I'm really sorry. A drink tonight?

89
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,438
Ok, let's make up. Where to?

90
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,758
Hello?

91
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,461
Hello!

92
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,023
How about...

93
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,538
Ms CHUNG!

94
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,445
Get out!

95
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,943
Take a vacation

96
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,267
Who is it?

97
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,876
-Who is it?
- The superintendent

98
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,077
- I don't recognize your voice
- I'm a superintendent

99
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,581
What is it?

100
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,389
Your mailbox is way overloaded

101
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,520
On vacation

102
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:37,955
Up until 10 years ago,
boats went in twice a day

103
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,363
Now there are
only 9 people left

104
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,961
Who are you visiting
on Moo-do Island?

105
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,067
My grandfather used
to live there

106
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:57,379
-What was his name?
- Suk-hwan KIM

107
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,987
I knew it! You're Hae-won, right?
I thought it was you!

108
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,991
Remember me?
'Course you don't

109
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,996
You were so pretty back then
Still damn pretty

110
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,294
You married?

111
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,002
Of course you are! I'm not

112
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,257
Hurry! Hurry!

113
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,673
-You're Hae-won, right?
-Yes

114
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,075
Really Hae-won?

115
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,774
Don't touch her with
those dirty hands

116
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,682
Sorry

117
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,588
-You're really Hae-won, right?
-Yes, I'm really Hae-won

118
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,382
It's you! Hae-won!

119
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,085
Well, I'm off

120
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,204
She's here

121
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,105
Who? Kim's granddaughter?

122
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,506
You're Hae-won?

123
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:11,206
It's you alright
You haven't changed a bit

124
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,307
Remember us?

125
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:17,822
So pretty and white
Is it from drinking Seoul's water?

126
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,825
- That's right
- Of course

127
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,223
That's my hubby
Remember? Man-jong

128
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:29,631
That's his brother, Chul-jong
Man-jong and Chul-jong

129
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:35,140
Oh please Don't call 'em
by their names like that

130
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,439
Why'd you come here on vacation?
There's nothing here

131
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,641
City folks like to come for

132
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,550
fresh and water on vacations

133
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,554
This ain't no tourist attraction

134
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,458
-When ya going back?
- I'm staying for about a week

135
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,154
You'll change your
mind in a day

136
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,562
Back to work If it rains,
the potatoes will rot

137
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,159
Aren't ya coming?

138
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,262
Bok-nam, come and help out

139
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,674
After I take Hae-won
to her house

140
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,680
What's Chul-jong and that
old man chewing on?

141
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,476
Don't know?

142
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:22,782
It's called bozo leaf cuz you
become a bozo chewing on it

143
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,411
Here

144
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,613
It's hot, ain't it?

145
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,326
Remember?
We wrote that there

146
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:06,228
Your grandpa got mad like hell

147
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,230
Mama?

148
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,930
Go on Say hello
to mama's friend

149
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,233
Come here
What's your name?

150
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,248
Yeon-hee don't know
how to act around others

151
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,755
What grade is she in?

152
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,256
She's 10, but she
doesn't go to school

153
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,854
I want to send her

154
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:45,461
But Man-jong and his aunt
don't think girls need schooling

155
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,867
Said, if she gets educated,
she'll run away from us

156
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,280
Who doesn't send kids to
elementary school these days?

157
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,282
They even send kids to study
abroad in kindergarten

158
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,783
Really?

159
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,886
I hope I can send her
to school next year

160
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:10,895
She goes to the school
to read books these days

161
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,790
So I was wondering...

162
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,301
It's been 15 years since
grandpa passed away

163
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,395
How's this place so clean?

164
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,507
Take a guess

165
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:32,310
I spent three whole days
cleaning this place

166
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,717
Thanks you were saying?

167
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,322
Huh?

168
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,020
You were going to say
something about Yeon-hee?

169
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,120
It's nothing You just got here

170
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,735
You must be starving
I'll go get some food

171
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,872
I'm going night fishing
with Yeon-hee

172
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,179
- Really?
-Yup

173
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,583
You always come
back empty-handed

174
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,387
You love going
fishing with papa?

175
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,580
- Lazy-head not sleepin'?
-You're back?

176
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,188
Was it fun?
Did ya catch anything?

177
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,302
How can an islander
be so bad at fishin'?

178
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,105
You caught no fish
for over 2 weeks

179
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,205
Why, so you can pig
out if I do catch 'em?

180
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:55,310
Not only me Yeon-hee, you,
and that brother of yours

181
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:08,630
Didn't I tell you to show respect
talking about me and my family?

182
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:15,740
Even dogs and pigs learn
if they get beaten Why not you!

183
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,063
You a dog?
Don't eat on the floor

184
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,809
This is why you need
a man around

185
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,313
Even a dozen women
Can't do that

186
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,315
Damn right

187
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:36,116
Nephew? Can you fix
our shed after this?

188
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,120
Sure

189
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:41,023
- How about our door?
- Sure

190
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,027
Do it yourself

191
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:47,225
My nephew's dying
doing all the work

192
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,323
Damn right

193
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,632
He can't die
Without him, we're all dead

194
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,830
Damn right!

195
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,445
What you doing?

196
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,341
Don't just sit there
Make some noodles

197
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,251
-Yes, ma'am
- Finish that up, first

198
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:10,646
Yes, ma'am

199
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,657
Let her rest,
she must be tired

200
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,956
It's nothing compared
to men's work

201
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,259
What's Kim's granddaughter up to?

202
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,356
Still sleepin'

203
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,969
Damn woman still in bed
in broad daylight

204
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,464
Seoul life must be really hard

205
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,069
A woman's most happy
with a dick in her mouth

206
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:38,674
Still not married and taking vacation?
Stupid little girl

207
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,084
There's lots of women in Seoul
who ain't married

208
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,281
So?

209
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,690
You've been yappin' about
Seoul a lot these days

210
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,995
- It's so good
- Here, have some more

211
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:04,001
All this trouble for me
I'll cook for myself now

212
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,407
It's no trouble

213
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,510
Wanna go take a bath
at the pond?

214
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,016
The pond?

215
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,715
Remember where we used to
go when we were little?

216
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,717
No one will look

217
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,228
People here all sleep
after sundown

218
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,129
I'll go first to do some laundry
Hurry up

219
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,028
- Give me your laundry, too
- It's okay I'll do it

220
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,836
With these hands?

221
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,434
No laundry rooms here, right?

222
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,047
Seoul people do
laundry in rooms?

223
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,744
How strange

224
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,778
Bok-nam!

225
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,080
This island has a lot of fresh water

226
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,884
We even had rice
farms in the past

227
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,809
So clean and white

228
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,818
So smooth and slippery

229
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:09,928
Remember we used to bathe here
at nights when we were kids?

230
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,027
Yeah, the water was
nice and cool

231
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,143
What are you doing!

232
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:25,440
Oh, come on It's just me

233
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,844
Just scared me, that's all

234
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,551
About what?

235
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,455
Nothing

236
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:42,666
Bet ya got men lined up
like flies on a corpse, huh?

237
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:39,923
Phones should work since they set
a base station or somethin' up there

238
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,923
But who knows?

239
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:45,929
The only phone here is
the one at Auntie's house

240
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,806
What ya doing, Uncle?

241
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,320
You like flowers?

242
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,131
What ya doing, mama's friend?

243
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,536
Mama's friend?
Just call me auntie

244
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,337
Auntie?

245
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,741
That's better
Want me to read it to you?

246
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,143
Fold 'em for me

247
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,545
Your mom will be upset
if you fold up your textbooks

248
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,141
Mama gave 'em to
me to fold 'em

249
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,048
What?

250
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,644
All except this one
Social Studies

251
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,748
-Why not?
- Cuz it talks about Seoul here

252
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,777
I wanna get holes
in my ears like you

253
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,679
Why you

254
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,093
I wish my boobs will
grow big like yours soon

255
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:52,082
Scream! Scream bitch!

256
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,924
-What's going on?
- It's nothing

257
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,126
She's here again?

258
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,930
I said scream!

259
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,430
What's going on?

260
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:22,436
Nothing Just foolin' around
Watch Yeon-hee for me?

261
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,946
Stay at auntie's house

262
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:51,266
Hold hands

263
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:54,673
Go on

264
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,587
Tell her to sell our honey, too

265
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,189
Yes, ma'am

266
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,200
How can ya eat
listening to that?

267
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,204
When another bitch is sucking
on your hubby's dick

268
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,211
Look at you
You're eatin' like a damn pig

269
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,455
I'm sorry

270
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:31,571
You're really tanned
Put this on your face It's sunscreen

271
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,769
Don't need your pity

272
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,779
I didn't want to come,

273
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,873
but he paid my boss
three times the rate

274
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,378
I'm sorry Really

275
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,789
Why are you sorry?
You ain't the monster

276
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,688
You'll ruin your body like that

277
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,387
I know-that

278
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,296
What the...

279
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,401
How can you live with him?
I'd run away

280
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,809
Probably kill me if I tried again

281
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,714
Where'd you run away to?

282
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,515
Should've gone to Seoul

283
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,821
No one can find you there

284
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:28,827
Don't even need this Seoul
water will make you white

285
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,630
Then why you living like that?

286
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,041
Wanna run away together?

287
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,347
We'll go to Seoul and work
at restaurants or something

288
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:57,160
But a kid needs her father

289
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:01,358
Who needs that?
I grew up fine without a dad

290
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,159
Oh, right Real fine

291
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,086
Ain't ya fixing dinner?

292
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,594
Hey!

293
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,211
Dumb bitch

294
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:30,244
-What?
- Get the rest of the honey

295
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,053
The boat's coming in tomorrow

296
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,860
-After I cool off the stings
-Why you little!

297
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,876
Put bean paste on it

298
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:06,683
-What the hell you up to?
- Stop cursing

299
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,494
What's with your face?

300
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,692
Just stung by bees

301
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,294
You let your husband
get away with that?

302
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,500
It's just a couple of stings

303
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,503
Not that

304
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,306
Right in front of you!

305
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,817
He had sex with a girl
in your room

306
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,512
and you act like it's nothing?

307
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,516
We keep things to
ourselves here

308
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,723
Not like you're gonna take me in

309
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,534
You need someone
to take care of you?

310
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,530
You're an adult
You should take care of yourself

311
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,854
- Come on
- It's hard

312
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,069
Not too close!

313
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:35,079
5 minutes No, just for
1 minute, please

314
00:38:55,866 --> 00:39:01,702
My baby girl's home
Let's go take a bath

315
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,824
What are you doing?

316
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,630
I wanna be loved by papa, too

317
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,230
You said to try to
get loved by papa

318
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,936
That ain't what I was talkin' about

319
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,445
Where'd you get this?
Did you steal it from that girl?

320
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,951
No

321
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,146
- Then where?
- Gave it to me

322
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,053
The girl gave it to you?

323
00:39:54,725 --> 00:40:00,254
Answer me! Want me to
beat it out of you!

324
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,663
Papa gave it to me!

325
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,060
Why would he give this to you?

326
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:10,266
What about these bunny undies?

327
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,685
Why's the laundry on the ground?

328
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,891
Did you fight? Over this?

329
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,001
Damn girls

330
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:48,507
Put it on All over your body, bitch!
Don't get jealous of the kid!

331
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,214
Let's just give it to your mama

332
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,416
I'll get ya something better

333
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:06,727
Take it and scram!
Get the hell out of my sight

334
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,794
You've been laid off
as per the Employment Law

335
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,199
Manager

336
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,302
The caller you have reached is...

337
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:38,814
Oh, hi

338
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,524
I'm leaving on the next boat
I had a good rest thanks to you

339
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,628
I'm going be a new me
when I get back to Seoul

340
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,134
Though it won't be easy
to change all of a sudden

341
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,448
Thank you for everything

342
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,560
Can I come by often?

343
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,864
What's this? Blood?

344
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,970
It's not blood

345
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,266
Why's this on your face?

346
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,882
- Hae-won...
-What's with you?

347
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,982
- Hae-won...
-What?

348
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:51,388
Can't you take Yeon-hee and
me with you to Seoul?

349
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,895
You can go anywhere you want

350
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,492
But I don't know how
to live on the mainland

351
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:03,902
It's the same Seoul is
scarier to live in then here

352
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:11,210
-You said you'd take me
-When? 15 years ago?

353
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:15,411
Yeah Don't that count as a promise?

354
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:21,024
Next time After I take
care of something first

355
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,620
Next time, again?

356
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:35,932
Fine Then just take
Yeon-hee? Please?

357
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,338
Why Yeon-hee?

358
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,443
Don't ask why

359
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:53,950
Please, I'm begging you

360
00:44:54,525 --> 00:45:02,660
If you take her, I won't call
or write you no more

361
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,066
Oh, come on!

362
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,974
Just tell me If you don't,
I'm not taking her

363
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:32,495
I think Man-jong... must have
screwed... Yeon-hee

364
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:44,602
That makes no sense

365
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:47,605
What?

366
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,112
I know you want
to go to Seoul...

367
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:55,316
But still, how can you say
something like that?

368
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,415
Try a more believable
lie next time!

369
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,324
You think I'm lying?

370
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,729
You know what
the bastards are like!

371
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,830
I don't know anything!

372
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,870
Reading?

373
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,479
Why do you want
your boobs to grow?

374
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:08,491
Don't you know?
That's how girls are loved

375
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,295
Yeon-hee... Does daddy love you?

376
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,399
How does daddy love you?

377
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,900
What ya doing here?

378
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,410
Yeon-hee, come here

379
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,613
You're old enough
to earn your keep

380
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,116
Stop idling around

381
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,119
- Take her and feed her
- Sure thing

382
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,225
- But I need that book
- Let's just go and eat

383
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,734
-You should take the next boat
- There's something...

384
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:05,145
Laws are meant to change
according to circumstances

385
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:09,242
And Bok-nam's damn
good at lying

386
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,549
She grew up like a beggar

387
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:16,150
She'll beg like a dog
to get anything

388
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,955
Then let the police investigate

389
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,762
If you're so sure,
why don't you report it?

390
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:27,269
You know that Yeon-hee is not
Man-jong's real daughter?

391
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:28,767
What?

392
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:34,471
If you're not going to protect this
island, stop worrying and go

393
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,247
Mi-ran? It's me

394
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,245
It's Moo-do Island

395
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:55,958
Remember what you said before?

396
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,653
About going to Seoul?

397
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,685
- Mom
- Quiet

398
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,321
-Where we going? I'm sleepy
-We runnin' away

399
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,919
-Where?
- To the mainland

400
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,431
Papa said the mainland's trouble

401
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,536
-You can go to school there
- I don't wanna go to school!

402
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,128
Then fine
Just go where papa ain't

403
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:19,539
But I like papa I like it here!

404
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,839
So you don't wanna go?

405
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:26,940
- If I don't, you're not going either?
- Of course not

406
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,751
If we don't go now, you'll
get beat all your life?

407
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:37,152
Then I'll go with you mama

408
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,355
Cuz I can't stand
you getting beat

409
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,663
Let's go The boat's comin'

410
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,668
That hurts Not so hard

411
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:56,770
-You crying, mama?
- Never saw mama cry, huh?

412
00:51:56,847 --> 00:52:01,580
No, I heard you cry and say
you'd rather die than live like this

413
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:06,179
-What's good about dying?
- I'm sorry. You're right

414
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:09,589
Rolling in dung is
better than dying

415
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,492
I don't want to roll in dung!

416
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,619
I warned you, not him!

417
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:48,130
No one else would
come here at this hour

418
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,531
Still, not him You stupid!

419
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:57,030
Don't worry I don't care
for people's business

420
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:58,734
Just pay me enough for the boat

421
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,545
Where'd you get this?

422
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:24,666
Oh no! Look!

423
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:28,864
Mama! Hurry! Hurry! Come on!

424
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,668
Let's go now!
Man-jong's coming!

425
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:35,676
Hurry!

426
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,975
Please hurry! He's coming!

427
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,279
I gotta count it!
Shit, I lost my count!

428
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,494
Let's go!

429
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,794
- Hurry!
- Let me count first!

430
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,096
Where's my damn lighter?

431
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,200
Got a light?

432
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:06,106
- Hurry!
- Hurry up!

433
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:14,515
We'll go when I'm done counting
One, two, three...

434
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,916
Sis! Sis!

435
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,617
Sis!

436
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,223
Papa!

437
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,329
- Papa!
- Come here, you bitch!

438
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:40,941
I take in a bitch with a kid!
And you sneak off on me! You bitch!

439
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:42,944
You bitch!

440
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,948
Don't just stand there!
Stop him!

441
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,541
Break her damn legs!

442
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:54,955
Like dogs and bitches who try to run away...
Break 'em so she can't go!

443
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:56,253
Get up!

444
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,756
Stop your brother
She's gonna die!

445
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,060
Papa!

446
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,263
Get up!

447
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,666
Dumb fucking whore!

448
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,973
Warned you to stay away
from people's business!

449
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,775
Stop it, papa!

450
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:21,283
I'll live with you!
Stop hitting her!

451
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:27,789
I treated you good!
And you betray your papa?

452
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,791
Is it cuz I'm not your real dad?

453
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,386
I'll show you how papa
can get real mad!

454
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,598
Are you okay!

455
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,400
Stop it! Not Yeon-hee

456
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,704
Careful, Man-jong!

457
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,907
Are you crazy?

458
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,816
You can't throw stones
at your husband!

459
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:01,123
A woman can get stoned
to death but not a man?

460
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,422
He took you and your kid in!

461
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,121
You should be grateful, bitch!

462
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,721
- Damn right
- Of course

463
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,323
Quit saying that!

464
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:14,837
Why don't I know
who the father is?

465
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,635
I was raped by more
than one bastard!

466
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:23,236
- By every single one of them!
- Shut up! You filthy bitch!

467
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:34,449
- Damn bitch!
- Papa!

468
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:37,959
You damn bitch!

469
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,679
Yeon-hee? Wake up, Yeon-hee!

470
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,889
- Get some water Hurry!
-Yes, sis

471
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,184
Yeon-hee...

472
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,701
Yeon-hee...

473
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:36,518
Yeon-hee... Wake up

474
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:41,021
Let's go to Seoul...

475
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,418
Yeon-hee...

476
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:52,230
Stop fussin' bitch She'll be fine
with some bean paste Move!

477
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,735
Let go!

478
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:59,432
Don't touch her! Let go!

479
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,036
Get away!

480
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,749
Get away!

481
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,784
Thanks for coming all this way

482
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,480
Must be hard taking
care of the elders

483
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,986
Why'd your aunt
call me out here?

484
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:00,001
How's your father doing?

485
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:03,402
He said to say hello
when I said I'm coming here

486
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:08,806
If you told me before,
I would've called a doctor

487
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:15,111
You need a medical report
to file a death these days

488
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:20,417
She just slipped and fell
Ain't no different if a doctor sees her

489
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:24,927
Actually, I can draw up
the report myself

490
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,928
I'm Yeon-hee's grandma

491
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:30,227
If you look at it,
I'm her grandma, too

492
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:36,136
How would I look if you are
suspicious of her death

493
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:41,040
- But her bruises are...
- Bok-nam? Why don't you tell him?

494
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:47,349
If we were lying, would
her mama stay still?

495
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,651
She's quiet
Then, did she kill the kid?

496
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,861
What did you say?

497
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,959
Move for a sec

498
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:09,864
What did you just say?

499
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:18,870
That bastard killed her
He kicked her

500
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,979
She fell

501
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,987
I wasn't gonna say this but...

502
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:33,185
If you're gonna blame me,
I have no choice

503
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:39,999
This bitch here tried to pack up
and run away this morning

504
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:44,597
-Ain't that right?
- Huh? Yes, sir

505
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,905
Were you there too,
when she died?

506
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,918
-You don't believe me?
- Go on I'm listening

507
01:00:55,985 --> 01:01:01,423
I knew she was gonna run away
But she tried to take Yeon-hee, too

508
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,016
I couldn't let that happen

509
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:09,622
So, I told her to leave the kid
and go if she wants

510
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,736
- I even gave her some money
-Yeah right

511
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,535
You never gave me
a dime all these years!

512
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,542
Then where's that money from?

513
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:25,242
I stole it
From that bastard's pocket

514
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,339
Boast why don't ya?
Damn thief!

515
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:33,450
Our nephew's trying to cover up

516
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:37,050
that run-away bitch's sins

517
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:41,256
- He's got a good heart
- Good heart my ass!

518
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,958
-Watch your fucking language
- Man-jong

519
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,968
It's money I made from
the honey, anyways!

520
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,470
Fine... I'm sorry for not
providing you with much

521
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,483
There's not much here for her

522
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:06,488
So I told her to go
and start a new life

523
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,482
But...

524
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:14,196
- But the kid... Not her!
- Man-jong

525
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,189
Let the kid decide

526
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:21,202
So? What did she say?

527
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:27,406
A child would normally
follow the mother

528
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:33,811
But her mama was so mean,
the kid chose the stepfather

529
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:39,014
She held my ankle tight
and begged to stay

530
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,023
But she pulled her away!

531
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:49,725
And fell down Then bumped
her head on a rock

532
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:54,736
God damn it

533
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:59,032
Bok-nam? Is that right?

534
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,546
Then what about
Bok-nam's friend?

535
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,351
Did you see the child die?

536
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,063
No I was sleeping at the time

537
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:38,577
Good work

538
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:43,085
The honey's for you
in the mornings

539
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,383
A big spoonful when you wake up

540
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:49,185
I should save good honey like this

541
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:55,497
Wait Bok-nam's friend said
she's going back, too

542
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,796
Don't worry
You're busy Go on

543
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:02,494
Get the stuff on the boat

544
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:06,804
- No, I'll carry them
- It's okay

545
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,808
-What's this?
- Boat fare It's not much

546
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:32,128
Wait! Wait up!

547
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:40,232
She got something to say to him?
What's her hurry?

548
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,142
No need to hurry
A boat will come tomorrow

549
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:49,241
No more buses to Seoul today

550
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,148
Damn right

551
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:54,155
Bok-nam must be sad
Shouldn't you console her?

552
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,953
Damn right
She could use a friend now

553
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,206
Tell Bok-nam thanks

554
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:56,770
Seoul girls won't stand
you messing with 'em

555
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:03,680
Especially with a witness

556
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,365
- Isn't it dirty?
- Nope

557
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:30,929
You're laughing?

558
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:51,652
Let go!

559
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,051
Man-jong! Get her!

560
01:09:57,126 --> 01:10:00,653
Stupid Dumb bastards

561
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,732
Boat's in

562
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:20,534
Don't slack off and dig up
potatoes before it rains!

563
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,841
Damn bitch
Building a grave in the yard

564
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:26,244
Scram!

565
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:30,146
Or I'll bury you right
next to that!

566
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,955
Chul-jong! Let's go!

567
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,965
Excited to go into
town, Chul-jong?

568
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,764
Move your scrawny ass

569
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:53,364
Come y'all and have a drink

570
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:57,173
So damn heavy Damn it

571
01:11:57,246 --> 01:12:01,080
This is why we need
a man around

572
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,675
They'll be back tomorrow

573
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,877
Stop trembling

574
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:14,090
Bok-nam, take a break will ya?

575
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,190
Sis?

576
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,396
Don't she look a bit crazy? Sis?

577
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,402
Strange if she weren't
after losing her kid

578
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,404
Let her rest for a bit

579
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:27,602
She'd go crazy doing nothing
She'll get over it faster this way

580
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,007
I'm doing her good

581
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,815
- I'll go get some fish
- Really, sis?

582
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,910
- Don't Get all excited
- Okay, okay

583
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:12,248
Damn bitch ain't worth shit

584
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:26,962
How about a song?

585
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:33,668
Oh time, do not come or go

586
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:38,770
My precious youth is gone I'm all old

587
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:44,183
Ari-ari-rang, Ssuri-Ssurirang,
Arari-ga nat-nae

588
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:49,691
Ari-rang Arari-ga nat-nae

589
01:13:49,758 --> 01:14:00,396
Were you born a beauty?
I was born an ugly

590
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:05,805
Ari-ari-rang, Ssuri-Ssurirang,
Arari-ga nat-nae

591
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,707
Ari-rang

592
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:23,580
I stared at the sun for long
and it spoke to me

593
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,955
Said, if I hold back, I'll get sick!

594
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:54,447
Say something!

595
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,747
What's going on!

596
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,862
She's... she's gone crazy!

597
01:20:05,934 --> 01:20:08,869
We need a man...
at a time like this

598
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:13,870
The boat's coming soon
The men will be back

599
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,775
I just have to hang on till then

600
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:43,395
Auntie! Slow down!
You're gonna fall!

601
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,857
Damn whore!

602
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:48,760
Damn you! Damn whore!

603
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:01,475
Stop it, now!
You've done enough!

604
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:18,397
Damn bitch You're dead now
The men are back

605
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:24,196
I came to this island
when I was 15

606
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:27,503
I swam for over 50 years!

607
01:22:28,376 --> 01:22:35,009
You! Stay right here
I'm coming back with the men!

608
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:50,426
- Did you hear something?
- Hear what?

609
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,824
Nothing

610
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:59,235
Go check the hives
See if they're okay from the rain

611
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:03,641
Damn stupid wife probably
left 'em out in the rain

612
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:09,249
-Wanna stay for a drink?
- Sure!

613
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,253
Damn it, Auntie...

614
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:17,848
Should've worn glasses

615
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:31,425
Why were all these potatoes
left in the rain?

616
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,031
Where the hell is everyone?

617
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:39,530
Damn What's that stench?

618
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:41,939
Out of Service

619
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,641
Hey, gramps! Everything okay?

620
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:49,947
Says everything's fine

621
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,453
That man's living long

622
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:56,149
Remember when all
the men died in the storm

623
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,748
except him?

624
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,657
All the women beat him

625
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:03,356
saying he killed their husbands

626
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,764
Then they all took turns taking
him home and feeding him

627
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:09,565
All except my mama that is

628
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:13,368
Your mom took him up the hill
instead of your home

629
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:16,371
Where the fuck is everyone?

630
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,674
-Watch your Damn language
- Sorry

631
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:22,477
Dumbass

632
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:39,392
Respect your elder first
Stupid bastard

633
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,998
I said, give me some water!

634
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:03,020
Watch out!

635
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:06,517
What the hell?

636
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:22,438
You crazy bitch!

637
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:32,445
You crazy bitch!

638
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,575
Should tend to
the funeral offerings...

639
01:26:57,145 --> 01:27:02,674
Why'd you kill them!
Crazy bitch! Why! Why!

640
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:06,679
Why didn't you just kill yourself!

641
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,987
I didn't wanna die

642
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:14,786
Then I should live it up

643
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:20,799
You never opened up to me

644
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:25,601
Treated me like trash
Always cold like a rock to me!

645
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:30,003
That's why my dick never
got hard in front of you

646
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,809
Is that why you
touched my kid? Huh?

647
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,712
Shut your damn mouth!

648
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:44,017
If the cops get me,
I'll tell 'em everything you did

649
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:49,822
Fine

650
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:53,934
Killing you is self defense

651
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:03,140
If you kill her, I'll call the cops

652
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,143
I'll kill you painlessly like a pig

653
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:12,049
What about her?

654
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,748
Make it look like you killed her?

655
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:17,848
Or take her as my new wife?

656
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:18,949
What?

657
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:30,266
Why? Looks like the killer
is scared to die

658
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,268
What would I be scared of?

659
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:45,274
- I'm just sorry to you, honey
- Honey? Crazy bitch

660
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:33,603
Does it hurt?

661
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:40,914
A lot?

662
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:54,124
Hold on I'll put bean paste on it

663
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:13,146
Doesn't hurt now, does it!
Doesn't hurt now! You bastard!

664
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:18,055
You damn son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

665
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:27,865
What the hell? Get up! Hurry!

666
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,484
Let go!

667
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:56,889
The fuck is wrong with this!

668
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,400
Hurry! Hurry up
you dumb bastard!

669
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,596
What are you looking at?
Hurry up you dumb bastards!

670
01:34:04,672 --> 01:34:09,507
I'm the only one here
You crazy, too?

671
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:15,311
Damn crazy bitch Shit! Fuck!

672
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,316
Shit!

673
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:57,452
Hurry! Hurry!

674
01:34:58,225 --> 01:34:59,249
Quick!

675
01:36:04,692 --> 01:36:08,628
Moo-do Island?
At least $100 to go

676
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:13,033
Right now? Be right there

677
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:17,529
Hey, Jang!
Sail over after the game

678
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:22,440
What game? I got nothing I'll go

679
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:25,442
What took you so long?

680
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:37,449
Where you headed?

681
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:48,067
Thinking of going to see Seoul

682
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:50,670
How long since you
been on land?

683
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:52,865
Since I was born

684
01:36:57,144 --> 01:36:59,169
So about 30 years

685
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:04,479
Damn, didn't you go crazy
being stuck there all your life?

686
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:09,079
Do I look sane to you?

687
01:37:17,965 --> 01:37:23,801
Play me a song, why don't you
Then I won't charge you

688
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:09,939
Aren't you getting off?

689
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:43,978
There's a bus to Seoul
on the main road

690
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:48,187
Have yourself a good trip

691
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:52,285
What's this for?

692
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:19,517
There are kind people?

693
01:39:41,108 --> 01:39:42,234
Night Duty Room

694
01:39:45,012 --> 01:39:46,240
Sergeant Seo?

695
01:39:46,714 --> 01:39:49,740
I'll notify headquarters and
check out Moo-do Island

696
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,251
Yes, sir I'll call you from the island

697
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:55,652
Let go of me!

698
01:39:57,424 --> 01:39:58,948
Go away!

699
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:10,329
Hey! Help!

700
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:29,039
Let go!

701
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:06,843
- Play it
-What?

702
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:09,045
Like back then

703
01:43:10,717 --> 01:43:16,656
-What!
- The song you played before

704
01:43:17,724 --> 01:43:21,558
- Don't do this Bok-nam
- Do what?

705
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:24,258
Why are you doing this to me?

706
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:29,864
You're too unkind

707
01:43:31,939 --> 01:43:35,875
Here Go on

708
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:59,051
In the village... if someone
would stop working...

709
01:45:00,327 --> 01:45:02,056
Auntie used to say...

710
01:45:06,833 --> 01:45:08,061
'That's like Bok-nam...

711
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:13,372
not picking out the weeds'

712
01:45:22,849 --> 01:45:25,875
I... can't stand that anymore

713
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:18,755
I wandered today to
the hill, Maggie...

714
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:29,565
To watch the scene below
The creek and the rusty old mill

715
01:49:56,523 --> 01:49:57,956
Please have a seat

716
01:50:06,032 --> 01:50:07,659
It was them

717
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:10,266
You bitch!

718
01:50:11,638 --> 01:50:14,368
You wanna die, bitch?

719
01:51:06,593 --> 01:51:11,530
Dear Hae-won,
I miss you so much

720
01:51:17,804 --> 01:51:19,931
My dear Hae-won,
I miss you so much

721
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:23,737
I need to ask you a favor
You're the only one who can help me

722
01:51:26,312 --> 01:51:28,439
My dear Hae-won
I miss you so much

723
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:32,952
Your friend, Bok-nam
