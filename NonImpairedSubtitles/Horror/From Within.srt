1
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,646
Are you sure you want to do this?

2
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,007
There's just one more
thing I got to do.

3
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,395
What's that for?

4
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,500
Sean, I'm serious. Stop screwing around.

5
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,205
I don't like guns, okay?

6
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,713
Can you just put it away?

7
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,376
You're not going to like this.

8
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,844
Ever notice your reflection's
better-looking than the real you?

9
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,243
What's that?

10
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,440
Your reflection,

11
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,244
it's the same, but different.

12
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,784
I don't know, it's better-looking.

13
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,443
Lindsay, focus, please, the dress.

14
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,782
I don't got all day.

15
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,845
What do you think?

16
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,254
It's too drab.

17
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,020
You're saying that about all of them.

18
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,492
Because they're all too drab.

19
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,755
Well, you got to choose one.

20
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,389
I can't have you showing up to church
in the same damn thing all the time.

21
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,591
And you're showing too much skin.

22
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,724
Here we are, ladies.

23
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,702
This has Lindsay written all over it.

24
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,601
It just arrived yesterday.

25
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,163
It's supposed to be
the new look or something.

26
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,675
That's a proper young lady, right there.

27
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,472
My daughter Natalie is no better.

28
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,107
You should see what she
does with her clothes.

29
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,150
Hacks off the bottom,
cuts off the sleeves,

30
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,241
dyes everything black.

31
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,478
You got to talk to her.

32
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,678
I try.

33
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,986
Come on. Not everyone
can dress the same.

34
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,685
It's not about conformity, Lindsay.

35
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,352
It's about respect for the Lord.

36
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,622
Natalie? Natalie?

37
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,791
Oh, God.

38
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,357
Lock the door, Dad!

39
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,493
Natalie, calm down. Breathe.

40
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,662
Where are you hurt?

41
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,036
It's not my blood. Do you see her?

42
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,540
There's no one out there, Nat.

43
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,973
She was right behind me!

44
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,533
Whose blood is it, honey?

45
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,804
It's Sean's.

46
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,152
He's...

47
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,947
He's dead.

48
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,549
It's okay. Listen.

49
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,786
He shot himself.

50
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,021
Everything's okay.

51
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,461
Just stay calm. Okay?

52
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,931
I'm going to set you someplace safe.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,093
Trish, watch the door.

54
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,336
That's good.

55
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,138
You're doing real good, real good.

56
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,770
All right.

57
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,212
Honey,

58
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,251
you said the blood belonged to Sean.

59
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,184
Did he...

60
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,278
did he try to...

61
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,947
I got to find somebody who knows...

62
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,081
Natalie.

63
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,716
...what he lived.

64
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,032
Did you see her?

65
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,331
I didn't see anyone.

66
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,530
Shut the window!

67
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,938
Shut it!

68
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,579
Who'd you see?

69
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,447
I don't know.

70
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,486
You see something?

71
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,419
No, but she said that...

72
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,820
She's in shock.

73
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,294
She was right there.

74
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,392
She was right behind me.

75
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,703
Can you ask my dad to look, please?

76
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,573
Can you please just
ask him to go and look?

77
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,102
She keeps asking about some...

78
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,246
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

79
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,411
Tear it down.

80
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,853
- No! Please!
- Natalie!

81
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,981
Open the door, honey!
Open the door!

82
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,753
Natalie, open the door,
God damn it!

83
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,995
Open the door.

84
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,655
Daddy!

85
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,799
Oh, no, no, no!

86
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,805
No, Natalie! What have you done?

87
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,613
No. Natalie, no.

88
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,954
Please, no.

89
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,959
It'll be all right. Just...

90
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,727
Lindsay.

91
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,738
You okay? Come on, let's go.

92
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,672
Hi, Sheriff.

93
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,176
Sheriff Cooper.

94
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,237
The girl, she killed herself?

95
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,646
Go home, Aidan.

96
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,911
We learn anything more
about her or your brother,

97
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,384
we'll call you.

98
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,587
I don't know how she could do it.

99
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,720
She saw her boyfriend kill himself.

100
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,889
It was suicide of passion,

101
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:50,561
like Romeo and Juliet.
Juliet drank poison,

102
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,400
not stabbed a pair
of scissors into her neck.

103
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,536
She had this book with her.

104
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,875
I don't know, she wouldn't let go of it.

105
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,209
Whatever.

106
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,215
I mean, she's always
been fucked in that.

107
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:08,276
You've seen her, dressed in leather
like a dominatrix in training.

108
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:13,517
There was so much blood.

109
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,754
God, it sucks you had to see it.

110
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,022
No shit.

111
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,189
Trish is probably
going to make me feel

112
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,495
like the whole thing was my fault.

113
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,161
Screw that.
She's not your real mom.

114
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,104
Okay, like, that gives you
license to ignore her.

115
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,406
What? Come on, it ain't a sin.

116
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,781
I heard Jesus drank wine
every chance he got.

117
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,821
He didn't live with an alcoholic.

118
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,749
Dylan's downstairs.

119
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,701
Hey.

120
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,612
We missed you at Bible class tonight.

121
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,309
Are you kidding me?

122
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,980
Look, Lindsay, it's times like this
when we need the good Lord the most.

123
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,522
Look, bad... No, I'm good.

124
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,559
Bad things happen,
but you got to believe

125
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,287
some good's going to come out of it.

126
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,828
I guess.

127
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,625
See, you don't have to guess.

128
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,858
It's written.

129
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,800
Trials and tribulations
bring people together.

130
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,898
You always know what to say.

131
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,734
I can't help it.

132
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,401
Son of a pastor.

133
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,001
It's in my blood.

134
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,379
Hold on.

135
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,781
I got a little something for you.

136
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,952
Oh, it's stupid.

137
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,496
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

138
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,833
We're closed.

139
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,756
Hello?

140
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:33,520
<i>...the tragedy that has struck here</i>
<i>in these past few days.</i>

141
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,423
<i>According to many who knew her,</i>

142
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,260
<i>Natalie Wilburn was a normal,</i>
<i>happy 17-year-old.</i>

143
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,526
<i>Yet, on this particular morning,</i>

144
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,795
<i>with no apparent warning signs,</i>

145
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,838
<i>this young woman abruptly</i>
<i>took her own life</i>

146
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,533
<i>here in father's clothing store,</i>

147
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,041
<i>apparently as part of a suicide pact.</i>

148
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,941
<i>A few hours earlier,</i>

149
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,707
<i>she'd watched her friend Sean Spindle</i>

150
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,372
<i>initiate the pact...</i>

151
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,711
You hearing this?

152
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,250
<i>...by killing himself in the early morning.</i>

153
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,219
That kid was one of
Candace Spindle's sons.

154
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,653
So?

155
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,452
<i>...death of his mother,
Candace Spindle...</i>

156
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,718
The witch.

157
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,384
<i>...who died tragically</i>
<i>in a fire six months ago.</i>

158
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,656
I'm failing to see the humor.

159
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,392
Come on. Why is she a witch?

160
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,161
She killed Jimmy Grogan.

161
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,328
Jimmy Grogan drowned.
In a lake by her house.

162
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,871
That doesn't mean she killed him.

163
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,238
Look, the truth was there for all to see.

164
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,106
You saw how Natalie was.

165
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,236
That stuff don't come from nowhere.

166
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,575
And I'll tell you what.

167
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,672
That book she had on her,

168
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,513
I'll bet you that was no Bible.

169
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,246
Mom, what are you trying to say?

170
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,379
I'm saying if you believe in the light,

171
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,218
you got to believe in the dark.

172
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,623
Shit, man.
It's hotter than you out there.

173
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,994
Hey, mama.

174
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,862
- Hi.
- How you doing, baby?

175
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,298
All right.

176
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,995
All right.

177
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,540
Yeah, I guess you look all right.

178
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,837
All right. Come on, Cinderella.

179
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,968
Shake a leg, huh?

180
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,636
Let's go.

181
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,977
I just got a little hard.

182
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,984
Well, God bless you.

183
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,684
And welcome today.

184
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,593
We are so glad
to have you here today.

185
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,961
Welcome to God's house.

186
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,294
And we know

187
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,736
that God has good things in store
for every one of you today.

188
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,069
We love you.

189
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,404
We believe in you.

190
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,207
And how many of you know
that God loves you?

191
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,713
Yes, he does.

192
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,043
Yes, he does.

193
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,674
He loves you.

194
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,218
He loves every one of us.

195
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,120
Now, I find that
the more I praise God,

196
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,717
he lifts my burdens
and raises my sprits. Amen.

197
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:48,817
Amen.

198
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,919
If you cast down your burdens,

199
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,362
and you say to God
that He is bigger

200
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,424
than all the problems in your life,

201
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,164
you will be saved. Amen.

202
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,865
Amen.

203
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,202
Amen.

204
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,237
But today is a sad day for us.

205
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,145
Death is never a welcome guest.

206
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,415
But there is also a reason to rejoice

207
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:19,184
because our Lord has made this day.

208
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,060
Almighty God,

209
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,891
who rewards us for believing in him.

210
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,728
Praise our awesome God.

211
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,097
Almighty Father...

212
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,272
we love you,

213
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,173
and we worship you with all our hearts.

214
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,475
We open ourselves to your control
and your infinite wisdom.

215
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,946
And we know

216
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,677
that when life takes a turn
for the unexpected,

217
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:50,848
it is you taking us
on a road of devotion.

218
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,322
Amen.

219
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,858
Amen.

220
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,069
We sing praise for the Lord, yes

221
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,799
We sing praise for those good times

222
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:13,209
We sing praise for the joys he brings us

223
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,339
Oh, yeah

224
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,973
What was that?

225
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,318
What it always is.

226
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,355
No, it's always passionate
and to the point.

227
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,220
And you skimmed over what happened
like it was a traffic accident.

228
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,487
I said what needed to be said.

229
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,858
Look, Candace Spindle's
sons came back.

230
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,330
And now, one of our own is dead.

231
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,800
It's a tragedy.

232
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,632
That's it.

233
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,606
Dylan, you watch your tone.

234
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,166
I'm fully aware of what this town needs.

235
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,974
No. What this town needs
is the fire of faith.

236
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,175
And you gave it words
from a prayer card.

237
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,882
Uncle Bernie?

238
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,284
It was a lovely ceremony.

239
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,805
Poor Bernard.

240
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,397
He couldn't even make the service.

241
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,499
Shit, man. Can you blame the guy?

242
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,567
If my daughter rammed a pair
of scissors into her neck,

243
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,272
I'd be fucked up for life.

244
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,212
Surprised you two ain't
more fucked up for seeing it.

245
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,977
Well, we didn't see her do it.

246
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,916
They don't even know
if she did it for sure.

247
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,920
Could be a killer out there,
for all we know.

248
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,387
Shit, man. That's where Bernie is.

249
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,947
He's hunting the son of a bitch down.

250
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,516
You know what I'd do
if I found my daughter's killer.

251
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,893
I'd make him swallow a pair of scissors.

252
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,989
Then I'd cut his tongue out.

253
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,796
Then I'd take a leak on him.

254
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:53,065
Jesus, Roy, you got a sick mind.

255
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,799
It's what you like about me, ain't it?

256
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,931
Yeah.

257
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,408
That and my big heart.

258
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,936
My big, fat heart.

259
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,539
Hey, Lindsay, you like
my big, fat heart, don't you?

260
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,691
Hey, sweetie,
you ask about that job yet?

261
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,253
Dylan wants me to go back
to work at the church,

262
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,821
more clerical stuff.

263
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,993
Oh, honey, that's an honor.

264
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,004
After all we been through,
that's exactly what you need.

265
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,335
Shit, man. What'd I do now?

266
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,421
Man.

267
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,655
All right. You guys wait here.

268
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,255
Bernard's dead.

269
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,136
Oh, no.

270
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,569
He hung himself.

271
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,754
...interpretation.

272
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,951
Analzye and re-analyze.

273
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,224
But most of them turned out
very, very well.

274
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,447
Who would've thought
Bernard, of all people?

275
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:20,144
I guess losing Natalie was
more than he could handle.

276
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,483
All we can do is pray.

277
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,454
For him or us?

278
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,252
Us?

279
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,190
People are saying things.

280
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,454
Like what?

281
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,756
Like, you know,

282
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,491
maybe it's, like, a suicide pact.

283
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,726
What the hell is this?
Mary, what's up?

284
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,496
Dylan's going to kick his ass.

285
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,800
- Whose ass?
- Wait, Lindsay.

286
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,964
Dylan?

287
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,139
That guy's a freak.

288
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,405
Dylan? What's going on?

289
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,946
No need to worry.

290
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,242
Dylan, what are you do...

291
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,442
Don't you worry. No need to worry.

292
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,711
Don't you look at her.

293
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,377
For God's sakes, Dylan.

294
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,786
They worship the devil, Lindsay.

295
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,518
You can't worship something
you don't believe in.

296
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,321
Satan's a creation of your religion.

297
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,390
Hit him, hit him. Harder.

298
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,727
Stop this right now.

299
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,892
Dylan.

300
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,163
Thy pain is thy cleansing.

301
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,935
Yeah, man. Good job.

302
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,498
Yeah, Dylan.

303
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,227
Thank you for helping me.

304
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,339
Sorry about your brother.

305
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,809
Thank you.

306
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,379
I'm Aidan.

307
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,755
Lindsay.

308
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,033
You seem to know your way.

309
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,127
We used to sneak back here.

310
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,604
For a good scare?

311
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,299
We were kids.

312
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,800
It's okay.

313
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,842
My mother actually liked the visits.

314
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,510
She loved children.

315
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,349
It's the adults that made her suffer.

316
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,814
Are you coming in?

317
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,016
No, I shouldn't.

318
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,583
You've seen the outside
of the house enough as a kid,

319
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,822
you might as well see the inside.

320
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,033
You got stuff for those cuts?

321
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,029
Inside, I do.

322
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,532
That's my great-grandmother.

323
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,279
Do you play?

324
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,878
No.

325
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,770
Do you believe he killed himself?

326
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,748
He hated himself.

327
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,784
He always did.

328
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,185
When I found his body,
I wasn't surprised.

329
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,450
Do you have any other family?

330
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,792
I have a cousin Sadie.

331
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:02,357
She's coming down tomorrow
from New York for the funeral.

332
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,494
I haven't spoken to my father in a year.

333
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,988
That's where they killed her.

334
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,933
I thought the fire was an accident.

335
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,900
Well, that's what they said.

336
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,803
Crazy woman tripped
over a few candles.

337
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,865
Fire spreads fast,
and she's trapped inside.

338
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,140
It was retribution.

339
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,817
I guess it didn't take much
for them to blame her,

340
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,186
especially since what they said she was.

341
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,150
I'm sorry.

342
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:31,054
Why'd you and your brother
come back?

343
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,852
This is the house we grew up in.

344
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,259
It's our home.

345
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,074
That's her.

346
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,472
She's beautiful.

347
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,017
You remind me of her.

348
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,958
Really?

349
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,764
I don't mean looks.

350
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,964
It's how you carry yourself.

351
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,336
How you treat people.

352
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,538
Is that you and your brother?

353
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,020
That's me.

354
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,756
I've never seen that side of Dylan.

355
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,452
You have to believe me.

356
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,986
His other side must be something.

357
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,658
When...

358
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,293
When my father died,

359
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,836
I was lost.

360
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,197
He came...

361
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,674
he came to me from the church,

362
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,735
pulled me through a bad time.

363
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,142
Loss brings people together.

364
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,217
What is it?

365
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,350
Nothing.

366
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:52,055
It's just that Dylan said
something similar recently,

367
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,327
about trials and tribulations.

368
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,380
Billy, is that you?

369
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,686
What are you doing here?

370
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,264
Who are you?

371
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:48,151
Come to me.

372
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,672
What are you doing?

373
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,658
Hey.

374
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,635
You can sneak a peek, honey.

375
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,431
I ain't shy.

376
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,699
Where have you been?

377
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,741
Out driving.

378
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,105
Don't you lie to me.

379
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,404
I wasn't doing anything.

380
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,707
I think I'm going to leave you to it.

381
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,077
Roy.

382
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,082
Roy, we have that thing
tomorrow night, though, right?

383
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,845
Oh, yeah. Just give me a call.

384
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,547
Dylan called.

385
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,645
So?

386
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,986
He says you were
with the Spindle boy.

387
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,788
Did Dylan also mention
that he beat him up?

388
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,088
That boy touch you?

389
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,596
No.

390
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,461
I was just helping him.

391
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,625
We just talked.

392
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,760
Oh, I'm sure that's all you did.

393
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,371
You're completely soaked.

394
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,565
I can see everything.

395
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,767
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself,

396
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,434
treating Dylan the way you do.

397
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,978
- Look, I just took care...
- You went home with a stranger,

398
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,139
and one from a very
questionable family.

399
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,876
Come on, you've never met him.

400
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,181
He's decent, and his family's
been here way longer than us.

401
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,744
Was he playing the victim for you?

402
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:32,687
Poor little boy in need of help?

403
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:35,658
No. We tried to bring them
into the fold.

404
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,354
We went to that house.

405
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,952
We invited them to church.

406
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,759
We welcomed them with open arms.

407
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,424
And then you realized
they were different.

408
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,094
Their beliefs are rooted
in darkness, sweetie,

409
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,261
- pure and simple.
- Maybe...

410
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,965
When they rejected God,
they rejected us.

411
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,770
Maybe they just wanted to be left alone.

412
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,606
Maybe that boy just wants to get laid.

413
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,169
I don't like talking to you
when you're like this.

414
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,078
- Like what?
- Piss-ass drunk.

415
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,642
<i>...6, 7, 8.</i>

416
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,808
<i>Pull back, 2, 3, 4.</i>

417
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,513
<i>Step together, 6, 7, 8.</i>

418
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,249
<i>Great.
Let's try that from the top.</i>

419
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,851
<i>And 5, 6, 7, 8.</i>

420
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,454
<i>To the front, 2, 3, 4,</i>

421
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,762
<i>5, 6, 7, 8.</i>

422
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,997
<i>And roll, 2, 3, 4.</i>

423
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,972
<i>Other side. 6, 7, 8.</i>

424
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,452
Bye, Dad.

425
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,225
See you later, sweetie.

426
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,640
And actually, it takes us
to our last question

427
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,306
that we have when we're analyzing,

428
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,545
um, Joseph Conrad's
<i>Heart of Darkness.</i>

429
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,382
And the last question I have, then,

430
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,287
why would Marlow,
why would our narrator,

431
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,451
point-blank lie
when Kurtz' fiancée asks him

432
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,688
what Kurtz' final words were?

433
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,288
Whatever. They're just jealous.

434
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,857
That doesn't make me feel better.

435
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,129
What'd you expect?

436
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,137
I mean, you're already
dating the pastor's son.

437
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,969
who's, like, Grovetown royalty.

438
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,771
And now, the Spindle kid
has taken a shine to you?

439
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,608
Aidan? Why do you say that?

440
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,773
I heard you rescued him.

441
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,443
No, I... I just drove him home.

442
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,952
Wow, you're more wild than
I give you credit for, girl.

443
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,013
No, we just... we just talked.

444
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,325
I thought he could use
someone to comfort him.

445
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,693
Oh. Is that what they're calling it now?

446
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,356
Claire.

447
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,195
Were there sparks?

448
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,327
Come on, it's a little much to ask for.

449
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,373
Well, I ask for it all the time.

450
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,503
Just... Just be a little careful, okay?

451
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,342
I can't control what people think.

452
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,177
Right now, they see you
as being on his side.

453
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,184
Okay? They praise God for the good

454
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,186
and blame the devil for the bad.

455
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,516
It doesn't matter.

456
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,057
Come on, I don't plan
on going back there.

457
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,093
Well, maybe I'll stop by later.

458
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,857
You can take me to meet him.

459
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,922
Maybe he has a friend
you can hook me up with.

460
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,243
And the weak will walk away,

461
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,575
but the strong,

462
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,242
the strong will deal with
the son of Candace Spindle,

463
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,684
this godless heir to a murderess mother.

464
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,551
and a festering sore of heresy.

465
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,148
Don't you touch him.

466
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,453
Well, that's a relief.

467
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,428
I was beginning to think
I didn't exist to you.

468
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,691
You know why I'm not talking to you.

469
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:11,132
Look, I did what I had to do, Lindsay.

470
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,726
You'll come to understand that.

471
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:13,963
I doubt it.

472
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:17,098
The suicides all started
with the Spindle boy, okay?

473
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,301
Natalie had that book.

474
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,809
Come on, it's just a book.

475
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,437
That's like saying the
Bible is just a book.

476
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,208
It's different.

477
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,711
I mean, the cops will check it out.

478
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,881
No, see, the cops...
the cops don't have it.

479
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:36,518
They gave it to my father
to judge what it is,

480
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,959
what that boy is.

481
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,792
Leave him alone, Dylan.

482
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,563
I don't believe this.

483
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,160
He's gotten under your skin.

484
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,000
You're going to see him
again, aren't you?

485
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,612
That's fine, you know.

486
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,453
That's great, but just know this.

487
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,857
This town takes care of its own.

488
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,353
Hello?

489
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,428
The door was open.

490
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,962
So that makes it okay?

491
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,196
If your pants are open, can I go in?

492
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,007
Well, if you're not going to rob us,

493
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,137
might as well do the name thing.

494
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,373
Sadie.

495
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,814
Um, Lindsay.

496
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,874
I came by to see Aidan.

497
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,284
New girlfriend?

498
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,555
No. We're not...

499
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,858
You're the cousin.

500
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,559
Yeah, he mentioned
you were coming.

501
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,761
I drove down when I heard.

502
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,634
Blew his brains out.

503
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,833
What am I supposed to do about it?

504
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,446
Play date's here.

505
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,641
I see you met Sadie.

506
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,018
Can I talk to you alone?

507
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,561
I got to get to the funeral.
So what is it?

508
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,426
It's not safe to stay here.

509
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,059
Do you know something I don't?

510
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,898
They think you have
something to do with the suicides.

511
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,597
They're scared.

512
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,332
So?

513
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,307
So I came to warn you.

514
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,172
Come on. Look at your face, Aidan.

515
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,735
Those cuts and bruises
are there for a reason.

516
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,082
This isn't about pride.

517
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,210
It's about some rednecks
coming to kill you.

518
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,846
You need to talk to the cops.

519
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,051
My mother didn't run, and neither will I.

520
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,357
Come on, you're being stupid.

521
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,695
These people are dangerous.

522
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,363
What the fuck was that all about?

523
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,906
She came to warn us.

524
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,840
We don't need outsiders involved.

525
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,775
I can handle it.

526
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,405
They killed your mother.

527
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,117
You think they won't
do the same to us?

528
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,319
I wish Sean were here.

529
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,793
Look, multiple suicides are unusual,
but they can happen.

530
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,796
Bunch of kids see
the same damn movie...

531
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,628
it's called "suicide hotspots."

532
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,158
But are they the result
of some kind of, what, curse?

533
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,670
No, I don't believe that.

534
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,000
They do.

535
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,166
Come on, you know how it is here.

536
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,075
It's God and the devil, good and evil.

537
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,237
There's no in-between.

538
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,746
- Look, Lindsay...
- You ever find out

539
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,008
what happened to Aidan's mother?

540
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,879
To Candace Spindle?

541
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,743
She died in a fire.

542
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,346
It... It wasn't murder?

543
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,755
That investigation is closed.

544
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,658
She died a week after
Jimmy Grogan was found.

545
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,059
People thought she killed him,

546
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,960
so they got their revenge.

547
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,658
They'll do the same thing to Aidan.

548
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,701
They're blaming him the same way.

549
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,861
Look, Lindsay, people here
are just passionate.

550
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,167
That's all it is, passion.

551
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,004
It doesn't make them murderers.

552
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,250
Come to me.

553
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,142
Please!

554
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,015
Let me out!

555
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,849
Please! Please!

556
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:17,952
Claire.

557
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,220
Thanks for coming.

558
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,317
What is it you wanted to tell me?

559
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,385
Someone likes us.

560
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,226
It's not going to stop with that.

561
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,891
Still wet.

562
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,894
Let's talk somewhere else.

563
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,011
My mother used to come here.

564
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,736
You shouldn't come around
to the house anymore.

565
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,131
You brought me here to tell me this?

566
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,206
This is where my mother
practiced her religion.

567
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,021
She'd read from her grimoire.

568
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,559
It's a book,

569
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,618
a collection of rituals.

570
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,330
What does that have to do with this?

571
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,544
Go far away from here.

572
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,410
Leave Grovetown.

573
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,804
Dylan, Paul.

574
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,465
You know why we're here, Sheriff.

575
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,669
Why don't you fill me in, Dylan?

576
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,771
'Cause you know exactly
what's happening out there.

577
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:53,078
These aren't just suicides.

578
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,118
This is something else,

579
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:56,550
something worse.

580
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,783
And that idea would be based on what?

581
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,417
Faith, Sheriff.

582
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,587
But I don't expect you
to understand that.

583
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:06,754
The lost never do.

584
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,429
- Listen...
- No, you listen to me, all right?

585
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,629
This all started with the death of
Candace Spindle's youngest son.

586
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:14,762
What are you gonna do?

587
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,329
You might want to watch that tone, son.

588
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,204
I've been waiting for you, sweetie.

589
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,139
Trish, are you okay?

590
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,138
I will be.

591
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,078
Once it's over.

592
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,383
Over?

593
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,546
What... Who else is here?

594
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,381
I love you, Lindsay.

595
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:45,223
You know that, right?

596
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,353
Roy?

597
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,761
Hey, what's going on?

598
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,497
Now get her... her hands.

599
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,528
No.

600
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,837
Watch her head.

601
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,400
No.

602
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,616
What are you doing?

603
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,584
Let go, please.

604
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,684
Be still. Come on. Be still.

605
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,488
We gotta cleanse ourselves, sweetie.

606
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,053
We were both at the store
when the girl died.

607
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:25,261
And today, I saw something
that made me know there's a curse.

608
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:30,095
There's something I gotta tell you.

609
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,903
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

610
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,500
Claire's dead.

611
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,011
Hey, hey, come on.

612
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,171
- Be still.
- Come on.

613
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,282
O Lord, send down your blessed hand

614
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:47,152
and cast out the evil
that has entrapped this innocent.

615
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,987
O Lord, send down your blessed hand

616
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:51,289
and cast out the evil
that has entrapped this innocent.

617
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:54,353
O Lord, send down your blessed hand

618
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,025
and cast out the evil
that has entrapped this innocent.

619
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,193
O Lord, send down your blessed hand

620
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,601
and cast out the evil
that has entrapped this innocent.

621
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,799
O Lord, send down your blessed hand

622
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,843
and cast out the evil
that has entrapped this innocent.

623
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,386
It's all over, sweetie.

624
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,154
Nothing to worry about anymore.

625
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:27,390
I felt the power of the Lord
in that church.

626
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,932
And I saw a vision of the Virgin Mary.

627
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,025
We're saved.

628
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,160
Lindsay?

629
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,965
Say something.

630
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,369
Fuck you.

631
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,339
<i>And we're just gonna do pulses.</i>

632
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,840
<i>Here we go, ready?</i>

633
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,674
<i>4, 3, 2, and</i> 1...

634
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,398
Lindsay?

635
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,696
You.

636
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,306
Trish?

637
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,621
Are you okay?

638
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:40,986
Trish?

639
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,370
Roy... Roy, you can't go in there.

640
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,847
- Don't touch me.
- You can't go in.

641
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,511
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.

642
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:11,281
Don't... You can't go in there, Roy.

643
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,719
- Let me see her.
- Relax.

644
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,586
Let me see her.
Let me fuckin' see her!

645
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,750
Come on. Go home, Roy!

646
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,057
You don't wanna be
heading back to jail, son.

647
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,187
I want to go back.

648
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:22,322
Look, come on down
to the station tomorrow.

649
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,128
We'll give you a full report, okay?

650
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,726
You'll give me a full report on
what the fuck's going on here?

651
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,430
I'm sorry about Trish.

652
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,274
Sorry about Trish?

653
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,676
You sorry about Trish?

654
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,757
Did you see it?

655
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,026
It's inside me.

656
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,089
I have it. What am I gonna do?

657
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,929
It's inside of me.

658
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,470
- Lindsay...
- I'm going to die.

659
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,662
It's real.

660
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,299
No, it's not real.

661
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,071
It's not real.

662
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,270
But I saw.

663
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:43,710
It's in your mind, okay?

664
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,714
- It's just your mind.
- I heard Trish running like...

665
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,650
someone was chasing her.

666
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:52,586
That's because what she saw
looked real to her.

667
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,715
Okay, but she was alone.

668
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,473
Let's be real, okay?

669
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:16,671
It makes you do it. You.

670
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:21,874
Now this.

671
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,915
Do they see what I see?

672
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,389
Do they see themselves?

673
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,955
That's what we're dealing with.

674
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,587
You against you.

675
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,324
But I'd never kill myself.

676
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,995
And Claire...

677
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,740
You have to help me.

678
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,442
You have to do something.

679
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,455
I don't want to die.

680
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,961
Come with me.

681
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:23,640
Those spells use energy.

682
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,745
Null energy can be slowed.

683
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,660
This should weaken its flow.

684
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,535
It won't stop it,

685
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,901
but it should weaken it.

686
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:23,164
Think of it as a thin layer of armor.

687
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,237
A layer of armor,

688
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,542
protecting you.

689
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,321
Relax.

690
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,855
Allow it to work.

691
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,909
Does every part have to be covered?

692
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,720
I think we're good.

693
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,984
Just...

694
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,252
Try not to...

695
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,486
Try not to what?

696
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,222
Try not to sweat it off.

697
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:24,923
All finished with the rubdown?

698
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:37,206
Really gets your juices
flowing, doesn't it?

699
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,522
You said the curse is spreading?

700
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:51,719
When will it stop?

701
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,396
I... I don't know.

702
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,332
So, this, the suicides,

703
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,267
It's like a plague?

704
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,271
Now it can spread everywhere?

705
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:15,608
How could something that serious
be lying around in a book?

706
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:20,019
Man's own act of suicide...

707
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:23,320
If you are willing to pay such a price.

708
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,691
Sean was willing.

709
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:31,366
The spell is like a key.

710
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,460
If it can open something,

711
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:36,471
it can also close it.

712
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:40,635
What we need is the book.

713
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:45,746
I think I know where it is.

714
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,347
You stay and watch the house.

715
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,983
Oh, is it the house
I should be watching?

716
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,460
I know what I'm doing.

717
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,668
I used to work here.

718
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,001
Where are we going?

719
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,810
He thinks it's unholy, dangerous.

720
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,043
I think I might know where he put it.

721
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,897
Protected by God.

722
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,063
Do you have the key?

723
01:00:58,287 --> 01:00:59,754
Stay with me, Lindsay.

724
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,052
Stay with me.

725
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,572
Don't let it get in, okay?
I know it's hard.

726
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,133
But, you've gotta keep it out.

727
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,755
Don't look at it, Lindsay.

728
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,457
I'm protecting you.
You just have to stay calm.

729
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,523
- Don't give in.
- Real.

730
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,965
You're not real. You're not real.

731
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,094
You're not real.

732
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:07,150
Sean's blood, isn't it?

733
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,987
Can you do the ritual?

734
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,423
I can try.

735
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,496
I'll need some supplies from upstairs.

736
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:24,139
You better go get them, then.

737
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:27,973
Another way to save the world.

738
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,069
See. we should have
gotten rid of the book

739
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,272
when we had the chance.

740
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,143
We don't know what's in that thing.

741
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,944
- How did Trish...
- Poison.

742
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,610
Cops say she killed
herself like the others.

743
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,153
That's bullshit.

744
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,189
And Lindsay?

745
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,986
She called the cops,
said Trish was dead.

746
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,822
When the cops came, she was gone.

747
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,759
Pastor...

748
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,626
We tried it your way, okay?

749
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,859
And I... I don't mean
to be disrespectful,

750
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,663
but it didn't amount
to a steaming pile of shit.

751
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,569
Roy, in all places.

752
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,163
Had to be said. I'm sorry.

753
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,937
Have you all lost faith in the Lord?

754
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,602
This has to be handled.

755
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:05,374
No. I cannot condone this.

756
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,643
We can't take this into our own hands,

757
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:08,843
not again.

758
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,385
This man lost his daughter.

759
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,854
Son, look into your heart.

760
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,084
What happened last time was wrong.

761
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,626
How can you say that?

762
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:19,593
Weeds must be pulled from the garden.

763
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,220
That sound familiar?

764
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,994
What happened to Candace Spindle
was a mistake.

765
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:30,402
One that I have had
a very hard time living with.

766
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,340
Oh, I'm sorry that you suffer, Father.

767
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,037
Only problem is
is that weeds grow back.

768
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,476
Leave him with his gardening.

769
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,853
- Dylan...
- I've heard enough.

770
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,056
I want to speak with you.

771
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,732
I'll meet you in the truck.

772
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,968
Look, you know this is right.

773
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,600
He's gotta answer for the deaths,

774
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,577
just like his mother
did with Jimmy Grogan.

775
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:16,541
When Jimmy came back from the war,
he was deeply troubled.

776
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,554
- I don't have time for your guilt, okay?
- You don't understand.

777
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:22,090
Jimmy...

778
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,388
Jimmy needed someone.

779
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:26,918
He came to me.

780
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,830
We talked.

781
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,730
We spent some time together.

782
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,063
Okay, you're a pastor.

783
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,295
That's what you do.

784
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,565
No.

785
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,664
Not like this.

786
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,648
I gotta deal with this later, okay?

787
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,278
He was gonna tell everybody.

788
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:53,652
Grovetown is built on a bedrock of faith

789
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,088
that I instilled.

790
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,421
I had to do something.

791
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,096
And what was that?

792
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,308
I didn't have a choice.

793
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:19,308
Leaving him in the lake made it easy.

794
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:23,376
Everybody blamed that poor woman.

795
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,045
This conversation dies in this room,

796
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,317
you hear me?

797
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:33,095
Well, that's up to you, son.

798
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:36,427
If you harm that boy,

799
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:37,989
I will tell everyone.

800
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:40,501
Because your weakness is your own?

801
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:41,831
If you want to tell everybody,

802
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:43,531
go ahead and tell them.

803
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,541
My true father reigns in heaven.

804
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,407
His work shall be done.

805
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,972
Aidan,

806
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,140
once this is over,

807
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,979
will you leave here?

808
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,817
Will you leave Grovetown?

809
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,981
I won't be returning after tonight.

810
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:39,694
I want to come with you.

811
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,287
Excuse me while I throw up.

812
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,924
- Give it to me.
- You...

813
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,766
Give me the fucking book.

814
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,670
- Sadie, why are you...
- Shut the fuck up.

815
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,666
You think I won't...

816
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,303
Think I won't kill you for it?

817
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,712
Think I won't kill some bitch for it?

818
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:04,275
All right. Right here.

819
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,581
Your brother died for this,

820
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,887
you shit.

821
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,226
Sean was wrong.

822
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:21,394
We all were.

823
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,098
What happened to you?

824
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:29,344
We decided on this
together, you and Sean.

825
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,039
He gave his life.

826
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:35,481
What's going on?

827
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,815
The curse.

828
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,583
He found it.

829
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:43,386
It was his idea, honey.

830
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:50,455
Aidan wanted everyone
in your pretty little town to die,

831
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,023
you included.

832
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,796
This is true?

833
01:07:56,872 --> 01:08:00,103
Seems you two have a lot to talk about.

834
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:03,634
It was a mistake.

835
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,180
Sorry, choir girl.

836
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:09,149
Burning times are back.

837
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,947
Except this time...

838
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:14,719
it's for the rest of the fucking world.

839
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,824
Come on.

840
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,486
Why would I go anywhere with you?

841
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:23,225
- Lindsay...
- You lied to me.

842
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:24,664
We don't have time for this right now.

843
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,530
You're killing people.

844
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:29,901
Sadie will destroy the book
if we don't stop her. And then...

845
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,807
And then you will die.

846
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,229
Paul, you grab the front.

847
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,423
Hey, Lindsay might be inside.

848
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:57,523
- Yeah, so?
- So be careful.

849
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,201
Lindsay!

850
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,671
- Lindsay!
- No!

851
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,442
Sean died for nothing.

852
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,341
Go!

853
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,749
Aidan!

854
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,383
Knock-knock!

855
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,823
We want to talk to you, Aidan.

856
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,019
Lindsay?

857
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:27,585
We're here.

858
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,654
Come out now. We won't hurt you.

859
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:31,290
No we won't.

860
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:32,459
Upstairs.

861
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,207
There's nobody down here.

862
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,354
Oh, fuck!

863
01:09:58,427 --> 01:10:00,622
- We got her!
- Shit.

864
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,459
Fuck!

865
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:05,629
No.

866
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,295
Where's Aidan?

867
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,373
No, no, no. No, go back.

868
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,147
Oh, shit. That hurt, huh?

869
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:24,815
Can't you do it here?

870
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,354
No.

871
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,322
I need time.

872
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,381
Your worthless god can kiss my ass.

873
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:31,756
What was that?

874
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:37,159
Hey, stay here. Take care of the bitch.

875
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,098
Fine. I'll take care of her.

876
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,775
Paul, to the woods!

877
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,699
Lindsay!

878
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:20,875
The devil must be strong in you.

879
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:25,180
The mother went much easier.

880
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:42,020
It was in prison
that the Lord came to me.

881
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:44,725
Then he gave me a purpose.

882
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,394
One night, after a...

883
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,598
particularly painful day,

884
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,196
he spoke to me.

885
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,705
And he said to me, "Hey, Roy?"

886
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,979
Then, I said, "Yeah, God?"

887
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,586
He said, "I want you to be a soldier.

888
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:09,090
"I want you to be a soldier of the Lord."

889
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:16,795
"And anytime there's
a soul that's lost or..."

890
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,994
"possessed or

891
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,129
beyond hope..."

892
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,042
"I want you to send that soul
straight to hell."

893
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,046
Now, are you gonna pray with me?

894
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,823
No.

895
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,765
Well, then I'm gonna
need you to shut the fuck up.

896
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:05,010
Lindsay!

897
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,651
I gotta draw 'em away.

898
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,556
Meet me by the pier.

899
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,484
Look, I just want you to understand

900
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:50,616
my work here tonight

901
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:53,627
is God's work.

902
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:55,526
I am an instrument...

903
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,491
...of his will.

904
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,640
My hands...

905
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:09,802
...are his.

906
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:11,140
No, no. No, no, no.

907
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:14,306
I know.

908
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,616
Our Father, Who art in Heaven,

909
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,457
Hallowed be Thy name...

910
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:52,740
It wasn't my book.

911
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,527
Aidan!

912
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,907
Aidan!

913
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,535
Thy pain is thy cleansing.

914
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,389
Lindsay?

915
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,060
Lindsay!

916
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,461
Stop. Stop!

917
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:32,533
Stop. Stop, hey...

918
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:36,634
Stop. Look at me. Look at me.

919
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,612
It's me.

920
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:47,446
How long will it take?

921
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:48,819
Not long.

922
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,852
Is it over?

923
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,931
You remember when I told you

924
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,867
certain spells...

925
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,339
require a terrible price?

926
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,713
What I need to do...

927
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,380
You have to understand,

928
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:54,548
Sean gave his life to start the curse.

929
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,682
What are you saying?

930
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,891
Sacrifice started it.

931
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:04,889
And sacrifice needs to end it.

932
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,572
It's the only way.

933
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,709
No.

934
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,276
No, it can't be.

935
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,092
No, Aidan. Please, no.

936
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:36,958
You have to destroy
the book after it's done.

937
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:38,124
Listen to me.

938
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,327
You have to make sure

939
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,393
that it can never be used again ever.

940
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,438
Aidan, please...

941
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,565
Promise me you'll burn it.

942
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,245
No.

943
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,700
It didn't have to be this way, Lindsay.

944
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:49,703
I thought that we were
meant to be together.

945
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:54,501
I thought it was God's plan.

946
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:58,239
Dylan, put the gun down.

947
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:00,872
She's become one of them.

948
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:06,320
She abandoned the Lord, Paul.

949
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:18,131
What, is it your turn to kill yourself?

950
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:21,994
Oh, I get it.

951
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,561
You can't let your man's
death go unanswered.

952
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:28,769
- Dylan?
- Would you shut up, Paul?

953
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:34,276
Can't you see Lindsay's having
a little moment here?

954
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:35,907
Don't do this.

955
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,884
Walk away, please. Walk away.

956
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,083
I don't walk away.

957
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,683
Ever.

958
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,720
My faith is my anchor.

959
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:01,725
I don't know the record
for suicides in one town,

960
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:03,930
but we gotta be climbing the charts.

961
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:07,271
This wasn't a suicide.

962
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,473
Lindsay said he shot himself.

963
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,276
Well, she was wrong.

964
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:19,220
He may have tried
to blow his brains out.

965
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:23,781
Dylan shot him in the chest
before he got the chance.

966
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:36,765
