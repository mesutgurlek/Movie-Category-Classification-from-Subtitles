1
00:00:28,927 --> 00:00:31,122
911. What is your emergency?

2
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:36,682
I'm tired of the way things are,
as opposed to the way they should be.

3
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:39,998
Is this an emergency?
Where are you located?

4
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:42,362
That really doesn't matter.

5
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:44,358
- Can we have your name?
- Of course.

6
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:47,519
Common denominator.
Your man on the street.

7
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:51,725
Now don't ask another question,
or I will be obliged to do bad.

8
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:56,597
Andyou would have to assume
responsibility. No interruptions.

9
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,398
Natural selection.

10
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:07,838
Natural selection.

11
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:16,078
Born to win.

12
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:19,117
Born to lose.

13
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,203
Born to die.

14
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:28,165
Three situations that make up
everything in the world.

15
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:30,807
No interference is necessary.

16
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,683
But interference happens.

17
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:42,846
People interfere with an important task

18
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:45,043
I enjoy doing.

19
00:01:56,167 --> 00:02:00,046
I don't believe people are not good
by nature, not at all.

20
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:10,036
So ifyou remove the authority, the police,

21
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,401
then you'll see life
as God intended it to be.

22
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:23,560
A world ofpandemonium.

23
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:30,599
Without police, the weak
and diseased would be gone.

24
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:35,405
Streets red with blood.

25
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:40,685
The way nature intended it to be.

26
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:52,640
There will be another body found tonight.

27
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:55,116
Thank you foryour time.

28
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:32,080
April fool, right?

29
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:36,282
- You're kidding, right?
- You've picked a very fine diamond.

30
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:40,280
I'll tell you what, throw in a car and I'll
take it. Throw in a hand, I'll take it.

31
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:43,677
Perhaps a lesser gem
would be more appropriate?

32
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,439
Nah, it's perfect.

33
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,517
Go! Go! Go! Go!

34
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,321
What's up, Malloy?
You're losing your touch.

35
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,365
He'll get you in the rematch.
Don't you worry, buddy.

36
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:10,204
I got plans tonight and they don't include
you guys. I'll get killed if I don't go.

37
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:14,599
She'll be pissed anyway. One more round
isn't gonna make a rat's ass difference.

38
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,362
I forgot I was dealing with the
stable-relationship brain trust here.

39
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:21,519
You guys ever heard of quittin'
while you're ahead?

40
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:24,917
You got a little drinking problem
in this area over here.

41
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:26,565
Give this guy another pop.

42
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:29,719
You feds any closer
to nailing that son of a bitch?

43
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,924
What d'you wanna hear? I got him
giftwrapped out in the trunk.

44
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,999
- We're gettin' close.
- That's bullshit.

45
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:38,681
- No, we're getting close.
- I hope so.

46
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,520
- Tucker didn't deserve that.
- No cop does.

47
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:43,962
He's puttin' bodies
on display like trophies.

48
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:48,882
Son of a bitch knows we're the ones
who have to look at 'em, that's why.

49
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:55,283
Look, I'd love to tell you we got this guy
ready for a toe tag and a slab.

50
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:58,404
But we're dealin' with a different
kind of street logic here.

51
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:01,923
It's a whole different breed.
There's no repeatable patterns.

52
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,804
There's no identifiable method.

53
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:09,325
He's targeting cops, different precincts,
different times. Every site's clean.

54
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:12,717
But he's gonna fuck up. They all do.
When he does, we'll nail him.

55
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:16,482
Come on, Malloy. We've had nine
dead cops inside of six months.

56
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:21,641
If this was nine dead feds we were talkin'
about, that would be a different story.

57
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:27,438
A different story? You really think I give
a shit what kind of badge a man wears?

58
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,884
I think you're feelin' guilty because you
and your fed friends are droppin' the ball.

59
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:35,926
What happened to you, Malloy? You used
to be one of us before you became a fed.

60
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:39,238
Ease up. We're all on the same team here.

61
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,677
Yeah, ease up.

62
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,198
You finished?

63
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:48,007
Oh, yeah, everyone here
knows I'm an asshole.

64
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,486


65
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,762
- You got that right.
- You are an asshole.

66
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:54,884
Everyone knows that. That's a fact of life.

67
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:59,916
Bring these guys anything they want,
please. Just keep their mouths full.

68
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,916
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

69
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:52,158
You wanna tell me
why you were late for dinner?

70
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,761
- Very funny.
- Got an excuse?

71
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,041
Sorry.

72
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,960
- How was Donovan's?
- How do you know I was at Donovan's?

73
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:01,607
- Cos I called.
- No, you didn't.

74
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,757
No, I didn't.

75
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:06,759
- That was my imitation of your ex-wife.
- Ouch.

76
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:08,963
Come on, don't go there.

77
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,918
What happened to our date?

78
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:18,400
These guys are goin' through a bad time,
so I was just talkin' to them a little bit.

79
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:22,116
It's always gonna be somethin'.
If not this, somethin' else, Mary.

80
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:26,280
What is this? The beginning of
a "you're just too good for me" speech?

81
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:29,518
- Is that what this is?
- Stop bustin' me already.

82
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:33,319
Lucky for you, I've been
checking out the competition,

83
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:35,875
and the pickings are pretty damn slim,

84
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,755
so I was thinking, what the hell?
Why not stay with me?

85
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,636
Are you tryin' to tell me somethin', huh?

86
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:47,116
Maybe. Maybe not.

87
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:53,567
I have a surprise. I got this great surprise,
but it's gonna have to keep for a while.

88
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:57,560
I'm gonna give it to you,
but I wanna have a clear head when I do.

89
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:04,482
Whatever happened to roses?

90
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,401
Roses? Obviously you haven't
been reading Cosmopolitan.

91
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,522
Obviously.

92
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:12,485
Romantically speaking,
roses are totally obsolete

93
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:15,286
and monkeys are
the new language of love.

94
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,198
I didn't know that.

95
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:22,840
Well, if that's the case...

96
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:28,404
why don't you
and your little friend come to bed?

97
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,876
I think we just got lucky.

98
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:38,278
Forget it. I work alone.

99
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:52,482
- I could have made it myself, you know.
- And you would have gotten another DUI.

100
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,878


101
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:21,961
Hey, Jimmy, are you gonna tuck me in?

102
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:24,038
Christ.

103
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,158
Jimmy?

104
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:56,598


105
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,926
What the hell is this? A treasure hunt?

106
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:39,363
Everybody make sure you step
on every damn thing you can.

107
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:42,757
You see anything you want,
just take it on home.

108
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:50,520
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah. A long time.

109
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:54,040
I can't find any sign
of gunpowder tattooing.

110
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:57,199
The shooter was most likely
several feet back.

111
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,881
He was in whispering distance.

112
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:03,641
See the starburst splitting
of the skin here, Doc?

113
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:08,596
Gun was pressed directly against the head.
The killer wanted him to feel the barrel.

114
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:11,599
Nine dead cops inside of six months.

115
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:16,442
If this was nine dead feds we were talkin'
about, that would be a different story.

116
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,400
Let's cut him down.

117
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,682
How long do you plan
to have him hang there?

118
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,962
Junior hasn't finished
analysing the body.

119
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:30,121
What do you think you're gonna find? Why
don't you get that club out of his throat?

120
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,198
- He's a cop!
- Let me handle this.

121
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:34,562
- Fine.

122
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:38,560
- Hello?
- Let me speak with Agent Malloy.

123
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,638
It's for you.

124
00:11:49,687 --> 00:11:51,120
Thanks.

125
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:53,680
It's Malloy.

126
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:56,804
- You andyour friend were out late.
- Who is this?

127
00:11:56,887 --> 00:12:00,960
Tell me, Malloy, what do you see
in that dead cop 's eyes?

128
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:04,323
Do you see recrimination?
Because it's your fault.

129
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,637
Who is this?

130
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:08,116
They've all died because of you.

131
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:12,723
- What are you talkin' about?
- We'll get to that. But first things first.

132
00:12:12,807 --> 00:12:15,082
You know, she's got a lovely place here.

133
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:19,957
Nice neighbourhood.
It almost looked safe... until now.

134
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:27,842
You really should have stayed home and
played house, instead of playing hunter.

135
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,039
He's at my house.

136
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:30,764


137
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,318
Her name is Mary, right?
I'll bet she has nice eyes.

138
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:40,364
- He's at my fuckin' house!
- 1311 Oak! Westside. Go! Go!

139
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:45,843
Come on, Mary.

140
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,918


141
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,717


142
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:55,595
- Pick up the goddamn phone!
- Send all available units.

143
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:58,042


144
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:04,566
I'm sorry, but Mary can't
come to the phone right now.

145
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:06,399
What do you want?

146
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,399
You're the agent in charge
ofmy case, aren't you?

147
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:12,126
That's right, so whatever you gotta do,
do it to me!

148
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,846
I am doing it to you, Malloy.

149
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,283
And I'm doing it to her.

150
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,358
You still haven't told me what you want.

151
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:25,362
Four years ago you were in charge
ofan investigation ofa series ofmurders.

152
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:30,760
Atrocities against prostitutes.
I call it removing diseased filth.

153
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,281
You got very close to getting me.

154
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,916
You'd rather protect them and remove me.

155
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:41,319
You made my life hell.
So now I'm returning the favour.

156
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:44,763
- Keep him talking, Jake.
- Hunting the hunter.

157
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:47,680
I won't live long.
The odds are against that.

158
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:52,124
So what time I have left,
I will dedicate to you.

159
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:56,723
I'll always be close, like hide -and-seek.

160
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:59,605
Now, about Mary...

161
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:07,522
To kill a man is easy, but kill what
he loves and he dies a thousand times.

162
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:10,599
Please don't hurt her.

163
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,961
Please.

164
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:15,960
I'll see you, butyou won't see me.

165
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:18,238


166
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:26,921
Mary! Mary!

167
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:30,720
Mary! Mary!

168
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:33,526
Where is she? Mary! Mary!

169
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:50,318
Oh, jeez.

170
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,638
Agent Hendricks!

171
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,081
We got him.

172
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,757
Hey, Tommy!

173
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,766
What's the story?

174
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:49,556
Security guard spotted him
covered in blood, dressed in SWAT gear.

175
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,207
Son of a bitch didn't say a word,
just opened fire.

176
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:54,960
- Guard OK?
- He took one in the leg.

177
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:58,403
Lost a lot of blood.
Called for backup before he passed out.

178
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,116
I see you, you see me.

179
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:43,236
You on the roof, identify yourself.

180
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:46,956
Identify yourself now. This is the police.

181
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,403


182
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,162
You buyin' shares in this place?

183
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,401
Hey. Kill me again.

184
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,958
Listen to me. I...

185
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:15,238
I've been diggin' around.

186
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:21,125
There's this place out in Wyoming.
It's a detox centre.

187
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:23,163
Just hear me out this time.

188
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:26,523
It's run by a former cop for cops.

189
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:35,877
You know...

190
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:39,436
if she'd never met me,

191
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,486
never knew me, she'd still be alive.

192
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,847
I'm where I wanna be, where I should be.

193
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,683
That's where I am.

194
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,039
OK. I'll make you a deal.

195
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:03,675
You blow your brains out like a damn man

196
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:07,476
and stop pissing on Mary's memory
one sorry-ass day at a time,

197
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,797
and I'll take care of your tab.

198
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:20,639
What the fuck is...?!
What's the matter with you?!

199
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:24,037
It's all right, everybody.
A little accident. Everybody relax.

200
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:26,482
What's the matter with you?!

201
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:29,877
Whether you like it or not,
you still got a life to live.

202
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,878
It doesn't end here.

203
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:12,118


204
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,322


205
00:23:13,487 --> 00:23:16,285


206
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,997
Do you believe in reincarnation?

207
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:37,875
Transmigration of the soul?
Any of that stuff?

208
00:23:38,727 --> 00:23:42,003
I do believe I was a shitkicker
in a previous life.

209
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:12,003
Well...

210
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:15,523
nothing a few nice curtains couldn't fix up.

211
00:24:18,527 --> 00:24:22,884
Hey, look, partner,
if you ever need to return the favour,

212
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,958
make it Miami.

213
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,999
We run a dual diagnosis programme here.

214
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:33,836
A fancy way of saying
we're gonna detox your ass

215
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:37,044
and then tackle your demons
head-on in group sessions.

216
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:43,721
I was a cop for 12 years before
I took a shot at drinking myself to death.

217
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:46,241
So I know what keeps you up at night.

218
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:48,921
Gonna make it all go away, huh?

219
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:51,475
Not even gonna try.

220
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:55,526
No magic wands here.
The shit you swallowed doesn't digest.

221
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:02,916
You carryin' a weapon, Mr Malloy?

222
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,676
I'll have to confiscate it.

223
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:21,556
Need the shield, too.

224
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,996
We don't allow crutches here.

225
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,436
Thought I'd stick around awhile,

226
00:25:50,527 --> 00:25:52,722
burn up a little vacation time,

227
00:25:52,807 --> 00:25:54,843
maybe even rent me a cabin.

228
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:57,282
Do some ice fishing?

229
00:25:57,367 --> 00:26:01,679
Yeah, why not? See if I can't catch
more than a shot glass.

230
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:04,235
Hey, this is gonna be a piece of cake.

231
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,680
Doc.

232
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:15,439
The man's my better half.

233
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:19,759
I sure as hell don't intend to lose him
out here in Jerkwater, Wyoming.

234
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:22,478
Do you follow me?

235
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:26,915
Jack.

236
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:30,204
See if you can't find some boots
and a parka for this man.

237
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:33,438
Anything to serve these fine officers, Doc.

238
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:40,519
You might run into more than
a cool breeze up here.

239
00:26:41,407 --> 00:26:44,399
Come on. Let's get you checked in.

240
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:50,323
The place was built in the 50s
as a command control centre

241
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,557
for Strategic Air Command.

242
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:55,207
Satellites made the facility obsolete,

243
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:59,075
so they converted it to a military asylum.

244
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:02,159
Uncle Sam put it on the market last year.

245
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:06,126
It's isolated as hell
and that's why I chose it.

246
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,199
You're the last of our patients to arrive.

247
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,762
You know the rules, Slater.
No smoking in the rooms.

248
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,042
I'd like you to meet Jake Malloy.

249
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:23,766
We got nothin' to hide here,
including our names.

250
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:26,645
Slater, Metropolitan Police
Department of London.

251
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:29,446
I know it's a long way to come
to quit the shakes.

252
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:31,483
Club Med was fully booked.

253
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,841
Ain't exactly Betty Ford, huh?

254
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,282
Last place I was at
was a Twelve Step health spa.

255
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:48,518
Mud baths, nature walks.
We don't got TV here.

256
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:50,757
Convicted felons, Doc, get TV.

257
00:27:50,847 --> 00:27:53,759
- Jaworski here's a narc.
- And a hell of a sharpshooter.

258
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:56,680
Shut up, limey! Nobody's talkin' to you.

259
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:59,281
This is Jake Malloy, FBI.

260
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:01,881
Hey, we got a fed gracin' our presence.

261
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:08,406
Hey, Malloy, any idea of the three
most overrated things in the world?

262
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:12,605
Home cookin', home fuckin' and the FBI.

263
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:24,319
Let's get your blood and urine sample,
see what we're up against.

264
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:30,003
Our resident psychiatrist was an
air-force consultant here for four years.

265
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:34,285
When the facility shut down,
she signed on with us.

266
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:38,758
She's pulling double duty as a nurse,
till we get fully staffed.

267
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:54,682
We used to take care of
almost 100 patients here.

268
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:57,076
There's only ten of you cops.

269
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:01,763
But judging from your case files,
I don't think anyone's gonna be bored.

270
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:06,596
This is Jack Bennett, one of our orderlies.
Jake Malloy, new arrival.

271
00:29:06,687 --> 00:29:10,362
If you need anything, ask Jack. He knows
the place like the back of his hand.

272
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:12,483
That's what they say.

273
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:15,479
I know every inch of this nuthouse.

274
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,997
Anything else, ma'am?

275
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:21,078
I don't think so.

276
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:33,839
Manny, this is Jake.
See if you can fatten him up.

277
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:36,487
Hey. Hope you ain't a vegetarian.

278
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,957
- Gilbert, say hi to Jake.
- Hey, Jake. How you doin'?

279
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:44,843
You wanna hear about the generator?

280
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:49,398
Don't worry. I'll keep her hummin'
with spit and balin' wire if I have to.

281
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:57,161
- And the boiler's about to go, too, Doc.
- Then fix it. You're the caretaker, Hank.

282
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,800
Have you managed to get settled in?

283
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,276
First night's a bitch.

284
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:11,200
- How long you been here?
- Couple of days.

285
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:17,044
No one's been here more than a week.
Don't have to meet them to know them.

286
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:21,439
Take Noah there, all buffed out like a fag.
Completely paranoid.

287
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:24,519
Back-to-the-wall type.
Got SWAT written all over him.

288
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:28,441
Fuck!
Fuckin' motherfucker's motherfucked!

289
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,997
Lopez. LAPD.

290
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:37,402
Reverend Jones. Worked homicide before
he found Jesus at the bottom of a bottle.

291
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:40,763
Check out Jaworski. This guy
couldn't even swallow a bullet.

292
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:44,681
Stupid fucker missed his brain
and blew half his cheek out.

293
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:49,238
See the old guy? McKenzie. Member
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

294
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,921
Word is he froze up,
let his partner get shot.

295
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:54,521
They put him on the rubber-gun squad.

296
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:57,996
All right, let's get started.

297
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:05,920
This is what I call the witchin' hour.

298
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:08,960
No lessons, no Twelve Steps.

299
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:11,038
This is your time.

300
00:31:33,607 --> 00:31:36,075
They told me to put 'em in the bag.

301
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:38,158
The pieces.

302
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:41,876
They were so tiny.

303
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,804
Little fingers.

304
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:50,966
Every once in a while
I'd get a whole hand or... part of a leg.

305
00:31:51,807 --> 00:31:56,005
Mostly blood. It was everywhere.

306
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:06,082
Their little fingers were just...
rolling around.

307
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,081
I dropped it. I...

308
00:32:11,567 --> 00:32:15,116
I tried to gather 'em up,
but there was so much blood.

309
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:17,038
I can still smell it.

310
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:23,838
21 preschoolers were blown to pieces.

311
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:29,804
Some of their fingers
still had paint on 'em.

312
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:32,401
They were finger-painting
when it happened.

313
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:37,605
You got somethin' to add, Noah?

314
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:43,000
This ain't the Boy Scouts. This ain't
about helpin' old ladies across the street.

315
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,396
- He's just a kid.
- Oh, bullshit.

316
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:48,763
He's just weak, like the rest of you
mamsy-pamsy motherfuckers.

317
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:54,160
If you can't stand the smell of trash, why
are you workin' in the garbage business?

318
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,725
Maybe he's not as strong as us.

319
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:04,040
Maybe he never learned to like the smell.

320
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:06,436


321
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:11,282
You laugh it up, smiley. You sure as shit
won't see me swallowing my gun.

322
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:15,883
So what do you swallow?
A fifth of gin? Maybe a little speed?

323
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,083
- It ain't the same.
- Yes, it is.

324
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,401
Let's be clear about somethin'.

325
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:26,322
You people landed here for a reason.
It's not just your careers you're killin'.

326
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:30,002
Booze may be a slow burn,
but it's still suicide.

327
00:34:04,847 --> 00:34:06,838


328
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:12,078
De luxe cabin, my ass!

329
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,884
How'd it go? The first session.

330
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:51,878
I don't know. What do you wanna hear?
I got no more demons, no more monsters?

331
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,003
We all have demons.

332
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:59,477
But I stopped believing
in monsters when I was 12.

333
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:02,957
That's cos you never met any.
Don't be naive, Jenny.

334
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:07,004
Is that her ring?

335
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,326
Look, I know you mean well,

336
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:15,922
but you're in way over your head
on this one.

337
00:35:16,007 --> 00:35:19,636
Do you think words are gonna make
a difference, gonna change anything?

338
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:25,006
They're not. So just do yourself a favour
and don't waste your time on me.

339
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:41,321
Looks like we're in for one.

340
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:48,439
You know, my Mary had a scarf like that.

341
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:07,725
- We can't have this goin' on here!
- Keep out of everybody else's business.

342
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:12,722
- Don't jump over my ass. He's the one...
- I'm sure he didn't mean anything by it.

343
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:16,277
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Yeah. Something like that.

344
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:18,517
- The point is he ripped it off.
- Yeah!

345
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:23,476
Fine. Suppose he ripped it off.
What do you wanna do about it?

346
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:27,716


347
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:30,635
Did you take it?

348
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:32,718
Jack?

349
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:39,916
Maybe you should give it back.

350
00:36:51,487 --> 00:36:53,876
Thanks for the light, old-timer.

351
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:56,958
Stupid cops.

352
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,518
How you doin'?

353
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:13,318
Do you wanna get some air?

354
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:15,762
If you wanna talk, I'm right over here.

355
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:19,157
Looks like we'll be in this place a while.

356
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:45,715
Hey!

357
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:48,162
No!

358
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,600
It's OK.

359
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:03,204
It's OK. It was just a nightmare.

360
00:38:13,007 --> 00:38:15,396
Can I help you?

361
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:25,397
Here, take these. They'll help you sleep.

362
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:30,404
- Would you mind?
- Would I mind what?

363
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:34,838
Stayin' a minute.

364
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:01,962


365
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:08,802
Oh, God.

366
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:16,797
Can't get through.
Storm must have knocked down the lines.

367
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:21,085
It ain't like anyone's gonna make it out
here anyway, boss. We're socked in.

368
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:24,398
I ain't gonna think about ploughin'
until the storm breaks.

369
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,682
What are we gonna do?

370
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,803
Break the news to the group.

371
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:32,683
Hank, you get Gilbert up here
to help you move the body.

372
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:47,039
I think I'll be goin' with
just a salad tonight.

373
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,322
- Did he leave a note?
- None that I could find.

374
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:58,843
No offence, Doc, but this
mini-Alcatraz you got goin' here

375
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:01,646
ain't gonna change a goddamn thing.

376
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:06,005
You may dry a few of 'em up, but you
ain't gonna change what they're made of.

377
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:08,885
The boy was weak. We all knew that.

378
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:13,518
It was just a matter of time
before old Humpty fell off the wall.

379
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:16,246
And what about
Dudley Do-Right there, huh?

380
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,795
What a peach he is.

381
00:40:18,887 --> 00:40:23,483
30 years of bullshit war stories,
only to leave his partner for dead.

382
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:26,604
Alone. No one to watch his back.

383
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:33,764
There's nothin' worse in my book
than a goddamn yellow cop.

384
00:40:38,447 --> 00:40:42,759
You see what I mean, Doc?
You ain't the Wizard of Oz here.

385
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:44,963
You can't just hand out courage.

386
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:50,762
You're real good at kickin' 'em
when they're down, aren't you?

387
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:59,757
- Do OK when they're standing up, too.
- You never stood up to anybody.

388
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:06,363
Yeah?

389
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,683
Well, at least I'm there for my women.

390
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:23,198
That's enough.

391
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:34,876
Hey, Doc! Check it out!

392
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:40,045
Man overboard!

393
00:41:41,087 --> 00:41:44,045
- Get my bag. It's in the office.
- Earthquake!

394
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,958
- He's had alcohol.
- What's wrong?

395
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:49,278
He's on disulfiram.
Makes you puke if you even smell booze.

396
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:51,881
- He looks bad.
- Shit!

397
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,198
- Looks like he swallowed a damn dog.
- Give us a hand.

398
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:58,677
- What do you want me to do?
- Hold him. Hold him still.

399
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:03,759
A little Aqua Velva over the rocks?
I rest my case, Doc.

400
00:42:03,847 --> 00:42:05,838
Hold him.

401
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:10,400
- I want everyone's belts.

402
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,637
Off with them. Now!

403
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:15,639
- Shoelaces, too.

404
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:17,718
Do it!

405
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:21,677
I want the rooms checked
every hour on the hour.

406
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:24,759
Anything you say, Sheriff.

407
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:51,163
Hey, you know that hospital
about ten or so miles up the canyon?

408
00:42:51,247 --> 00:42:54,523
- You mean the old loony bin?
- Yeah, right.

409
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:57,883
I got a friend I'm tryin' to ring
stayin' up there.

410
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:00,527
Your friend sick in the head, is he?

411
00:43:00,607 --> 00:43:02,598
In more ways than one.

412
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:05,076
Well, the lines are down.

413
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:08,318
You a cop?

414
00:43:09,247 --> 00:43:13,126
Thought so. Been a few
passin' through here lately.

415
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:15,482
One took a cabin for the night,

416
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:20,004
bought out all my Scotch,
damn near tore it down.

417
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:22,726
Another looked like he shaved
with a cheese grater.

418
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:25,401
So how are the fish biting?

419
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:29,241
You happen to see
what's goin' on outside?

420
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:32,960
It's called the dead of winter.

421
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:35,607
I meant ice fishing.

422
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:39,396
I'd love to try my luck.
Maybe you could help me out.

423
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:44,641
Maybe. Fact is, you couldn't have
picked a better time of year.

424
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:52,805
We both know that if someone
really wants to kill themselves,

425
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:55,481
there's no stopping it.

426
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:59,603
I know you have to believe that, Jenny.

427
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:03,885
But I can't.
That's what this place is about.

428
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:07,640
Stoppin' em.

429
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:16,398
I don't get it.

430
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:20,399
Why do you put yourself through this?

431
00:44:21,647 --> 00:44:23,797
You got family, Malloy?

432
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:26,481
- No, I don't.
- Neither do I. No.

433
00:44:28,447 --> 00:44:30,438
The job is all I got.

434
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,524
I'm not a coward, you know.

435
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,723
I know that.

436
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:41,924
But try and remind yourself now and then.

437
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:44,396
That goes both ways.

438
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,603
Can't sleep?

439
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:01,882
I didn't mean to spook you.

440
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:15,244
I never knew.

441
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:17,887
Knew you could miss someone so much?

442
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:21,318
I didn't know that.

443
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:31,126
Just remember that sometimes the real
bad things in life can make you stronger.

444
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:06,037
What's the matter, cowboy?
Somebody steal your horse?

445
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:08,197
No, I just thought I heard something.

446
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:10,721
Like what?

447
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:13,116
I don't know. Something.

448
00:47:01,287 --> 00:47:03,198
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

449
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,678
Good morning to you!

450
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:09,200
Rise and shine, lazy ladies!

451
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:13,086
It's a wonderful day in the neighbourhood!

452
00:47:13,847 --> 00:47:15,599
Wakey, wakey!

453
00:47:22,087 --> 00:47:23,236
Oh...

454
00:47:24,127 --> 00:47:26,118
Doc!

455
00:47:26,967 --> 00:47:27,877
Doc!

456
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:30,638
Doc!

457
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:41,077
Two suicides back-to-back?!

458
00:47:42,687 --> 00:47:46,282
Get Mr Fed in here.
He's seen his share of dead officers.

459
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:50,881
The bruise is
in the shape of an inverted V.

460
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:54,801
- What does that mean?
- The markings say it's a suicide.

461
00:48:00,407 --> 00:48:05,197
The V is from the noose. If he was
strangled, it'd be a straight-line bruise.

462
00:48:05,287 --> 00:48:09,565
Hey, Doc. The waiting list for this place
is getting shorter by the minute.

463
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:12,525
Still taking bets on
who the next suicide's gonna be?

464
00:48:12,607 --> 00:48:16,759
The man didn't say it was a suicide.
He just said the markings say that.

465
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:25,676
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes.

466
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:28,683
And there shall be no more death.

467
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:32,756
Neither shall there be any more pain.

468
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:35,842
I'm tearin' up here, Reverend

469
00:48:58,847 --> 00:49:00,838
Shit!

470
00:49:14,287 --> 00:49:18,246
I can't risk finding any more bodies.
I'll have to lock you in your rooms.

471
00:49:18,327 --> 00:49:22,366
- Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me!
- I need to review everyone's case files.

472
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:24,483
- Lookin' for what?
- Answers.

473
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:27,604
Look, man. Solitary confinement?
No fuckin' way, man!

474
00:49:27,687 --> 00:49:31,726
- It's for your own safety.
- Nobody lockin' me up in no cell!

475
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:34,319
Is somethin' funny?

476
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:38,923
If the idea of a bunch of cops being locked
up like common criminals isn't a joke,

477
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:41,396
what is, then?

478
00:49:41,487 --> 00:49:44,479
Doctor Mitchell, can I have a word?

479
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:47,365
- What?
- Jack's missing.

480
00:49:48,727 --> 00:49:51,082
Jack's your responsibility.

481
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:53,397
Maybe he took a joyride.

482
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:56,602
We're short one snowmobile.

483
00:49:57,087 --> 00:50:00,079
- He'll freeze to death.
- He ain't the only one!

484
00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:03,921
Boiler bought the farm. Mm-hm.

485
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:23,239
Manny! Afraid soldier boy's
turned into a human ice cube by now.

486
00:50:23,327 --> 00:50:27,684
Yeah, the hell with Jack. Who knows
what that crazy fucker's up to!

487
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,798


488
00:50:55,727 --> 00:50:57,843
Conner and Brandon.

489
00:50:57,927 --> 00:51:00,839
They weren't prior suicide attempts,
were they?

490
00:51:03,047 --> 00:51:05,686
- I want you to lock your room tonight.
- Why?

491
00:51:07,047 --> 00:51:09,356
Please. Just do it.

492
00:52:57,687 --> 00:52:59,279
Damn!

493
00:53:02,007 --> 00:53:03,440
Hey! Hey!

494
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:05,518
Come back here!

495
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:09,038
Jack?

496
00:53:10,207 --> 00:53:12,198
Jack!

497
00:53:15,087 --> 00:53:17,078
Jack!

498
00:53:27,127 --> 00:53:29,163
We're droppin' like fuckin' flies!

499
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,158
Knock it off!

500
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:36,559
You're losing it. You're all losing it.

501
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:39,081
Slater's right. We're cops.

502
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:43,604
What would Slater know about bein'
a cop? Bobbies don't even carry a gun!

503
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,645
God forbid I put myself on a par
with America's finest.

504
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,799
Shut up! Communications are down.
Our meds are gone.

505
00:53:49,887 --> 00:53:53,277
One orderly and Doc, who knows
where they are! And we got two bodies.

506
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:56,564
That, and you're all in danger
of experiencing DT's.

507
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:59,639
Sweetcakes,
shakes are the least of our worries.

508
00:53:59,727 --> 00:54:02,878
You got a medical degree
we don't know about? Let her talk!

509
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:05,840
I'm not talking about the shakes.

510
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:09,556
Grand mal seizure caused by DT's...
can kill you.

511
00:54:12,927 --> 00:54:17,125
- Without meds, you're all vulnerable.
- Maybe you should tell them about Jack.

512
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:20,601
Hey, lady? What the hell
is he talkin' about?

513
00:54:20,687 --> 00:54:24,282
- I don't know.
- Bullshit! You tell 'em, or I will.

514
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,803
Jenny, Doc's missing.
Two men are dead.

515
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:30,845
If there's something you need
to tell us, now is the time.

516
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:34,317
- You should check his service record.
- I already did that.

517
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:36,967
- The guy was a patient here.
- Oh, that's great!

518
00:54:37,047 --> 00:54:41,279
The son of a bitch murdered his
commanding officer over in South Korea.

519
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:43,403
Strangled him. Psycho!

520
00:54:43,487 --> 00:54:47,480
- And you gave this crazy fuck a job?!
- Come on, Lopez! Back off.

521
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:51,037
Since when did protecting women
become your specialty, Malloy?

522
00:54:57,887 --> 00:55:00,242
You're right. It's not.

523
00:55:02,247 --> 00:55:05,319
My specialty... is doing my job...

524
00:55:06,207 --> 00:55:10,519
while the one good thing in my life
is home, being butchered.

525
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:19,323
You talk about her again,
I'm gonna kill you.

526
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:31,837
How'd Jack end up working here?

527
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:35,684
I vouched for him.
He was totally rehabilitated.

528
00:55:36,247 --> 00:55:39,557
- What about Gilbert?
- A manic-depressive. He hates violence.

529
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:43,606
Look, Jack's got nothing to do with this.
I know that.

530
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:46,645
Hey, people! Gilbert found Doc.

531
00:56:01,367 --> 00:56:03,085
Jones.

532
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:04,998
Jaworski.

533
00:56:06,207 --> 00:56:07,606
Noah.

534
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:09,882
Lopez.

535
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:14,445
That's the Scotch drinker, all
right. Guess he never made it to detox.

536
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:18,805
- You're tellin' me this guy's a cop?
- Well, that's what he said.

537
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,595
Now, what the hell is goin' on up there?

538
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,563
I need to get up there.

539
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:30,477
Whoever did this
must have used a sledge.

540
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:34,606
They hammered the living shit
out of these carburettors.

541
00:56:34,687 --> 00:56:37,281
The snowmobiles are finished.

542
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:39,642
Let's take the Suburban, go for help.

543
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:42,685
If I had extra hands, we could
dig our way out if we get stuck.

544
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:46,601
- The freezer's fillin' up fast.
- I think he's right.

545
00:56:47,727 --> 00:56:51,276
Hank, take Jenny and Gilbert.
Manny can help with the digging.

546
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:55,724
No. Weeks can't be moved. We need
someone here with medical expertise.

547
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,082
It's not a request.
You don't have to be here.

548
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:02,001
Where would I be safer? Riding through
a whiteout with some yahoo like Hank,

549
00:57:02,087 --> 00:57:05,602
or sitting here
in a room full of armed officers?

550
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:10,363
How about you?

551
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:13,041
No way. I'm gonna go down with the ship.

552
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:17,081
You guys go while there's still some light.

553
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,839
We're outta here!

554
00:57:18,927 --> 00:57:20,724
C'mon, Gilbert, let's go.

555
00:57:22,407 --> 00:57:25,160
- Now what?
- We can rotate two-man shifts on
watch.

556
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:29,126
- Who made you king shit?
- He's ranking officer.

557
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:32,756
- I ain't in uniform.
- I thought SWAT boys were team players.

558
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:36,760
My team doesn't wait around to get hit
by a shitstorm. We are the shitstorm.

559
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:42,080
I'm with Noah. I say we find
this crazy piece of shit and Frosty his ass.

560
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,158
How do you know it's Jack?

561
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:46,759
How do you know that?

562
00:57:46,847 --> 00:57:50,283
How do you know it's not...
Lopez, or Jones?

563
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,961
How do we know it isn't Slater?

564
00:57:53,047 --> 00:57:55,038
How do I know it isn't you?

565
00:57:55,447 --> 00:57:57,438
Me?

566
00:57:59,407 --> 00:58:01,318
Yeah... right!

567
00:58:02,887 --> 00:58:05,321
You better keep an eye
on that one, nursie.

568
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:08,401
He crackin'!

569
00:58:08,487 --> 00:58:11,843
Split the building into sections.
Each person will clear an area.

570
00:58:11,927 --> 00:58:14,316
Point me in the direction.

571
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:22,163
I see you.

572
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:25,207
Butyou won't see me.

573
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:54,638
He'll die without it.

574
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:58,484
Jenny, where'd you find Conner's body?

575
00:59:31,047 --> 00:59:35,086
Hank! Do ya think
we can get the truck through yet?

576
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:37,158
Keep digging, Manny.

577
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,758


578
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:49,478
What was that?

579
00:59:56,487 --> 00:59:59,797
- Gilbert's gone!
- I don't give a shit where he's gone!

580
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:03,197
We're gettin' the hell outta here!
Get in the truck.

581
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:23,645
What's that?

582
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:25,604
Look out! Look out!

583
01:00:37,127 --> 01:00:39,561


584
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:52,879
Anything scares you, kill it.

585
01:01:26,407 --> 01:01:28,762
Hank! Where'd you go?

586
01:01:33,287 --> 01:01:34,515
Hank!

587
01:01:38,767 --> 01:01:40,883
Jack!

588
01:01:50,927 --> 01:01:53,122


589
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:58,323


590
01:02:17,687 --> 01:02:19,279
Jack.

591
01:02:38,127 --> 01:02:40,118


592
01:02:40,767 --> 01:02:42,723


593
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:12,516
Gilbert!

594
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:14,518
- Wait!

595
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:52,601
Hey.

596
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:56,436
Frozen corpses don't bite.

597
01:03:56,527 --> 01:04:01,157
- You're used to seeing bodies. I'm not.
- It's OK.

598
01:04:01,687 --> 01:04:04,759
Weeks is burning up. I need ice.
Will you get it for me?

599
01:04:04,847 --> 01:04:06,565


600
01:04:09,527 --> 01:04:11,995


601
01:04:24,247 --> 01:04:27,125
Who's the fuckin' brainiac
that locked the door?!

602
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,921
- Shit!
- What were you doing outside?

603
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:36,316
Noah told me to check for tracks.

604
01:04:36,407 --> 01:04:39,797
- Did you see Malloy?
- Why? Should I have seen him?

605
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:45,237
Is there something goin' on here
I should know about?

606
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:10,558


607
01:05:23,047 --> 01:05:25,038


608
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:31,886
Jack?

609
01:05:35,287 --> 01:05:37,437
Come on, now, Jacky boy...

610
01:05:40,447 --> 01:05:42,517
No more games.

611
01:06:08,647 --> 01:06:10,638


612
01:06:11,207 --> 01:06:12,560


613
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:36,683
Main circuit board died with
McKenzie. That means no power, no heat.

614
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:39,327
The emergency lights
are not gonna last long.

615
01:06:39,407 --> 01:06:42,046
Great! It's gonna be
20 below in here by morning!

616
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:43,606


617
01:06:46,327 --> 01:06:50,525
This is bullshit! This is bullshit, Malloy!

618
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,916
- Come on.
- Malloy!

619
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:56,645
- What happened?
- Jack and Manny are dead. Hank's gone.

620
01:06:56,727 --> 01:06:59,082
- Where's Gilbert?
- He saw me and he bolted.

621
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:02,284
- He's still out there?
- I found the missing snowmobile.

622
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:04,517
Whoever took it
burned the personal files.

623
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:07,758
- Why?
- Makes it impossible to prove who's who.

624
01:07:07,847 --> 01:07:09,758
One of us isn't a cop.

625
01:07:12,847 --> 01:07:15,441
Give me a knife.

626
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,605
What are you looking for?
What are you looking for?!

627
01:07:27,687 --> 01:07:31,475
- Confirmation!
- Confirmation of what?!

628
01:07:55,927 --> 01:07:58,361
I see you. You see me.

629
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:03,121
- He's here.
- What are you talking about?

630
01:08:03,207 --> 01:08:05,243
He's here!

631
01:08:27,527 --> 01:08:29,085
Agh!

632
01:08:48,407 --> 01:08:49,840
Dead...

633
01:08:50,407 --> 01:08:54,036
- Dead... dead...
- What'd he say?

634
01:08:54,127 --> 01:08:56,322
- All dead.
- They're all dead.

635
01:08:57,287 --> 01:09:00,802
Open up! Come on, open up!

636
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:09,720
For the last time, I got out of there
when I saw Jack strung up.

637
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:12,002
I almost got lost in the blizzard.

638
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:15,443
I'm coming back through
the utility tunnels when Malloy comes in.

639
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:19,884
He's not just down there for a walk,
so I hide behind the woodpile, OK?

640
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:23,596
It's not Malloy. I was with him.
He went out there to help you.

641
01:09:23,687 --> 01:09:26,485
Well, what do I know?!

642
01:09:28,007 --> 01:09:32,398
Malloy should stay
locked in my cell. Just to be safe.

643
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:33,806
Yeah?

644
01:09:36,927 --> 01:09:42,763
Tell you what... you don't have to be a fed
to read a flashing sign.

645
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:46,123
Maybe it's time for Reverend Jones
to explain the artwork!

646
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:51,525
Don't you ever paw me, boy.
You understand?

647
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:19,239
Maybe Malloy was right
about one of us not being a cop.

648
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:21,716
Somebody was out there in that storm.

649
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,596
If it wasn't Hank, or Malloy,

650
01:10:26,407 --> 01:10:27,999
who was it?

651
01:10:28,087 --> 01:10:30,840
You were outside looking for tracks, right?

652
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:33,839
Right. And I got locked out.

653
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:36,122
Did you?

654
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:43,163
Guess my cover's finally blown.

655
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:46,125
Ignorant assholes.
It's not me, it's one of you.

656
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:49,040
Get the fuck outta my face!
Get the fuck outta my face!

657
01:10:49,127 --> 01:10:51,038
- Drop the gun!
- Noah, don't!

658
01:10:51,127 --> 01:10:53,083
- Back off!
- Drop the gun, asshole!

659
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:56,682
- Mine shoots bullets, too, motherfucker!
- Stop it!

660
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:15,241
I feel safer already.

661
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,762
Christ, it's Slater.

662
01:11:48,647 --> 01:11:52,003
I'm very close.
So close, you don't know it.

663
01:11:52,927 --> 01:11:55,646
I stare into your eyes,
andyou see nothing.

664
01:11:57,607 --> 01:12:00,883
I see you. Butyou don't see me.

665
01:12:02,647 --> 01:12:05,207
So what did the fed say
about all this?

666
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:08,916
He talked like it was someone
he knew. Someone he tracked.

667
01:12:09,007 --> 01:12:12,204
- The cop killer?
- He's dead, isn't he?

668
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,278
He'd better be.

669
01:12:15,407 --> 01:12:18,558
Hey, any cop killer steps my way,
I'll cap his ass.

670
01:12:18,887 --> 01:12:20,843
Well, let's hope you do.

671
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:25,640
- What do you mean, hope?
- You've studied guys like this, Doc.

672
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:32,042
They don't just kill you.
They play with you.

673
01:12:32,127 --> 01:12:34,163
Hey, man, I don't wanna hear this, OK?

674
01:12:34,247 --> 01:12:37,045
They gouge out your eyes,
shove things down your throat.

675
01:12:37,127 --> 01:12:39,004
Are you deaf?

676
01:12:39,087 --> 01:12:41,647
Maybe the Lord's got other plans.

677
01:12:42,527 --> 01:12:45,121
Maybe we'll freeze to death first.

678
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:47,767
You wanna show us
where that woodpile is?

679
01:12:50,207 --> 01:12:53,517
What, are you nuts?!
I ain't goin' back down there.

680
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:58,686
Well, I ain't goin' down there by myself.

681
01:13:02,407 --> 01:13:03,806
Lead on.

682
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:48,604
- Wood store's down this way.
- Sh!

683
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,356
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

684
01:13:54,247 --> 01:13:56,681
I think we got company.

685
01:13:57,487 --> 01:13:59,796
Not for long.

686
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:03,286
You two... clear that one.

687
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:05,799
I got this one.

688
01:14:10,007 --> 01:14:11,998
Come on.

689
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,398
Move!

690
01:14:50,327 --> 01:14:52,887
I found that hidden above Slater's room.

691
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:59,358
It's him.

692
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:02,523
He's taking trophies.

693
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:05,796
If we're gonna get outta here,
here's what we do.

694
01:15:05,887 --> 01:15:09,926
You and Lopez check upstairs.
I'll take the tunnels.

695
01:15:10,687 --> 01:15:13,155
- Jenny, you stay here with Jaworski.
- Why?!

696
01:15:13,687 --> 01:15:15,882
Please, just trust me.

697
01:15:19,527 --> 01:15:21,518
Hank!

698
01:15:22,447 --> 01:15:24,324
Slater!

699
01:15:24,807 --> 01:15:26,798
Hank!

700
01:15:27,687 --> 01:15:29,439
Slater!

701
01:15:29,527 --> 01:15:31,916
- Hey, cop.

702
01:15:33,007 --> 01:15:35,077
Drop the weapon.

703
01:15:41,407 --> 01:15:43,796
Hands behind your head.

704
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:46,317
Fingers locked.

705
01:15:46,407 --> 01:15:48,045
That's it.

706
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,277
Now, on your knees.

707
01:15:55,007 --> 01:16:00,400
You know, I like playing cop.
How do you like playing the victim? Huh?

708
01:16:00,487 --> 01:16:02,955
D'you like how it feels?

709
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:19,677
- Come on.
- Please.

710
01:16:19,767 --> 01:16:21,166
Please.

711
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:25,003
Wasn't it you who was gonna cap my ass,
tough guy?

712
01:16:26,047 --> 01:16:28,038


713
01:16:31,047 --> 01:16:33,242
Open your eyes.

714
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:35,318
Look at me.

715
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:38,722
That a boy! See?

716
01:16:41,527 --> 01:16:43,518
Look here.

717
01:16:43,607 --> 01:16:46,121
You see somebody comin' up them stairs,

718
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:50,676
you let faith guide that bullet
right through their head.

719
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,445
Right?

720
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,435
Malloy.

721
01:17:12,087 --> 01:17:14,203
Malloy!

722
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:16,555
Malloy.

723
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:20,358
Malloy!

724
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:28,117
I see you, Malloy.
Butyou still don't see me.

725
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:31,243
Fuck you!

726
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:39,917
We've got to do something!

727
01:17:40,647 --> 01:17:42,638
Why?

728
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:45,442
Malloy's already dead.

729
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:52,482
- Who was he?
- Who?

730
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,444
Your stand-in.

731
01:17:54,527 --> 01:17:58,315
Oh, you mean the real Mr Slater
I tracked up here.

732
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:02,195
Last I saw, he was detoxing
at the bottom ofa frozen lake.

733
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:06,164
I didn't think you'd mind
me borrowing his name and his badge.

734
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:10,035
From there, it was easy.
Ijust came here and blended in.

735
01:18:10,127 --> 01:18:13,119
You're real good at blending in,
aren't ya, scumbag?

736
01:18:13,207 --> 01:18:17,405
Is that how you found out about this
place? Just blending in at the cop bar?

737
01:18:17,487 --> 01:18:19,478
That doesn't matter now.

738
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:22,843
What matters is I got to you
before you got to me.

739
01:18:31,607 --> 01:18:34,201
People will ask if I was insane.

740
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:38,360
Just the opposite. An insane man
could not have accomplished this.

741
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:42,478
All these deaths, including Mary's,
weren't irrational.

742
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:44,603
They were to prove a point.

743
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:48,004
You cannot control
what nature intended, Malloy.

744
01:18:48,087 --> 01:18:50,681
We 're born to perform a duty,
which I've done.

745
01:18:51,207 --> 01:18:53,880
And so you finally see me.

746
01:18:54,607 --> 01:18:55,756
Now what?

747
01:18:55,847 --> 01:19:00,159
You know, you never feel more alive than
when you're watching someone else die.

748
01:19:00,247 --> 01:19:03,398
Like when I stared at poor Mary.

749
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:07,075
But once again, Malloy,

750
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:09,158
you're too late.

751
01:19:09,927 --> 01:19:13,522
Now I imagine
you are staring at poor Noah.

752
01:19:24,727 --> 01:19:26,524
Malloy!

753
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:28,958
Malloy!

754
01:19:30,007 --> 01:19:33,238
- Malloy!
- Dj vu, huh, Malloy?

755
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:36,399
How many second chances
do you get in life?

756
01:19:36,807 --> 01:19:39,526
You think you're strong enough
to stop me?

757
01:19:52,407 --> 01:19:54,443
Run, Jenny! Run!

758
01:19:54,527 --> 01:19:56,995
You're too young to die.

759
01:20:14,087 --> 01:20:16,157
Run, Jenny! Run!

760
01:20:17,487 --> 01:20:19,478
Run!

761
01:20:20,647 --> 01:20:22,763
I'll cut her fucking heart out.

762
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:11,881
Jenny... I like your eyes.

763
01:21:16,327 --> 01:21:18,716
Let me see your eyes.

764
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:24,600
Did I mention I hear voices?

765
01:21:24,687 --> 01:21:30,000
Right now I hear Malloy...
pleading for his precious Mary.

766
01:21:33,087 --> 01:21:35,237
You stay here!

767
01:21:35,727 --> 01:21:37,957
I'm gonna follow these tracks.

768
01:21:38,247 --> 01:21:40,283
Make me work for it.

769
01:21:56,127 --> 01:21:58,004
Do you see me?

770
01:21:58,087 --> 01:22:00,078
Cos I see you.

771
01:22:20,447 --> 01:22:22,438
Stay... here.

772
01:22:50,087 --> 01:22:52,317
Freeze! Drop the weapon!

773
01:22:54,087 --> 01:22:56,078
On your knees.

774
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:01,038
Hands behind your head.

775
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:05,123
Lock your fingers. It's your turn now.

776
01:23:06,967 --> 01:23:09,322
It's time to die.

777
01:23:10,887 --> 01:23:13,162
Now, look at me.

778
01:23:19,727 --> 01:23:21,445
Slater!

779
01:25:16,207 --> 01:25:24,205
She... called out your... name...

780
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:36,285
just before I... drained the life... from her.

781
01:25:45,967 --> 01:25:47,320
I see you.

782
01:25:47,407 --> 01:25:49,967
You see... this.

783
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:36,558
You OK?
