1
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Sorry about yesterday when
I saw his body at the viewing.

2
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,840
I should have controlled myself.

3
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,760
No, you had no reason.

4
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
Helene did not deserve to see
how you cried over his body.

5
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,440
Do you think I did it on purpose?
I'm not stupid!

6
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,320
She knew that you slept with him.
I thought that you were more mature.

7
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,000
If you had sleep with someone else.

8
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
Like an outsider.
We could have kept the family together.

9
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,800
Is that why Ouessem and
Tony are angry with me?

10
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,680
How dare you come?

11
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,080
Does Jimenez know?
- No.

12
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,400
I don't think he'd let her come if he knew.

13
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,240
- We should tell them.
- Forget it.

14
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,080
Jimenez knew she had a relationship with
Rivoallan, and doesn't need to know more.

15
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,000
- Yes, but don't you think ...
- What?

16
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,840
Aurore is one of us,
you're not. So shut up!

17
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,200
We made a mistake,
but today we must be united.

18
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,800
I only have you.

19
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,200
So I said nothing.

20
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,120
I know Ouessem would never understand.

21
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,960
- Ouessem has his principles.
- No.

22
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,360
He has a lot of anger.

23
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Mathias was everything to
me and that bothers you.

24
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
No, it's you who bothers me.

25
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,960
You do whatever you want, I don't give a shit.

26
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,560
But lets make you the victim.
I need a soldier, not a crybaby.

27
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,720
Impeccable, as always.

28
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,960
What's this?
- A medallion that was my aunts.

29
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
For protection.

30
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,760
I know what you do.

31
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,440
It's not what you think.
- Ouessem, don't lie to me.

32
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,160
Not to me.

33
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,440
I know what you do.

34
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,440
I lost my husband.
And I don't want to lose my family.

35
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,800
Listen well, Ouessem.

36
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,400
You're the one I trust.
So promise me one thing.

37
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,560
Bring everyone back.
Unharmed.

38
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,600
Promise.

39
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,080
I promise.

40
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,000
You'll be OK.

41
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,520
You don't think I knew about Aurore...

42
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm not stupid.

43
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,320
He slept with her for 20 years.
But I knew my husband better than you.

44
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,400
Listen to me Frank.

45
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,720
I trust in you.

46
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,120
You have to promise me something.

47
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,320
Promise you will kill the pigs that did this!

48
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,680
Promise me that you will kill them all!

49
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,120
Everyone!

50
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
What do you want from me?

51
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,640
No!

52
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,840
- Where are they?
- I don't know who you're talking about!

53
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,720
- Where are they?
- I don't know who ...

54
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,680
- Where are they?

55
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,360
- I'll ask you again!
- I don't know what you mean.

56
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
Where are the Markudis?
Where are the Markudis?

57
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,560
I don't know what you're talking about!

58
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,320
Where are they?

59
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
- What's happening?
- Leave him alone!

60
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,120
- Tony, get rid of them!
- What are you doing?

61
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,960
- Out!
- Pigs!

62
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,280
- Don't mess in my private affairs!
- Get out at once!

63
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,480
They have spent two days in hiding.

64
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,840
Where?

65
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,080
- I didn't get it from Rivoallan.

66
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,120
- Do you want to stay with us?

67
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,640
In the northern area.

68
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,960
- What?
- In the northern area.

69
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,360
In the district Charonne.

70
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,240
They are hiding with his men.

71
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,640
Rivoallan ...

72
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,600
was like our brother.

73
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,480
The Markudis killed him like a dog.

74
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm not being sentimental.

75
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
I just want to kill those bastards.

76
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
I want to see ...

77
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,920
how they beg for their lives.

78
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,120
I thought this place was deserted.

79
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,960
We'll be seen.

80
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,800
So what?
We eliminate anyone that gets in our way.

81
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,320
Come on!

82
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,880
Sékounade, Nabil, go home.
- Don't tell us what to do.

83
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,040
Stop bothering us.

84
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,200
Around the back.

85
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,800
Jimenez, I didn't come here for a bloodbath.

86
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,800
Well does it make you feel better?

87
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,280
You don't understand.

88
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,640
We'll have to play dirty.

89
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,440
We're just here for Markudi.

90
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,840
Ouessem, you're a good guy, I know that.

91
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,120
But do not forget why we are here.

92
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,600
Today, we came for a bloodbath.

93
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,200
Come on!

94
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,720
Ouessem, they are the enemy.
Remember that.

95
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,080
THE HORDE

96
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,680
Ohh ..! Quiet!

97
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,200
What's going on?

98
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,480
Who are you?

99
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,280
Relax, I'm the lookout.

100
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,840
Well, I was. There is nothing
more to lookout for in this sty.

101
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,680
Is this a raid?

102
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,120
It's for the immigrants upstairs?
- How many?

103
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,560
Seven, eight.

104
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,880
Not to mention the security guards.
- Anyone else upstairs?

105
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,600
No.
The building is condemned.

106
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,880
The damned bourgeois and we are poor.

107
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,280
Some poor families are here.

108
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,400
Never thought to see it in France.
- Get lost. You didn't see us.

109
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,160
Go on!

110
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,600
Who do they think they are?
This building is mine.

111
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,000
Waste anyone who comes out alive.

112
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,640
Tony, take care of the door.

113
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,960
You two are on opposite sides.

114
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
Nobody moves until I give the signal.

115
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,440
We'll teach 'em The Marseillaise!

116
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,200
We have to go.

117
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,800
Finish him, Ade.

118
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
He is no longer good for us.

119
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,080
Able to catch them with it.
- Get out.

120
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,440
Believe me, it's better than their pellet gun.

121
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,960
Jimenez!

122
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,640
Tony!

123
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,480
I'll fill you with bullets!

124
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,440
Don't move. Give me that.

125
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
What is this?

126
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,960
Let me see your face!

127
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,040
How beautiful.

128
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Who are you?

129
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,760
I'll blow them all away.
- No.

130
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,880
Go on!

131
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,000
Go on!

132
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,640
Come here.
Hurry!

133
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,000
Go tell the others.

134
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,600
Do not let anyone enter the building.
Nobody!

135
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,880
Let me go, damn it!
Let me go!

136
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,440
Shut up.

137
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,840
I said shut up.

138
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,920
Look at me.

139
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,600
I said look at me.

140
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,360
What are you doing?

141
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,680
How many more are out there?

142
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,520
Look at me!

143
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,320
They came looking for someone?

144
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,920
That's why we are here?

145
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,120
Shit Bola!
My suit!

146
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,880
Shit, I'm not your maid.

147
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,240
You piss me off.

148
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,720
I don't understand a word you're saying.

149
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Shut your mouth.

150
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,640
Shit!

151
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,080
Drop it!

152
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,800
Whether you end up like him?

153
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,320
Look at you cops, so pathetic, with your toy guns.

154
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,640
They hoped to catch us?

155
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,840
In our country, we would have
had you hung by the balls.

156
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,440
What will you do?

157
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,840
Bola!

158
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,000
They can't be alone.

159
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,880
Let's get out of here, before we are surrounded.

160
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,640
We're not leaving ...

161
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,360
...while these cretins don't say what is out there.

162
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,720
Upstairs went all wrong block everything.

163
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,360
Forget it!

164
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,400
They don't want to talk.

165
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,720
He is right, let's finish them off.

166
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,920
There's nobody out there!

167
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,920
We came alone.

168
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,320
Don't lie to me!

169
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,920
Don't lie to me.

170
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,160
You alerted the entire police station?

171
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,160
Answer me!

172
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,000
Answer me!

173
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,720
I don't know who they are!

174
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,840
You can show that gun all you want.

175
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,960
We came here alone, Rivoallan paid for it.

176
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,160
Kill. Kill everyone.

177
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,560
All this for a fucking cop?

178
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,760
What going on, Ade?

179
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,400
What the fuck is this?

180
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Step aside!

181
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,240
Son of a bitch!

182
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,760
It's not possible.

183
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,840
What's happening?
I just killed him.

184
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,920
And he stood up?

185
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,040
Don't move!

186
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,520
My goodness!
Ade!

187
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,200
Shit!

188
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,880
Ade!

189
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,600
Come on!

190
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,680
Come on!

191
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,680
It's unreal!

192
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,000
The bar!
Get the bar!

193
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,120
Hurry, up!

194
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,440
Hurry the bar!

195
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,400
They devoured the Czech.
They ate the Czech.

196
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,000
Bola!

197
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,800
Ouessem!

198
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,720
What's happening?

199
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,320
What the hell is going on Ouessem?

200
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,240
Ouessem!

201
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
They're coming.

202
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,640
They're coming to get us.

203
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,560
I guess we can leave.
We have to try.

204
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,160
You saw what they did
with the Czech. Ate his face.

205
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,960
Don't be a sissy, Bola.
I'll bust their heads in.

206
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,600
There is nothing to do.

207
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,440
Absolutely nothing.

208
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,280
The judgment is final.

209
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,520
Look at them.
They broke down the doors with one hand.

210
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,720
They rip out your guts with their teeth.

211
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,360
Bullets don't stop them.

212
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,080
You can't kill them,
because they are already dead.

213
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,360
There are thousands of them.

214
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,040
We're screwed.
It won't help if we do anything.

215
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,400
It's a death sentence, don't you see?

216
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,560
We'll all die.
Shut up!

217
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,480
Whatever you want, we'll leave.

218
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,640
What will you do, get down with a rope?

219
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,840
That's the only way out.
And the bodies are everywhere.

220
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,400
How you doing?

221
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,000
Don't listen to him.
Come at once.

222
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,880
Listen, Markudi.
You, your brother and idiot friend...

223
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,160
...are three.

224
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,160
Don't count on these suckers here.

225
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,240
But together we have a chance.

226
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

227
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,240
You seem to disagree.

228
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,920
You can't do that.
Shut up.

229
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,080
Stop!
Shut up. We agree.

230
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,560
Listen, I'm not your friend.

231
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,640
I don't care for you.

232
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,560
But I want to get out of here alive.

233
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,360
And our chances are better with you.

234
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,600
Or don't you agree.

235
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,760
Or we split up now on this damn roof.

236
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,360
No time to think.

237
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,560
We'll go down together
then we'll part ways.

238
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,320
Separating?
He is deceiving you, Ade.

239
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,720
Your girlfriend here...
can she use a gun?

240
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,960
Don't worry about me.

241
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,200
Control your group.

242
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,160
Control yours.

243
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,560
We need guns and drugs.

244
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,720
Do you have a cache?

245
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,520
Guns, yes.

246
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,120
I can't help with the rest.

247
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,680
Don't move.

248
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,360
They're gone.

249
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,480
They took Jimenez's body.
- Help me.

250
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,200
That's all we have.

251
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,760
Forget your homemade remedies.
This is what he needs.

252
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,640
Stop, Ouessem it hurts.

253
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,040
He is right, this will end the pain.

254
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,520
Are you sure?

255
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
See?
He knows what's good for him.

256
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,240
Where're you going?
- I'll be right back. Rest.

257
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,640
Slowly!
He's worse than you.

258
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,720
Why did you join with these cretins?

259
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,040
I know you don't like it.

260
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,680
Neither do I.
But we have no choice.

261
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,080
See Tony.

262
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,360
This is bullshit, Ouessem.

263
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,040
We can't trust those bastards.

264
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,480
You got us into this mess.
- What?

265
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,960
Was it you who got us into this.

266
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,920
No that was you with fucking Rivoallan.

267
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,640
Calling him every night crying.

268
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,880
You said you were pregnant.

269
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
When he was looking for these assholes.

270
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
Tony told you that?

271
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,760
No matter who, Aurore.

272
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,640
You messed up his head.

273
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,400
This mess is your fault.

274
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,920
When you're finished, we can try it out.

275
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,960
You know this building.
What's the plan?

276
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Avoid leaving traces of blood.
- That's your plan?

277
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,440
This building is rotting.

278
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,920
The elevator only goes to the fourth
floor. And you can't use the balconies.

279
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,040
The service stairs were never
finished. Understand the situation?

280
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,160
Have a better idea, then?

281
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,840
That's what I thought.

282
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,040
Let’s get another ladder.

283
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,240
Wait.
They should be at the entrance.

284
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,280
"They should be at the entrance."

285
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,080
Scary.

286
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,000
Shit!

287
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,960
What was that?

288
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,920
Go, Bola.

289
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,520
Jo.

290
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,000
We need to go, Jo.

291
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,960
Come on!

292
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,080
Come on!
- Wait!

293
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,680
Tony!

294
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,760
Don't shoot!

295
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,480
Don't worry about it.

296
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,640
Bola!
My leg!

297
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,960
Ade!

298
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,720
Hands off!

299
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,640
Ade!

300
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,600
What would you do without me?

301
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
Tony!

302
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,920
Aurore! Tony!
They need us.

303
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Let it go!
It's too late.

304
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
I know these calls.

305
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,680
Go ahead.

306
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,960
What is stopping you?

307
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,720
Two cops killed, and we are stuck with the lame.

308
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,360
You think you're funny?

309
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,480
Shut up, Bola!

310
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,040
Back off.

311
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,920
This is how it keeps track of your group?

312
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,200
You're alone now.

313
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,680
If you want to work with us...

314
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,120
you better stop being so sensitive.

315
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,840
I'm sure she's alive.

316
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,040
If so, hope that she has courage.

317
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,960
Bitch.

318
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,240
Are you okay?

319
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,800
Show me.
The bleeding has stopped.

320
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,080
The dog bit my shoulder.

321
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,520
Can you walk?

322
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,120
Yes.

323
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,040
Holy shit!

324
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,920
Don't move!

325
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,480
Lower your guns, I'm not one of them.

326
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,600
I told you not to move.

327
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,760
You gave them a good beating.

328
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,120
It's good, no?

329
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,800
Like the battle of Dien Bien Phu!

330
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,720
How many did you smoke?

331
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,480
How many did the Chinese smoke?

332
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,920
I didn't say.

333
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,720
A half dozen, I think.

334
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,920
I'm getting rusty in my old age.

335
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,960
What are you doing here?

336
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,360
Keeping the post.

337
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,520
They saw the mess on the ladder?

338
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,920
I blew them to smithereens.

339
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,760
Handmade explosives.

340
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,840
I ran out of grenades in '64.

341
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,880
You live on this floor?

342
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,560
Yes.

343
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,360
You were bitten, weren't you?

344
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,200
Need to take care of it.

345
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,120
I get around, come with me.

346
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,800
Don't trust this old man.

347
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,760
Take his gun.
We will try to find the others.

348
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,160
They got you good.

349
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
Shit!

350
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,640
Who's the pussy now?

351
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,240
Let me see.
Move your hand!

352
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,040
Quiet, monster.
We have to avoid gangrene.

353
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,120
What did he call me?
- Forget it.

354
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,560
A cop is sometimes helpful.
- What?

355
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,080
Why is he taking care of me?

356
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,720
Do I look like a nurse?

357
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,600
Want to be alone?

358
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,320
Screw it.

359
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,080
Hey Grandpa. Is there anything
stronger than this to drink?

360
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,240
It hurts.

361
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,120
What are you doing?

362
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,720
I'll have to cut the leg off.

363
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,000
What?

364
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,720
Are you kidding?

365
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,960
If it rots, that won't help get
the Chinese out there.

366
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,200
Cut, cut.

367
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,600
Try it.
- Easy.

368
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,520
Stay out it.
- He's right.

369
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,400
Shut up.
- I have to amputate the leg.

370
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,200
Nobody touches my leg.

371
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,080
Easy.

372
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,880
Back off, grandpa.

373
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,520
I have to amputate his leg.
- He's crazy.

374
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,240
What did he do?

375
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,640
Say it to my face.
- You're crazy!

376
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,120
We must cut off his leg.

377
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,880
No way.
- Stop it.

378
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,840
Easy!
- We have to amputate.

379
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,360
The old man is crazy.
- Amputate, amputate!

380
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,720
Nobody touches my leg.

381
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,240
Enough!
- Stop it!

382
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,040
We have to amputate his leg.

383
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,360
Ouessem should not have said that.

384
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,480
What?

385
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,280
Rivoallan was not your fault.

386
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,520
You shouldn't have opened your mouth.

387
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,880
I know.

388
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,320
When Ouessem knew you
were pregnant, he thought ...

389
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,800
What?
- What that I did it on purpose?

390
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,040
You all think I'm a bitch.

391
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,320
I never said that.

392
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,520
Not my fault.

393
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,520
Not my fault.

394
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,040
I regret what happened, that's all.

395
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,640
Repentance?

396
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,800
Think you have time to regret?

397
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,760
What happened?

398
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,120
Want to know?

399
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,520
Damn his apologies.

400
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,360
He can swallow his words.

401
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,200
I owe nothing to anyone.

402
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,160
You mean nothing to me.

403
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,240
Ouessem means nothing to me.

404
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,200
I don't care about anything.

405
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,320
What are you doing?

406
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,840
That's all that matters.

407
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,200
Cuff yourself.

408
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,600
You can't do this to me.
- Cuff yourself.

409
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,160
If you leave me here, I will die.
I beg you.

410
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,400
Please Aurore, don't do this to me.

411
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,160
Cuff yourself now!

412
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,760
You can't leave me here.

413
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,360
If you leave me here, I will die.

414
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,280
I don't want to die here.
- Cuff yourself.

415
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,640
I don't want to die.

416
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,760
I beg you, Aurore.
Don't let me die.

417
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,400
You're already dead, Tony.

418
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,680
Don't worry, it's broken.
- Shit.

419
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,320
You better take care of the monster,
he needs help.

420
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,320
He is fine,
and he's not a monster.

421
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,560
As you wish.
But I know what I'm talking about.

422
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,840
When your friend turns Chinese
we have to take him out.

423
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,880
Those things are contagious.
- You tire me, old man.

424
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,400
See how he speaks, his worm.
- Leave him, Bola.

425
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,640
Ok, forget it.

426
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,080
I was young once.
He is insignificant.

427
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,040
And now?
- Hold it, guys?

428
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,520
We are safe here, I locked the door.

429
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,920
I have a pear brandy.

430
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,920
Fifteen years old.

431
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,320
What do you think?

432
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,440
I can't drink alone.

433
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,800
Their religion does not allow it?
- I don't believe in God.

434
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,600
Call me Rene.

435
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,680
Take it.

436
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,040
Religion is just death insurance.
Right?

437
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,960
And I badly need it now.

438
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,840
Am I right?

439
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,520
This shit is hardcore.
- What?

440
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,720
"Hardcore," brutal.

441
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,560
"Hardcore"?

442
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,400
I'll pass.

443
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,920
Good to see that there are still men like you.

444
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,200
To your health.

445
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,400
Say there, soldier...

446
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,880
you did not learn to make bombs here.

447
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,560
How did you survive?

448
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,840
I have a good hiding place.

449
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,840
I received good training on the front.

450
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,360
If my wife Clemence
was alive, you would have seen.

451
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,040
120 pounds of sagging,
udder banging against her knees...

452
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,320
...hands like hams.

453
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,480
You would think twice before
putting your hands on her ass.

454
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,600
We laugh, but...

455
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,080
A big girl.

456
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,880
You can say that again.
But it must be tough here.

457
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,240
You have to have balls.

458
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,120
And there always comes a sucker
wanting to rule the henhouse.

459
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,800
I see.
- I'm not complaining.

460
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,520
Clem could not stand it here,
but I never cared.

461
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,840
There seems a lot more...

462
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,200
but after Indochina...

463
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,840
no Chinese will keep me, agreed.

464
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,880
Depends on who.
- Don't ruin it, cop.

465
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,920
What? Are you kidding?
You're a cop?

466
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,800
What are you doing here alone?

467
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,720
I came here for justice.

468
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,120
Came to lessen the injustice.
- Didn't go as planned.

469
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,400
Look around you, the world is upside down.

470
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,800
The Chinese are not the first
to cause problems here.

471
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,000
We've been eating shit for 30 years.

472
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Just like Mother Teresa, but getting nothing.

473
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,640
Want to know the truth?

474
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,560
You came because you're like us.

475
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,240
You want to be in the forefront.

476
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,840
Turns you on, no?

477
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,640
Excites you.

478
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,800
Excites you.

479
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,320
We do not know if the epidemic is spreading ...

480
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,520
Turn it up, I can't hear.

481
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,600
Outside is a mess.

482
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,880
I'm with a group survivors.

483
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,960
It's a massacre;
Hundreds are dead.

484
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,960
The army ordered an evacuation.

485
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,760
Downtown is inaccessible.

486
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,720
Hundreds of survivors were
assembled outside the capital...

487
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,040
...and sent to the
military base in Villacoublay.

488
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,840
The capital?

489
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,560
Where is our evacuation?

490
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,080
This reminds me of Abuja.

491
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,640
Going down the stairs, is impossible.

492
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,680
Do I have to spell it out?

493
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,200
The fact that it’s an entry,
doesn't make it an exit.

494
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
You guys really want to
wander around, waiting...

495
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,880
...for these freaks who want to eat us?
We should go straight out...

496
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,240
...and run for it.
- Let me get this straight.

497
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,000
Go up the elevator shaft
with my friend José hurt?

498
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,560
Run into these bastards
who want to devour us?

499
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,240
And then run to some military base ...

500
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,520
to end up in a shower with other soldiers...

501
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,000
Who looked at my ass like I'm some chick?

502
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,720
Goofing off in my face?
- If we stay here, we die.

503
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,160
Are you deaf?

504
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,400
We don't know how many
of them are out there.

505
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,760
There's probably a lot after what I did.

506
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,080
I'll take care of the elevator doors.
- You do not give up?

507
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,440
Want to save his skin?
Then listen.

508
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,440
Listen to you.
You couldn't even save your friends.

509
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,080
Bola, not now.
- He's your boyfriend now?

510
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,720
Tell this asshole to leave me alone.

511
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,400
I'll kill this damn cop too old and decrepit.

512
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,120
Bola!

513
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,240
Come on.

514
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,560
Give me the Coke.

515
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,000
Give it to me!

516
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,440
I can't get it.
I'll help.

517
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,120
Smell a little.
- Really?

518
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,640
Don't need it.

519
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,640
This is sugar compared to what I took in China.

520
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,720
It's time for your suppository you shit!

521
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,400
What happened to the ones I killed?

522
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,200
They take the bodies.

523
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,040
Why?

524
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,480
Give me your lever.

525
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,160
Well done, lad.

526
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,560
Where is your spirit?

527
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,320
What you gonna do now?

528
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,480
Who's the idiot now?

529
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,440
What will you do?

530
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,080
It's time for a wheelchair.

531
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,440
You found a way into it.

532
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,240
We'll kill the bitch.

533
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,000
What about boys?

534
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,440
I know what she wants.

535
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,800
Give a kiss to Rene.

536
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,880
Look what that bitch is capable of.

537
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,880
The teacher of the second floor?

538
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,040
You gave it to him?

539
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,000
Go on.
Kiss it.

540
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,280
Kiss it!

541
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,080
Kiss it, come on!

542
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,880
Kiss it, bitch.

543
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,120
Come on!

544
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,880
Kiss!

545
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,280
So.

546
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,480
You want Rene's salami?

547
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,760
Think this is funny?

548
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,040
What's gotten into you?

549
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,240
Answer me!

550
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,440
Think this is funny?

551
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,240
You think you're it?

552
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,640
You think you're it?
- Stop by Ade. -

553
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,480
You think you're it?

554
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,600
You think you're it?

555
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,280
What?

556
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,880
Remember what they did
to us in our own land?

557
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,760
Have you forgotten?

558
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,000
His brother is a problem.
- I don't like how that sounds.

559
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,640
He can't talk to you that way.

560
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,160
Shit!

561
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,880
You have to fix it, Ball.

562
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,240
She has a beautiful corpse.

563
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,120
You scare me, man.
- How so?

564
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,800
Tony!

565
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,280
I'm fine.

566
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,240
Aurore ...
- What?

567
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,000
Where is she?

568
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,000
She tried ...
- What?

569
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,000
What's gotten into you?
Are you mad?

570
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,400
We can't trust him.

571
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,280
You're crazy.
- Let me go.

572
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,520
He was changing.
- He was not dead.

573
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,400
You shot him in the head.

574
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,160
Tony.

575
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,600
He was part of the family.

576
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,520
Leave her alone.

577
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,000
She did the right thing.
- Fuck you!

578
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,400
Let your feelings out!

579
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,320
We need everyone.
Let go.

580
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,200
He won't hurt me.

581
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,360
I am part of the family.

582
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,560
Come on help me.

583
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,840
I'm not a kid any more.

584
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,800
What are you doing?
- Go on!

585
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,840
Calm down, children.
- Shut up.

586
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,760
What are you doing, Bola?

587
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,800
You want to die with these idiots.

588
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,360
Then die with them.

589
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,880
Take their weapons.

590
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,320
That idiot turned his head?

591
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,080
I have no brother.

592
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,200
You treated me like garbage for years.

593
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,720
Not anymore.

594
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,080
Mom was right.

595
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,320
You only think about yourself.

596
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,560
You only think about yourself.

597
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,400
You are weak, Bola.

598
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,840
You know it as well as I do.

599
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,800
Without me, you'd have been dead.

600
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,720
The lame monster cannot save you.

601
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,520
Forget it, Bola.

602
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,800
I'm your only brother here.

603
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,440
You won't last long.
Did you know that?

604
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,440
Shut up, you old fart.

605
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:08,960
Bola.

606
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,400
You can't go on without me.

607
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,040
I can, Ade.

608
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,360
Without you I will.

609
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,840
Without you.

610
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,640
Bola!

611
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,120
We should have amputated his leg.

612
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,520
He wouldn't have gotten very far.

613
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,280
We can't stay here.

614
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,320
We can't stay here!

615
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,200
We need weapons!

616
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,760
The watchman has a stock.
This way.

617
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,440
We will not win without them.

618
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,840
Ouessem!

619
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,360
Now you're alone, Markudi.

620
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,840
If you want to work as a team ...

621
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,320
you have to trust me.

622
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,040
Come on!

623
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,720
Come on!

624
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,280
It's like it is asking for help.

625
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,160
No.

626
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,120
They're hungry.

627
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,440
Don't waste time.

628
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,440
Come on.

629
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,720
Didn't I say so?
It's enough to supply an army.

630
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,000
Rene?

631
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,480
I'll smash the lot of them with this.

632
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,080
My love ...

633
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,480
let's make mincemeat of them.

634
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,680
Hey, girl ...

635
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,560
you look like a shrew, now.

636
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,400
Calm down, dear.

637
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,000
Open your eyes, Markudi.

638
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,040
I didn't forget why I came here.

639
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,440
Neither did I.

640
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,960
Come on.
Just a minute.

641
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,000
I will not need the
protector of my balls, now.

642
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,480
Come on, folks.

643
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,400
I'm ready.

644
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,840
Damn!

645
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,120
They were here!

646
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,560
What are you doing, Markudi?

647
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,120
Bola!

648
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,360
Get off it!

649
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,440
Come on, get up, you bastard!

650
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,040
You killed my brother, you bastard!

651
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,240
You know who I am?

652
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,120
I'm a damn Nigerian.
A Nigerian!

653
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,960
Come here!

654
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,960
Get up, you bastard!

655
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,160
You killed Bola,
I'll kill you.

656
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,920
Think you can play with me?

657
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,040
Think you can play with me?

658
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,520
I'll kill you.

659
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,560
I'm a damn Nigerian you bastard.

660
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,360
A Nigerian damn you!
You killed Bola!

661
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,040
The door!

662
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,480
Hurry!
The exit is around here.

663
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,840
Come on. It's over.
- Leave me alone.

664
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,520
Wake up!

665
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,720
Oh, no!

666
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,840
I can't believe it.

667
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,840
We're trapped!

668
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,160
I need to find it.

669
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,840
The basement!
Come to the basement.

670
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,720
Come on.

671
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,200
I'll keep an eye on them.

672
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,840
You can't.

673
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,280
Let him.

674
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,040
You don't need it.

675
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,840
Come on!

676
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,400
Take care of her.

677
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,840
Go!

678
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,040
Get the fuck out of here!

679
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,520
C'mon motherfuckers!

680
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,160
They're everywhere!

681
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,760
Here!

682
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,080
I'll cover you.

683
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,560
I'm looking up!

684
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,520
Hurry!

685
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,920
Move!

686
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,440
They are worse than flies hungry for shit.

687
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,960
Shut up!
Where is the exit?

688
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,120
Where?
There's a door downstairs.

689
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,520
Are you sure?

690
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,360
The cop died because of their conversation.

691
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,120
Don't need him.

692
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,000
He gave his life for you.

693
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,760
I don't care.

694
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,440
You bastards!

695
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,320
My God.

696
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:34,680
They bring the bodies here?

697
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,240
It looks like a mass grave.

698
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,800
No.
It's their pantry.

699
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,120
Have enough food.

700
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,080
Good work!

701
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,680
Shit!

702
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,000
Let's get out of here!

703
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,720
They're getting up!
Help me!

704
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,680
Help me!

705
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,440
My God!

706
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,320
The path is clear.
Here!

707
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,480
Come, children. Hurry!

708
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,280
Shit!

709
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,400
The lady!

710
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,280
Shit!

711
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,000
Hurry, girl!

712
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:49,120
Get ready, kids.
Hell begins!

713
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,120
I'm running out!

714
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,960
Markudi!

715
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:08,200
Quick, boys!

716
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,880
Move!

717
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,960
Tear down that damn door!

718
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,120
Shit!

719
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,200
I'm out of ammunition.

720
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,200
Give me the grenade, quickly.

721
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,440
Hurry up!

722
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:22,160
Fuck that.
I won't die of a heart attack.

723
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,120
All’s fair in love and war.

724
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:36,160
What are you doing?

725
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,240
What is this?

726
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:43,600
Shit, playing soon!

727
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,880
Come to Daddy, its fucking time!

728
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:57,840
I'll show you what's hardcore.

729
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,880
Relax, relax, relax.

730
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,240
