1
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,870
Are you crazy?

2
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,740
You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

3
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,700
-Hi, Mom.
-Don't "Hi, Mom" me.

4
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,250
What are you still doing up?
lt's past 1:00.

5
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,250
-l thought l'd wait for you.
-Well, l'm home.

6
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,210
Now you can get to sleep.
Come on.

7
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,420
Andale.

8
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,970
l'm really not tired.

9
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,800
Kristen, don't start with me.
You know what your shrink said.

10
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,470
He's full of it.

11
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,140
l'm not going to let you
get me into an argument.

12
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,760
Now get to sleep.

13
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,100
Mom, l'm still having
those awful dreams.

14
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,400
Elaine,
where do you keep the bourbon?

15
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,740
l'll be right down.
l've got a guest.

16
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,860
And you don't want
to keep him waiting?

17
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,740
That's right. l don't.

18
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,490
Good night.

19
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,460
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

20
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,970
Three, four,
better lock your door

21
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,640
Five, six, grab a crucifix

22
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,560
Seven, eight, gonna stay up late

23
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,230
Nine, ten, never sleep again

24
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,740
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

25
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,490
Three, four,
better lock your door

26
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,620
Five, six, grab a crucifix

27
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,540
Seven, eight, gonna stay up late

28
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,840
Nine, ten...

29
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,390
Hi. What's your name?

30
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,520
Kristen. What's yours?

31
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,110
What is this place?

32
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,860
l got to go now.

33
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,740
Wait, little girl.
Don't go in there!

34
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,790
Little girl?

35
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,040
This is where he takes us.

36
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Come on. We're going.

37
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,140
Freddy's home.

38
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,660
Put me down. You're hurting me.

39
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,240
And in local news, two more
teenage deaths have occurred...

40
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,490
both suicides.

41
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,580
County health officials
are at a loss to explain...

42
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,660
this alarming trend.

43
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,460
Nothing like a little
cheery news to start the day.

44
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,420
Doc, l got a new theory
about all these suicides.

45
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,460
Don't hold back on us, Max.
We need all the help we can get.

46
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,880
lt's fucked-up chromosomes.
Think about it.

47
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,470
All their parents dropped acid
during the sixties.

48
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,010
lt beats Simms' theory.

49
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,640
She thinks it's sex,
drugs, and rock 'n' roll.

50
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,310
Shit.
That's what keeps people alive.

51
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,230
Hi, Taryn.

52
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,980
You don't look so hot, kid.
Are you getting some sleep?

53
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,820
l didn't think so.

54
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,990
Good morning, Dr. Gordon.

55
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,860
Good morning, Jennifer.
How are the burns?

56
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,530
Regular, menthol, ultra-light.

57
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,030
They're healing up nicely.

58
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,040
l've been good. When do l get
my cigarette privileges back?

59
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,160
Don't hold your breath.

60
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,040
-Phillip.
-Hey, Doc.

61
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,050
How is he?

62
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,600
He's cooling down.

63
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,560
lf he continues having
these outbursts...

64
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,890
l'll have to have him
isolated permanently.

65
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,480
Don't worry.
lt won't come to that.

66
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,730
l read the report
on the new staff member.

67
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,270
What did you think?

68
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,240
l don't understand why
some grad school superstar...

69
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,820
is being treated
like a seasoned pro.

70
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,580
She's doing ground-breaking
research on pattern nightmares.

71
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,540
We don't need any outside help.
l know these kids.

72
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,620
l don't want some hotshot
taking chances with them...

73
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,380
just so she can get published.

74
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,460
Dr. Gordon, Dr. Simms,
to examination, stat.

75
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,930
This is ridiculous.
l know my daughter.

76
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,760
She's just trying
to get some attention.

77
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,600
l won't play one of her
little games with her.

78
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,270
Suicide attempt.
Just down from Country General.

79
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,730
-What's her name?
-Kristen Parker.

80
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,350
She was fine
until we tried sedating her.

81
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,280
She tore her stitches out.

82
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,950
Kristen, we want to help you!

83
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,280
Hold her.

84
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,080
l'm Dr. Gordon.
l want to help you.

85
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,210
Be careful, Max!

86
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,590
Back off, Max.

87
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,800
Kristen, put the scalpel down.

88
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,140
Nobody's going to hurt you.

89
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,560
Five, six, grab your crucifix

90
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:12,520
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

91
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,820
Nine, ten, never, never...

92
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,280
Never sleep again.

93
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,870
Where did you learn that rhyme?

94
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,010
Tell me about the kids.

95
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,020
Well, they're survivors
in a way.

96
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,060
They're all severely
sleep disordered--

97
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,690
insomnia, narcolepsy,
bed-wetting.

98
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,610
But the nightmares
are their common thread?

99
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,440
Right.
They share a group delusion--

100
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,030
a boogieman,
for lack of a better word.

101
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,700
They're so traumatized...

102
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,870
they'll do almost anything
not to sleep.

103
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,370
Anything?

104
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,290
We lost a kid a month ago
to Fairview.

105
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,290
l don't know where
he got the razors...

106
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,050
but he cut off his own eyelids
to stay awake.

107
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,800
Oh, God.

108
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,800
Shook the kids up pretty badly.

109
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,890
By the way, that was great work
with the new patient.

110
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,300
Pretty smooth for an intern.

111
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,470
l have had some experience
with pattern nightmares.

112
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,600
l've got to get going.

113
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,150
Let me help you.

114
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,030
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

115
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,320
Now, be sure
that you check in with Max.

116
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,580
He'll give you
the whole twenty-five-cent tour.

117
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,660
l'll see you later.

118
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,170
Oh, Miss Thompson...

119
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,330
You can call me Nancy.

120
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,540
You call me Neil.

121
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,050
What was that nursery rhyme
all about?

122
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,010
lt was just something
that the kids say...

123
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,010
to keep the...boogieman away.

124
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,870
Anyway, that's group therapy.

125
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,040
This whole wing
is devoted to the program.

126
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,590
l guess...yeah.

127
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,090
You can use this office
for the time being.

128
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,710
This will be fine.

129
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,430
l'll have you set up
in your own space...

130
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,300
by the end of the week.

131
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,550
The patients' rooms
are down this way.

132
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,310
This is Phillip.
We call him "The Walker."

133
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,320
-Why is that?
-Because l sleepwalk.

134
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,860
A perfectly normal event
that our illustrious staff...

135
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,610
loves to theorize about
endlessly.

136
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,280
Phillip, this is Nancy.

137
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,620
Hi. Welcome to the snake pit.

138
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,870
Thanks.

139
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,830
Nice work.

140
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,580
They really ought to be carved
out of wood...

141
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,380
but they won't let me have
a knife.

142
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,670
l might, you know...

143
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,390
This lump over here is Kincaid.
Take a good look.

144
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,730
He gets himself thrown in
the quiet room so often...

145
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,270
you probably won't see
a lot of him.

146
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,280
l do it so l don't have to look
at your ugly face all the time.

147
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,690
l love you, too.

148
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,990
Nice meeting you.

149
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,120
They're really good kids,
but don't let them fool you.

150
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,450
They're dangerous--
to themselves and to each other.

151
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,590
Hi, Joey.

152
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,800
Why, thank you.

153
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,970
-Hey, Marcie. How you doing?
-Great.

154
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,180
These going to "C" Ward?
l'll walk you down.

155
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,810
See you later, Joey.

156
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,110
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen
acting any different?

157
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,160
Did you notice anything strange
before she made the attempt?

158
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,330
Kristen specializes
in strangeness.

159
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,830
l've spent thousands
on psychiatrists.

160
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Did she always have nightmares?

161
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,500
No. They've gotten worse since
l took away her credit cards.

162
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,090
l'm serious.

163
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,180
l don't know
what you want from me.

164
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,340
Just some answers.

165
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,350
Other kids are involved,
not just Kristen.

166
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,390
All good kids, smart kids.

167
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,890
l'm sorry to hear that.
You're the experts, not me.

168
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,690
lf l had any insight
into any of this...

169
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,770
l would share them with you,
believe me.

170
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,270
l'm sure you would.

171
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,320
Excuse me.
l have to get downtown.

172
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,530
l'll need to get her things.

173
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,030
l had them packed
in a suitcase. Teresa.

174
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,540
l'll get them.
Please, l don't mind.

175
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,250
lt's the first door
at the top of the stairs.

176
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,760
You.

177
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,470
Oh, my God. Run!

178
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,430
Get us back out, Kristen!
Do it now!

179
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,290
l used to live in this house.

180
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,330
That's just a house
l dream about.

181
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,500
Have you ever done that
before...

182
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,880
pulled someone into your dream?

183
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,050
When l was a little girl,
like four or five...

184
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,130
if l had a nightmare,
l'd always bring my dad in.

185
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,800
The dreams
would always get better.

186
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,600
He used to tell me about it
the next day.

187
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,270
He used to think
they were his dreams.

188
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,020
When did that stop?

189
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,480
When l was still a kid.

190
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,320
My folks got divorced,
and after a while...

191
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,240
l just thought
l imagined the whole thing.

192
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,070
l guess l didn't.

193
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,160
lt's an amazing gift.

194
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,580
The man in my dreams,
he's real, isn't he?

195
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,290
He's real.

196
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,510
OK. Group's in session.

197
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,930
Straight talk only in this room.

198
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,850
Today l'd like to start
getting us acquainted...

199
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,100
with our new staff member
Nancy Thompson.

200
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,520
Let's make her welcome.

201
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,440
You've already met
Phillip and Kincaid...

202
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,860
and, of course, Kristen.

203
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,940
How about the rest of you tell
Nancy about yourselves?

204
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,570
Will, how about you first?

205
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:10,910
Hi, l'm Will Stanton.

206
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,660
l've had a little accident,
as you can see...

207
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,450
ended up in this chair.

208
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,460
Accident, my ass.
You said this was straight talk.

209
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,630
So he took a jump. He wasn't
sticking needles in his arms.

210
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,180
Save it, Kincaid. Jennifer?

211
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,140
l'm Jennifer Callfield...

212
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,390
and as soon as
l get out of here...

213
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,140
l'm going to Los Angeles
to be an actress.

214
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,390
l'm going to be on TV.

215
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,310
Yeah. "Lifestyle
of the Rich and Psychotic."

216
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,650
Screw you.

217
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,110
This is Joey. He used to be
a debater in school.

218
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,910
Now he doesn't talk much.

219
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,490
l'm Taryn White.

220
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,490
The only reason l'm in here...

221
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,210
is because
it's better than juvie hall.

222
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,460
Also because l'm going through
some very strange shit.

223
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,290
Your dreams?

224
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,960
Everybody has bad dreams.

225
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,470
Can l interject something
just to save time?

226
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,340
Sure, Phillip, go ahead.

227
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,300
According to our kind hosts...

228
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,720
our dreams
are a group psychosis--

229
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,350
sort of a mellow mass hysteria.

230
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,060
The fact that
we all dreamt about this guy...

231
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,850
before we ever met
doesn't impress anybody.

232
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,860
So we go in circles...

233
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,690
making minimal progress
with maximum effort.

234
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,110
You won't make any progress...

235
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,110
until you recognize your dreams
for what they are.

236
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,870
And what are they?

237
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,160
The by-products of guilt.

238
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,120
Psychological scars
stemming from moral conflicts...

239
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,870
and overt sexuality.

240
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,670
Oh, great.
lt's my dick that's killing me.

241
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,720
Tell me what's supposed
to be happening again.

242
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,850
You're being attacked
by the bog demon.

243
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,600
Fourteen.

244
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,230
Doesn't count.
You got to say the words.

245
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,730
-This is stupid.
-Come on.

246
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,570
ln the name of Lowrek,
Prince of Elves, demon begone.

247
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,580
Good.
You conquered the demon...

248
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,160
but your horse
is sinking in the bog.

249
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,910
What do you do?

250
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,330
l go to bed, and get a new horse
in the morning.

251
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,050
How do l score that--
enchanted slumber or death?

252
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,380
All right, fellas. Lights out.

253
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,050
Aw, Max.

254
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,050
'Aw, Max." You know the rules.

255
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
Come on, Joey. You, too.

256
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,560
Every time
we get a good game going...

257
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,100
it's always, "Lights out."

258
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,120
-Good night, fellas.
-Night, Max.

259
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,870
OK, you get first shift.

260
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,710
Oh, come on.
l had it last night.

261
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,210
Good. Just remember,
keep your eyes open...

262
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,970
and one whimper,
and you wake me up, OK?

263
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,480
-This is nice.
-You never been here before?

264
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,030
No. l think it opened
when l was at school.

265
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,320
Best Thai food in Springwood.

266
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:40,580
Of course, it's the only
Thai food in Springwood.

267
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,080
Do your parents
still live around here?

268
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,580
My mother passed away.

269
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,170
She died in her sleep.

270
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,710
l'm sorry.

271
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,340
My father and l...

272
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,800
Things just seemed
to fall apart after that.

273
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,300
Sounds like a rough time.

274
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,680
lt was.

275
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,860
What if l told you that...

276
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,280
your patients
are in real physical danger...

277
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,110
from their dreams?

278
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,780
The nightmares are nothing but
a symptom of the real problems.

279
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,080
Then let's just eliminate
the symptom for the time being.

280
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,910
With Hypnocil?

281
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,540
That's right.

282
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,460
You want me to prescribe...

283
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,380
an experimental
psychoactive drug...

284
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,340
to a bunch
of suicidal teenagers?

285
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,550
Just until we get things
under control.

286
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,720
Dream deprivation is
nothing to fool with.

287
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,930
You have no business
taking it yourself.

288
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,600
l used to be like them.

289
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
l know what
they're going through.

290
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,060
So do l.

291
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:51,020
You told me they were survivors,
and they are.

292
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,320
But how much longer
they survive is up to us.

293
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,150
l'm sorry, Nancy.

294
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,490
The answer's no.

295
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,240
Phillip, wake up.

296
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,210
Have a nice stroll, asshole.

297
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,880
What? What are you doing?

298
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,420
Hey! Come on, man!

299
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,130
What are you, crazy?

300
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,850
Oh, shit! What's he doing?

301
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,060
Get help! Get help!

302
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,320
What's the matter?

303
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,960
Don't do it, Phillip!

304
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,840
God! Stop!

305
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,710
l want us to talk
about last night.

306
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,920
l want us to get our feelings
out in the open.

307
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,970
He wasn't strong enough,
so he got wasted. That's all.

308
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,720
That's all?
ls that what you think?

309
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,430
He couldn't hack it,
so he got nailed. Period.

310
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,810
Yeah. Big, tough badass.
How long will you last?

311
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,650
Longer than any of you.

312
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,650
Go ahead and fight.
That's what he wants.

313
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,650
Who?

314
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,990
Who do you think?
What does he want?

315
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,740
To turn us against each other
so we'll be weak.

316
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,700
-Horseshit.
-No, she's right.

317
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,370
We're all
missing the point here.

318
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,960
Phillip's death
was a sleepwalking accident.

319
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,170
Nothing more.

320
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:23,960
No. l could see him
up there...his face.

321
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,260
He was wide awake...
all the way down.

322
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,930
Then it was suicide.
Phillip quit. He gave up.

323
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,300
Joey says it wasn't suicide.

324
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,180
Listen to me, Joey.
Phillip killed himself.

325
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,940
That's a cowardly thing.
That's an empty thing.

326
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,190
He let himself down.
He let all of us down.

327
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,230
lt was murder!
Can't you understand that?

328
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,650
That bastard murdered him !

329
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,860
l'm not listening to this.

330
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,660
How much longer will you go on
blaming your dreams...

331
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,370
for your own weaknesses?

332
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,290
How much longer will you keep
blowing smoke up our ass?

333
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,370
There will be
no repeat occurrences...

334
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,040
of last night's events.

335
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,840
Your doors will be locked
during sleeping hours.

336
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,920
We'll start a policy
of evening sedation.

337
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,510
Anybody tries drugs on me
will get his ass kicked!

338
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,390
You just bought yourself
a night in the quiet room !

339
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,890
-Sit down!
-Fuck you! You sit down!

340
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,100
Easy, Kincaid.

341
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:22,270
Nobody's putting me to sleep!
Get away! Let me alone!

342
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,810
Ain't nobody
putting me to sleep!

343
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,570
l don't want to go to sleep!

344
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,360
l ain't going to sleep!

345
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,860
Stay in your seats.

346
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,410
We'll begin sedation tonight,
starting with him.

347
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,410
You can't.
They'll be defenseless.

348
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,410
That's precisely
what they need--

349
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,580
some uninterrupted REM sleep
to release that negative energy.

350
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,420
l'm prescribing Hypnocil.

351
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,670
lt's a dream suppressant.

352
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,590
l know what it is.
l just can't believe it.

353
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,920
What has she talked you into?

354
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,260
Nothing. lt's my decision.

355
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,310
l want these dreams stopped
till we get some answers.

356
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,850
l can't allow that.

357
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,640
Then l'll go to Carver
if l have to.

358
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,480
He'll either back me up
or accept my resignation.

359
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,690
All right.
But if something goes wrong...

360
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,780
l'll make sure
that you're held responsible.

361
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,530
l mean that.
Fully responsible.

362
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,780
l can't believe
l just said that.

363
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,790
Can we get
the Hypnocil by tomorrow?

364
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,660
We're going to try.

365
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:27,670
l hope you know
what you're getting us into.

366
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,970
Ain't gonna dream no more,
no more

367
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:44,980
Ain't gonna dream no more

368
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,480
All night long, l sing this song

369
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,070
Ain't gonna dream no more

370
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,000
Girl, what are you doing?

371
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,500
-Watching TV.
-l can see that.

372
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,840
Why don't you read a book?
You watch too much damn TV.

373
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,000
Research.

374
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,340
Right.
You're going to be a TV star.

375
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,970
Wait and see.

376
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,470
lf Simms catches you here
after lights out...

377
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,430
she's gonna chew my ass.

378
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,890
l gotta stay up, Max.

379
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,930
Just tonight, please?

380
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,400
l can't handle the nightmare.

381
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,730
Not after Phillip. Not tonight.

382
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,160
l never saw you.

383
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Thanks, Max.

384
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,560
Hi, sweet stuff. Good news.

385
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,440
Can't be good news,
coming from you.

386
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,360
-Pulled night duty.
-So?

387
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,150
So, got the keys to heaven,
baby.

388
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,820
-What?
-The dispensary.

389
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,240
l am talking
clean pharmaceutical high...

390
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,120
a night at Club Meth.

391
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,080
l don't do that shit.

392
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,750
Yeah?
What are those, beauty marks?

393
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,420
-Those are ancient history.
-Oh, yeah?

394
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,130
lf you're ever in the mood
for a history lesson...

395
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,380
l'm your teacher, understand?

396
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,390
Stay out of my face,
or l'll go straight to Max.

397
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,890
Who's going to take the word
of a crazy junkie chick?

398
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,310
Fuck off!

399
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,740
lt's silly to ask, but how many
of what did they kill?

400
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,530
Don't say that. l love animals.

401
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,700
l bought it red,
so l didn't know what it was.

402
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,500
Probably an artificial bird.

403
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,290
Ever go to acting school?

404
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,170
Not in the beginning.
l started on a talk show.

405
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,420
So you don't always say
you have to study?

406
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,920
l think you should
study, work...

407
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,970
then maybe you can make it.

408
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,220
-Can l ask you something?
-Certainly.

409
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,770
Who gives a fuck what you think?

410
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,780
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

411
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,620
Three, four,
better lock the door

412
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:58,650
This is it, Jennifer--
your big break in TV.

413
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,570
Welcome to prime time, bitch!

414
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,760
Don't be ashamed, young man.

415
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,100
This is a place for sorrow.

416
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,060
What faith do you follow?

417
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,230
Science, l suppose.

418
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,030
Sad choice.

419
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,450
There are times when it doesn't
offer much comfort.

420
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,450
l've seen you before, Sister...

421
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,410
Mary Helena.

422
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,380
You do volunteer work
at the hospital.

423
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,050
From time to time,
when l'm needed.

424
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,560
l should have been able
to save them.

425
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,020
Only one thing
can save the children.

426
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,190
The unquiet spirit
must be laid to rest.

427
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:25,490
lt is an abomination
to God and to man.

428
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,950
Excuse me, sister.

429
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,330
What are you doing up here?

430
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,670
l was talking to...

431
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,040
To who?

432
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,380
Doesn't matter.

433
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,380
Are you ready to go now?

434
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,630
Sure.

435
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,980
Are you finished?

436
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,730
Yeah. l'm sorry.
l guess l'm not hungry.

437
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,030
That's OK.

438
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,580
That's pretty. What is that?

439
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,580
This is my Malaysian dream doll.

440
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,710
lt's supposed to bring
good dreams.

441
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,630
l could use some of that
right about now.

442
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,390
You know, l used to think...

443
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,180
l could do something
for the kids...

444
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,230
make some kind of difference...

445
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,190
but they're slipping through
my fingers, every one.

446
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,940
You're doing the best
you can for them, Neil.

447
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,110
Am l?

448
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,320
l'm running out of answers.

449
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,580
A patient sleepwalks
out of a high-security ward.

450
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,120
A girl alone in a room dies.

451
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,660
l can't believe
this is happening.

452
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,750
Nothing makes any sense.

453
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,300
Then maybe you're ready.

454
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,630
For what?

455
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,090
The truth.

456
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,970
Try me.

457
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,180
Only if you're willing
to put aside...

458
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,480
everything you've learned
and trust me.

459
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,350
Can you do that?

460
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,110
l can do that.

461
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,450
Straight talk only in this room.

462
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:39,200
-ls this group?
-Yeah, unofficially.

463
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,080
Soon there won't be enough
of us left to call it group.

464
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,000
Listen up, you guys.
Nancy has something to say.

465
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,550
l know who's trying to kill you.

466
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,510
Don't humor us.
We're not in the mood.

467
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,680
He wears a dirty brown hat.

468
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
He's horribly burned.

469
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,230
He has razors on his right hand.

470
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,020
Who is he?

471
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,730
His name is Freddy Krueger.

472
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:16,110
He was a child murderer
before he died.

473
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,160
And after he died...

474
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,040
he became something worse.

475
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,500
Six years ago,
he killed my friends.

476
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,290
He almost killed me.

477
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,040
Why is he after us?

478
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,380
Yeah. What did we do?

479
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,510
lt's not you.

480
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,260
Your parents, my parents--
they burned him alive.

481
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,310
And now we're paying
for their sins.

482
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,440
You are the last
of the Elm Street children.

483
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,610
Mom and Dad--
l mean, that's crazy.

484
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,190
They never mentioned anything--

485
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,070
Sure. Parents tell
their kids that sort of thing--

486
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,030
'Good night. Say your prayers.

487
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:01,120
"By the way, we torched
some maniac last night."

488
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,450
So what do we do
about this creep?

489
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,120
Kristen is the key.

490
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,380
She has a very special talent.
A gift.

491
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:13,210
l haven't been able to do that
since l was little.

492
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,760
-You did it the other night.
-That was different.

493
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,850
You never lose a gift like that.
You just forget how to use it.

494
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,720
How about it? Will you try?

495
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,810
All of you have
this inner strength...

496
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,730
some special power
that you've had...

497
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,770
in your most wonderful dreams.

498
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,070
Together, we can learn
to use that power if we try.

499
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,360
You sound like Peter Pan.

500
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,490
Remember, open mind?

501
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,250
Taryn,
would you pull the shades down?

502
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:51,670
We're going to try
a little group hypnosis.

503
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:08,680
l want you all to follow
this pendulum with your eyes.

504
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:10,440
Tune out everything else.

505
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,400
Nothing else exists
but the pendulum.

506
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,570
Take us there, Kristen.

507
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,660
Breathe deeply and relax.

508
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,410
Starting with your toes,
relax everything...

509
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,040
till there's no tension
left in your bodies.

510
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,670
Keep following the pendulum.

511
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,210
You find yourselves
getting tired.

512
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,670
Nothing would feel better
right now...

513
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,050
than a nice, long, deep sleep.

514
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,060
l'm going to count backwards
from five.

515
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,640
When l finish...

516
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,860
you will all be asleep.

517
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,650
Five...

518
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,400
four...

519
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,110
three...

520
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,160
two...

521
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,490
one.

522
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,800
Sorry.

523
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,340
That's OK. We'll try again.

524
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,260
Everybody take five.

525
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,560
l was willing
to go through with this...

526
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,900
for the kids' peace of mind,
but you'll have to face reality.

527
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,810
Joey, l just wanted to get you
alone for a second.

528
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,730
l mean, look, l really like you.

529
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,650
Do you like me?

530
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,150
l know this sounds crazy...

531
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,490
but l make up excuses to come
into the ward every day...

532
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,530
just to see you.

533
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,490
You're so cute.

534
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,460
Let's just try one more time.

535
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,630
lf it doesn't work,
l promise l'll--

536
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,340
We're here.

537
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:52,850
-Where here?
-We're in the dream.

538
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,390
No, we're not.
We're still here in the group.

539
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,900
ln my dreams, l can walk.

540
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,150
My legs are strong.

541
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,240
ln my dreams,
l am the Wizard Master.

542
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,040
Try something, Kristen.
What can you do in your dream?

543
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,430
A perfect score.
The crowd goes wild.

544
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:39,900
Dig this.

545
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,490
Kincaid, please.

546
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,990
That's very unnerving.

547
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,870
Hey, check out Taryn.

548
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,120
ln my dreams, l'm beautiful...

549
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,540
and bad.

550
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,340
l could get into
a lot of trouble for this.

551
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,760
But l know you won't
say anything, will you?

552
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,180
Unzip me.

553
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,530
Do you like my body, Joey?

554
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,910
What's wrong, Joey?
Feeling tongue-tied?

555
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,240
What's happening?

556
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,160
-He's close.
-Who, Freddy?

557
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,370
He's heavy in the halls.

558
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,330
-Where's Joey?
-Freddy's got him.

559
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,790
Quiet, everyone! Listen.

560
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,300
The room's changing.

561
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,640
What the heck's going on here?

562
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,930
What's happening?

563
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:28,310
Get away from the wall.

564
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,610
Help!

565
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,500
Don't panic! Quiet down!

566
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,220
This isn't real!

567
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,010
Get us out!

568
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,470
Quiet! The door!

569
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,850
What's going on in here?

570
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,860
What's wrong with Joey?

571
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,190
Code blue.

572
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,530
Oh, my God.

573
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:26,120
He's in a deep coma.
There's nothing we can do.

574
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,420
This is inexcusable.

575
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,290
The session was unauthorized.

576
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,420
lt was purposely conducted
without my knowledge.

577
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,300
Unusual steps were called for.

578
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,630
ls that what l should
tell his parents?

579
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,550
l understand you prescribed
a highly experimental drug.

580
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,260
He's not in a coma--

581
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,890
Your opinion
is of no interest to me.

582
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:49,060
Furthermore, you've created
panic among the patients.

583
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,980
That's not true.

584
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,480
ln four days,
we've had two suicides.

585
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,030
Now he's in a coma.

586
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:59,490
lt's safe to say your approach
has failed, entirely.

587
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,870
You're both relieved of duty.
l want you out today.

588
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,960
l'm sorry, Neil.

589
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,670
l'm afraid
you brought it on yourself.

590
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,170
For God's sake, Elizabeth...

591
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,170
will you please just try
to help the kids?

592
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,260
Will you listen to them?

593
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,090
Of course l will.

594
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,680
What are we going to do?

595
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,190
There's nothing that we can do.

596
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,190
lt's out of our hands.

597
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,230
Sister!

598
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,960
This is where it began.

599
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,210
This wing's been closed
for years.

600
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,510
What was this place?

601
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:07,010
Purgatory...fashioned
by the hands of men.

602
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,470
Twisted, lonely souls.

603
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:14,560
The worst
of the criminally insane...

604
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:19,480
were locked up in here
like animals.

605
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,190
This whole facility
was shut down in the forties.

606
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,150
Some sort of scandal?

607
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,950
A young girl on the staff...

608
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:33,580
was accidentally locked in here
over the holidays.

609
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,960
The inmates
kept her hidden for days.

610
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,380
She was raped...
hundreds of times.

611
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:47,550
When they found her,
she was barely alive...

612
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:50,550
and with child.

613
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,760
That girl was Amanda Krueger.

614
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,390
Her child--

615
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:02,270
The bastard son
of a hundred maniacs.

616
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,780
Some say he was murdered...

617
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,900
though no body was ever found.

618
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:16,160
You said something before
about laying him to rest.

619
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,670
You must find the remains...

620
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:23,210
and bury him in hallowed ground.

621
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,260
Hallowed ground?

622
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,810
Sister?

623
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:40,770
lf your only faith is science,
Doctor...

624
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:45,320
it may be you
that's laid to rest.

625
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,780
Wait!

626
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,450
Sister!

627
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,680
Let go of him, you bastard.

628
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,720
Oh, my God.

629
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,160
l've got to go in.
We have no choice.

630
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,160
Getting yourself killed
won't help the kids at all.

631
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,080
Besides, we do have a choice.

632
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,420
Assuming your mysterious nun
is right.

633
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,710
l've heard weirder things
this week.

634
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,590
All right. Whoever she is...

635
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:53,550
she seems to know
more about Krueger than l do.

636
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,680
The question is,
what happened to his body?

637
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,980
They burned him to death
in his boiler room...

638
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,770
and they hid the remains.

639
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,270
Who would know
where they're hidden?

640
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,360
Only one man knows...

641
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,690
and it's time for him to talk.

642
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:18,490
You can't take Nancy
away from us!

643
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:19,910
She's all we have!

644
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,910
You're a sick girl, Kristen.

645
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,120
lf you want to get better,
you must trust me now.

646
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,090
Take her to the quiet room
and sedate her.

647
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,760
You stupid bitch!
You're killing us!

648
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,820
All right, everybody.
Back to bed.

649
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,750
Hi, Daddy.

650
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,010
Well, if it isn't
my little girl.

651
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,890
My baby come to see her daddy?

652
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,520
lt's been a long time.

653
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,850
But you're here. Sit down.

654
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:32,360
What did l do to get so lucky?

655
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,200
l thought that you were
trying to forget me.

656
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:39,780
That's not true.
You're the one trying to forget.

657
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:47,370
l need your help, Dad.
Krueger's back.

658
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,880
Fred Krueger is dead.

659
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,220
You always had a little trouble
trying to understand that.

660
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,720
You know what he did.

661
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,390
He's doing it again.

662
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,560
She's telling you the truth.

663
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,560
l don't believe we've met...

664
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,360
and this isn't
any of your goddamn business.

665
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,490
We can stop him this time--
stop him for good...

666
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,570
but we need to know
where his bones were hidden.

667
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:27,410
l've lost too much
over this already.

668
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,920
l'm through with it.

669
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,130
People are still dying
after all this time.

670
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:34,300
Stop running away from it.

671
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,840
You owe me.

672
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,680
lt was nice seeing you again,
princess.

673
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,220
Next time, don't...

674
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,100
don't stay away so long.

675
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,280
l'll be OK.
Just give me a minute.

676
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:03,200
lt's the hospital.

677
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,710
-Dr. Gordon?
-Taryn.

678
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:19,720
You've got to come right away.
Kristen had a total shit attack.

679
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,470
Simms doped her up
and put her in the quiet room.

680
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:25,640
Simms put Kristen
in the quiet room for the night.

681
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,060
-They sedated her.
-Oh, no.

682
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,060
She can't stay awake for long.
She's all alone.

683
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,560
Freddy's going to get her.

684
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,400
Just stay cool.
Help is on the way.

685
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,570
Just hurry!

686
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,070
l got to get there.

687
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:42,070
-You go. l'll get the remains.
-lt's no use.

688
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,740
l'll talk to him.
Make Simms understand.

689
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,910
She'll never understand.
l got to get to Kristen.

690
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,410
Be careful.

691
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:07,850
My name is Neil Gordon.
Pleased to meet you.

692
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:09,770
There, now we've met!

693
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:11,430
Now listen to me!

694
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,520
Maybe you don't care whether
Nancy lives or dies, but l do!

695
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,530
You and l are going
on a little scavenger hunt.

696
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,000
Please, God...

697
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,380
don't make me sleep.

698
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,270
What the hell are we doing here?

699
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,490
l won't be long.

700
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:55,120
What do you think you're doing?

701
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,210
Look, l'm sorry.

702
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,710
l really need this. l got...

703
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,210
l'll reimburse you.

704
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,090
You keep my driver's license.
l'll be back.

705
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,030
Max, l need to see Kristen.

706
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,150
-You don't understand.
-Save your breath.

707
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,070
Dr. Simms
gave me specific instructions.

708
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:32,530
No one sees Kristen,
especially you.

709
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:35,410
But, Max, she needs me.
She's in danger.

710
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,080
You got to believe me!

711
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,130
l really think you mean well,
but my kids been dying off...

712
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,670
and even without Simms' orders,
l wouldn't let you near her.

713
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,800
OK, Max. l understand.

714
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:54,220
Can l say good-bye
to the others?

715
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,430
l don't know.

716
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,270
lt'll be my last chance.

717
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,520
Five minutes.
They're in the TV room.

718
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:09,070
Where have you been?

719
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,070
There's no time. Come on.

720
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,490
-Where?
-Our last group.

721
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,590
ln there.

722
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,050
We knew nobody would ever
find it in that place.

723
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,720
l'm not sure
l can find it myself anymore.

724
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:12,590
lt's deep in the heart
of the place.

725
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,300
Take it slow.

726
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,820
Straight talk only in here.

727
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,320
What about Kristen?

728
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,280
We can't get to her. l tried.

729
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,950
l was hoping we'd have more time
to learn to use the dreams...

730
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:46,330
but Joey's in there.
Kristen's going in, too.

731
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,040
They need us.

732
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:51,300
We're trying to go in,
to link up?

733
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,840
lt's now or never.

734
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,800
l'm not going to kid you.
This is dangerous.

735
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,390
lf you die in this dream,
it's for real.

736
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:01,100
Nobody has to go in
that doesn't want to.

737
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,480
l'm in.

738
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,570
Me, too.

739
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:13,990
Let's go kick the motherfucker's
ass all over dreamland.

740
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,120
Remember, you have to stay
together whatever happens.

741
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,120
That's the only way
we can beat him.

742
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,460
All right.
Clear your mind of everything.

743
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,300
Picture yourself
in the quiet room...

744
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,140
the soft, white walls...

745
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:43,430
the total silence...

746
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,350
only the sound
of your heart beating.

747
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,520
Picture yourself there
with Kristen.

748
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,110
l'm going to count backwards
from five...

749
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:56,200
and when l'm done,
we'll all be asleep.

750
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,240
We'll all be in the quiet room.

751
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,790
Five...

752
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:06,370
four...

753
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,420
three...

754
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,460
two...

755
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,970
one.

756
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:24,270
l knew you'd come.

757
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:26,230
We wouldn't let you go in alone.

758
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:29,270
No way. We're a team !

759
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:33,270
Listen, everybody.
Joey needs us. l can feel him.

760
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,900
Where is he?

761
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,150
How do we find him?

762
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:48,040
Stay in the middle of the room !

763
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,250
Whatever happens, stay together!

764
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:12,520
You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

765
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:16,690
Why are you still up?
lt's past 1:00.

766
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,660
l just thought l'd wait for you.

767
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,030
Well, l'm home.

768
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,580
You can get to sleep now.
Come on.

769
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:27,700
Andale.

770
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,880
What's that for?

771
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,880
l'm just glad you're home.

772
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,180
Mom, l had the most awful dream.

773
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,230
Elaine,
where do you keep the bourbon?

774
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:52,730
l'll be right down.

775
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:55,980
Kris, l've got a guest.

776
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,480
l just don't want to be alone.

777
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:04,370
l said
where's the fucking bourbon?

778
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,080
You should listen
to your mother!

779
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,080
God damn it, Kristen,
you ruin everything!

780
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,790
Every time l bring a man home,
you spoil it!

781
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:16,540
You know what your shrink says?
You just want attention!

782
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,920
ls that you?

783
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,510
Welcome home, Taryn.

784
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,220
Look familiar?

785
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:57,350
OK, asshole, let's dance!

786
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,830
Why should we fight?

787
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:17,370
We're old friends, you and l.

788
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,880
Remember?

789
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,460
Let's get high.

790
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,400
What a rush.

791
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,010
You guys? Where are you?

792
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,970
ls somebody there?

793
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:35,120
You look tired.

794
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,620
Have a seat.

795
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:41,170
No, thanks.
l'm fine just the way l am.

796
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:43,210
For now, maybe.

797
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,170
But when you wake up...

798
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:49,550
it's back...

799
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:52,050
in the saddle...

800
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,970
again.

801
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,650
My leg!

802
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:10,950
lt's the chair for you, kid!

803
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:12,490
l am the Wizard Master.

804
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,870
l am the Wizard Master!

805
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,170
ln the name of Lowrek,
Prince of Elves, demon begone!

806
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,400
Sorry, kid.
l don't believe in fairy tales.

807
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:54,530
Somebody?

808
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,790
What is that?

809
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,550
l don't know.

810
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,930
Yo. l thought l heard voices.

811
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,520
Kincaid, l could kiss you.

812
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:27,150
What's stopping you?

813
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:30,440
Cool. So where's Joey?

814
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,570
l don't know.
This place is a maze.

815
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:35,320
lt's time to stop guessin'
and start messin'.

816
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,530
Yo, Freddy, where you hiding,
you burnt-face pussy!

817
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:40,370
We should find the others first.

818
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,870
You think you're hot shit,
don't you?

819
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:44,410
Come get a piece of me!

820
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,080
Krueger, pussy!

821
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:51,000
l knew he was a little chicken.

822
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,380
Shit.

823
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,690
-lt's a door.
-But it doesn't go anywhere.

824
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,610
Yes, it does.

825
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,130
This is it.

826
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:30,750
Are you ready?

827
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,550
Let's snuff the sucker.

828
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,680
That's it.

829
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,180
The Caddy.

830
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:34,080
Going somewhere?

831
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,470
l said l'd show you where
the goddamn thing was.

832
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:42,970
l never said l'd stick around.

833
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:45,930
-We've got work to do.
-What are you talking about?

834
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,930
You're about to attend
a funeral--

835
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:50,560
one that's long overdue.

836
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:57,000
Joey, look.

837
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,460
All the little piggies
come home.

838
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,130
Let him go, Krueger!

839
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:06,220
Your wish is my command.

840
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,140
He's never been this strong.

841
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:42,480
The souls of children...

842
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,440
give me strength.

843
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,120
Always room for more.

844
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,480
-What's that?
-What?

845
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,030
Listen.

846
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:38,740
Somebody else is out here.

847
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,250
We're alone.

848
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,460
Bury the fucking thing!

849
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:40,640
lt's really you.

850
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:47,940
l killed you once before,
you son of a bitch.

851
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,490
Let's try this way.

852
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:37,530
Kristen, can you pull us out?

853
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:39,410
They sedated me.
We're stuck here.

854
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:41,030
lt's a dead end.

855
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:44,080
What the hell?

856
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:50,210
Sorry to keep you waiting.

857
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:54,300
Perhaps if there was more of me
to spread around.

858
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:52,610
Wow.

859
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:54,110
Did l say that?

860
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:56,320
You found your dream power.

861
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,940
You saved us, Joey.

862
01:27:57,990 --> 01:28:01,110
-You blew him away!
-Put me down.

863
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:02,620
Are you OK?

864
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:04,240
l think so.

865
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,160
He's gone.

866
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:09,500
lt's over.

867
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,760
Daddy?

868
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:28,560
l've crossed over, princess.

869
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:34,020
Crossed over?

870
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:37,690
l couldn't go without
telling you how sorry l am...

871
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:40,820
for all the things l've done.

872
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:42,860
l love you so much.

873
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,870
l'll always love you.

874
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:49,500
l'll always love you.

875
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:03,680
Die.

876
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:23,820
You're mine now, little piggy.

877
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:51,970
Please, God, for the children.

878
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,520
For Nancy.

879
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:56,560
Ashes to ashes.

880
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:03,030
Dust to dust.

881
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,950
Lay this spirit to rest.

882
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:31,640
l won't let you die.
l won't let you.

883
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:35,230
l'm going to dream you
into a beautiful dream...

884
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:37,020
forever and ever.

885
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,870
'Trust in Him at all times.
