1
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:15,152
"It's" Peeping Toms!

2
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:20,325
Starring Ted Craft.
And now, here's Ted!

3
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,871
Hello, everybody,
and welcome to "Peeping Toms,"

4
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,081
New York's newest
and grooviest game.

5
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,458
You have just seen
the first half...

6
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,919
of our real-life
candid situation.

7
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,589
Now, in one minute,
you will have to predict...

8
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:37,384
just what our unsuspecting
subject will do.

9
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,262
You folks there in the audience,
and those of you peeking in at home,

10
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,223
guess along with us, okay? All right.

11
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:48,854
Now, today, our Peeping Tom's
problem is, chivalry.

12
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,940
What does a fella do
when a pretty girl...

13
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:56,278
starts taking off all her clothes
right there in front of him?

14
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,740
A blind girl, that is.

15
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,534
Lovely young model
Danielle Breton...

16
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,536
agreed to be our decoy.

17
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,206
Now, Danielle
is not really blind,

18
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,042
but that's what we want
our male friend to think.

19
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,336
Okay, peepers,
look at the board.

20
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,172
You've got 20 seconds
to pick your answer.

21
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,819
"Well, look at that!"

22
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,322
Both of our contestants
have picked the same answer.

23
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,534
Let's see if they're right.

24
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:57,256
Oh, I am sorry, Pat and Fred,
but better luck next time.

25
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,008
- Right, audience?

26
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,512
All right. And now, before we meet
our contestants for tomorrow,

27
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:07,641
let's bring out the lovely
Danielle Breton, our blind girl.

28
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,528
- Bravo, Danielle.
- Thank you.

29
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,030
It's so nice to see you.
Danielle, what do you do in real life?

30
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:26,243
Right now I study
to be a model with Gene Fox,

31
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,996
and also I study
to be an actress.

32
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,039
Great!
That's wonderful, Danielle.

33
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,041
Danielle, let's bring out
our other guest,

34
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,794
Peeping Tom's
own Mr. Chivalry,

35
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,964
Philip Woode.

36
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,049
Hello, Phil. Nice to meet you.

37
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,094
You're a great sport.

38
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,388
Phil, what do you do
in real life?

39
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,224
I'm an advertising manager
for "The Amsterdam Star."

40
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,226
Oh, great.
That's wonderful.

41
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,228
I'm glad to... Oh! Uh-oh.

42
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,230
It's been wonderful
talking with you, Danielle and Phil,

43
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,941
but that music tells us that we just
have time to give away our prizes...

44
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,943
before we have
to say bye-bye.

45
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:04,448
Danielle, for you, this complete set
of Reynolds stainless steel cutlery.

46
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,783
- Thank you.
- Ha, ha. Congratulations.

47
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,077
And Phil, for you,
good sport that you are,

48
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,996
dining and dancing
for two...

49
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,916
at Manhattan's famous
African Room.

50
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,723
Philip!

51
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,351
I just remembered
that I haven't eaten all day...

52
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,854
and I thought maybe you want
some help with your dinner for two.

53
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,068
I don't bite, you know.

54
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,946
That is, if I'm filled
I don't bite.

55
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,448
I-I have brought
my own cutlery.

56
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,203
- All right, let's go get my car.
- Okay.

57
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,478
... I don't know
what to do, so I just stand there...

58
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:20,107
and, uh, I feel very stupid
and about, uh...

59
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,401
Then I said
to the photographer...

60
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,988
I said something so terrible you can't
even put it in the French movie.

61
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,074
But he deserved that,
you know.

62
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,243
He's a...
How you say that word?

63
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,370
He's a son of a bastard.

64
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,290
- Son of a bitch.
- Yes, he was that too. Son of a bitch.

65
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:41,086
But I'm not, you know, I'm not
like you Americans' women's liberation.

66
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,423
I don't, uh, I don't
spend my life to hate the men.

67
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,510
I don't like that, but this man,
he have deserve what I tell him.

68
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:52,598
So, after that have
happen to me, then, uh,

69
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,726
I said to myself, "Now it's time
for you to go from Quebec."

70
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,728
- Quebec?
- Yes.

71
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,106
- I thought you were French.
- Oh, yes, I'm French-Canadian.

72
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,983
It's not the same,
you know.

73
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,862
Quebec is very pretty,
you know, but now, for me,

74
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:11,533
New York is the home. Is for me...
is for me, freedom, New York.

75
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,577
Yesterday you know
what I have do?

76
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,579
I go to the top
of the Empire State Building.

77
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:19,208
You know, the...
that building, the big...

78
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,669
And I am up there by myself,
and nobody know I am there.

79
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,548
I look down, I can see
all the little car and the people,

80
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:29,885
and I'm all by myself,
and nobody knows that I'm there.

81
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,929
Do you like
to be alone?

82
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,390
Sometime I do,
but not tonight.

83
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,478
Danielle, I think
I should take you home now.

84
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,482
I'm sorry.
This is so embarrassing.

85
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,361
I waited for you at the TV studio.
You saw me.

86
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,821
Why can't you
leave me alone?

87
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:53,242
Look here, Miss Breton
and I were just having a drink.

88
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,369
Mrs. Emil Breton
and you.

89
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,622
I am not married!
I have been divorced for a year.

90
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,208
- But still he follows me.
- Danielle, that is quite enough.

91
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,795
We do not want to discuss our very
private problems in front of strangers.

92
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,672
- Come along now.
- Don't touch me!

93
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,049
- Waiter?
- I will go, but not with you.

94
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,176
- It is important we go home now.
- Yes, sir?

95
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,304
This gentleman
is bothering us.

96
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,598
You better come
with me, sir.

97
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,935
- Just come with me.
- Danielle. Danielle!

98
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,937
Come home with me!

99
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,939
Danielle!
Get your hands off me!

100
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,860
Come on.
Uh, I better take you home.

101
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,571
- Okay.
- Where do you live?

102
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:34,157
- Staten Island.
- Staten Island?

103
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,702
I thought you said
you lived in New York.

104
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,121
Isn't Staten Island
in New York?

105
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,498
I guess it is.
Come on.

106
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,805
You know, there are
so few people...

107
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,932
that I have
any feeling for.

108
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:01,935
Not just men, you know.

109
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,607
Ever since
my sister left.

110
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,443
We have had
such a close bond.

111
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,071
Hey. Hey!

112
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,474
Oops!

113
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,812
Well, here
is my apartment.

114
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:49,316
I have just move in, you know.
I have a dishwasher.

115
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,610
A real dishwasher?

116
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,874
Ah.

117
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:29,189
I think it's very hot
right here.

118
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:33,402
I think I'll turn
the thermostat down.

119
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:57,342
Philip, you know I think
what you should do?

120
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:01,388
Ooh! You just must
wait there for me.

121
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,479
Oh, Christ.

122
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,481
Philip, what
are you doing?

123
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,818
Does your ex-husband
make a habit...

124
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,112
of standing guard
out there?

125
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:03,492
Why he is always
following me?

126
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,036
What is so terrible,
you know, is his persistence.

127
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,330
He-He says that we can
work it through,

128
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,666
but I don't want
to work it through.

129
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,252
Some time there are
no solution.

130
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,089
I think you better go.

131
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,424
- Wait. Wait, look. I got an idea.
- No, I think...

132
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,135
- What?
- Why don't I go downstairs.

133
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,722
I'll get in the car.
I'll drive around the block.

134
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,476
And I'll park. And then I'll
come back through the back entrance.

135
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,478
I'll pretend to leave.

136
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,148
Okay?

137
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,819
- I don't know if that's
such a good idea to do.
- Trust me.

138
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:43,156
I got rid of him before.
I can do it again.

139
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,744
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

140
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,455
I'll wait for you.

141
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,147
You forgot
your cutlery.

142
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,791
Danielle.

143
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,340
Danielle!

144
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,804
- Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, say...

145
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,683
Shh, shh, shh.

146
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,103
- Who was that? Who was that?
- It is my sister.

147
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,690
Come on, take it easy.
You can tell me.

148
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,692
She's so crazy.
She get...

149
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,862
She get so angry with me
when I'm with anyone,

150
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:40,616
except for her,
my husband and now you.

151
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,618
Why is she here?

152
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:50,667
Because we are twins
and today is our birthday...

153
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:55,631
and she can come visit me but she know
that she have to go back...

154
00:20:55,672 --> 00:21:01,053
and so... 
And so she feel very bad.

155
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,806
- Look, why don't I leave.
- No, no, no! Please?

156
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:09,394
- "Stay with me."
- Okay.

157
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:13,440
I look so terrible,
I think.

158
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,734
- No.
- I have such a headache.

159
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,655
- I have had too much
Manhattans last night.
- A little.

160
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,449
Philip, I think
I would feel better.

161
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,451
I have no more
of these pills.

162
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,537
- Could you get me some
at the drug store?
- Sure.

163
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,664
- You know where is Bay Street?
- Yeah.

164
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,960
And then we have
a happy birthday together.

165
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,923
$4.50.

166
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,884
$ .79, $ .89, $ 1.29.

167
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,387
That's $ 7.68.

168
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,193
- Yes.
- You must do as I tell you.

169
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,237
- Yes, I...
- You are not well.

170
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,781
Yes, I know.
Please, but I have only...

171
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:05,159
I have only two pills left.
Please hurry.

172
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,269
Yeah, that one's fine.
And I'd like something written on it.

173
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:35,230
Can't have it.
The cake decorator isn't in yet.

174
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:38,233
- Well, couldn't you do it?
- Are you kidding?

175
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:42,112
- Well, why not?
- Hey, Louise, he wants me
to write on a cake.

176
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:47,117
- You? I'd like to see you try.
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,287
All right then, I will.
What do you want written?

178
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,751
Happy birthday to Danielle...
No. Uh...

179
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,212
Happy birthday
to Dominique and Danielle.

180
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:01,548
Dominique and Danielle.
You gotta be kidding.

181
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,300
Come on.
Let me show you.

182
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,131
Surprise.

183
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:35,095
Hey, now you know you're
not supposed to cut the cake...

184
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,681
until you make a wish
and blow out the candles.

185
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:43,228
No!

186
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:03,952
Hello? I want to report
an emergency... a murder.

187
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,960
Hello.
I want to report a murder.

188
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:14,880
A man, about 25, black.

189
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,132
I saw it just now
through my window.

190
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:20,719
I live in the apartment just across
the courtyard. 36 Hamilton.

191
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:25,766
Yes. I'll meet you downstairs
right away. My name is Grace Collier.

192
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,768
Yes, the Grace Collier.
I wrote that story.

193
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:31,104
I'm sorry you feel that way, Detective,

194
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:33,106
but I have to write it
the way I see it.

195
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,108
Sometimes the police
are wrong.

196
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,612
Look, this is ridiculous.
We can't discuss it now.
A man is bleeding to death.

197
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,449
Yeah. Right away.

198
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:53,544
I'm coming, I'm coming.

199
00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:59,508
Dominique?

200
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,939
Just a minute.

201
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,739
- What's wrong?
- Oh, Emil, thank you for coming,

202
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:26,076
but, uh, everything
is fine now and I get dressed...

203
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,662
- and go out...
- What happened?

204
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:32,040
Well, this morning
I felt those pains...

205
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,709
What happened?

206
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,719
Dominique. What have you done?

207
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,637
Dominique is here?

208
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:50,184
She was.

209
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,528
Watch out.

210
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:06,158
Someone might look
in the window.

211
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,647
Help me.

212
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:39,650
Help me!

213
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,822
- Help me!
- Wh-What are you going to do?

214
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:47,241
It's a beautiful day
here in New York.

215
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:50,118
This is Windy Craig
on the radio for you.

216
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,179
On the couch.

217
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,207
Help me.

218
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,086
Put on some makeup.

219
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,172
It must look as if
nothing has happened.

220
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,163
- Drop it there.
- I'm Grace Collier.

221
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:01,291
I just spoke to you
on the telephone.

222
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,294
How you doing, Miss Collier?
I'm Detective Kelly.

223
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:06,630
My partner,
Detective Spinetti.

224
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,132
- What seems to be the problem?
- You're the man...

225
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:10,592
I spoke to,
aren't you?

226
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,594
- That's right.
- Well, I imagine we can discuss...

227
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:15,180
I hope there's not
too much imagination involved here.

228
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:19,434
You obviously don't think so,
or you wouldn't be here.

229
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:22,312
Now, I just saw a man viciously
and repeatedly stabbed.

230
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:25,607
It was in that apartment up there... 3-R.
The name is Breton.

231
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,609
The man's probably dying
if he's not dead already,

232
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,611
so I think the best thing to do
is to get up there.

233
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:31,613
All right, take it
easy, will you, lady?

234
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,615
These people are
always stabbing each other.

235
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:35,993
- "These people"?
- All right, all right.
Let's just keep calm.

236
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,120
One step at a time.

237
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:41,623
Your story is that you
looked out the window.

238
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:43,750
- What time would that have been?
- Your people have this written down.

239
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,794
The thing to do
is to try to get up there...

240
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,796
and try to save
that poor guy.

241
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,299
Miss Collier, our work
is a profession.

242
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:55,554
- A doctor, for example,
doesn't begin to operate...
- You're not a doctor.

243
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:59,975
I read your article
about police brutality in Stapleton.

244
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:03,020
And the next time "The Staten Island"
"Panorama" decides to investigate...

245
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:07,024
- our methods, I hope
they send a real reporter.
- I'm going up there.

246
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:13,238
- And you're certainly not a cop.
- And you're not either...

247
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,324
if you don't do
something about this.

248
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,743
Unless, of course, you'd rather
go beat up a few students.

249
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,745
Ever hear of a search warrant,
Miss Civil Liberties?

250
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,788
Well, you haven't got one,
and neither do I.

251
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:24,791
You mean you're actually gonna stand
here and ask me idiotic questions...

252
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:28,545
like some dumb courtroom
drama while a man dies?

253
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,923
I saw it.
Saw it happen.

254
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:34,468
- Actually saw it happen.
- Calm down, calm down.

255
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,762
Now, you just go back
to your apartment and relax.

256
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,764
And watch you walk off?

257
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,766
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

258
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:43,268
That'd make a great story
for your next issue.

259
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:47,397
"Police refuse to investigate
brutal race murder."

260
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,399
Not a chance, lady.
You stick with us.

261
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,401
And keep
your mouth shut.

262
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:54,363
I'll do what
I consider necessary.

263
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,958
This isn't
a police state yet.

264
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:25,435
3-R is this way.

265
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,622
- Yes?
- Police officer.

266
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:48,041
- Oh, yes? Can I help you?
- Are you the lady of the house?

267
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,377
- Yes, I am.
- You live here alone?

268
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,921
- Yes.
- Had any company this morning?

269
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:55,465
- Oh, no.
- Two people...
- That will do, Miss Collier.

270
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:58,969
If there is some information that
you need, I will be glad to help you,

271
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:02,014
but as you can see,
I am in the middle of dressing,

272
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:05,517
so, uh, if you excuse me,
I'll finish.

273
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,519
- She's afraid.
- You mind...

274
00:37:07,603 --> 00:37:09,813
- You mind if we come in?
- Just what do you want?

275
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,065
If you don't mind our coming in,
this lady will explain.

276
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:16,028
Have you the search, um... the search
permission? Have you that?

277
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,698
- You mean a search warrant?
- Yes, the search warrant.
Have you that?

278
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:21,950
- No.
- She's stalling. She's hiding the body.

279
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:25,120
If you have not the search warrant,
it's not very important.

280
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:29,082
So if you will excuse me,
I finish to dress.

281
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,543
It'll take me just ten minutes
to get a search warrant,

282
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,546
and while Spinetti here is going
to the trouble of doing that,

283
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,466
- I shall naturally have to...
- Excuse me.

284
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:39,593
I don't mean to offend you.
Come in.

285
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:43,388
But you know, I see all the time
on the television show...

286
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:46,642
the scene of the evil criminal
and the policeman,

287
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,685
and the policeman
knock on the door...

288
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:51,647
and the criminal,
he ask about, you know,

289
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:53,357
what you have ask me...
the search warrant.

290
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,276
But you have not
said to me,

291
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,987
"Open in the name of the law."
You have not said that.

292
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:03,909
- Now, then, Miss...
- Danielle. Danielle Breton.

293
00:38:03,992 --> 00:38:06,703
I'm Detective Kelly.
This is Detective Spinetti,

294
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,122
- How do you do?
- This is Miss Collier, your neighbor...

295
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,708
- "from across the way."
- Hello. How are you?

296
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:16,421
- Hello.
- "Something very unusual"
occurred this morning.

297
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:19,341
Seems that Miss Collier happened to
glance out of her window...

298
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:23,554
and saw something which so shocked
and disturbed her...

299
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:26,640
- that she called the police department.
- I saw a murder.

300
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,895
Thank you, Miss Collier.

301
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:34,606
Now, then, Miss Breton,
I suppose you can see...

302
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,153
- Miss Collier's apartment from here.
- I really don't know.

303
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:41,822
You know very well
you can.

304
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,199
Yes, there's my window.
This is definitely the right apartment.

305
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:48,704
Miss Collier, do you spend a lot of time
watching my apartment?

306
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,081
You saw me.
You know you did.

307
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,625
Lf, uh, I have seen you,

308
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:56,003
then I would have pulled
the shade and if I do that,

309
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,005
I have to give up
all my life...

310
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:00,674
- "to have the privacy."
- She did draw the shade.

311
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:03,677
Obviously once she'd
hidden the body she felt safe.

312
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,096
But it must be here
somewhere.

313
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,349
I can't believe
that this is serious.

314
00:39:09,433 --> 00:39:11,852
He wrote "help"
on this window in his own blood.

315
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,854
And I watched him
write it.

316
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:16,607
- Here he write that?
- "Naturally she washed it off."

317
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,984
It's all so obvious.
This girl is protecting someone.

318
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:24,281
But the murderess
is someone this girl knows.

319
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:27,826
She was shorter
and had a twisted face...

320
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:32,539
and stringy hair and was having
a terrible fit of some kind.

321
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:37,794
- You know someone who would fit
that description, Miss Breton?
- No.

322
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:41,089
Good God! I saw the knife!
I saw her stab him!

323
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,800
Could somebody have gotten in here
without your knowledge?

324
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:47,554
It would be impossible.
I was here all morning.

325
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,598
What about the man
that stayed over?

326
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,393
I was quite alone.

327
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:57,272
You see, I'm-I'm divorced
from my husband, and still, uh...

328
00:39:57,356 --> 00:40:00,025
Well, it's
very personal, you know.

329
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:04,321
But Miss Collier, many time at night
I watch the television show...

330
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:09,076
and I watch the horror film,
and it make me full of fear,

331
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,078
and-and I jump
at every noise.

332
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:15,207
I understand that when you live alone
it make you... It's very difficult.

333
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,209
I understand that.

334
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,758
What I saw happen
was real.

335
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,598
Mind if we have
a look around?

336
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:34,059
No, it's perfectly
all right.

337
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:37,062
Thank you, Miss Collier.

338
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:39,982
I know you're doing your best
to help the forces of justice,

339
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:43,318
but they will be better served
by your sitting down.

340
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:46,655
That body is
here somewhere,

341
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,824
and she knows it.

342
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,826
How many rooms do you
have, Miss Breton?

343
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:53,328
Well, uh, there is
the living room here,

344
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:55,330
and then the bathroom
and the kitchen

345
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,332
and then past
is the bedroom.

346
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,334
You mind if we see
the bathroom?

347
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,837
No. The bathroom
is here.

348
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,429
- See? This. And, uh...
- Bedroom?

349
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,973
Yes, the bedroom
is down here.

350
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:16,894
- In here.
- Coming, Miss Collier?

351
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:20,439
Oh, uh, 'scuse me
for a second.

352
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:14,743
Miss Collier,
would you stick with us, please?

353
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:30,926
- I understand.
- Have you looked under the bed?

354
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:32,928
I was waiting for you.

355
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,724
Any luck?

356
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,893
I think we should check
those hallway closets.

357
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:43,772
- It's fine with me.
They are right here.
- Thank you.

358
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:51,280
There you are...
and there.

359
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,451
- Can we look in these bags?
- Yes, fine.

360
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:16,722
Why do you have things
in pairs, like twins?

361
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,724
- 
- You have a twin.

362
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,976
I have a television commercial
to do some time...

363
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,479
and in case I should get
the makeup on the dress,

364
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,815
then there is another one
for the next take.

365
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:29,860
You see, uh,
I'm a model.

366
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:31,862
And some time
an actress too.

367
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:35,365
- You certainly are.
- That will do, Miss Collier.

368
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:38,785
I'm sorry to have
troubled you, Miss Breton.

369
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:42,414
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
- I'm sure you'll
report it to the police.

370
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,875
- Oh, yes.
- By withholding evidence,

371
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,461
you can make yourself
an accessory after the fact.

372
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,422
If I do hear anything,
I'll telephone you.

373
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:53,634
Oh, excuse me.

374
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:57,304
- Oh!
- Hello, darling. Am I late?

375
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:59,723
No. Officer Kelly,
this is my, uh, husband...

376
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:03,810
my ex-husband, Emil Breton,
and Officer Spinetti.

377
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:07,523
Now you have done something
naughty and the police have found out.

378
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:11,360
No, they tell me
that they look for a dead body.

379
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,779
Are you serious?

380
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,740
Well, the lady claims
she saw a murder victim.

381
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:21,495
- Mind if I ask you a few questions?
- No, not if I can help.

382
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,789
Just what
is your full name?

383
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:28,293
- Emil Breton.
- How long have you
and Mrs. Breton been divorced?

384
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:31,839
We are not divorced.
We are separated.

385
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:35,384
Dominique and Danielle!
She "does" have a twin! Oh!

386
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:47,938
It was right...
right here.

387
00:45:00,576 --> 00:45:02,870
- Listen...
- Listen. One more word out of
you and I'm going to book you.

388
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:06,039
I'll book you on something. I'll find
something in the book to book you on.

389
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:08,083
Attempted libel,
assault on a police officer...

390
00:45:08,167 --> 00:45:10,043
I don't care what it is,
but I'll do it.

391
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:12,254
I saw a murder,
and I'll prove it.

392
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:15,215
Listen, Miss Collier, I don't know
what kind of a nut you are,

393
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,509
or what kind of an exposé
you're looking to get,

394
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:20,804
but just don't bother me
or that girl upstairs, okay?

395
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:25,142
Far as I'm concerned, this case
is closed, you got that? Closed!

396
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:48,040
Grace, I thought we were
supposed to meet upstairs.

397
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:50,042
What are you
doing here?

398
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,836
Grace, it's Tuesday.

399
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,838
Oh, I forgot.

400
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,924
Um, well, let's go.

401
00:45:57,007 --> 00:46:00,093
Honey, don't you think
you ought to change into
something a little bit more...

402
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,304
Yeah, I'll change.
I'll meet you at the car, okay?

403
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,402
Honey, I thought we were
going upstairs to have a little chat,

404
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:19,404
and if you were embarrassed
about the mess,

405
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:23,158
you know I'm always glad
to help you tidy up.

406
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:27,246
Although, what you're going to do
when you get married, I don't know.

407
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:30,999
Oh, did I tell you
the Cunningham girl is engaged?

408
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:34,920
She's about your age, and she finally
found somebody that suits her.

409
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,922
He's a doctor.

410
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:40,425
Well, he's a veterinarian,
but the animals are all
owned by wealthy people...

411
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:42,970
and he has
his own hospital.

412
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:45,889
So you see, honey? Just because things
aren't working out...

413
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:49,268
with you and your editor...
Uh, what's his name? ...Jim?

414
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,812
- I don't want to discuss that.
- Oh.

415
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:55,023
Well, I'm not trying
to interfere, honey.

416
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:59,194
But you know, this doctor has
a very interesting young assistant.

417
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:01,613
Grace, that reminds me.

418
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:03,615
They've started
right in our neighborhood,

419
00:47:03,699 --> 00:47:05,868
and I don't know whether the zoning laws
are going to permit it.

420
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:08,537
And I just don't know
how they got away with it.

421
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,040
But three or four blocks away
from us... Are you listening, honey?

422
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:15,878
Because this would make a very
interesting story for your newspaper.

423
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:19,214
An experimental
madhouse.

424
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:23,218
Now, you see, what's worse is that
they just let them walk around.

425
00:47:23,302 --> 00:47:26,680
The whole idea is that instead
of locking them up,

426
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:28,891
they let them live
in a house...

427
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:31,143
and the doctors make
a home for them,

428
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:35,731
and it's sort of a family situation,
just like real people.

429
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:41,069
It's very advanced.
I saw something about it on television.

430
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:43,071
Now you see, honey?
There are interesting things...

431
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:46,742
going on right here
on Staten Island.

432
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:49,870
But I tell you,
I don't feel safe at night.

433
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,872
- Would you stop here? Pull over.
- Why?

434
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:12,309
Everything looks so...

435
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,311
If you want pastry,
let's wait and get it at Brian's.

436
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:16,313
I don't want
any pastry.

437
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,569
Did a man come in here
this morning and buy a birthday cake?

438
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:25,948
Lady, ten men came in
and bought ten birthday cakes.

439
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:30,118
This cake had two names on it,
but written the way a child
writes, not the way a...

440
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,081
Oh, yeah. The colored guy that
made me write on the cake.

441
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:37,835
- What were the names?
- I don't know.

442
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:40,003
Daisy and Debbie.

443
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:42,005
Dominique and Danielle.

444
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:44,174
- That's what it was.
- Yeah! That's it.

445
00:48:44,258 --> 00:48:46,510
I did it,
and I don't even remember.

446
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:49,680
- Can I have your names, please?
- What for?

447
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:53,267
My name is Grace Collier, and I write
for "The Staten Island Panorama."

448
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,144
And I'm her mother,
Mrs. Payson Collier.

449
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,021
My girlfriend and I
read your column.

450
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:00,983
My name
is Elaine Deanna.

451
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:02,985
Deanna.

452
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:07,447
- And the other girl is Louise Wilanski.
- Wilanski.

453
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:11,368
- What do you want to know?
- Thank you. That's fine.

454
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:15,455
Huh.
How do you like that?

455
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:19,168
She says she's gonna write an article,
and she doesn't ask us any questions.

456
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:22,796
They're just terrible
about deadlines.

457
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,464
Next, please?

458
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:29,636
Really, Grace,
you were rather abrupt.

459
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,972
I happen to be working
on an assignment.

460
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:35,058
Well, don't you think you're taking this
little job of yours a bit seriously?

461
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:38,020
You're 25 years old. You should be
thinking about something else.

462
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:40,022
I'm not gonna marry anybody.

463
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:44,067
And I wish you'd stop referring
to my work as "a little job."

464
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,069
I like to call what I do
a profession,

465
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:50,240
only working for "The Staten Island"
"Panorama" is a bit of a joke.

466
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:52,493
- Do you know what
my next assignment is?
- No, I don't.

467
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:55,162
I'm having lunch tomorrow
with an 80-year-old ex-con...

468
00:49:55,245 --> 00:50:00,042
who's just carved an entire replica
of the Danbury Penitentiary out of soap.

469
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,253
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Oh, I want to write about...

470
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,255
about the apathy
in the police force.

471
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:08,717
- About where the heroin goes
after a bust. About the...
- Shh!

472
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,137
You don't have to shout
like you're on the street.

473
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:14,139
What's the matter with you?
I've never seen you like this.

474
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:17,935
- I'm on to something big.
- Are you on diet pills again?

475
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,896
I can see that you
have your mind on other things.

476
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:23,398
- Can we have another date?
- We "do" have another date.

477
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,776
- You have supper with us on Friday.
- Fine.

478
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,778
I'll be there.

479
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:31,990
Well, can I
drop you somewhere?

480
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:34,952
No. It's okay.
I'll walk.

481
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,954
Well, it's not the way
we planned it, but...

482
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:40,791
A white woman kills
her black lover,

483
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:43,836
and those racist cops
couldn't care less.

484
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:46,964
I saw it happen,
and they won't investigate.

485
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,135
Well, if you're not
interested,

486
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,555
I'm sure I can find
someone else who'd print it.

487
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:56,557
Lots of people would.

488
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:04,815
Good. You're interested.

489
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:08,986
I'll do my own investigation.
Why not?

490
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:11,029
I know more
than those idiot police.

491
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:14,950
I know karate...
A private detective. Waste of money.

492
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:17,077
I...

493
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:19,788
All right.
All right, what's his name?

494
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,666
"Joseph Larch."

495
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:50,235
- Now, I think the best
thing for us to do...
- This is what we do.

496
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,280
You go up to your apartment, call
Danielle, and see if anybody's home.

497
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:55,824
If someone answers, wave once.
If no one is there, wave twice.

498
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,826
- Well, you're going up there
if no one's there?
- Sure.

499
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,828
All I have to do is know
the situation in advance.

500
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,830
- I can play it either way.
- Well, in that case, I can pretend...

501
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:04,500
- to be making an informal
telephone survey...
- You just do hand signals.

502
00:52:04,541 --> 00:52:06,502
If there's no one
up there,

503
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,504
I can charm the superintendent
into giving me a passkey.

504
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,423
- No, you've got to make
a wax impression.
- No one does that.

505
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:14,259
Go up to your apartment,
watch the front while I'm up there,

506
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:16,261
and if you see someone coming,
telephone the apartment.

507
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,263
- One ring. One ring and hang up.
- Well, what if...

508
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:20,432
- Does that answer your question?
- Yeah.

509
00:52:20,516 --> 00:52:22,601
- But suppose that...
- Hey, have you ever been a detective?

510
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,603
- No.
- Have you?

511
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:27,272
No, but simple logic suggests
a way of doing things.

512
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:31,568
- I don't see that it can be
all that mysterious.
- Grace, this is a craft.

513
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:33,946
I wouldn't try to teach you how
to write magazine articles.

514
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:35,948
Listen, I went to school
to learn this...

515
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:38,450
The Brooklyn Institute
of Modern Investigation. Okay?

516
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:40,911
- Okay.
- Okay.

517
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:43,956
Now, you go on up to your apartment
and do what I told you. Go ahead.

518
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:47,292
I'll be here.

519
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,012
Larch?

520
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:55,861
The boxes.

521
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:32,606
- What?
- Meet me in the truck.

522
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,323
My God.

523
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:57,214
Get out of there, Larch.

524
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:14,583
We got to get
out of here.

525
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,600
- What was that you were waving?
- I don't know,

526
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:34,311
but they had it hidden in the bedroom,
so it might be something important.

527
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:36,313
Take a look in it
while I tell you...

528
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,607
about the real evidence
I found in the living room.

529
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,068
I got up there
without any trouble.

530
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:44,029
I did the usual search...
nothing.

531
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:47,783
I began to think that cop
was right about you until
I tried to move that couch.

532
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:50,702
- I couldn't. It was too heavy.
- The couch.

533
00:56:50,786 --> 00:56:54,039
- Yeah. He's in the couch.
- What?

534
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:56,959
- The body.
- What about the body?

535
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,961
What I went up there
to look for, remember?

536
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,963
The body
is in the couch!

537
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:04,591
Terrific!
And the murderess is in here!

538
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:07,886
- What?
- Do you know what you've found?

539
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,640
A complete file
on the Blanchion Twins.

540
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:13,642
- Now what are you talking about?
- Do you remember...

541
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:17,354
about a year ago, "Life" magazine
ran a whole story on them.

542
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:19,940
- The only Siamese twins...
- Look, I was up there, Grace,

543
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:23,360
and I know what I know and saw,
and I didn't see no Siamese twins.

544
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:26,780
I do know that you have to have
a dead body before you have a murder.

545
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,824
I gotta get going.
We gotta catch this ferry.

546
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:31,952
You mean that's all you're gonna do...
locate the body and then split?

547
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:34,329
- Yes, for Quebec.
- Quebec?

548
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:36,331
That's where Breton
told them to take it.

549
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:39,334
Now, wherever that couch goes,
I follow, because somebody's
gonna be waiting for it...

550
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:41,336
at the other end,
and I want to know who.

551
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:45,757
- That makes sense.
- Hey, lend me a dollar, will ya?

552
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:48,468
When we get to Manhattan,
I'm gonna go see this writer,

553
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,470
- and then...
- Then you go back to your apartment,

554
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:52,973
lock the door, and wait
for me to call. Period.

555
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,375
Where's Arthur McLennen's
office?

556
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:22,377
Uh, end of the hall,
to your right.

557
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,225
- Uh, Miss, uh, Miss Collier?
- Yes.

558
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:38,727
Ah, yes.
Well, I'm, uh, I'm Arthur McLennen.

559
00:58:38,811 --> 00:58:40,729
- How do you do?
- Hello.

560
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:44,733
I, uh, I'm afraid
I'm a little disorganized today.

561
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:48,237
Are, uh, are you here
about, uh...

562
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:54,326
- Well. That's the Blanchion Twins file.
- Yes, it is.

563
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:56,495
Now, I know you did the story
over a year ago,

564
00:58:56,578 --> 00:58:59,206
but I was hoping you might remember
enough about it to help me.

565
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:01,208
Oh, those poor girls.

566
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:06,296
You know, this looks like the file
I saw at the Loisel Institute.

567
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,841
- Oh, it "is" the original, isn't it?
- Yes, I believe it is.

568
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:12,010
How'd you get it?
Are you going to do a follow-up?

569
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:15,055
We never did. The managing editor
would never assign it.

570
00:59:15,138 --> 00:59:17,140
Well, they've asked me to find out
as much as I can about it.

571
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:20,310
We're not quite sure
what kind of a piece we'd do.

572
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:23,397
Oh, well, come on in
and we'll talk about it, huh?

573
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,568
The subject
is a curious one.

574
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:30,612
After we ran this story,
we got about 500 letters.

575
00:59:30,654 --> 00:59:35,784
No matter what else they said,
they all had that same tone
of morbid fascination.

576
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:38,745
I don't excuse myself,
either.

577
00:59:38,829 --> 00:59:43,041
Though I actually met the Blanchion
girls, I was the same way.

578
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:46,128
Hey. You know,
if you're going to do that piece,

579
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:48,130
I've got something
I'd like to show you.

580
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:51,425
- Oh, I'd appreciate anything that...
- You do have some time now?

581
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:54,970
- Of course!
- Sometimes I forget myself
when I get going on a subject,

582
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:57,973
but actually, if you have the time,
I'd like to show you a videotape.

583
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:01,643
The more I learned,
the more interested I became.

584
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:05,772
You see, to me at any rate,
the psychological and
philosophical elements...

585
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:08,442
are of extreme importance.

586
01:00:08,484 --> 01:00:10,444
Yes. Fine.

587
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:13,655
Well, there.
About to begin.

588
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:24,458
Conjoined twins,
called Siamese,

589
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,128
challenge life
at their first breath.

590
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:31,465
History had them
as the stuff of myth and symbol.

591
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:35,636
Some tried to achieve
such normality as they could.

592
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:39,681
The famous Chang and Eng,
the twins of Siamese birth...

593
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:42,684
who gave this congenital
abnormality its popular name,

594
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:46,855
married and fathered families.

595
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:50,776
Other twins lived by hiring
themselves out to sideshows...

596
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:53,987
or running
small town souvenir shops.

597
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:58,659
With the sophisticated surgical
techniques developed in this century,

598
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,746
some twins have been separated
and lead normal lives.

599
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:06,834
Others never can.

600
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:11,338
Born on March 27, 1948,
in Quebec, the Blanchions...

601
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:13,882
were Canada's
first Siamese twins.

602
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:19,346
Their parents died in an
automobile accident only days
before their first birthday.

603
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:23,267
Dominique and Danielle
were to grow up...

604
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:27,271
from then on within the pale walls
of the Loisel Institute,

605
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:31,692
where surgeons, reluctant
to risk an operation on their
delicate spinal conjoinment,

606
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:34,444
decided to let
them live as one.

607
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:38,073
- But whether as twins through life...
- That's Danielle's husband.

608
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:41,034
- Who told you that?
- I want to hear this.

609
01:01:41,118 --> 01:01:43,453
There is always
a price to pay.

610
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:47,040
It seems the older
they become,

611
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:51,920
the more precarious
is their psychological balance,

612
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:56,592
both within themselves
and between one another.

613
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:59,887
In this, I am in agreement
with my colleagues.

614
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:03,182
Although, they tend
to think that Dominique...

615
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:06,727
is the truly disturbed one,

616
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:11,315
I think they will find that
Danielle, who is so sweet,

617
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:15,652
so responsive, so normal,

618
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:18,113
as opposed to her sister,

619
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:21,658
can only be so
because of her sister.

620
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:25,078
- Bonjour, Dominique.
-

621
01:02:25,162 --> 01:02:29,583
This was the last interview
the conjoined twins would ever give.

622
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,960
That night, the doctors
were forced by nature...

623
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:35,297
to perform an operation
they had hoped to avoid.

624
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:39,676
Late the next day, the institute
announced the successful separation.

625
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,137
Dominique and Danielle,

626
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:47,017
once one, would now
stand each alone.

627
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:52,689
- Well, what do you think?
- That's an extraordinary
tape, Mr. McLennen.

628
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:54,983
Now, I tried
to do a follow-up,

629
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:58,362
but the institute was closed to me
even as a friend of the twins.

630
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:01,949
- Why was that?
- Well, all I could find out
at the time was that...

631
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:04,743
after the operation there
had been some complications.

632
01:03:04,827 --> 01:03:08,872
- What sort of complications?
- I never did get
any official information,

633
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:12,376
so I slipped 20 bucks to one of the
suture nurses, and she told me that...

634
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:15,337
Dominique Blanchion had died
on the operating table.

635
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:33,113
- What are you doing?
- I have my work to do.

636
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:39,620
- Do you live here?
- So they tell me.

637
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:43,582
Do you mind
if I use your telephone?

638
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:46,084
- No.
- Where is it?

639
01:08:46,168 --> 01:08:48,629
It's in the kitchen
down the hall.

640
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,672
Thank you.

641
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:13,987
Better spray yourself, hon.
You're not supposed to be in here.

642
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:16,824
I've got
to use the telephone.

643
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:21,161
You're not supposed
to be in here.

644
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:23,205
I think you have a cold.

645
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:28,293
No, no.

646
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:34,091
It's a clean telephone.

647
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:41,265
Don't just think you can
walk in here like that.

648
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:48,272
Did you know that the germs
can come through the wires?

649
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:52,943
I never call
and I never answer.

650
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:56,321
It's a good way
to get sick.

651
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:59,950
Very, very sick.

652
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:04,454
That's how I got so sick.
Someone called me on the telephone!

653
01:10:04,538 --> 01:10:07,833
What's going on here?
Who are you?

654
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:11,170
My name is Grace Collier and I write
for "The Staten Island Panorama,"

655
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:14,256
- and I must use the telephone.
- No!

656
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:17,217
No!
Don't give it to her. Don't!

657
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,887
She won't use it, Arlene.
She won't.

658
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,473
Trust me.

659
01:10:25,809 --> 01:10:30,272
Look, this is the Lynton Clinic.
You can't just come
walking in here like this.

660
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:33,400
Well I can if one of your patients is
roaming around loose murdering people.

661
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:37,279
Oh, come on. There have been a lot of
wild rumors going around about us,

662
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:39,531
but I wouldn't expect the "Panorama"
to take them seriously.

663
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,284
I take them seriously
and I'm going to call the police!

664
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:44,786
Better talk to the head of the clinic.
Now, if you call about 10:00 tomorrow...

665
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:47,289
I'll speak
to him now!

666
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:51,126
- I'll see if he'll see you.
He's probably gone to bed.
-

667
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:54,796
Hello, Doctor.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

668
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:58,342
There's a girl here who says she's
"a reporter from the" Panorama.

669
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:01,303
She insists
on talking to you.

670
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:03,514
Okay.

671
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:07,643
Doctor will be
right with you. Arlene...

672
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:12,773
- You did a good job cleaning up.
-

673
01:11:12,856 --> 01:11:17,152
Now, you can take your things
back to the supply room.

674
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:39,675
One of your patients is a murderess.

675
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:43,679
I followed her here tonight. Now, we've
got to call the police. That's him!

676
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,348
Dr. Breton, this girl says
she's from the "Panorama."

677
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:49,476
Hello, Margaret,
why aren't you in your room?

678
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:52,771
This man is involved in a murder
and we have got to call the police.

679
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:56,400
She came to us last night. We're
very happy to have her join our family.

680
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,819
Oh, I was off duty.

681
01:11:58,861 --> 01:12:02,865
Margaret, this is Mr. Jansen.
Margaret Grisham.

682
01:12:02,948 --> 01:12:06,285
- Hello, Margaret.
- Nice try.

683
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:08,579
If you'll go and check my I.D.,
it's in my car outside.

684
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:10,539
I am Grace Collier.

685
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:16,336
I wouldn't insist on "Margaret" right
away. We want to respect your wishes.

686
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:19,506
When you're ready to have us
call you Margaret, you tell us.

687
01:12:19,548 --> 01:12:22,926
- Take her to room 23.
- Right.

688
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,929
Dr. Corbin, prepare her
for hypnotherapy.

689
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:32,936
Come with me, Margaret.
Grace, I mean. It's all right.

690
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:42,237
Please. Now, you've
got to believe me.

691
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:46,492
I am perfectly sane. Just go downstairs
and check my bag. It's in my car.

692
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:49,036
- Yes, Grace. Just as soon
as you're settled in.
- No! Now!

693
01:12:49,077 --> 01:12:52,122
- I'm afraid my life is in danger.
- I understand.

694
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:54,208
Oh, God!
I know what that sounds like.

695
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:57,252
I'm serious. As soon
as you find out who I am,

696
01:12:57,336 --> 01:12:59,338
you'll know that they are
making all of this up!

697
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,798
Grace, I believe
you're serious in what you think.

698
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,635
- Let go of my arm!
- Well, it's a little rough
going here in the dark, Grace.

699
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:07,805
- Stop calling me Grace!
- Then, you really do
want to be Margaret?

700
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:10,307
No, damn it,
my name is Grace!

701
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,434
Let go.
Let go.

702
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:16,146
All right, Margaret, just push up your
sleeve for me. This won't hurt a bit.

703
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,232
-  Help!
- Get her in the room.

704
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:25,239
No!

705
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:28,617
Help!

706
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:43,340
Open your eyes.

707
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,093
You came here
to ask me questions.

708
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:49,513
- Is that correct?
-  Yes.

709
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:55,185
You will ask me questions.
You will remember my answers
exactly, word for word.

710
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:58,438
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

711
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:03,443
Good.
Now, repeat after me.

712
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:06,780
What did you do
with the body?

713
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:10,951
- Repeat.
- What did you do with the body?

714
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:13,912
It was all
a ridiculous mistake.

715
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,415
There was no body.

716
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:20,961
- Repeat.
- It was all a ridiculous mistake.

717
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,505
There was no body.

718
01:14:23,547 --> 01:14:28,510
There was no body,
because there was no murder.

719
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:30,637
Repeat.

720
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:35,392
There was no body
because there was no murder.

721
01:14:35,476 --> 01:14:41,315
- Again.
- There was no body because
there was no murder.

722
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:43,650
Good.

723
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:48,322
When you awaken, all you will remember
is what I have told you...

724
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:50,532
if anyone should ask.

725
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:53,619
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

726
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:55,913
Good.

727
01:14:55,996 --> 01:15:01,001
Now, I'm going to take you deeper...
into deeper sleep.

728
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:06,381
Relax. Breathe in.

729
01:15:06,465 --> 01:15:09,676
Breathe out.

730
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:12,971
Breathe in.

731
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:17,559
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

732
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:22,689
You came to watch us, to spy on us,
to feed on our sorrows...

733
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:26,026
look at me... at no cost.

734
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:29,279
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, I hear you.

735
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:31,281
Good.

736
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:34,117
You want to know
all our secrets?

737
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:38,580
All right. We will
share them with you.

738
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:41,416
Watch.

739
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:58,058
Wh-Why is she here?

740
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,728
Don't you remember?
She was always here.

741
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,814
Don't you remember?

742
01:16:03,897 --> 01:16:06,316
- No.
-  Go back.

743
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,154
- Go back. Remember.

744
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:14,741
- I can remember.
- Remember
when you were very young.

745
01:16:14,783 --> 01:16:18,370
I am in agreement
with my colleagues.

746
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:22,082
Although they
believe that Dominique...

747
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:26,295
is the one
who is truly disturbed,

748
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:31,592
I think that they will find
that Danielle, who is so sweet,

749
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:35,471
so responsive, so normal,

750
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,973
as opposed to her sister,

751
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:42,144
can only be so
because of her sister.

752
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:45,564
- Danielle...
-  And the time
we had the picnic.

753
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:50,444
- That's right, the picnic.
- And people have come to see us.

754
01:16:50,486 --> 01:16:52,779
- To see you, yes.
- I remember.

755
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:56,658
- What else do you remember?
- She is not just one.

756
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,286
- They were all my friends.
- They were... They were your friends.

757
01:16:59,369 --> 01:17:01,997
- Oh, Dominique, it's okay.
- They brought...

758
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,041
- Thank you, Charlie.
- Their picnic lunches...

759
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:06,627
- and their cameras.
- Yes.

760
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,837
And they brought
their little children.

761
01:17:08,921 --> 01:17:11,673
- Ah, yes. I remember that.
- They gave you treats.

762
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:13,800
- Little cakes, candies...
- Yes, an apple... You gave me an apple.

763
01:17:13,884 --> 01:17:16,678
Apples, yes.
And then they asked...

764
01:17:16,762 --> 01:17:18,722
- if they can take your picture.
- Yes.

765
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:22,059
- Dominique didn't like
the children very much.
- Is that right, Dominique?

766
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:26,939
- No, she said that
they were laughing at us.
- Do you remember?

767
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:29,733
- No, I can't remember.
- Go back. Try.

768
01:17:29,817 --> 01:17:33,070
- What did they call you?
- I-I can't remember that.

769
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:35,405
- Try to remember what they called you.
- Go away, please!

770
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:38,200
- You can remember.
"You" can "remember. Look at me."
- I can't remember. No!

771
01:17:38,242 --> 01:17:41,370
- Look at me!
- Go away! I can't remember that.

772
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:44,998
"- You" can "remember."
What did they call you?
- No. I don't know!

773
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:48,418
- Remember!
- They said, "freak."
"Look at the freak."

774
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:51,713
- ... the freak, the freak...
- Sweetie, smile.

775
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:54,424
- 
... the freak, the freak...
-  Smile.

776
01:17:54,508 --> 01:17:58,053
Make them go away
from me, please.

777
01:17:58,137 --> 01:18:00,222
Don't you remember what you learned
last spring that you could never have?

778
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:03,225
- No, I can't remember.
No, I can't remember!
- Yes, you can. Try.

779
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:05,602
Don't you remember you realized
you could have no home,

780
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:08,689
- no husband, no children, no baby?
- Yes, I remember that.

781
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:11,567
Yes, I remember that.

782
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:24,872
You're supposed
to be sleeping.

783
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:35,090
Why can't you
make her go away?

784
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:39,970
Can you make her go away?
Please. Please.

785
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:45,142
Of course.

786
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:05,037
Help me.
Don't let him hurt me.

787
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,166
Help me.
Help me.

788
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:57,714
- 
-  Danielle,
what happened afterward?

789
01:19:57,798 --> 01:20:01,301
L... I was walking in the garden...

790
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:03,428
with Dominique and...

791
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:08,100
I tried to tell her that
I was going to have a baby.

792
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:11,103
And l...

793
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:16,775
I tried to explain that
it could be her baby too, but...

794
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:21,905
but she doesn't understand
and she get very angry at me.

795
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:26,869
And she... tried to kill
the baby with the garden shear.

796
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:29,580
- Are you in pain?
-

797
01:20:29,663 --> 01:20:32,666
I'm-I'm going
to lose my baby.

798
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:35,460
No,
you will be fine.

799
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:39,423
- I'm going to die.
- Everything will be fine.

800
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:45,345
- 
- Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

801
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,389
Oh, it hurts me.
Please help me.

802
01:20:47,473 --> 01:20:51,185
Do not be afraid.
Do not be afraid.

803
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:53,187
Do not be afraid.

804
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:57,900
I am a surgeon.
You have lost our baby.

805
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:01,278
You are
bleeding very badly.

806
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:06,617
The only way I can save you
is to separate you from Dominique.

807
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,994
-  Am I going to die?
-  No.

808
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:13,457
You will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

809
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:19,421
Sleep.
Sleep. Sleep.

810
01:22:24,695 --> 01:22:27,322
Relax, relax,
relax, relax.

811
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:35,289
- Relax. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.
-

812
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:38,834
- I-I am sure you've
come back, Dominique.
-

813
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:40,878
- Dominique! Dominique.
- Dominique is dead.

814
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:43,463
Please come back,
Dominique.

815
01:22:43,505 --> 01:22:46,633
Dominique is dead.
Remember.

816
01:22:46,717 --> 01:22:48,510
No, she's not dead.
She's going to kill you.

817
01:22:48,552 --> 01:22:50,137
- She "is" dead.
- No!

818
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:53,515
- I know she's not. No! No, she's not.
- Sleep.

819
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:57,978
- Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.
- No. No...

820
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:02,900
- She's not.
- Dominique is dead. She is dead.

821
01:23:02,983 --> 01:23:06,361
Time you learn
to accept her death.

822
01:23:08,989 --> 01:23:11,617
We both have
to go away now.

823
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:15,412
Danielle, I'm going
to marry you.

824
01:23:15,496 --> 01:23:20,584
Do you remember?
How we came here to the clinic...

825
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:24,004
and made it our own?

826
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:29,051
It was good
for a while.

827
01:23:29,134 --> 01:23:33,514
But Dominique
never died for you.

828
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:37,518
You kept her alive
in your mind.

829
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:43,357
Sometimes... Sometimes,
you even became her...

830
01:23:43,398 --> 01:23:47,986
to reassure yourself
of her existence.

831
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:51,990
You could never
accept the guilt,

832
01:23:52,074 --> 01:23:57,538
The terrible guilt
for Dominique's death.

833
01:23:57,621 --> 01:24:01,959
It was hard for me
to accept what had happened...

834
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:07,005
- that we could never live
together as man and wife.
-

835
01:24:07,089 --> 01:24:10,342
Every time
I made love to you,

836
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:13,053
Dominique came back...

837
01:24:13,095 --> 01:24:16,723
and took control of you.

838
01:24:16,807 --> 01:24:20,853
I did not know
how to rid you of her.

839
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:23,981
All I could do was
give you the pills...

840
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:27,067
and keep you sedated...

841
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:30,487
until she went away.

842
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:33,907
- 
- I tried to warn you about Dominique.

843
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:38,370
Dominique is dangerous
for both of us.

844
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:40,372
To Dominique,

845
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:45,586
any man that made love
to you is me...

846
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:48,422
Emil.

847
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:54,344
Danielle? Danielle?
I love you.

848
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:26,835
- 
- Look at this knife.

849
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:29,963
Look at it. You killed
a man with this knife.

850
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:34,134
- Remember. Remember.
-

851
01:25:36,094 --> 01:25:40,808
- Remember. That's it.
-

852
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:49,024
- What happened?
- There was a cake.

853
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:52,152
A cake?
What else?

854
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:54,947
They had candles.

855
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:58,158
Yes.
What did you do?

856
01:25:58,242 --> 01:26:00,911
- I made a wish,
- Yes.

857
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:04,706
- And I blew out the candles.
- Yes.

858
01:26:04,748 --> 01:26:07,209
And then I cut him!

859
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:09,122
Relax, fellas.
He's dead.

860
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:18,340
Just a minute,
Mrs. Breton.

861
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:21,718
Are you prepared to confess to the
murder of your husband, Emil Breton?

862
01:28:21,802 --> 01:28:26,056
I warn you that whatever you say
may be used as evidence against you.

863
01:28:28,767 --> 01:28:31,520
I have never
hurt anyone in my life.

864
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:35,524
You claim that you had
a sister who did it?

865
01:28:37,651 --> 01:28:39,903
My sister died last spring.

866
01:28:45,576 --> 01:28:47,536
Dawson.

867
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:39,129
- Well, Miss Collier, up and about?
-

868
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:42,508
- How do you feel today?
- Oh, fine. Thanks.

869
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:45,219
- Oh, thank you for the chocolates.
- Oh, you're welcome.

870
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,638
- Would you like one?
- No, thank you.

871
01:29:47,721 --> 01:29:52,059
Well, you'll be interested to know
that we're reopening the whole case.

872
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:55,437
We already got her on first-degree
murder for Breton.

873
01:29:55,521 --> 01:29:59,566
But we haven't had any luck turning up
that black man you saw her slice up.

874
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:01,944
Now, I want you to tell me
everything you can remember.

875
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:07,241
It was all a ridiculous mistake.
There was no body.

876
01:30:07,282 --> 01:30:12,246
Look, I apologize
for having been so skeptical.

877
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:14,331
I should have
put more trust in your claim.

878
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:18,210
It-It was all
a ridiculous mistake.

879
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:22,089
What else do you want me to do?
Apologize in print?

880
01:30:22,131 --> 01:30:25,634
- I sent you candy.
- I'm telling you all I can remember!

881
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:28,804
Look, I talked to your editor,
and he told me about
the detective that you hired.

882
01:30:28,887 --> 01:30:33,559
What did he think? I got a witness
who saw the couch loaded onto the truck.

883
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:36,270
Now, obviously the body
was hidden inside that couch.

884
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:38,313
Otherwise,
why would they move it?

885
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:43,527
It's really quite simple. There was
no body because there was no murder!

886
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:48,532
What was simple? There's nothing
simple about any of this.

887
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:53,495
L- I just don't understand you.
Now you claim that there wasn't a body.

888
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:57,249
If there wasn't a body,
why did you make such an accusation?

889
01:30:57,332 --> 01:30:59,334
You know how serious
that could be?

890
01:30:59,418 --> 01:31:03,130
Grace has never deliberately
told a lie in her life.

891
01:31:03,172 --> 01:31:05,299
You have to understand
that she's not quite herself.

892
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:08,802
I'm fine! There's absolutely
nothing wrong with me!

893
01:31:08,844 --> 01:31:12,973
All I know is there was no body
because there was no murder!
