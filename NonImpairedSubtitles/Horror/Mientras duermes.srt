1
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:09,736
6am and we're still here
answering your calls.

2
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:13,096
Sharing your problems, llstenlng...

3
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:19,756
... my chlldren,
my motivation to go to work.

4
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:23,091
Just to get up In the mornlng.

5
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:28,932
I don't really know where to start...

6
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:34,517
... now they're just Ignoring me.

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,931
They won't answer my calls.

8
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,016
It makes me so sad...

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,232
... I feel llke I'm not needed at home,

10
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,655
as If I'm not there...

11
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:00,942
... 'cause there's
always a way to be happy

12
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:03,696
and we just have to find lt.

13
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,253
Happy.

14
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:17,127
That's exactly my problem.

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,046
That I can't be happy.

16
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,193
I never have been.

17
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:32,025
Not even when good things
happen to me.

18
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:35,521
You can't imagine what it means

19
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:37,854
to wake up every day
with no motivation.

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,040
The effort it takes me
to find a reason.

21
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,457
Just one.

22
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:48,247
Not to let it all go to Hell.

23
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:52,955
And believe me
I give it my best shot.

24
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:54,291
My very best.

25
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:57,002
Every day of my life.

26
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:08,798
MONDAY

27
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,123
... we have time for one last call...

28
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,625
We're late.

29
00:05:57,968 --> 00:06:01,381
That's enough!
Enough messing around!

30
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,461
Stop playing with your bag!

31
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:06,546
Got your lunch?

32
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,013
You got it?

33
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,087
Come on, quick.

34
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,342
Ursula!

35
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:27,884
What's up?

36
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:30,599
Nothing.
I was just saying good morning.

37
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:32,688
Morning.
Come on, let's go.

38
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,073
Good morning.

39
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:13,368
...I was thinking

40
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,370
we could use gauze.

41
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,204
Yeah and bring me the catalogues.

42
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,574
Okay, we'll finish them
in leather...

43
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:24,323
Okay, we'll be in touch. Ciao.

44
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:25,664
Morning, César!

45
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,543
Miss Clara. Everything all right?

46
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:28,909
Everything's great.

47
00:07:30,504 --> 00:07:31,749
Hello, Verónica!

48
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,920
Well, that's us for today.

49
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:35,582
You're up earlier every morning.

50
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,506
What choice do I have? Poor Rocío...

51
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:41,757
She can't hold it long... you know.

52
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,088
We're off upstairs.

53
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,013
What time is it?

54
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,010
8:25.

55
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:56,211
I'm off.

56
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,765
César!
I think my sink's blocked.

57
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,308
Could you take a look?

58
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:03,713
I'll stop by this afternoon.

59
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:05,434
Thanks! Ciao.

60
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:06,597
Bye.

61
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:30,854
Morning.

62
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,396
Morning, César.

63
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:43,897
Morning.

64
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,453
Morning.

65
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:08,663
Hi, Mum.

66
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:11,252
How you feeling?

67
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:22,046
So, what have I got
to tell you today?

68
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:27,081
The truth is I haven't got
much news.

69
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:30,582
The neighbours
are behaving themselves.

70
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:32,171
Most of them.

71
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:37,758
My only worry is Clara.

72
00:09:40,097 --> 00:09:42,421
I'm trying my best.

73
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:47,555
But I think it's going to be
tougher than I thought.

74
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:50,724
But I don't want you worrying.

75
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:53,224
I'll think of something.

76
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,558
Afternoon.

77
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,666
Do you know what time it is?

78
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,745
Obviously not.

79
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,495
It's 4:26 pm.

80
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:16,783
Not bad...

81
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,836
You've beaten
your own record.

82
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:24,256
Sorry, I was visiting my Mother...

83
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,379
Today it's your mother's fault.

84
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:30,461
Yesterday it was the radio's fault
for putting you to sleep.

85
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:33,420
Look, you have hours to keep.

86
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:35,336
And if it's 4, it's 4.

87
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,054
César, what a stroke of luck!

88
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:41,720
We've got a problem.

89
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,880
Well, I'm sure we'll solve it.

90
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:46,757
Last warning, eh?

91
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:50,301
What's the problem?

92
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:54,387
This afternoon my friend's
celebrating her birthday.

93
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,762
And at the bingo hall... I ask you!

94
00:10:57,895 --> 00:10:59,554
That's good, isn't it?

95
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:02,262
It's about my little ones...

96
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,432
I feel awful leaving them alone.

97
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:07,349
Don't worry...
I'll take care of them.

98
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:08,472
Really?

99
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:09,929
It's no trouble.

100
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:12,598
You just have to give them dinner.

101
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:15,526
But remember,
Rocío has her own special food.

102
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:18,064
The yellow container,
not more than two measures.

103
00:11:18,236 --> 00:11:21,070
That's it. If not, the poor girl
gets indigestion.

104
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,988
Then she gets such
terrible diarrhoea...

105
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,322
I know. Don't worry.

106
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:30,072
Oh, and I left you a piece
of pie in the kitchen.

107
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:33,027
I made it myself. Potato.
Delicious!

108
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:36,116
I'd best be off
or I won't get a seat!

109
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,399
Enjoy yourself!

110
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:38,905
Same to you!

111
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,080
3B - Out at...

112
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,383
Why can't we ask Dad?

113
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:23,675
As if we'd ask him!

114
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:25,884
We'll go hand in hand to ask him!

115
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,048
Evening.

116
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:31,598
How was your day?

117
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:32,927
Uff... Crazy!

118
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,883
Neighbours going out, mail,
neighbours coming in.

119
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,802
I thought I was going crazy.

120
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,845
Okay. You can relax.

121
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:43,390
It's my turn to clean
up their posh shit.

122
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:44,973
And their dogs?

123
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,262
And don't I do anything?

124
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,139
You... Just keep quiet.

125
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:51,555
The kid's right. He cleans too.

126
00:12:51,857 --> 00:12:54,144
Their posh shit.

127
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,648
Each to his own, no?

128
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,483
So, what about you?

129
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:01,230
All day sitting there,
doing nothing.

130
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:04,402
Well, I wouldn't swap this
for anything.

131
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:06,354
Yeah, I bet.

132
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:08,361
Look who's talking.

133
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:10,405
Bet you'd love to be in his shoes.

134
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:12,072
Oh yeah, that's my dream...

135
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,022
Fuck, Mum!

136
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,396
Don't give me lip!

137
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:21,784
Here, the office keys.

138
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:23,742
Afterwards,
leave them in the cupboard.

139
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,488
Yeah, like always.

140
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:27,867
Here. Up you go.

141
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:27,508
Potato.

142
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:29,978
Delicious.

143
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:21,781
Hi Clara.

144
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:49,731
So you don't like bugs,
eh Clara?

145
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:55,062
TUESDAY

146
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:02,581
At it again?

147
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:04,909
What the hell are you doing?

148
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,914
What about you, dickhead?

149
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:08,452
That's the question.

150
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:10,535
I gave you what you asked for.

151
00:23:10,711 --> 00:23:11,789
Yeah.

152
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:16,336
But you didn't expect that 60 shitty
euros would keep me quiet forever.

153
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:18,377
Or do you think I'm stupid?

154
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:22,047
What do you want?

155
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:24,714
An adult movie.

156
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:25,712
What?

157
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:27,542
You heard me.

158
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:31,882
Ok.

159
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:33,881
Now get to bed.

160
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:34,572
Morning.

161
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:36,072
Morning, dear.

162
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:40,529
You haven't got Rocío today.

163
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:41,534
No.

164
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:44,787
The poor thing isn't well.

165
00:24:45,748 --> 00:24:47,028
I don't know.

166
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:49,365
She must have eaten something.

167
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,705
She's got awful diarrhoea.

168
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:56,909
And with her age, I'm scared that...

169
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:59,617
You should start getting used to the idea.

170
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:01,668
Even though it's painful.

171
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:03,225
Yes.

172
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,879
And how was bingo?

173
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,522
12 UNREAD MESSAGES

174
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:09,650
I DREAMT ABOUT YOU AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

175
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:11,856
YOU CAN BE SUCH A WHORE...

176
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,695
ERASE ALL

177
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:24,609
Excuse me.

178
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:27,223
Ah...

179
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,070
César.

180
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:29,369
Yes, César.

181
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:30,536
What?

182
00:26:30,707 --> 00:26:33,243
Yesterday I spoke to the estate agency.

183
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:37,079
And they want to know
how the cleaning woman is doing.

184
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:38,993
Whether you're satisfied.

185
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:41,658
It seems some of the neighbours
have complained.

186
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,297
I haven't noticed,

187
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,007
to be honest.

188
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,928
But I can ask.

189
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:51,296
If it's no bother, please.

190
00:26:51,473 --> 00:26:53,050
I need an answer soon.

191
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:54,338
Yeah, I'll ask.

192
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:56,009
Thanks... and sorry.

193
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:03,015
Morning.

194
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,430
Morning Miss Clara.

195
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:09,768
Sleep well?
You seem tired...

196
00:27:09,939 --> 00:27:13,222
Yes, you're right.
Lately I wake up feeling awful.

197
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,306
And it isn't lack of sleep.

198
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:19,935
César, don't call me Miss...
It feels strange.

199
00:27:20,318 --> 00:27:23,483
I'd prefer to.
It helps me in my work.

200
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:25,402
As you wish.

201
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,684
Late today, aren't you?

202
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:27,608
What's the time?

203
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,561
8:30.

204
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:31,310
Oh no! And I think
I've lost my watch.

205
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:33,072
Was it valuable?

206
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,527
For me it was.
It was my mother's...

207
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:39,816
Oh, I stopped by your apartment...
You do have a blockage.

208
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,280
I'll go back this afternoon
with the drain cleaner.

209
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,111
Great. I've got to run.

210
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:45,512
Thanks.

211
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:47,824
And if you find a watch anywhere...

212
00:27:47,995 --> 00:27:49,323
Sure everything's okay?

213
00:27:49,496 --> 00:27:50,409
Yeah.

214
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:52,493
Ciao.

215
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,792
What the hell?
I've still got 5 min...

216
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:31,673
What are you doing here?

217
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:32,925
Shouldn't you be at school?

218
00:28:33,097 --> 00:28:35,668
What do you care?
You got what I asked for?

219
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,932
This where you live?

220
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,555
What a dive!

221
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,808
But it's not like
you spend much time here.

222
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:58,056
Here. Enjoy it.

223
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:02,686
What?

224
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:04,766
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

225
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:07,645
Have you seen it?

226
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:09,891
Now go.

227
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,440
I bumped into Clara in the lift.

228
00:29:12,737 --> 00:29:14,279
We were talking...

229
00:29:14,947 --> 00:29:15,811
about you.

230
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,519
What did you say?

231
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:19,358
Are you worried?

232
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:20,943
You mean she doesn't know?

233
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:22,230
What did you say?

234
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:25,863
Nothing.

235
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:29,861
But from now on we'll have
to raise the price...

236
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,242
About 100 euros.

237
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:35,617
Make sure nobody catches
you with that.

238
00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:43,533
What is it today?

239
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,412
Just finishing lunch.
Had a hectic morning.

240
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:49,450
Yes.

241
00:29:51,294 --> 00:29:54,329
You don't go up
to the rooftop much, eh?

242
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:11,625
What?

243
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:13,461
What do you mean what?

244
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:16,173
You were instructed
to water the plants.

245
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:19,969
You were told not
to water at midday.

246
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:23,382
But of course
you couldn't give a damn!

247
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,632
Look at them, all dead.

248
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:28,299
Look at the Musas.

249
00:30:28,976 --> 00:30:30,138
Dead.

250
00:30:30,685 --> 00:30:32,842
Do you have any idea
what they cost?

251
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:34,133
Such ugly plants?

252
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,427
You should have seen his face.

253
00:30:38,521 --> 00:30:39,849
The Musas.

254
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,929
Today was a good day, Mum.

255
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,223
Now, there's just Clara.

256
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:00,011
She's a tough one, eh?

257
00:31:00,563 --> 00:31:02,140
Always that smile.

258
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:04,480
All good, all great!

259
00:31:06,983 --> 00:31:08,180
All great.

260
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,683
Anyway, I think we're
on the right track.

261
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:15,601
We'll wipe that smile off her face.

262
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:19,692
She just needs...
an extra push.

263
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:31,146
Ah, one more thing...

264
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:34,111
This morning the office workers
came to see me.

265
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:37,615
I don't want to butt in, but...

266
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,112
I'd be a bit more careful
if I were you.

267
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:43,782
What did they say?

268
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:46,494
They complained about
the state of the office.

269
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:49,616
That's not true.
I go over it all...

270
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:50,787
Shut up!

271
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:52,911
They're pretty angry.

272
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:55,076
They wanted to speak to the agency.

273
00:31:55,252 --> 00:31:57,243
But I told them to wait.
I'd talk to you.

274
00:31:57,586 --> 00:31:58,830
Mum, I swear...

275
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:00,545
Just shut it!

276
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,087
I've fucking had it!

277
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:07,547
I'm really sorry.
That's what they told me.

278
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:13,631
I'll clean with him today.

279
00:32:15,426 --> 00:32:16,422
And César...

280
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:18,256
Thanks.

281
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:19,886
Think nothing of it.

282
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:06,405
Hello?

283
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:08,966
Hi, baby.

284
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:12,256
I've already had dinner.

285
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:14,925
No, I sleep well.

286
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,221
But then it's a real effort to wake up.

287
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,632
And I spend all day feeling groggy.

288
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,763
Yeah, text messages all day,

289
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,719
a couple of emails and letters.

290
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:31,846
Yeah, I've talked
to the police again.

291
00:34:32,147 --> 00:34:34,269
It seems the emails
are sent from cyber cafés.

292
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,933
So they can't do much.

293
00:34:36,232 --> 00:34:37,856
They said I shouldn't worry.

294
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:39,732
Probably just some nut
who doesn't even know me.

295
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:45,483
I dropped my papers...

296
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:50,606
Oh, I feel dizzy...

297
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:53,529
No, I'm fine. It was nothing.

298
00:34:55,115 --> 00:34:56,656
You and doctors!

299
00:34:58,408 --> 00:35:00,814
Yes, he said it's stress.

300
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:03,240
And I should take it easy.

301
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,951
Yes, of course.

302
00:35:05,327 --> 00:35:08,243
If I tell my boss
I'm going to see you in San Francisco,

303
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,492
he'll have a heart attack!

304
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:13,827
Ah, I found my watch.

305
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:16,327
It must have fallen down the sink

306
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:19,201
and the concierge wrecked it
with drain cleaner...

307
00:35:23,084 --> 00:35:24,708
You're so cruel!

308
00:35:25,502 --> 00:35:28,667
No, poor guy.
He didn't know.

309
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,539
He even left me a note.

310
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:34,293
Okay.

311
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:36,709
Night night.

312
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:37,995
I love you.

313
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:30,642
I think it's time we got serious.

314
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,178
WEDNESDAY

315
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:12,472
What's this?

316
00:38:23,364 --> 00:38:24,443
Morning.

317
00:38:24,614 --> 00:38:25,812
Morning.

318
00:38:27,282 --> 00:38:28,775
How are you feeling today?

319
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,814
Better.

320
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:32,700
Doesn't look like it.

321
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:33,941
Hell, César!

322
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:36,275
You know how to treat a woman,
don't you?

323
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:38,947
With the time I've spent
in front of the mirror...

324
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,692
But you're right.
Too much make-up, no?

325
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:45,238
No... just that rash
doesn't look too good.

326
00:38:45,373 --> 00:38:47,115
It'll get better.

327
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,280
Gordi! Yes, yes, of course...

328
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,709
THURSDAY

329
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:22,843
Dear Clara, I thlnk It's time
to stop foollng around.

330
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:26,469
I thought you'd have guessed
who I was by now.

331
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:30,463
You've no Idea how sad It
makes me that you've forgotten.

332
00:39:30,807 --> 00:39:33,760
Because I've been thlnklng
about you all these years.

333
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,350
I went to the dermatologist.
It's an allergy.

334
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:41,175
He gave me a pill
and it should be gone in a few days.

335
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:50,221
I've olten followed you
to the metro.

336
00:39:51,107 --> 00:39:54,023
I was so close
I could even smell you.

337
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,349
You stank of make-up.

338
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:00,859
And lately you aren't
looklng good.

339
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:04,439
You look fucklng slck.

340
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,526
Morning, Miss Clara.

341
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,191
Morning. Sorry.

342
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:12,195
Ciao.

343
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,567
In a hurry, isn't she?

344
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:20,610
The truth is I don't know
how she stands it.

345
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:23,738
Maybe she's a little bit like you.

346
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:32,319
A nut who finds vlctims
at random, eh?

347
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:39,865
Here we go Clara.

348
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:42,437
Here we go...

349
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:46,242
MONDAY

350
00:42:08,678 --> 00:42:10,053
César, you have to help me!

351
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:11,299
Come with me.

352
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,220
My apartment's full of bugs.

353
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,016
The bedroom...
It's that way, César.

354
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,009
Where?

355
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:29,887
At the end of the hall.

356
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:40,560
Cockroaches.

357
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:45,517
You stay there, alright?

358
00:42:47,986 --> 00:42:49,942
Hurry up, please, César.

359
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,488
Are you there?

360
00:42:57,323 --> 00:42:58,152
Yes!

361
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:01,526
In the wardrobe. Grab me a dress.

362
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,693
Which one?

363
00:43:04,742 --> 00:43:05,987
The grey one.

364
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:10,948
There are two.

365
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,696
The first one you see.

366
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:18,155
Shake it out well, please.

367
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:20,744
Got it.

368
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:22,788
And shoes, the brown ones.

369
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,031
Dark brown?

370
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:27,616
No, no, no!

371
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:29,370
So light brown?

372
00:43:29,544 --> 00:43:31,334
Hurry, please!

373
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:42,458
Thanks. Hurry.

374
00:43:43,466 --> 00:43:45,920
And my bag, shake it, please.

375
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:53,387
It looks like you've got
quite an infestation.

376
00:43:53,762 --> 00:43:55,587
It's so disgusting, César!

377
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:57,968
And to think I was sleeping in there!

378
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,258
Shit.

379
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:03,510
Maybe you bought some rotten fruit

380
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,473
and there were eggs inside.

381
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:07,467
These bugs breed in a few days.

382
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:09,635
Gross! Eggs...

383
00:44:09,768 --> 00:44:12,471
So what should I do?

384
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:13,758
Well, fumigate.

385
00:44:13,895 --> 00:44:16,182
You'll have to clean
the whole apartment.

386
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:17,931
They breed so quickly.

387
00:44:21,773 --> 00:44:23,183
And could you fumigate it?

388
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,773
Yes? Great!

389
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,354
Meanwhile, I'll stay at Mum's.

390
00:44:31,443 --> 00:44:33,814
No, but I think you should stay.

391
00:44:33,986 --> 00:44:37,732
Stay here? No chance!
You saw what it was like.

392
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:40,945
No, but I'll have to throw out
a lot of stuff.

393
00:44:41,156 --> 00:44:44,238
It's better for you to stay.

394
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:45,734
Doesn't matter.

395
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:48,071
If something has to be thrown out...
just call me.

396
00:44:49,909 --> 00:44:52,445
Anyway, it was time
for a spring clean.

397
00:44:52,618 --> 00:44:56,365
I'm serious. I need...
What do I do with your clothes?

398
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:01,152
My clothes? Fumigate them.

399
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,902
Put them in a bag,
and I'll take them to the cleaner's.

400
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:06,157
What have you done, César?

401
00:45:06,457 --> 00:45:07,785
What's up?

402
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,954
I've got a bug infestation
in my apartment.

403
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,405
Eggs and everything.

404
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:22,369
You should go back to the doctor's.

405
00:45:22,547 --> 00:45:23,791
It doesn't look good.

406
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:25,505
Ah no, it's going now.

407
00:45:26,007 --> 00:45:28,081
You should have seen it before.

408
00:45:29,216 --> 00:45:31,291
The cream seems to be working.

409
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:35,088
I've been having a run
of bad luck lately...

410
00:45:36,344 --> 00:45:38,300
Let's hope it ends soon.

411
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:42,678
Is he still harassing you?

412
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,176
What?

413
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:47,719
That nutter...
the one who's sending you messages.

414
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:51,348
How do you know about that?

415
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:55,758
I think you told Verónica...

416
00:45:56,477 --> 00:45:58,018
You know her.

417
00:46:02,855 --> 00:46:04,811
Yes, he's still harassing me.

418
00:46:05,272 --> 00:46:06,979
She said you knew him...

419
00:46:07,148 --> 00:46:09,186
a friend of yours or something.

420
00:46:09,357 --> 00:46:11,183
Ah no, it was false alarm.

421
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:12,555
The police investigated.

422
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:15,104
My friend's been living in Geneva
for years.

423
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:20,976
Whoever it is uses a prepaid
phone so they can't trace him.

424
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,563
But the police located the signal
or whatever and...

425
00:46:25,238 --> 00:46:27,029
He's sending them from here.

426
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:28,947
What do you mean here?

427
00:46:29,115 --> 00:46:30,774
Someone in the building.

428
00:46:32,366 --> 00:46:33,860
That's how he knows me.

429
00:46:34,617 --> 00:46:36,774
But he doesn't know they know.

430
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:40,281
So while he keeps sending messages,

431
00:46:40,453 --> 00:46:42,574
they can tighten the net around him.

432
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:45,614
So sooner or later they'll get him.

433
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:49,737
Because he isn't going
to stop today, is he?

434
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,117
I doubt it.

435
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:55,083
Here, my number.

436
00:46:55,375 --> 00:46:57,034
Once it's fumigated, call me.

437
00:46:57,209 --> 00:46:58,667
Yes, don't worry.

438
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:11,753
Things are getting complicated.

439
00:47:13,132 --> 00:47:15,836
I think I've taken things too far.

440
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:32,428
You know I'd never gone
this far with anybody.

441
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:37,554
Because I was so hopeful.

442
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,676
For the first time
I had a reason to live.

443
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:51,521
I haven't been up
to the roof for days.

444
00:47:54,149 --> 00:47:56,105
And I hadn't even realised.

445
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,934
And all this for what?

446
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:06,819
For that bitch to keep smiling
every day like nothing's happened.

447
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:08,893
Happy.

448
00:48:09,863 --> 00:48:11,902
And me back to square one.

449
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:18,363
So those are reasons enough,
aren't they?

450
00:48:29,163 --> 00:48:31,699
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

451
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:36,614
You'd love that.

452
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,163
To get rid of the piece of shit
you gave birth to.

453
00:48:46,753 --> 00:48:48,127
But no.

454
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:50,295
Not yet.

455
00:48:54,006 --> 00:48:57,254
First, I'll wipe the smile off
that bitch's face.

456
00:48:57,424 --> 00:48:58,703
Whatever it takes.

457
00:49:53,904 --> 00:49:56,476
Oh, what have we got here...

458
00:49:58,531 --> 00:50:01,733
What a waste of space you are.

459
00:50:01,908 --> 00:50:04,741
And it isn't just me who thinks that.

460
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:06,947
I've got your references.

461
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:10,367
It seems you don't last long
in any job.

462
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,952
Three and a half months,
Balmes 53...

463
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:17,490
One month, Aribau 14...

464
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:20,201
One month!
Odd, isn't it?

465
00:50:21,207 --> 00:50:24,538
What I'm saying
is you should start looking again.

466
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:26,535
Because you... here...

467
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,958
WEDNESDAY

468
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:57,757
Afternoon.

469
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,461
Is there a problem?

470
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,262
Can we have a word, please?

471
00:51:01,723 --> 00:51:02,552
Yes.

472
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:05,385
You can't do this.

473
00:51:05,516 --> 00:51:06,760
We won't be long.

474
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:11,929
The IP matches...
They were sent from here.

475
00:51:13,228 --> 00:51:16,143
Yesterday at 8:18, Tuesday at 8:24...

476
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:17,426
That's impossible.

477
00:51:17,563 --> 00:51:19,270
Nobody's here at that time.

478
00:51:23,065 --> 00:51:25,103
Anyone else have access
to the office?

479
00:51:32,694 --> 00:51:35,230
That's the time
when they're cleaning.

480
00:51:35,403 --> 00:51:37,229
Apparently he helps his mother,

481
00:51:37,404 --> 00:51:40,024
but judging
from the neighbours'complaints...

482
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,615
Well, now we know what
he was really doing.

483
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:20,625
Hello?

484
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:22,206
Miss Clara, it's César.

485
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,039
HI César.
How's It golng?

486
00:52:24,214 --> 00:52:25,209
Good.

487
00:52:25,381 --> 00:52:28,084
I'm calling to tell you
I finished fumigating.

488
00:52:28,257 --> 00:52:30,000
It's all clean...
Problem solved.

489
00:52:30,175 --> 00:52:32,296
Great...
I can't walt to get home.

490
00:52:32,467 --> 00:52:34,459
You heard about the cleaner's son?

491
00:52:34,593 --> 00:52:35,506
Yes, I know.

492
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:38,382
So, come home whenever you want.

493
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:41,089
I took the liberty
of cleaning up a bit.

494
00:52:41,346 --> 00:52:43,005
There was no need. Really.

495
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,800
But thanks anyway.
So I'll be back tonlght.

496
00:52:45,973 --> 00:52:46,886
Yes.

497
00:52:47,348 --> 00:52:49,340
Thanks for everythlng, César.

498
00:52:49,516 --> 00:52:51,092
Think nothing of it.

499
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:20,527
I'm ready.

500
00:55:31,288 --> 00:55:32,616
I can't wait!

501
00:55:35,748 --> 00:55:37,574
I've still got some marks,

502
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:38,780
on my back.

503
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:39,988
I'll shut my eyes.

504
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:41,329
You're so silly!

505
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,061
What's that smell?

506
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:32,344
Shush!

507
00:58:14,811 --> 00:58:16,269
Shit.

508
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,605
THURSDAY

509
00:58:42,947 --> 00:58:44,654
When you get up,

510
00:58:44,823 --> 00:58:47,360
I need you to help put
that cream on my back.

511
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:49,656
Come back to bed, Mimi.

512
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,735
No, come on.

513
00:58:52,326 --> 00:58:55,859
I'm so happy.
Lately I've been waking up fine again.

514
00:58:56,995 --> 00:59:00,409
Maybe that's all it was,
I needed you here.

515
00:59:00,538 --> 00:59:02,529
And for that guy
to stop screwing with you.

516
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,985
Yeah, that too.

517
00:59:04,623 --> 00:59:06,828
The cleaner... What a nerve.

518
00:59:07,207 --> 00:59:09,957
And while he was working
with his mother.

519
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:15,746
I don't want to talk
about that, baby.

520
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,199
It's over.

521
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:20,826
Mimi?

522
00:59:21,713 --> 00:59:23,289
What are these things?

523
00:59:23,463 --> 00:59:24,412
What things?

524
00:59:24,547 --> 00:59:26,206
Under the bed.

525
00:59:27,132 --> 00:59:28,755
Wait, I can't hear you.

526
00:59:29,007 --> 00:59:30,750
There's a sports bag here...

527
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:33,500
What is all this stuff?

528
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:38,009
No idea. It isn't mine.

529
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:40,468
What do you mean?

530
00:59:40,595 --> 00:59:41,793
It's not yours?

531
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:43,547
No, how strange.

532
00:59:44,472 --> 00:59:45,882
Strange no, Mimi.

533
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:48,221
There'll be an explanation?

534
00:59:49,057 --> 00:59:51,760
The concierge was here fumigating.
It'll be his.

535
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:54,505
And he left his stuff under your bed?

536
00:59:54,643 --> 00:59:56,385
What is this?

537
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,349
Looks like a diary.

538
01:00:00,978 --> 01:00:02,520
And that key?

539
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:04,348
Marcos...

540
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:06,312
What's the matter?

541
01:00:06,647 --> 01:00:08,224
Are you dizzy?

542
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,095
Here.

543
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,398
Wait, have another pillow.

544
01:00:15,984 --> 01:00:17,892
You're not better yet.

545
01:00:18,068 --> 01:00:20,190
I don't care what the doctor says.

546
01:00:20,528 --> 01:00:21,938
I'm really worried.

547
01:00:23,862 --> 01:00:25,404
I'm feeling OK now.

548
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,020
Sure?

549
01:00:27,197 --> 01:00:28,001
Yes.

550
01:00:28,072 --> 01:00:29,530
I'm even hungry.

551
01:00:31,157 --> 01:00:32,615
That's a good sign.

552
01:00:36,492 --> 01:00:37,571
I love you.

553
01:00:38,577 --> 01:00:40,698
I'll fix breakfast. Okay?

554
01:00:49,414 --> 01:00:50,991
What do you fancy?

555
01:00:51,165 --> 01:00:52,196
Juice.

556
01:00:52,374 --> 01:00:53,748
Which kind?

557
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,326
Orange and banana.

558
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,994
No, kiwi.

559
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:05,375
There's nothing in the fridge, Mimi...

560
01:01:05,546 --> 01:01:06,708
Ah, that's right.

561
01:01:06,879 --> 01:01:08,254
What'll we do?

562
01:01:09,756 --> 01:01:11,961
Well, let's go out for breakfast.

563
01:01:12,423 --> 01:01:15,209
OK. And we'll get some shopping.

564
01:01:16,342 --> 01:01:17,539
Milk...

565
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:19,045
...and cereal.

566
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,922
Nutella...

567
01:01:21,093 --> 01:01:22,172
What?

568
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:23,541
Nutella.

569
01:01:23,886 --> 01:01:26,174
Milk, cereal...

570
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,128
Bread...

571
01:01:31,056 --> 01:01:31,969
Oranges...

572
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:33,337
Let's go downstairs for a coffee.

573
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:34,297
No.

574
01:01:34,474 --> 01:01:38,006
They charge you 4 euros just for
writing your name on the cup.

575
01:01:38,184 --> 01:01:39,974
You're so stingy!

576
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:43,600
You make up any name you want.

577
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:45,511
You could be...

578
01:01:49,396 --> 01:01:51,187
Get in the shower, I'm starving.

579
01:01:51,355 --> 01:01:53,927
Why don't we shower together?

580
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:20,148
And if we go back to bed?

581
01:02:20,534 --> 01:02:22,442
Why do we have to get up?

582
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:24,449
Because we have things to do.

583
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:25,572
What things?

584
01:02:25,744 --> 01:02:27,866
You can't spend all day in bed.

585
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:30,573
The first morning I'm feeling fine.

586
01:02:30,954 --> 01:02:33,444
We could go away for a few days.

587
01:02:33,872 --> 01:02:35,117
Where to?

588
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:36,992
I don't know... away.

589
01:02:37,165 --> 01:02:38,706
We could stay at home and relax.

590
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,749
We'll rent some movies.

591
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:42,707
Yeah, and you fall asleep
in ten seconds.

592
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:13,090
OK, but before we're going
to the doctor's.

593
01:03:15,264 --> 01:03:16,923
I'm serious.

594
01:03:27,018 --> 01:03:28,049
What's the matter?

595
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:32,394
What are you doing here?

596
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:34,850
Who the fuck are you?
How did you get in?

597
01:03:35,022 --> 01:03:37,937
What are YOU doing here?
This isn't your apartment...

598
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:40,774
I'll ring the police.
I'm warning you.

599
01:03:41,899 --> 01:03:44,056
He's the concierge.

600
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:46,067
Miss Clara, you're here.

601
01:03:46,234 --> 01:03:48,107
César, what are you doing here?

602
01:03:48,444 --> 01:03:50,150
I'm really sorry.

603
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,318
I wanted to tell you this morning.
But I didn't see you.

604
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:57,068
I left my fumigation gear
in the bedroom...

605
01:03:57,239 --> 01:04:00,403
What's worse,
Miss Verónica's keys are there.

606
01:04:00,657 --> 01:04:02,862
God!
You scared us to death!

607
01:04:03,483 --> 01:04:04,976
I'm really sorry.

608
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:08,564
You can't just come into people's
apartments without permission.

609
01:04:09,819 --> 01:04:12,853
Sorry. But Miss Verónica
was asking for her keys...

610
01:04:13,028 --> 01:04:15,600
And I didn't want to admit
I'd lost them.

611
01:04:15,905 --> 01:04:17,446
They could sack me.

612
01:04:17,947 --> 01:04:21,029
Relax, they're here.
I'll get them, okay?

613
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,235
Are you here for a while?

614
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,612
Do you use a saw
to fumigate insects?

615
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:39,785
No.

616
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:42,030
Why are you wet?

617
01:04:43,457 --> 01:04:45,863
There was a burst pipe...

618
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:47,452
A total disaster.

619
01:04:50,668 --> 01:04:52,126
Thank you so much.

620
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:55,538
You're looking a lot better.

621
01:04:55,712 --> 01:04:58,036
Yes, these few days away
have been good.

622
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,084
Thank you, Miss Clara.
I'm really sorry.

623
01:05:03,173 --> 01:05:04,750
By the way, César,

624
01:05:05,091 --> 01:05:07,545
how much do
I owe you for fumigating?

625
01:05:07,925 --> 01:05:10,545
Nothing.
You don't owe me anything.

626
01:05:11,135 --> 01:05:14,087
Just don't say anything
about the keys and we're even.

627
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:17,260
Don't worry about that.
But I'll pay for your work.

628
01:05:17,429 --> 01:05:18,756
We're square.

629
01:05:18,929 --> 01:05:19,794
Thank you.

630
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:21,461
And welcome back.

631
01:05:21,597 --> 01:05:22,462
To you too.

632
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:23,967
And sorry again.

633
01:05:46,941 --> 01:05:48,766
You've really made it
easy for me.

634
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:51,604
Today you've beaten
your own record.

635
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:55,434
This is your letter of dismissal.

636
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:59,106
You've got 15 days
to vacate the flat.

637
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:02,481
You can appeal,
but I don't advise it.

638
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:18,784
Are you sure you're alright?

639
01:06:20,329 --> 01:06:22,997
Yes, don't worry,
I'll find something.

640
01:06:23,705 --> 01:06:26,788
I don't know
what's come over them.

641
01:06:26,956 --> 01:06:30,158
Because they also sacked
the cleaning lady.

642
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:33,036
She'd been with us for years.

643
01:06:35,251 --> 01:06:37,409
Know that my babies and

644
01:06:37,544 --> 01:06:40,496
I have absolutely
no complaints about you.

645
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,252
Quite the contrary.

646
01:06:43,671 --> 01:06:45,378
You know that, don't you?

647
01:06:47,548 --> 01:06:48,710
Oh César,

648
01:06:49,257 --> 01:06:51,083
we're going to miss you.

649
01:06:55,093 --> 01:06:58,257
And if you're going out
with your girl, don't worry.

650
01:06:58,427 --> 01:07:02,174
Put it in the fridge and eat it
tomorrow, or the next day.

651
01:07:02,345 --> 01:07:04,420
It keeps well.

652
01:07:09,973 --> 01:07:11,716
You're very good Miss Verónica.

653
01:07:11,891 --> 01:07:12,756
No.

654
01:07:13,767 --> 01:07:15,592
I don't understand
why you're single.

655
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:21,017
No kids and no partner,
and it'll just get harder.

656
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,468
You're old.

657
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:27,097
And you'll get older.

658
01:07:27,981 --> 01:07:31,099
It's a shame you have
to waste away in that apartment.

659
01:07:32,316 --> 01:07:34,556
Because the dogs help, of course.

660
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,855
But we know they aren't children.

661
01:07:37,276 --> 01:07:38,556
Just mutts.

662
01:07:39,402 --> 01:07:40,860
Let's not kid ourselves.

663
01:07:42,111 --> 01:07:43,439
Because I see.

664
01:07:43,904 --> 01:07:46,571
I spend hours here.
The neighbours talk...

665
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,560
I realise.

666
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:53,655
They pretend to listen to you...

667
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,360
But it's pity.

668
01:07:57,659 --> 01:07:59,983
Really, they couldn't care less.

669
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,119
So don't trust them.

670
01:08:04,412 --> 01:08:05,442
Believe me.

671
01:08:08,038 --> 01:08:10,362
You're past it.

672
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:13,782
And terribly alone.

673
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,707
And believe me...
there's no remedy for that.

674
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,578
Thanks for the stew.

675
01:08:28,088 --> 01:08:29,332
Excuse me.

676
01:08:49,054 --> 01:08:50,050
Hello.

677
01:08:51,014 --> 01:08:52,211
Hello, Verónica!

678
01:08:52,389 --> 01:08:54,961
I'm off again.
But just for the weekend.

679
01:08:56,057 --> 01:08:57,681
Are you feeling all right?

680
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,465
Sure?

681
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:10,886
Hello, César.

682
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,343
Are you going for long?

683
01:09:12,522 --> 01:09:14,395
No, just four days, until Sunday.

684
01:09:14,898 --> 01:09:17,222
Come on Clara.
The doctor's is at 6.

685
01:09:18,024 --> 01:09:19,222
Where are you off to?

686
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,514
Away.

687
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:23,689
Have a good weekend, César.

688
01:09:58,707 --> 01:09:59,821
Hello, César.

689
01:10:00,708 --> 01:10:03,541
I'd just like to thank
you for the programme.

690
01:10:04,459 --> 01:10:06,001
You've helped me a lot.

691
01:10:06,627 --> 01:10:11,001
So tell us, what Is It that stops you
from belng happy?

692
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:17,955
That's exactly my problem.

693
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:21,128
I can't be happy.

694
01:10:24,134 --> 01:10:25,413
I never have been.

695
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:28,339
I thlnk I was born without
that capaclty.

696
01:10:29,469 --> 01:10:31,674
Llke belng born bllnd or deaf.

697
01:10:32,387 --> 01:10:34,213
But even worse...

698
01:10:35,472 --> 01:10:40,095
You can't lmaglne what It Is to wake up
every mornlng with no motivation.

699
01:10:41,724 --> 01:10:45,340
The effort I have to make not
to let It all go to hell.

700
01:10:46,684 --> 01:10:50,051
And the only thlng that helps me
Is that others are unhappy too.

701
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:54,348
And belleve me
I glve It my best shot.

702
01:10:54,813 --> 01:10:56,010
My very best.

703
01:10:57,522 --> 01:11:00,687
That's why I want to thank you
for what you do.

704
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:04,895
You've helped me a lot.

705
01:11:05,067 --> 01:11:06,608
Really.

706
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:10,101
But It doesn't matter anymore.

707
01:12:05,382 --> 01:12:07,587
I don't see
why you're so worked up.

708
01:12:08,008 --> 01:12:09,916
What do you want me to do?

709
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,835
Throw myself out the window?

710
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,290
How do you expect me to react?

711
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:14,340
How?

712
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,841
By trusting me, for example.

713
01:12:32,518 --> 01:12:33,549
Mimi...

714
01:12:34,519 --> 01:12:36,676
Can we try to talk like grown ups?

715
01:12:39,604 --> 01:12:41,430
I swear I'm trying to.

716
01:12:41,605 --> 01:12:42,933
I know, darling.

717
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:45,974
But I haven't seen you for...
six weeks.

718
01:12:46,565 --> 01:12:49,268
And we always use a condom.
Always!

719
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:52,519
I've got a right
to be surprised at least.

720
01:12:52,776 --> 01:12:55,348
Surprised, yes. So am I!

721
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:58,610
It's one thing to be surprised,
but to insinuate...

722
01:12:58,778 --> 01:13:01,149
No.
I'm not insinuating anything.

723
01:13:01,738 --> 01:13:04,772
I'm just saying it seems
a little strange, that's all.

724
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:11,025
You heard the doctor.

725
01:13:11,658 --> 01:13:12,820
It can happen.

726
01:13:12,992 --> 01:13:14,783
You are only 4 weeks pregnant.

727
01:13:14,951 --> 01:13:17,073
But the doctor said! Fuck!

728
01:13:18,203 --> 01:13:19,744
It's technically possible.

729
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:22,245
Yes... technically.

730
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:25,111
Go to Hell!

731
01:13:49,215 --> 01:13:50,792
Leave me alone, please...

732
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,634
Our affair is starting to bear fruit,
eh Clara?

733
01:14:22,353 --> 01:14:24,890
Maybe I haven't done such
a bad job after all.

734
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:31,939
It's a pity our time
is running out...

735
01:15:24,336 --> 01:15:29,920
FRIDAY

736
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,954
Hi.

737
01:15:56,674 --> 01:15:59,507
I asked for you at the desk
and they told me you'd be here...

738
01:15:59,717 --> 01:16:01,127
What's up?

739
01:16:01,468 --> 01:16:04,039
It seems like Clara's still got
some bugs.

740
01:16:04,302 --> 01:16:06,970
You might have
to spray the place again.

741
01:16:07,345 --> 01:16:10,048
Could you take a look...
if you don't mind?

742
01:16:11,513 --> 01:16:12,255
Yes.

743
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:13,425
Hang on.

744
01:16:27,811 --> 01:16:28,973
Come in.

745
01:16:44,985 --> 01:16:46,359
I can't see anything.

746
01:16:46,527 --> 01:16:47,392
No?

747
01:16:50,612 --> 01:16:51,940
Look closely.

748
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:54,148
Maybe in the bedroom.

749
01:17:06,202 --> 01:17:07,481
And Miss Clara?

750
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:09,155
She isn't here.

751
01:17:09,578 --> 01:17:11,119
Don't worry about her.

752
01:17:21,874 --> 01:17:22,704
What's that?

753
01:17:26,418 --> 01:17:28,326
What the fuck is all that?

754
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:35,785
What is it?

755
01:17:42,132 --> 01:17:44,290
How long have you been
coming in here?

756
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:50,208
How long have you been
coming in here?

757
01:17:55,846 --> 01:17:57,008
Five weeks.

758
01:18:00,598 --> 01:18:02,139
Five weeks. What?

759
01:18:03,724 --> 01:18:05,099
Clara doesn't mind.

760
01:18:05,892 --> 01:18:07,266
Clara doesn't know anything!

761
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,179
What did you do to her?

762
01:18:13,895 --> 01:18:16,017
I kept her company, not like you.

763
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:19,437
What did you do to her?

764
01:18:21,023 --> 01:18:22,481
What did you do to her?

765
01:18:22,732 --> 01:18:24,106
Can't you guess?

766
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,773
It's technically possible.

767
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:12,881
César Manso?

768
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,318
Please.

769
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:35,318
This way.

770
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:41,033
This is the concierge.

771
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:43,876
No. I told him
I no longer work here.

772
01:23:44,585 --> 01:23:45,331
Right...

773
01:23:45,752 --> 01:23:47,328
Come with me, please.

774
01:23:59,799 --> 01:24:01,956
Can you give us a moment, please?

775
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:11,553
Do you know this man?

776
01:24:12,346 --> 01:24:13,376
Yes.

777
01:24:14,722 --> 01:24:17,472
Yes...
He's Miss Blas' boyfriend.

778
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:19,549
What's happened?

779
01:24:20,349 --> 01:24:23,218
It looks like suicide.
We're not sure.

780
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:24,761
Suicide?

781
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:26,096
We'll see.

782
01:24:28,477 --> 01:24:33,053
Seen any unfamiliar people
coming into the building today?

783
01:24:34,813 --> 01:24:35,616
No.

784
01:24:35,688 --> 01:24:36,968
I don't think so.

785
01:24:38,064 --> 01:24:39,178
Are you sure?

786
01:24:39,606 --> 01:24:41,764
I told you,
I don't work here anymore.

787
01:24:41,941 --> 01:24:43,055
I wouldn't know.

788
01:24:43,566 --> 01:24:44,431
Right...

789
01:24:45,525 --> 01:24:48,727
I understand that you have
the keys to all the apartments.

790
01:24:48,902 --> 01:24:51,605
Yes, as concierge
I had access to the keys.

791
01:24:53,153 --> 01:24:54,647
Is something wrong?

792
01:24:55,488 --> 01:24:59,151
I know Miss Blas quite well.
I'd like to offer my condolences...

793
01:24:59,614 --> 01:25:01,440
Now is not the time.

794
01:25:11,452 --> 01:25:14,368
I saw you!

795
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:04,847
Looking for me?

796
01:26:10,559 --> 01:26:11,383
Dad.

797
01:26:11,518 --> 01:26:12,307
Mum.

798
01:26:21,397 --> 01:26:23,435
Relax, they're just sleeping.

799
01:26:24,106 --> 01:26:26,512
If I were you, I wouldn't scream.

800
01:26:27,858 --> 01:26:29,055
My brother?

801
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:35,107
What are you going to do to me?

802
01:26:56,202 --> 01:26:57,400
Dad!

803
01:27:22,046 --> 01:27:23,753
Listen to me.

804
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,286
I've done terrible things to Clara.

805
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:33,463
And, yes, I was involved
in her boyfriend's death.

806
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:36,341
Let's not kid ourselves.

807
01:27:39,303 --> 01:27:41,093
Know why I'm telling you this?

808
01:27:43,346 --> 01:27:46,096
Because I want you to know
what I'm capable of.

809
01:27:47,973 --> 01:27:49,929
I know everything about Clara...

810
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,259
But also about you.

811
01:27:54,434 --> 01:27:56,591
I know which school you go to.

812
01:27:58,102 --> 01:28:01,469
I know where
your grandmother lives.

813
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:05,852
I've seen your twitter profile.

814
01:28:06,772 --> 01:28:08,644
I know who your friends are.

815
01:28:09,189 --> 01:28:10,351
Vanesa.

816
01:28:10,898 --> 01:28:12,060
Katia.

817
01:28:13,024 --> 01:28:14,222
Sofia.

818
01:28:15,984 --> 01:28:18,604
So if you say anything...

819
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:20,734
I know how to hurt you...

820
01:28:21,361 --> 01:28:22,819
Badly...

821
01:28:23,612 --> 01:28:25,354
You and your family.

822
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,190
Understand?

823
01:28:31,865 --> 01:28:32,860
Understand?

824
01:28:37,617 --> 01:28:39,159
And if not...

825
01:29:02,336 --> 01:29:03,331
Morning.

826
01:29:04,461 --> 01:29:05,291
Leaving?

827
01:29:05,503 --> 01:29:06,271
Yes.

828
01:29:06,379 --> 01:29:08,666
It looks like you're in a hurry.

829
01:29:09,672 --> 01:29:12,042
I told you I no longer work here...

830
01:29:12,214 --> 01:29:13,756
Yes, of course.

831
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:17,210
But I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

832
01:29:18,967 --> 01:29:20,164
Shall we?

833
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,592
There isn't much to see.

834
01:29:26,762 --> 01:29:28,042
Don't worry.

835
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:37,380
I'm not sure how I can help you.

836
01:29:37,933 --> 01:29:39,841
I thought it was suicide.

837
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,934
That's the problem.
We aren't completely sure.

838
01:29:45,644 --> 01:29:49,853
The thing is we've found your prints
all over the apartment...

839
01:29:50,021 --> 01:29:52,345
in the most unlikely spots...

840
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,057
Yes.

841
01:29:54,314 --> 01:29:57,930
Miss Blas asked me to fumigate
her apartment a few days ago.

842
01:29:58,108 --> 01:29:59,352
And I was...

843
01:29:59,567 --> 01:30:00,941
Yes... She told us.

844
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:03,979
She also told us
how you met Mr. Bazán...

845
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,391
Who?

846
01:30:05,527 --> 01:30:06,606
Her boyfriend.

847
01:30:06,778 --> 01:30:07,773
The deceased.

848
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:10,402
Ah... yes.

849
01:30:10,654 --> 01:30:13,144
It was quite an awkward situation.

850
01:30:13,322 --> 01:30:14,732
I can imagine.

851
01:30:15,531 --> 01:30:18,021
But I never got to know him well.

852
01:30:18,866 --> 01:30:22,482
I mean... I don't know what their
relationship was like.

853
01:30:22,659 --> 01:30:23,821
You get me.

854
01:30:24,243 --> 01:30:25,523
No, I don't get you.

855
01:30:26,035 --> 01:30:27,363
What do you mean?

856
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:30,741
I don't know...
It's all a bit awkward.

857
01:30:31,204 --> 01:30:32,283
Awkward?

858
01:30:32,413 --> 01:30:33,326
Well.

859
01:30:33,913 --> 01:30:35,869
If you want we'll talk about
something else.

860
01:30:37,998 --> 01:30:41,116
Let's say I'm not sure things
were exactly harmonious.

861
01:30:41,291 --> 01:30:42,204
No?

862
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:45,661
The other night
I heard them arguing...

863
01:30:46,919 --> 01:30:47,997
Okay...

864
01:30:48,169 --> 01:30:51,334
Miss Blas told us
they were having some problems.

865
01:30:52,129 --> 01:30:55,911
I don't know anything.
And I barely knew him.

866
01:30:56,297 --> 01:30:59,878
But the day it happened...
he seemed quite upset.

867
01:31:00,424 --> 01:31:01,668
Upset?

868
01:31:02,133 --> 01:31:03,543
Upset how?

869
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,175
I don't know...

870
01:31:05,509 --> 01:31:06,671
Nervous.

871
01:31:06,843 --> 01:31:08,087
Slightly out of it.

872
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:09,256
I see...

873
01:31:10,094 --> 01:31:13,426
But it'd be better
to ask the girl who lives opposite.

874
01:31:14,638 --> 01:31:15,835
Really?

875
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:21,096
She told me she saw him on the landing
and got quite a fright...

876
01:31:22,933 --> 01:31:25,257
But she'd be able to explain better...

877
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:28,889
Yes.

878
01:31:30,144 --> 01:31:31,472
We'll ask her.

879
01:31:32,145 --> 01:31:33,342
Thank you...

880
01:31:33,562 --> 01:31:35,020
Think nothing of it.

881
01:32:10,243 --> 01:32:11,950
Miss Clara, finally.

882
01:32:12,244 --> 01:32:13,951
How are you feeling?

883
01:32:16,329 --> 01:32:18,783
I didn't think I'd see you again...

884
01:32:18,955 --> 01:32:21,112
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am.

885
01:32:21,498 --> 01:32:23,454
It was a horrible tragedy.

886
01:32:23,582 --> 01:32:25,657
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

887
01:32:34,044 --> 01:32:35,870
Well, thank you.

888
01:32:36,045 --> 01:32:37,455
Thank you for your help.

889
01:32:37,713 --> 01:32:38,743
Goodbye.

890
01:32:45,507 --> 01:32:47,499
I hope to see you smiling again.

891
01:32:54,052 --> 01:32:57,217
Are you happy now, you bastard?

892
01:33:06,932 --> 01:33:08,474
Well no.

893
01:33:11,893 --> 01:33:13,600
Not yet.

894
01:33:54,285 --> 01:33:55,446
Clara.

895
01:33:55,994 --> 01:33:57,321
A letter.

896
01:34:18,419 --> 01:34:19,581
Dear Mlml,

897
01:34:20,211 --> 01:34:22,748
I hope you don't mlnd
me calllng you that.

898
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:26,380
I guess nobody's called
you that for a whlle,

899
01:34:26,714 --> 01:34:29,204
and I thought you mlght llke lt.

900
01:34:31,174 --> 01:34:34,956
I've walted patiently for the right
time to send you thls letter.

901
01:34:35,301 --> 01:34:37,541
And I can tell you It wasn't easy.

902
01:34:38,344 --> 01:34:42,588
But the time has come for you
to know everythlng I've done.

903
01:34:43,637 --> 01:34:45,047
My reasons.

904
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,884
And how lmportant you were to me.

905
01:34:50,724 --> 01:34:54,968
You won't belleve how olten
I've lmaglned your face as you read thls.

906
01:34:55,434 --> 01:34:57,425
How you would feel.

907
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:02,600
And I can assure you that that
has been enough to keep me golng.

908
01:35:06,313 --> 01:35:10,474
I just hope that whenever you look
at our chlld, you remember me.

909
01:35:13,858 --> 01:35:15,600
Everythlng I dld.

910
01:35:16,609 --> 01:35:19,359
All the nlghts that we spent together.

911
01:35:29,614 --> 01:35:32,779
I know that thls letter
changes everythlng.

912
01:35:34,074 --> 01:35:35,982
But I don't care.

913
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:41,196
Thanks to you,
I finally know how to be happy.

914
01:35:49,955 --> 01:35:53,157
And I assure you
I'll glve It my best shot.
