00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,403
-Some say it was all
caused by a virus.

3
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:06,880
And truthfully, it's
much more logical than

4
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:11,288
some apocalyptic event of
biblical proportions.

5
00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:19,179
A virus sounds more likely.
Something tiny, invisible.

6
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,753
Carried within us.

7
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:26,612
A collection of molecules,
a set of commands,

8
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:31,275
fragments of microscopic codes
that float wherever there is life,

9
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:37,153
waiting to attach themselves
to any living creature.

10
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,982
And to unleash their
malicious program upon on it.

11
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,074
Yes. A Virus sounds to me a
much more likely call.

12
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:00,290
The first day and God
said, "Let there be

13
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:03,140
light!" And there was light.
Genesis 1:3.

14
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:32,869
-You can help instead
of just sitting there!

15
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:19,380
-Are there any more?

16
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,484
-There are only a few seconds. Run!

17
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,419
-Are the drill charges ready?

18
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:34,087
Well, what are you
waiting for? Work your magic.

19
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:15,439
-Are you sure you want to
forget about the doctor thing?

20
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:16,519
--If someone's badly hurt

21
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,424
he dies. If someone
contacts the disease

22
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,374
that requires medical
attention he dies.

23
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:23,377
-We don't need a doctor.

24
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:13,287
-We don't need a doctor,
but we want one.

25
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:18,091
-Why take the risk?
-You want them.

26
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:20,131
You think a doctor
can give you more

27
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,141
information. Forget about it!

28
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,846
It's a waste of time.
All that's left is

29
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:28,202
to keep moving and attacking.

30
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,514
As fast and as fierce  as possible until
they die from lack of food and water

31
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:35,840
and become extinct.
-Information Is power.

32
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:39,130
We need the information so that the
initiative remains in our hands.

33
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,470
-Not that kind of information.

34
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:45,804
-What about hiding in some remote desert
until this whole thing blows over?

35
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,918
In the desert, we'll  need
a medical expert for sure.

36
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:53,401
Trust my my calculations. All we
need is two trucks loaded with...

37
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:54,726
-It's too dangerous!

38
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:59,705
they can always turn up when we're least
prepared and then we'll be trapped.

39
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,836
-That's not true. Come
on, remember when we met

40
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,307
after everything fell apart?

41
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:06,122
-You were sitting on your ass
waiting for a sonic boom and

42
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:08,604
a down poor of nuclear
warheads to cleanse the place.

43
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,588
-Only if they're bombers.
I told you.

44
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:11,979
If they're ICBMs
or cruise missiles,

45
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:15,231
You wouldn't have heard a
thing before the explosion.

46
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,331
But we digress.

47
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,871
Look, at one point or another

48
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:22,170
we'll need to settle in
one spot and we'll need

49
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:26,004
someone with medical know-how.
 -When settling in one spot is an option,

50
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,844
perhaps. But until then,
my way is the only way.

51
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:35,507
Keep moving keep attacking.
And we say when, where and how.

52
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:41,553
That's not the issue, is it?
You're simply dying of curiosity.

53
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,802
But curiosity will get you killed.

54
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:49,931
-So I'm curious, so what?

55
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:54,522
I don't get you.
Aren't you even a bit curious?

56
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:58,016
You wake up one day and everyone
around you has turned into mindless,

57
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:01,097
bloodthirsty,
pissed off zombies,

58
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:03,455
and you do not want to
know how or why it happen?

59
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,746
-No, I don't.

60
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:11,946
-Besides, I need to renew
my chemical stock.

61
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,206
Not to mention it's my turn

62
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:15,566
to choose our next destination.

63
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,461
A deployment location where
we can prepare for an ambush.

64
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:21,990
Agreed.

65
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,250
A Hospital. You choose the one.

66
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:48,455
-Come on!

67
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:52,599
Come on!

68
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:50,956
-Abracadabra.
Let there be light!

69
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:12,856
Let's go.

70
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:26,069
Do you know your way around the hospital?
-Yes.

71
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:28,107
-Room 318, Ward C. Go there.

72
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,211
Lock yourselves in
 and wait. -Go!

73
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:33,109
-How unlucky can we get?
we come looking for a doctor, and we find a

74
00:14:33,134 --> 00:14:35,890
nurse and a girl instead.

75
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:38,381
-My sister isn't a nurse
She’s a senior doctor.

76
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,668
 And I'm not just some girl...
-You've revealed too many details to two

77
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:43,829
complete strangers
before we've even

78
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:46,419
asked the questions.
There's no time for this.

79
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:48,300
We have to get out of here.

80
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,309
- It's okay. it's okay.

81
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,293
It's one of ours.
We've booby-trapped the entire place.

82
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:56,783
That's not right.

83
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:03,083
-I suggest whoever is standing
behind that door, you better move

84
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:05,222
before I blow this door to bits.

85
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:13,101
-Should we run? Before it?
-No time. Turn over the bed!

86
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,569
-I'm coming in, don't shoot.

87
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,133
Now, get up now.
You're the one who

88
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:50,558
set up that nice little
kill-zone out there.

89
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:53,461
Nice, very nice. Now
all you have to do

90
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,126
is just stand there and
pull your trigger.

91
00:15:56,303 --> 00:16:01,345
-What do you want?
-What do I want? What I want ?!

92
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,015
Look at this. Look at this!

93
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,642
They got me. I'm infected. You get that?

94
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:15,243
I'm fucking infected! Now what I want

95
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:20,529
is for you to take this thing out of me.

96
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:26,750
I want a cure. Do you understand? A cure!

97
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:29,845
And you're going to give it to me.
You out of all people!

98
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:35,404
I knew you'd come here eventually.
 You and your kind.

99
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:39,790
Now, what I want is for
you to take this thing out of me!

100
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:43,705
-Do you know him?
-You can say we know each other.

101
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:47,208
All my life I've been
hunted down by his kind.

102
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,609
What are you? A General?

103
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:54,917
No, you're too young for that.
Maybe a captain? Or Major?

104
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:58,837
Ah, you're a colonel.

105
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:03,122
Yeah, You must be a colonel.

106
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:10,019
-He's right about one thing. Part of my job
was to hunt down  freaks like him.

107
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:14,683
So yeah, you could say we know each other.
-Don't patronize me!

108
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:19,314
You're not in the position to patronize me!
I'm holding the cards now.

109
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:24,142
They can't see me, I'm infected.
That means that I'm invisible!

110
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,549
Truly invisible! So you better
come up with something quick.

111
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:30,066
You better come up with
something or else...

112
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:34,164
-To the exit now!

113
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:40,259
-Do you know him or not?
-Not personally.

114
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:44,409
-Should have killed him
when we had the chance.

115
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:47,824
You let him out of the room.

116
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:50,791
You pitied him?

117
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:53,805
'Cause if you did,
that is the first time

118
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,525
you let the emotion
get the better of you.

119
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,499
- It doesn't matter, he's dead.

120
00:18:57,576 --> 00:19:01,468
And you have your doctor.
-I know you were a soldier.

121
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:04,095
An Officer. I guessed it.

122
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:09,032
It must be hard aiming
down and shooting at someone.

123
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:11,275
-Npt infected, I mean.

124
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:15,347
On second thought,
he said he was.

125
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,146
Do you understand what he meant by that?
 -Forget it! He's dead!

126
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:24,999
-And you better stop
asking questions before you expose more

127
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:27,793
details to two
complete strangers.

128
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,549
-So, You're a doctor,

129
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:33,570
I'm sure you understand these
things better than us.

130
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:35,120
What do you think he meant

131
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,597
that he is not infected?

132
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:41,214
I mean, someone who's
 infected person turns into...

133
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:46,460
I mean you know, how can he be infected
and still control himself?

134
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:49,625
It has an incubation period.

135
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,620
Ok.

136
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:55,254
How dis he get
 infected in the first place?

137
00:19:56,174 --> 00:19:58,452
He had to be infected by one of them.
I mean

138
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:02,894
those wounds didn't look deep
enough to be animal bites.

139
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,861
You'd think that...
-Let it go.

140
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:10,815
There'll be time enough for your questions
-Must be almost nine o'clock.

141
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:13,900
If you turn the radio to...

142
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:17,459
- That's right. We almost
forgot it's almost nine.

143
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:21,097
You listen to him too? -Yeah, of course.
Every day at nine.

144
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:25,218
Do you think that it's him talking
or a recording? -I do not know.

145
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:27,481
Someone broadcasted it.

146
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:31,177
-Must be...Manually
operated radio broadcast

147
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:33,930
or a pre recorded program
that comes on every day at nine.

148
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:36,737
-Hey, you are worrying me.

149
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,659
I'm supposed to be the
cynical one, the skeptic.

150
00:20:40,836 --> 00:20:46,015
But not without feelings. You're the son of
 a bitch, remember? The purposeful one?

151
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,294
Who Lacks emotion, stays on the move and...

152
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,413
-Come on, let's go,
it's probably already started.

153
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:04,099
Perhaps it came with the rodents.
Small, elusive, merciless.

154
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:07,541
Spreading disease and death.

155
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:13,505
At times eating the remnants of the strong,
other times preying the weak.

156
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,847
They're merging from
the dens of night,

157
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,695
it's raiding dinosaur nests.

158
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:25,336
devouring their eggs, systematically
destroying the mighty creatures.

159
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:29,686
Perhaps that's the
nature of progress,

160
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,802
the new devouring the old.

161
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:36,163
Tears him to thousands
of tiny pieces until it perishes.

162
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:42,934
Perhaps progress is in it's
essence a type of extinction.

163
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:49,091
Unavoidable like the time in
death, but accompanying it.

164
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,450
The second day
And God called the firmament Heaven

165
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:21,342
-Step into my office.

166
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,081
-Remind me what are
 we doing here exactly.

167
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:38,673
-We are setting up
 traps for the kill zones.

168
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:43,419
Then there lure
infected and we butcher them.

169
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:46,372
I know it sounds
absurd at first.

170
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:48,347
Our initial instinct is
to entrench ourselves

171
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:53,166
 in one spot. Or if you do not want to get
trapped, simply run away

172
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:58,035
or stay out of trouble. But...
-No, I mean, I get that part.

173
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:02,005
We're in charge, we
chase them, not the other way around,

174
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:08,519
what I mean is what are we doing here
with all of this water and...

175
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:14,707
Electrodes? -Electrodes. Well, we are

176
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:21,343
dividing the waters from the waters
and making a firmament

177
00:23:21,444 --> 00:23:24,194
That we will call heaven.

178
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:30,250
It's...it's electrolysis. It's
breaking down water

179
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,475
into hydrogen and oxygen.

180
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,492
I'm hoping to create
a large enough amount

181
00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:37,276
of hydrogen in a closed space

182
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:42,144
so that at any given
moment only a small spark and...

183
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:46,083
everything explodes. Everything.
In theory, of course.

184
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:49,892
Truth is, I've tried several times
and it didn't go so well...I guess I

185
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,877
couldn't create a large enough

186
00:23:51,902 --> 00:23:54,414
amount of hydrogen
in the closed space

187
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:55,998
to get a substantial blast.

188
00:23:56,023 --> 00:23:59,428
I don't know, maybe I didn't
seal the spaces well enough...

189
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:04,080
or maybe I haven't had enough
containers with electrodes, but...

190
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:09,054
Whatever the reason,
we're doing it now.

191
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:12,560
-It's beautiful.

192
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:18,987
-Thanks. I'm glad  someone
appreciates my originality.

193
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:23,928
Not him, though. TNT and gunpowder,
it's all it cares about.

194
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,558
I mean the metaphor. It's like God.

195
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:32,017
Turning water into the heavens.
-That?

196
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,570
That's not original.
This religious fanatic

197
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:36,967
joined one of the forums

198
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:41,033
I've managed once. Some scientist
or pseudo scientist. I don't know.

199
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:45,292
The kind that tries to explain
 the scriptures through science? You know?

200
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:51,303
Anyways, he raised the  theory that this
is how God created the heavens.

201
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:56,585
By transmitting an electric current through
the prehistoric waters.

202
00:24:56,686 --> 00:25:00,542
It's a good theory, but I
didn't let him off that easy.

203
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:03,616
I asked him "Hey, where
did the nitrogen and the air come from"?

204
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,075
Still waiting for an answer.

205
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,970
-Where the nitrogen came from or
how the heavens were created?

206
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:16,743
-Yeah.

207
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:13,933
-Do you like it?

208
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,713
-What's it for?

209
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:20,827
-You sound just like my father.

210
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:26,162
Why does everything have
 to have a purpose?

211
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,502
Why can't we do things
just for the sake of doing them?

212
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,275
Do you like it or not?

213
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,237
-Aesthetically yes, but...
-But it serves no purpose, right?

214
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:46,485
-Say, don't you think beauty
has a purpose of its own?

215
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:52,477
That it can exist just for
 the sake of...well... beauty?

216
00:26:53,187 --> 00:26:56,200
Can't we do things for no reason at all?

217
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:59,814
Say, eat something
because it tastes good

218
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:07,311
or hear music?
Or draw a picture just for fun?

219
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,374
Alright, If you're done, let's go
and watch you learn about the rifle.

220
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:30,544
I can't believe you.
You're just like him.

221
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:33,920
Purpose, purpose, purpose.

222
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:39,104
There can be beauty
in purpose and function too, you know?

223
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:44,338
I mean, look how...
-They are entering fucking building!

224
00:27:44,536 --> 00:27:46,539
Follow me.

225
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,904
Go, go, go.

226
00:28:01,626 --> 00:28:04,577
One entry, weapons that way.

227
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:07,168
We need to leave!

228
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:11,397
-Negative. Outside they can close
in on us from all directions.

229
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:13,118
Here, there's only
two directions.

230
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:15,256
And according to you the
rescue’s on the way.

231
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,552
As soon as it arrives, we'll make
a run for it and get out of here.

232
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,582
Grenada.

233
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:40,866
The rescue's here! Move!

234
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,948
-Get in!

235
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:45,524
-Go, go!

236
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:17,575
This is the second time they'd attacked
us instead of us waiting for them.

237
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,942
Something is not right.

238
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,868
-It doesn't mean anything's wrong, either.
What is wrong is for

239
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:26,818
The third time we've been attacked
from the direction you've been observing.

240
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:29,389
And instead of working
on her SHOOTING skills,

241
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:31,042
you're playing the alchemists.

242
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:56,800
You still owe mean answer.
-I answered you.

243
00:30:56,901 --> 00:31:00,591
From what I've seen with my own eyes.
the time between an infection and

244
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,282
outbreak shifts from a
few seconds to several minutes.

245
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,951
But I've only seen a few cases,
so I can only go by that.

246
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:08,864
-It's the same as I've
seen up until now.

247
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:13,120
And that's what I read in the official
reports before everything fell apart.

248
00:31:13,227 --> 00:31:14,742
But that guy at the hospital...

249
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,601
- We have no reason to believe
he was actually infected.

250
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:22,025
-I don't know. It's hard to explain,
 but I feel like he wasn't lying.

251
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:23,543
We don't know what this thing is

252
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:26,554
and we don't know how it's transmitted
from one person to another,

253
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:28,305
and we don't know
who and what he is.

254
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:32,960
In any case, I'm not the right person
for this discussion.

255
00:31:33,061 --> 00:31:37,277
As far as I'm concerned, it's over.
But if you insist, you got him.

256
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:42,267
Now, if you do not mind,
I have more important matters to attend to.

257
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,622
Take a quick break.

258
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,359
Drink some water,
straight back.

259
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:02,202
-Purpose, purpose, purpose.
I swear you he's just like dad.

260
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:07,504
-You're right, but he's not.
Don't fall into that trap.

261
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:07,166
-Are you sure it's not too soon?

262
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:09,074
You fired more weapons
on the range than most

263
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:10,997
recruits on do during
weeks of basic training.

264
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,992
The sooner you get
used to killing,

265
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:16,119
the sooner that we'll get
this thing over with.

266
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:21,609
-How long will this have to go on?
How long do we have to make traps and

267
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,547
wait around with guns and kill?
 -Just a few more months, sweetheart.

268
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,915
I promise, in a few
months this nightmare will be over.

269
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,311
 And we'll find
a quiet spot where we can put all these

270
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:35,944
horrible things behind us. Ok?
-We almost always make traps.

271
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:39,865
Stand by with weapons, wait.
It's never really over.

272
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:44,206
There are merely rest nights, that's all.
-You don't really believe that?

273
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:49,192
That's a strange way of looking
 at things: through a rifle sight,

274
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:52,554
with no hope for
 something better? Something else?

275
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,512
-It worked! The vapor bomb; it worked!

276
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:03,020
You should have seen it.

277
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,775
The moment we went up we were
bombarded with cloud of steam.

278
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,142
They were totally blinded!

279
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:10,862
You should have seen it. All
water turned into steam

280
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:12,941
inside the container and...
-A few charges would have

281
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:16,437
done the job. Probably even better.
-Then maybe that's how the heavens

282
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:20,715
were created. A huge heat
source boiled the water...

283
00:35:20,816 --> 00:35:25,726
But it's only steam. -OK, Ok, Ok.
If the temperature high enough,

284
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:30,147
and AI mean really high, the water
disintegrates into it's elements, but...

285
00:35:30,248 --> 00:35:34,072
-But now the chemistry lesson is over
and we have real work to do!

286
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:39,348
-Are there any more?

287
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:22,277
-It is possible they
killed each other.

288
00:36:23,157 --> 00:36:27,336
The predatory dinosaurs simply
disobeyed the laws of balance.

289
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:30,002
Just like man.

290
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:35,695
Perhaps one or several dinosaurs
 become so skilled at killing

291
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:40,050
 that they eradicated entire species.

292
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,766
I know it doesn't sound likely,
after all, the ecosystem

293
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:48,371
was supposed to intervene.

294
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:51,617
The more the population
of prey decreases,

295
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,193
the smaller the
populations of predators

296
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:59,597
becomes. Allowing prey
to recover, and so forth.

297
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:05,513
The only exception into
 this equation is man.

298
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:11,533
But how do we know
 man is the only one?

299
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:19,855
-The third day
God called the dry land Earth

300
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:30,500
-Before all of this began,
I used to watched these scenes for hours

301
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:34,485
to observe the basic power

302
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,833
of the creation of
matter from nothing.

303
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:41,553
There is no greater truth than that.

304
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,824
-We're out of here.

305
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:30,330
-Did you pick anything up

306
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:32,330
since everything went quiet?
-No.

307
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:36,322
Just the guy with
the dinosaurs, that's it.

308
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,775
Do you think there is still
a government out there?

309
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,702
-There Is always something.

310
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:45,569
That's what civilization
is all about, isn't it?

311
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,426
Someone tells others what to do,

312
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:53,837
gives them orders and in return,
lives at their expense. It's false.

313
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:56,648
-And by your definition, if
there is no government,

314
00:38:56,673 --> 00:38:58,181
then there is no civilization.

315
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,583
-I don't know. If there were a
functioning government,

316
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,125
they'd probably cleanse the entire area
with nuclear weapons.

317
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:13,803
and we wouldn't be here.
And maybe it'll still happen. Who knows?

318
00:39:14,692 --> 00:39:17,302
-Well, in that case, we won't
know anything until it's over.

319
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:19,696
-Oh, that all depends.

320
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:22,909
If their ICBM's are a cruise
missiles, you won't hear a thing.

321
00:39:23,224 --> 00:39:27,161
But if they're airplanes,
then you have two options.

322
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:30,704
subsonic bombers like
the B-52s and you might

323
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:33,034
just hear the jet
airplanes approaching

324
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:37,701
right before the blast. Or
supersonic bomber like the B-1

325
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:40,408
and then you will not hear
anything because well,

326
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:43,825
they're supersonic. But you
might just hear a sonic

327
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,172
boom right before it all
comes crashing down.

328
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:51,234
And there'll be this
bright light and this intense heat

329
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:54,017
And then you won't  hear a thing.

330
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:58,003
-You're smiling.

331
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,872
This is the first time
I see you smiling.

332
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:05,394
Finally,  someone else he can
drive crazy  with this conspiracy theories.

333
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:09,655
Did you tell her what you
did before all this began? -No.

334
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:13,460
-He had a website where
he refuted conspiracy theories.

335
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:17,671
Now he's the  greatest believer of all.
-occam's razor.

336
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:19,609
It's usually the most simple,

337
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:22,931
most logical explanation of all.
Think about it.

338
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:27,265
Why did all the functioning
governments disappear all of a sudden?

339
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:30,580
Why is there still electricity
and running water?

340
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:36,290
You tell me. It must be
biological weapons.

341
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,204
I believe that.

342
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:44,144
It's the most logical,
most simple explanation.

343
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:46,426
Your turn to stand guard.

344
00:41:04,903 --> 00:41:08,766
-What did you lose?
-More Than enough.

345
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:14,134
You?
 -I was on the offensive.

346
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:19,027
You never sit back and
rest?-Always.

347
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:20,760
It's all right.

348
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:23,428
I understand if you don't
want to talk about it.

349
00:41:26,811 --> 00:41:29,828
-Everybody.
Everything.

350
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:33,287
As bad as it gets.

351
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:38,761
-Husband? Parents? Kids?

352
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:45,100
-Cousins, uncles...
As I said,

353
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,706
The worst.

354
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,793
-It's always gonna be worse.

355
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:57,787
-I see. Look, I know
everything looks dark,

356
00:41:58,655 --> 00:42:01,697
I understand your point of
view, but things change.

357
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:03,162
-Not for me!

358
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,215
Most of my life I have killed
and witnessed killing.

359
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:10,528
I have been responsible for the

360
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:12,728
planning and development
of ways and

361
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:14,428
methods of destruction
that will be

362
00:42:14,453 --> 00:42:16,558
incomprehensible to
a person like you.

363
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:21,062
So, as far as I'm concerned,
nothing's changed!

364
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,554
-But surely not like this.

365
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:27,320
Not women and children.
Not your own family.

366
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:33,928
Look, my entire life
I've seen people

367
00:42:33,953 --> 00:42:36,585
die suffering from all
sorts of illnesses.

368
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:39,858
But at the same time, I've
seen others who healed

369
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:42,491
and grew as people because
of that suffering.

370
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:47,218
So you're right. Nothing's changed.

371
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:52,474
That's exactly my point.
I know that even now there is hope.

372
00:43:04,187 --> 00:43:07,149
-We shot four of the five who were
in pursuit but there is still more.

373
00:43:07,174 --> 00:43:09,290
-This is the third time.
This is not an accident,

374
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:10,560
someone's leading them to us.

375
00:43:10,585 --> 00:43:12,457
 -Tonight's hideout. Move!

376
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:08,057
-I'm beginning to think that it's
that the guy from the hospital.

377
00:45:09,825 --> 00:45:12,678
After all, he survived
all of our traps.

378
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:16,511
And he said something
 about them not seeing him.

379
00:45:17,324 --> 00:45:19,419
Could be they're not
attacking him for some reason,

380
00:45:19,444 --> 00:45:21,261
 just like they
don't attack one another.

381
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:23,591
What do you think?

382
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:27,116
-He could be guiding them to
us and then running away.

383
00:45:27,743 --> 00:45:29,202
It is not unlikely.

384
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:34,984
Devise a plan. If he really
is leading the infected to us,

385
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:38,077
we'll have to neutralize him.

386
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:13,460
It's eleven o'clock and
we missed the broadcast.

387
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:17,200
It's the first time I'm
 missing the broadcast.

388
00:46:31,991 --> 00:46:35,293
So, you think they do know each other?
-I do not know.

389
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:37,392
It's not so clear cut.

390
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,260
-You said for a fact
that he should have

391
00:46:39,285 --> 00:46:41,230
killed them at the
hospital, but he didn't.

392
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:42,772
That's not like him.

393
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,169
I mean, I don't know him very well,
but that's not like him at all.

394
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:48,498
-I know, I've never seen
him hesitate like that.

395
00:46:50,527 --> 00:46:53,622
But then again, I've never seen
him with a live person before.

396
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:55,078
I mean a healthy person.

397
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:57,853
I mean, not infected.

398
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:00,910
Look, he's obviously a
professional soldier.

399
00:47:01,604 --> 00:47:06,470
Could be that shooting citizens in
back is just against his basic nature.

400
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:09,545
You know, the ethos of the
honorable warrior and all that.

401
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:12,557
It actually it fits in
well with his type.

402
00:47:12,582 --> 00:47:14,699
I've got to say
that that's exactly

403
00:47:14,724 --> 00:47:17,309
what I assumed when
I first met him.

404
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:21,147
Way too young to be
General, too confident and

405
00:47:21,152 --> 00:47:26,493
experienced to be Major
or captain. I don't know.

406
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:30,114
But we should probably
get back to the others.

407
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,324
they're probably beefing
up security as we speak.

408
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:36,085
If someone really is leading
the infected to us,

409
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,533
we should probably set up

410
00:47:38,558 --> 00:47:41,915
as many charges as we can.
We are out of hiding places.

411
00:48:44,969 --> 00:48:47,221
-What is this?
-it's a little

412
00:48:47,245 --> 00:48:49,271
experiment I'm conducting.

413
00:48:50,142 --> 00:48:51,838
I'm creating land from water.

414
00:48:52,832 --> 00:48:55,857
See, the cage is
in a body of water

415
00:48:55,884 --> 00:48:57,952
and I'm running a fake
current through it.

416
00:48:58,274 --> 00:48:59,818
The current makes the particles

417
00:48:59,843 --> 00:49:01,685
inside the water
stick to the cage.

418
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:05,853
According to the theory, enough particles
should stick to it

419
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:11,078
over time to create
small islands where you see the cage.

420
00:49:20,945 --> 00:49:24,251
-We should probably go back.
-Yeah.

421
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:28,365
Yes, we should. -This
Is really nice.

422
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:29,432
Thanks, thanks.

423
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:47,496
If he's really following us,
he's familiar with this place.

424
00:49:49,017 --> 00:49:52,196
That means he'll will guiding
 the infected to us tonight or tomorrow.

425
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:56,836
Do you have a plan?
-I always have a plan.

426
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,954
-That's how you put
 up with me, isn't it?

427
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:02,448
Maybe you enjoy me driving you crazy.

428
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,915
I should have
known. Like always,

429
00:52:05,399 --> 00:52:09,247
you are hunting me down. Like
a cat playing with a mouse!

430
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:11,044
-Don't move. Don't move.

431
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:18,204
I get it now. They think they
should be afraid of me.

432
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:22,259
Hate me. Me!

433
00:52:23,048 --> 00:52:25,520
He's the one you
should be afraid of!

434
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:28,342
He's the one who killed
his entire family!

435
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,498
Tell them, Colonel.
Tell them who you really are!

436
00:52:33,523 --> 00:52:36,560
Don't move! -I suggest you stand
still and raise your hands.

437
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,264
-All of them!

438
00:52:38,806 --> 00:52:42,744
With his own gun! From point blank!

439
00:52:43,526 --> 00:52:47,428
His mother, his children,

440
00:52:48,274 --> 00:52:51,535
his little niece.
A two-year old baby.

441
00:52:52,624 --> 00:52:55,985
Clever. They absolutely aren't.

442
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:02,056
You kill one person as a civilian ,
you're a criminal. A murderer.

443
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:07,818
You kill one person while
wear a uniform and you're a hero.

444
00:53:08,554 --> 00:53:12,589
A civilian killing twenty
 is a psychopath.

445
00:53:13,158 --> 00:53:14,726
A serial killer.

446
00:53:16,129 --> 00:53:20,076
-But a soldier, he gets a medal!
-Stop it!

447
00:53:20,646 --> 00:53:22,623
-And if by any chance
you're responsible

448
00:53:22,648 --> 00:53:26,879
for the deaths of hundreds
or thousands or more,

449
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:32,660
You're a national hero.
Kill millions you're a god.

450
00:53:33,192 --> 00:53:37,847
There are poems about you!
You've become the stuff of legends!

451
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,875
Stop, I beg you.
-They are afraid of me.

452
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:45,473
They despise me.

453
00:53:46,142 --> 00:53:49,749
When all this began, he still had
soldiers under him.

454
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:53,588
He could have helped
 his family to solitary,

455
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,341
take care of them. Help them out!

456
00:53:58,047 --> 00:54:01,015
At most send one of his troops
to take them out of their misery!

457
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:06,519
But no, no! not him! he went by himself!

458
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:10,186
To put a bullet in each
and every one of them.

459
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:11,792
Right in the head.

460
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:16,178
execution style. So here he is!

461
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:22,132
A decorated hero!
A noble man of honor!

462
00:54:23,037 --> 00:54:24,760
Nothing but a psychopath

463
00:54:24,785 --> 00:54:27,799
in the service of the law!
Nothing more!

464
00:54:28,915 --> 00:54:33,937
His mother, his children!
From point blank!

465
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:40,592
Tell them, Colonel. How does it
feel murdering your whole family?

466
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:44,802
-No! What the fuck ?!

467
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:51,217
You could have waited a little longer,
it looked like he had information.

468
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,698
You could have waited.

469
00:54:56,594 --> 00:55:00,775
-I've seen it before.
He was about to die.

470
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:03,915
And you?

471
00:55:05,524 --> 00:55:07,261
Did you know him or not?

472
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:11,049
Why'd hesitate again instead
of just killing him?

473
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:16,855
Why'd you hesitate this time?
-What's the difference?

474
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:18,792
He's dead.

475
00:55:22,998 --> 00:55:25,287
Another attack.
Take up your positions!

476
00:58:52,052 --> 00:58:54,336
-A meteor, yes.

477
00:58:55,847 --> 00:59:01,186
After all, what can cause such
sudden extinction other than some

478
00:59:01,212 --> 00:59:06,737
external element coming out of
 nowhere obliterating everything?

479
00:59:07,971 --> 00:59:11,875
Like a Hollywood disaster
movie or an apocalyptic myth.

480
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:19,246
Or is it no more than a reflection of one
of our greatest fears?

481
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:22,090
The total lack of control
over our fate?

482
00:59:23,305 --> 00:59:26,092
Who knows that whatever we do

483
00:59:26,117 --> 00:59:30,152
at any given moment,
the end is lurking.

484
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:35,964
Absolute and final gigantic,
burning, unstoppable.

485
00:59:36,165 --> 00:59:39,570
Of course, there is the
possibility they did see it,

486
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,731
but simply never
understand what it was.

487
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,261
Perhaps it's before our
 own eyes as we speak, and

488
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:53,393
like the dinosaurs we can't
 see or hear it.

489
00:59:54,103 --> 00:59:59,570
Like an annoying beep that your brain
simply wipes off after a while.

490
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:04,006
-The fifth day. And God created

491
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:06,669
great whales, and every
living creature that moveth.

492
01:00:45,324 --> 01:00:48,785
-So,did you know him or not?

493
01:00:49,894 --> 01:00:52,245
-When I told you to
prepare the hideout, I

494
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:54,689
asked you to kill the
fish in the aquarium.

495
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,886
They attract cats, and if they die
they will attract worse than that.

496
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:06,760
-You didn't answer my question.
-The time and energy you spent on that

497
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:10,792
 automatic nourishing device,
we don't have time for that.

498
01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:18,024
-Did you know him or not?
-I told you; I didn't know him personally

499
01:01:18,029 --> 01:01:22,300
and he is dead. So it doesn't matter.
-And the truth doesn't matter?

500
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:30,022
You're hiding something from us.

501
01:01:31,152 --> 01:01:35,294
You know how all this
started, how it all began, You know...

502
01:01:36,262 --> 01:01:39,309
You know how all of this is started...
-What difference does it make?

503
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,002
What I told you or didn’t
tell you is nothing

504
01:01:42,027 --> 01:01:44,387
you couldn't have figured
out for yourself.

505
01:01:44,643 --> 01:01:47,770
Yes, it was biological
weapons experiment.

506
01:01:47,795 --> 01:01:49,516
Yes it got out of hand.
Yes.

507
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:55,355
-So you knew. This entire time
you knew and you didn't tell us?

508
01:01:56,137 --> 01:01:58,725
You knew how all
this happened and...

509
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,588
-in the same way you knew.

510
01:02:01,323 --> 01:02:03,933
I don't understand why
you're feigning innocence.

511
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,468
Didn't you ever stop to think

512
01:02:05,493 --> 01:02:09,543
why the infected don't attack one another?
Why they only attack the healthy?

513
01:02:09,915 --> 01:02:12,135
You ? With all the
conspiracy theories?

514
01:02:13,304 --> 01:02:15,423
Wasn't it obvious to
you from the start

515
01:02:15,448 --> 01:02:17,248
that the most
logical explanation

516
01:02:17,325 --> 01:02:20,580
Is a biological weapons
experiment that got out of hand?

517
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:22,846
I mean, what would it achieve,

518
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:24,761
for me to tell you something
you already knew?

519
01:02:25,768 --> 01:02:27,164
She's a scientist.

520
01:02:28,638 --> 01:02:32,046
It's your obsessive curiosity
that got us here in the first place.

521
01:02:32,824 --> 01:02:36,932
If it wasn't for the geeky obsessions
of people like you with the truth, and how

522
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:38,782
and the why, we wouldn't
be here right now.

523
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:40,778
-Look, I understand
your anger, but...

524
01:02:40,856 --> 01:02:44,753
Just like he sat at his computer
developing software viruses.

525
01:02:44,778 --> 01:02:47,376
His friends and colleagues
were developing things

526
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:48,831
that were much, much worse.

527
01:02:48,856 --> 01:02:53,019
And he could easily be one of them.
If you care so much about the truth,

528
01:02:53,044 --> 01:02:58,052
don't lie to yourself. We're all sons
of bitches, that's the truth.

529
01:02:58,531 --> 01:03:01,110
So don't play innocent
as you didn't know,

530
01:03:01,135 --> 01:03:03,824
just because I hid or didn't hide
something from you.

531
01:03:06,655 --> 01:03:09,395
I don't have time for
this ridiculous discussion.

532
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:11,403
We have a large explosives

533
01:03:11,428 --> 01:03:14,105
arena to prepare by noon.
In the last few days,

534
01:03:14,182 --> 01:03:17,011
we've burned our traps faster
than we could build them.

535
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:18,349
We have to close the gap.

536
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:21,575
Now, don't fool yourselves.
It won't get any better.

537
01:03:21,759 --> 01:03:25,028
The infected are getting more
and more violent and aggressive.

538
01:03:25,053 --> 01:03:26,968
If we stop dictating
the time and place,

539
01:03:26,992 --> 01:03:30,291
they're gonna kill us all.
now get some rest.

540
01:03:32,716 --> 01:03:34,828
We'll take lower floors
when we are rested.

541
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,037
Don't judge him too harshly.

542
01:03:51,974 --> 01:03:53,785
You heard what happened.

543
01:03:57,204 --> 01:03:59,815
He had to kill his
own family by himself.

544
01:04:01,941 --> 01:04:04,185
You didn't just lost everything.

545
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:11,556
I used to have this argument
 with my father about euthanasia.

546
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:19,500
Would I have the courage to do it?
If and when?

547
01:04:19,617 --> 01:04:24,839
-Don't fall into that trap.
He's not Dad, remember?

548
01:04:31,107 --> 01:04:32,246
-Let's go.

549
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:41,175
-Tadpoles?

550
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:47,456
It's amazing, even the frogs
will fuck and spawn here/

551
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,759
-Hey, hey, hey
mate and procreate, please.

552
01:05:52,078 --> 01:05:56,296
-So you're saying if we find
some random fish

553
01:05:56,397 --> 01:05:58,213
from an abandoned pet store

554
01:05:58,238 --> 01:06:01,600
and put it together they'll
mate and procreate?

555
01:06:02,581 --> 01:06:04,821
-Absolutely. But we
really shouldn't because

556
01:06:04,845 --> 01:06:07,441
they tend to electrocute
the place,at some point.

557
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:13,418
-Yeah, but...we will have a chance
to make some love before it's all over.

558
01:06:46,613 --> 01:06:49,229
-Now I understand why you do not like
talk about it.

559
01:06:51,686 --> 01:06:52,809
I'm sorry.

560
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:57,950
Your wife, children?

561
01:07:00,044 --> 01:07:04,191
-Parents, siblings,
a niece, everything.

562
01:07:04,322 --> 01:07:10,015
Everyone. With my sidearm
at point-blank just like the man said.

563
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:12,446
-The worst.

564
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,276
I'm sorry.
-There is always something worse.

565
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:26,033
I treated a terminal patient
once who applied fora court order to

566
01:07:26,134 --> 01:07:30,697
switch him off her life support machine.
You know, to allow her to die in dignity.

567
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:33,480
When the order came in,
the woman insisted

568
01:07:33,505 --> 01:07:36,173
that only her youngest
daughter would actually do it

569
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,994
You know, to actually
pull out the plug.

570
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:42,657
That girl lived on
the other side of the world.

571
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:44,866
It took him a whole
week to trace her

572
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:47,075
and another week
to finally arrive.

573
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:52,867
All through that time, the mother
suffered through hell.

574
01:07:54,324 --> 01:07:58,895
We begged her to end it,
but she insisted on waiting.

575
01:08:02,793 --> 01:08:06,184
After the girl arrived
and everything was over,

576
01:08:06,209 --> 01:08:08,906
I had a chance to
speak with her.

577
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:14,626
When she spoke of her mother, she
spoke of a cold and harsh woman.

578
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:18,860
Somebody who is always criticizing
 demanding.

579
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:23,695
never caressing, accepting comforting.

580
01:08:25,828 --> 01:08:29,242
But she said she would forgiven
everything if her mother

581
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:31,514
had just told her once
that she loved her.

582
01:08:33,863 --> 01:08:36,222
At that point I stopped
her and I said,

583
01:08:36,247 --> 01:08:38,698
"You mother didn't
just say she loved you,

584
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:42,683
 she screamed it out loud
 halfway across the world."

585
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:25,450
-Ten minute break then prepare
the charges we're not keeping up.

586
01:10:25,553 --> 01:10:27,699
This can't go on;
we must keep up.

587
01:10:56,207 --> 01:10:57,815
-I wish we were on the beach.

588
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:03,278
-I'm not the beach type of guy.

589
01:11:04,414 --> 01:11:06,411
That's because you didn't
 know my dad.

590
01:11:07,702 --> 01:11:11,071
One week with him and you would
totally become sea god.

591
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:18,148
He was really a pirate deep inside.
At least a professional fisherman.

592
01:11:20,338 --> 01:11:25,653
He always talked about a Viking
burial ceremony at sea. -Viking burial.

593
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:31,166
So what? Lying in a boat,

594
01:11:31,696 --> 01:11:34,134
sailing off into
the horizon with

595
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:37,246
all his favorite weapons
and worldly possessions?

596
01:11:40,233 --> 01:11:43,327
-And the fire slowly consuming it all.

597
01:11:45,406 --> 01:11:46,621
Not bad.

598
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:51,668
-I don't know. I'd rather die
while making love.

599
01:12:02,788 --> 01:12:06,431
-Is this the first time you've scratched
or bitten by an infected person?

600
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:08,383
-What do you mean?

601
01:12:08,623 --> 01:12:09,868
-You know what I mean.

602
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:12,002
I'm talking about scratches
you got on the corridor.

603
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:15,223
-You don't miss a trick, do you?

604
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,532
-Not when it comes to injuries.
That's what I do for a living, remember?

605
01:12:22,586 --> 01:12:24,300
And you didn't answer my question.

606
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:30,796
-It's happened before.
-Yeah, to me, too.

607
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:34,918
Right at the beginning, but then
then it wasn't contagious or

608
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:37,643
it wasn't transmitted through bites

609
01:12:37,668 --> 01:12:41,697
or scratches. Or maybe the
incubation period was very long.

610
01:12:42,104 --> 01:12:43,796
Anyway, we have to find out.

611
01:12:43,821 --> 01:12:47,008
Maybe it's growing inside of us and
we must stay away from them

612
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:51,688
for their  safety before
it breaks out while they're around us.

613
01:12:52,524 --> 01:12:56,039
-What makes you think I know ?
-Come on.

614
01:12:56,830 --> 01:13:00,159
There's no point in
carrying on the charade.

615
01:13:00,184 --> 01:13:01,954
It's alright, I won't tell them.

616
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:05,639
-What do you mean?
-You know exactly what I mean.

617
01:13:05,663 --> 01:13:08,096
It can't be a coincidence.

618
01:13:16,962 --> 01:13:21,358
That's all right. I know
exactly how you feel.

619
01:13:23,974 --> 01:13:26,227
Everything is collapsing around me, too.

620
01:13:29,164 --> 01:13:34,274
All this is new to me. unlike
anything I've seen and maybe...

621
01:13:34,707 --> 01:13:38,005
-Maybe you need to
get a grip. Because like I said,

622
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:41,028
As far as I'm concerned,
nothing's changed.

623
01:13:41,053 --> 01:13:42,756
-You're doing it again.

624
01:13:43,393 --> 01:13:47,430
Attacking instead of answering.
and  I refuse to play the game.

625
01:13:48,155 --> 01:13:52,578
I know some things haven't changed,
you're right, but there are wounds.

626
01:13:52,603 --> 01:13:56,652
-There are wounds that no one
can heal. Not a doctor,

627
01:13:56,696 --> 01:14:00,086
Not a healer, not time, no one.

628
01:14:06,684 --> 01:14:09,513
We've rested
enough ; we're leaving.

629
01:14:18,515 --> 01:14:20,308
-Promise me?

630
01:14:26,118 --> 01:14:29,453
Promise me that when all this is over
We can...

631
01:14:30,595 --> 01:14:33,959
try to grow some fish without
having to electrocute them?

632
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:40,182
-And...tridents

633
01:14:40,963 --> 01:14:44,102
... and salamanders.

634
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:48,146
and... -Frogs?

635
01:14:48,171 --> 01:14:50,054
Frogs.

636
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:52,583
-Anything you want.

637
01:14:56,427 --> 01:15:00,908
-Come on, start making the charges.
Use them.We already know how

638
01:15:00,933 --> 01:15:01,727
to use use small arms.

639
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:03,685
It's time you learn how
 to prepare charges and

640
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:04,985
handle the explosives.

641
01:16:14,151 --> 01:16:17,905
-Another answer is
volcanic eruptions.

642
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:22,943
Not a single event
but thousands of small ones.

643
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:29,226
pressure accumulated from millions of years
and then one day, everything is released.

644
01:16:30,194 --> 01:16:35,347
The huge force erupts in numerous places,
filling the atmosphere with

645
01:16:35,372 --> 01:16:38,033
dust and lethal gases.
Blocking the sun,

646
01:16:38,058 --> 01:16:42,079
poisoning the soil,
the air and the water.

647
01:16:42,908 --> 01:16:47,497
What's more frightening than the thought of
destruction lurking under our feet?

648
01:16:47,873 --> 01:16:50,264
Coming from the same
the place we live off.

649
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:56,584
From which we draw our comfort
in life and death?

650
01:17:18,594 --> 01:17:21,389
-I did it. It worked!
I've been trying

651
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,640
this for months; it's perfect!

652
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:27,063
Even he can say it's ineffective.
I mean, look. It's...it's small,

653
01:17:27,088 --> 01:17:30,439
It's got a remote control,
it's got a camera.

654
01:17:30,464 --> 01:17:32,490
it's the perfect patrol device.
It's perfect.

655
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:36,560
-Nothing you can't do with a camera
installed in a remote controlled vehicle.

656
01:17:37,072 --> 01:17:41,376
-I knew you'd say that, but mind
can climb and descend stairs. Take a look.

657
01:17:41,635 --> 01:17:42,939
Check it out.

658
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:52,917
I don't get it, it just worked.
-Don't worry, don't give up.

659
01:17:53,329 --> 01:17:55,325
You know, one of my
professor of medicine

660
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:58,019
used to joke and say that
in the book of Genesis

661
01:17:58,044 --> 01:18:00,344
There's actually two versions
creation of man.

662
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:04,728
Because you know, the first one didn't
work out so well, so God tried again.

663
01:18:04,982 --> 01:18:07,882
-Well, from what I can see, He didn't
do a better job the second time.

664
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:12,163
I guess he released the beta version
too early before fixing all the bugs.

665
01:18:13,135 --> 01:18:16,205
-The beta version?
-Yeah, the beta version.

666
01:18:16,898 --> 01:18:19,713
You know, like
computer programs;

667
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:23,521
they release versions
without fixing mistakes.

668
01:18:23,546 --> 01:18:26,101
-By no means whatsoever.
I see he managed

669
01:18:26,126 --> 01:18:28,872
to convince you, but
believe me, it's too soon.

670
01:18:29,348 --> 01:18:32,740
in a few weeks maybe, when we
are certain everyone's dead, but not now.

671
01:18:37,861 --> 01:18:42,125
-We talked about loading up several
tons of equipment and foods on trucks

672
01:18:42,499 --> 01:18:46,793
And drive them down to a remote
location in the desert. Somewhere isolated.

673
01:18:47,018 --> 01:18:51,580
Hundreds of kilometers away from
any town and to laying low for a while.

674
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:58,645
-I'm all for it. I mean, look,
I devised a plan and I even made a list

675
01:18:58,746 --> 01:19:02,132
on how to collect everything.
And there's also room.

676
01:19:02,157 --> 01:19:03,666
-It's still too soon.

677
01:19:03,691 --> 01:19:06,990
-I agree. There is no
place they can't reach.

678
01:19:07,454 --> 01:19:10,187
And then we have nowhere
to run and nowhere to hide.

679
01:19:12,409 --> 01:19:14,526
-Wow, you finished it!
-Yeah.

680
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:17,536
-It's beautiful!

681
01:19:20,591 --> 01:19:25,809
-Thanks. Look, this...this
is the cage and protects processing unit.

682
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:27,951
I think I'm going to
build another one and

683
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:29,391
I'm going to make a
communication system

684
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:31,852
between them. Then I'll
replicate them and

685
01:19:31,877 --> 01:19:34,119
we'll be able to point
them everywhere.

686
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:36,877
You know, get one-one man shifts.
They'll rest a little more and...

687
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:38,653
-And we'll have more worthless toys.

688
01:19:38,678 --> 01:19:41,384
And time wasted on maintenance and repairs.

689
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:44,749
Ok, fifteen minutes'
rest and then we leave.

690
01:19:44,774 --> 01:19:46,763
I'll stand guard
while you get ready.

691
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:51,498
-Look, why were you
so hard on him?

692
01:19:51,523 --> 01:19:54,235
Is that what you
consider life's purpose?

693
01:19:54,817 --> 01:19:57,968
Always on the go? Kill or be killed?

694
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,124
-They're coming!

695
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,045
-They're coming. We're surrounded.

696
01:21:03,084 --> 01:21:06,964
This is it, we're trapped. -Fuck this!
let's hide in the corner.

697
01:21:06,989 --> 01:21:09,873
They'll break in, we'll finish them off.
We have enough charges and ammunition,

698
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:14,750
-Negative. There's too many
of them. This must be the end.

699
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:18,452
They become especially aggressive
and frenetic just before the end.

700
01:21:18,893 --> 01:21:21,306
They can smell and hear from
hundreds of yards away.

701
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:22,605
Gather within seconds.

702
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:26,388
 If we went in a corridor,
a narrow killing zone perhaps,

703
01:21:26,413 --> 01:21:30,552
but this way, they'll reach us long before
we can do any serious damage.

704
01:21:30,577 --> 01:21:34,335
-Her love. That's what you are.

705
01:21:35,028 --> 01:21:38,288
Always remember that.
Love.

706
01:21:38,993 --> 01:21:41,030
There is nothing else, understand?

707
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:49,325
-There's always hope.
You just need to take a good look around.

708
01:21:52,019 --> 01:21:56,072
-Wait, wait. If they all
 enter the hall all at once,

709
01:21:56,097 --> 01:21:59,488
We simultaneously blow off the charges.
stay close to the ceiling.

710
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:00,642
-Yeah, perhaps.

711
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,781
It might buy us several minutes before
next wave. We've got nothing to lose.

712
01:22:05,476 --> 01:22:09,515
They'll  help you deploy the charges,
I'll take care of the rest.

713
01:22:55,409 --> 01:22:59,445
-Come on! -Detonators.
I'm right behind you!

714
01:22:59,669 --> 01:23:01,202
Go!

715
01:23:06,983 --> 01:23:08,706
-Come on!

716
01:23:10,673 --> 01:23:12,179
Come on!

717
01:23:16,173 --> 01:23:19,313
-Move! Move! Move!
-She's not going to make it! Come on!

718
01:23:23,059 --> 01:23:25,571
They're going to kill her!
Let me to do it!

719
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:26,424
No!

720
01:23:27,527 --> 01:23:30,424
Come on!
-Not yet! Not yet!

721
01:24:07,935 --> 01:24:09,481
-No!

722
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:25,744
No!

723
01:25:14,371 --> 01:25:18,247
 -It's time to go to the desert.
 -Leave me.

724
01:25:18,348 --> 01:25:21,867
I'm dead.
 Go.

725
01:25:22,727 --> 01:25:24,076
Good luck.

726
01:25:56,303 --> 01:26:01,191
Why didn’t you leave there?
I am a dead man. We all are.

727
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:07,399
-You're badly hurt, but it's not over yet.
She's dead, but you're still alive.

728
01:26:08,844 --> 01:26:13,667
-So you're doing this for her? For
the idiot, that fucking hypocrite.

729
01:26:13,797 --> 01:26:16,755
-Shut your mouth. You hear me?

730
01:26:17,733 --> 01:26:20,261
-You're not...
-I'm not what?

731
01:26:21,027 --> 01:26:26,236
Jesus Christ! I'm sick and tired
of the pretense and the hypocrisy!

732
01:26:27,856 --> 01:26:33,392
What do you think? What was
she thinking? What are all thinking?

733
01:26:34,302 --> 01:26:38,292
that if you help your fellow
man and simply live and do no wrong,

734
01:26:38,317 --> 01:26:40,737
That absolves you from
any responsibility

735
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:41,937
for what goes on around you?

736
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:46,421
The essence of life
is murder and suffering.

737
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:49,498
Every time you eat
to sustain yourself,

738
01:26:49,523 --> 01:26:52,354
you're feeding off the death
of a living creature.

739
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,700
-Plants and animals aren't like that.

740
01:26:55,887 --> 01:26:57,852
-Plants, animals?

741
01:26:58,828 --> 01:27:01,867
Every time you turn on the
light or drive a car,

742
01:27:01,892 --> 01:27:04,533
someone somewhere
dies of lung cancer.

743
01:27:04,558 --> 01:27:06,871
Every time you
buy something  for peanuts,

744
01:27:06,896 --> 01:27:10,736
some kid dies in a
third world sweat shop. -It's enough.

745
01:27:11,509 --> 01:27:14,571
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're delirious.

746
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:15,691
- Jesus.

747
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:17,691
Again with the denial.

748
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:23,756
You know I'm dead,
but you think like her.

749
01:27:24,484 --> 01:27:28,928
That if you treat me,
maybe ease my pain,

750
01:27:29,029 --> 01:27:30,970
It'll make you a better person.

751
01:27:32,402 --> 01:27:36,724
Love, grace, pity.

752
01:27:38,406 --> 01:27:42,199
Fuck you! You're doing it for yourself.

753
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:46,247
You're just like her.
On the run and killing

754
01:27:46,259 --> 01:27:49,557
in an attempt to live
and not to be killed.

755
01:27:49,582 --> 01:27:53,572
No more, no less
a murder than the rest of us.

756
01:27:53,673 --> 01:27:58,013
You can say anything you want about me, but
don't you dare say anything about her.

757
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,158
-Don't dare?
Don't dare ?!

758
01:28:03,153 --> 01:28:05,730
Let me tell you something about that bitch.

759
01:28:06,653 --> 01:28:11,601
Why do you think I chose her hospital
out of all the hospitals? Huh? Why?

760
01:28:13,109 --> 01:28:15,944
Because it was part of the program.

761
01:28:16,362 --> 01:28:20,200
It was a research hospital
that was part of the program.

762
01:28:20,225 --> 01:28:23,076
I hoped there would
be research subjects there.

763
01:28:23,101 --> 01:28:28,524
I was curious. Curious to know
how my project turned out.

764
01:28:28,549 --> 01:28:30,979
-No, I don't believe you.

765
01:28:31,201 --> 01:28:35,901
I don't . -You knew all along.
All this time you knew.

766
01:28:37,295 --> 01:28:39,605
-Oh, yeah. I knew.

767
01:28:41,707 --> 01:28:45,443
And what that little shit said when
she blew his brains out is true.

768
01:28:46,797 --> 01:28:50,468
I am God. I'm God!

769
01:28:52,414 --> 01:28:55,398
What was the idiot
thinking when she killed it?

770
01:28:56,248 --> 01:29:01,472
That she'd spare him the pain? That she's
keeping me from confronting the truth?

771
01:29:01,573 --> 01:29:05,952
That ignorant, phony moron.
I know the truth!

772
01:29:06,276 --> 01:29:09,565
I know who I and what I am!
I have come up with

773
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:12,810
the idea for the experiment,
for Christs sake!

774
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:18,220
I set up the meetings.
I wrote the memos, I pushed,

775
01:29:18,321 --> 01:29:22,874
pressured, persuaded, hinted,
contrived, falsified signatures.

776
01:29:23,014 --> 01:29:25,269
The head hunches never
would have approved it if

777
01:29:25,281 --> 01:29:27,640
someone like me hadn’t
been pulling the strings.

778
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:33,073
This was my baby!
The highlight of my career!

779
01:29:34,351 --> 01:29:38,938
The entire damned,
monstrosity of an experiment!

780
01:29:44,604 --> 01:29:46,534
It couldn't have been worse.

781
01:29:49,138 --> 01:29:53,046
I killed them. All of them.

782
01:29:55,310 --> 01:30:00,905
I didn't just pull the trigger,
I eliminated all of them.

783
01:30:03,934 --> 01:30:09,670
We're all murderers. I'm just a little
more successful than most, that's all.

784
01:30:10,463 --> 01:30:14,259
But your sister, a saint,
sheer perfection,

785
01:30:14,962 --> 01:30:19,333
worked at a hospital that took
 part in an experiment. -No.

786
01:30:20,001 --> 01:30:24,412
I don't believe you. She would
never have... -Never have what?

787
01:30:24,513 --> 01:30:31,103
Stupid bitch. She lived,
therefore was a murderer!

788
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:36,910
You want to save me. You can't.

789
01:30:37,454 --> 01:30:42,006
I'm dead. The infected didn't attack me.

790
01:30:43,118 --> 01:30:46,600
I contracted it, too.
Right from the start.

791
01:30:47,229 --> 01:30:53,352
And it has no cure. I know because
I made sure there wouldn't be one!

792
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:58,346
It's Ok. You're sick,
it all makes sense.

793
01:30:58,907 --> 01:31:02,885
-We're all sick. We live,
therefore, we're sick!

794
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,679
Life is a disease!

795
01:31:06,766 --> 01:31:11,256
We're all murderers. You and him.

796
01:31:11,357 --> 01:31:14,179
And your sister and your father.

797
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:31,036
See...

798
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:51,248
You want to...

799
01:31:53,626 --> 01:31:57,420
We want to... -do
this properly.

800
01:31:59,953 --> 01:32:03,529
We clean him up and dress him.

801
01:32:05,652 --> 01:32:10,185
And we'll  put him in a boat like a
Viking noble, by the book.

802
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:17,235
We'll find two
trucks, and load them up

803
01:32:17,336 --> 01:32:19,929
everything  we need and
we'll drive to the desert.

804
01:32:34,135 --> 01:32:38,000
-It is possible that no
one theory is incorrect.

805
01:32:40,099 --> 01:32:42,407
And maybe they all are.

806
01:32:44,330 --> 01:32:51,048
Perhaps it was not just one event and the
end never came from a single source.

807
01:32:51,263 --> 01:32:56,068
but a combination of factors,
some related and some not.

808
01:32:58,401 --> 01:33:02,395
Something damaged the fragile balance
of the dinosaur ecosystem.

809
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,767
Maybe the dinosaurs themselves.

810
01:33:07,408 --> 01:33:11,718
Maybe small rodents. In any case,

811
01:33:12,171 --> 01:33:18,942
just then when they were most vulnerable,
a large meteor struck Earth.

812
01:33:19,298 --> 01:33:24,192
causing a chain of earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions throughout the world.

813
01:33:32,396 --> 01:33:36,628
-A Meteor, eruptions,
earthquakes, imbalance.

814
01:33:40,204 --> 01:33:43,501
Each of these itself
was not enough.

815
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:50,240
But together, they caused
everything to collapse.

816
01:35:32,288 --> 01:35:36,678
And some say it was
all caused by a virus.

817
01:35:38,874 --> 01:35:44,008
The truth is this sounds much more logical.

818
01:39:34,426 --> 01:39:37,485
The end
