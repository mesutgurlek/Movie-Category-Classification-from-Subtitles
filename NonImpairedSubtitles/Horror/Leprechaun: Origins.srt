one, would you?

160
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,123
That's the spirit.

161
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,159
(SIGHS)

162
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,695
So we saw these stones on
the outside of the village,

163
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,298
and I don't know too much
about Celtic symbols...

164
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,299
All right, bullshit.

165
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,135
What?

166
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:39,505
But do you know by chance what
the symbols on the stones mean?

167
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,573
I've got no idea, darlin'.

168
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,575
Them stones have been
there for centuries,

169
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,678
long before our village was built.

170
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,380
But I tell you, about 15
years ago we discovered gold

171
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,182
in an old Celtic cave.

172
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:54,651
Turned it into a mine.
Stones were there, too.

173
00:15:55,587 --> 00:16:00,924
But eventually the cave collapsed.

174
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,929
Well, things ain't been the
same round here ever since.

175
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,372
Times, they can't be that tough.

176
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:20,045
Ah, this? A guest gave that to me.

177
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:24,547
Oh. It's a Rolex.

178
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,485
It's a pretty nice gift.

179
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:31,855
Well, I guess he appreciated
my hospitality.

180
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,896
(SINGING)

181
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,833
Da, you're making my ears bleed.

182
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,742
It's not that bad.
It's pretty nice.

183
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,581
It's kind of run down
though, but whatever!

184
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,649
That's not where you're staying.

185
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,717
That's where we lived
before the mine closed.

186
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,399
HAMISH: Well, there it is.

187
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,869
The trail is right down there.

188
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,481
You sure it's safe?
It's falling down a little.

189

Ah, no. She's solid. On the inside.

190
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,423
Just needs a lick of paint,
that's all. Good as new.

191
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:51,303
We have to guard against break-ins
when the place isn't being used.

192
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,506
You let a lot of people stay here?

193
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,308
You said The Stones of the Gods

194
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,975
was the village's best kept secret.

195
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,415
Yeah. Well, that's why the
cabin don't get much use.

Nah, it was too fast.

Sorry about all that.

205

What was that all about?

207
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,504
Well, there's a lot of wild
boars round these parts.

208
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,807
They can get pretty
nasty. Anyway...

209

Let's get you settled.

Can I give you some
money for those beers?

Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

Oh, good. Because I
didn't bring my Rolex.

about me coming out your way?

you'd have to give us a helpin' hand

Yeah, well...

Maybe if you all hadn't
have been so greedy,

and taken all that

increase our offerin',

Oh, my God, this is the symbol that
was on the stone outside of town.

00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,655

Come on! Leprechaun?

395
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:03,338
I'm just telling you what it says.

396
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:11,246
Whatever it is, you think that's
what they dug up in that mine?

397
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:15,453
It wasn't a mine
originally, it was a cave.

398
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:18,689
But the people in the village took the
gold, that's what Hamish said to us.

399
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,125
Okay, now we're
talking pots of gold?

when you take its gold.

Until the debt has been repaid.

00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,751
So they put us in this cabin
they locked us in there

406
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:51,219
to sacrifice us to a leprechaun?

407

it is. How do we get out of here?

are like a boundary,

411
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,942
like an ancient warning
sign or something.

412
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,645

past a certain distance from its cave...

413
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,581
So?

414
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,451
So, if we make it to the stones...

415
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:23,487
Then what, the leprechaun won't
go past the stones, Sophie?

416
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,623
Really?

417
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:30,025
No, that makes sense. That's why the guy
who dropped us off didn't go past them.

418
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,797

that means it hasn't fed!
