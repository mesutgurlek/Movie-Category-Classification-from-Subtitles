1
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:42,755
Are you sure this is all right,
Mr. Fujiwara?

2
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:45,864
The boss said so, didn't he?

3
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:51,297
He doesn't need a bodyguard
in this apartment anyway.

4
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:55,407
But couldn't we at least stand in
the hall and guard the boss?

5
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,669
Guard the boss when he's fucking a girl?

6
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:00,575
I didn't mean that.

7
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,241
You're a hitman.

8
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:07,318
Why don't you shut the fuck up
till you're needed?

9
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,426
Hello.

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,561
Is that you, Takeshi?

11
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,603
You are coming home, aren't you?

12
00:01:25,872 --> 00:01:29,000
You won't go away, will you?

13
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:30,539
I won't go away, Takeshi.

14
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,041
I'm working now.

15
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:33,270
I'll call you back soon.

16
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:34,811
Dad. Dad...

17
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,656
Tadanobu Asano

18
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:50,295
Hideo Yamamoto

19
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:54,595
Takashi Miike

20
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:02,968
No!

21
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,976
No...No!

22
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:18,287
No! Stop..!

23
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:19,757
How does that feel?

24
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:45,907
Who?

25
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,051
Who is it?

26
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,953
Ichi the Killer

27
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:26,118
Hi, Miyu Miyu? It's me, Long.

28
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:29,425
Inoue, stop it.

29
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:32,488
I just thought if anything happened
I could blow some fucker away.

30
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:34,032
Ichi's taking care of everything tonight.

31
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:35,667
All we do lately is go in

32
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,828
after everything's finished and mop up.

33
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:40,962
I got it!

34
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,133
I told you to stop!

35
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,020
What are you doing?

36
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,284
If I can't shoot up,
you can't talk on the damn phone.

37
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,154
They're not the same thing.

38
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,620
Give it back!

39
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,118
Let's go.

40
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,831
Let's get started.

41
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,908
What the hell's going on here?

42
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:18,555
You were the boss' bodyguard last night!

43
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:20,392
Kaneko was, too.

44
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,501
Don't put the blame on others!

45
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:26,367
Sorry. I'm sorry.

46
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,573
Do you have any idea?

47
00:07:44,484 --> 00:07:45,508
Don't you have a girlfriend?

48
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:48,045
No, I don't. It gets lonely, you know.

49
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,383
Why don't you get a pet?

50
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,283
I used to have one. An alligator.

51
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:54,924
But they're hard to take care of
once they get big.

52
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,561
I flushed him down the toilet
before that happened.

53
00:07:57,263 --> 00:08:02,599
I remember I had a dog once
in elementary school.

54
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:04,227
What kind?

55
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:08,195
A mongrel. He was so cute!

56
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:11,369
But that old guy next door,

57
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:12,772
he had a German shepherd.

58
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:14,843
He was always making fun of my dog.

59
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:16,538
Damn it

60
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:22,812
So I started praying that something
awful would happen to him.

61
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:26,347
Welcome.

62
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:27,322
Is Karen here?

63
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:28,822
She's over there, please follow me.

64
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,427
And something did.

65
00:08:30,496 --> 00:08:31,360
What?

66
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:35,893
His dog died.

67
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:40,029
Oh my God! Really?

68
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,375
Well, I killed his dog.

69
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:48,539
I strangled it with a skipping rope.

70
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:52,178
Here, have another.

71
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:54,349
Kakihara

72
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:55,676
Did you hear?

73
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:58,149
The boss disappeared.

74
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:02,895
Oh yes, I've heard, he took the money

75
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:06,031
and went off with some fucking
17 year old girl.

76
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:09,028
If he was going to run off with anyone,
it would've been you.

77
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:12,265
One of the other gangs took him.
The money, too.

78
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:14,100
You mean he's killed already...

79
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,040
What are you going to do then?

80
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:20,406
You've given your whole life to him.

81
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:23,480
He's not dead. I'm going to find him.

82
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,182
Yes, Yes, you'll find him.

83
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,956
But I think he's already
six feet under by now.

84
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:32,189
Don't make me mad, Karen.

85
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:33,484
He's alive.

86
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:35,820
He's alive. I'm 120%%% sure of that.

87
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,520
He's waiting for me to come and find him.

88
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:41,059
Yeah, but...

89
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,267
You are the boss's woman.

90
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,769
What the hell are you talking about?

91
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:48,773
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,373
Today's my birthday.

93
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:54,274
Birthday? Is it your birthday?

94
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,778
OK. I'll give you this.

95
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,477
I told you to stop it!

96
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:03,518
Stop it, idiot.

97
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,089
They were kicked out from the syndicate

98
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:11,524
Where else can they make
a living but in Shinjuku?

99
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:14,691
They do all the dirtiest,

100
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:18,370
murder, arson, smuggling & rape.

101
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:21,039
everything.

102
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:32,543
Mr. Kakihara, of the Anjo gang.

103
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:33,945
How have you been?

104
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:35,484
So you're back in Shinjuku, huh?

105
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:39,486
There's nowhere else
we can make a living.

106
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:41,689
Did you hear what happened
over at your place?

107
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:44,092
A little bit.

108
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,062
If you hear anything, let me know.

109
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:47,358
I'll pay well for it.

110
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,959
All right.

111
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:30,706
Do it quick. Die.

112
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:33,878
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:39,180
I can't hear you!

114
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,388
Hurry up and die.

115
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,585
I'm sorry.

116
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,263
No use apologising.

117
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,825
Stop crying!

118
00:11:57,436 --> 00:12:00,837
You can apologize all you want.
It's not going to cut any ice with me.

119
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:10,648
You stupid son of a bitch!

120
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,983
I don't want to hear that
you haven't found him yet.

121
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:15,785
Give it to me.

122
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:19,222
I want you to turn Shinjuku upside-down

123
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,791
and inside-out until you find the boss!

124
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:25,088
Don't come back here till you do!

125
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:40,476
It doesn't look too good, does it?

126
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:48,077
That doesn't mean I don't think
there's no hope of course...

127
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:51,015
I'll find him! Please leave it to me!

128
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:54,819
I'll take it.

129
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:07,769
It's nothing more than hearsay.

130
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:09,634
I don't know how true it is.

131
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:12,942
The Funakis are Sanko Syndicate

132
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:15,079
members, just like us.

133
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:17,916
And they've got their office
right here in this building.

134
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:21,977
All the better to watch
what you're doing,

135
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:25,157
to see where the boss is going.

136
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:27,053
Why would they do it?

137
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:30,091
Well, Mr. Kakihara, three years ago
you cut Mr. Suzuki of

138
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:33,629
the Funaki Family out of
a porno video sales racket.

139
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:37,962
Rumour has it that
he hasn't forgotten that.

140
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,363
So Suzuki's behind all this?

141
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:45,401
It's just rumour.

142
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:50,505
But I am sure that Suzuki makes
no secret of the fact

143
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:52,946
that he doesn't think much of you.

144
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:54,783
He's spread some pretty ridiculous
stories...even that you

145
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:57,422
and Mr. Anjo were more than
just a gang boss and his capo.

146
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,493
What the hell are you talking about?

147
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:04,796
Takayama, bring him here.

148
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:07,666
Bring who here?

149
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,868
Suzuki.

150
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:13,627
But...

151
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,332
Are you afraid of him?

152
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,632
That's not the problem.

153
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:19,606
We don't have any proof.

154
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:22,207
Proof? When did you start
worrying about proof?

155
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:24,542
I can't believe I'm hearing this
from Takayama.

156
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,742
If we're wrong we'll give the Funakis
the old guy's dead body.

157
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,982
Get going, Takayama!

158
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:35,757
I got it.

159
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:52,166
Jijii, just go and buy some shrimps.

160
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:53,676
Shrimps?

161
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:04,179
Ouch!

162
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:16,360
Kakihara? Tempura?

163
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,539
What the hell?

164
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,486
Kakihara! What the fuck is this?

165
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:40,492
You look great, Mr. Suzuki!

166
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:01,645
Where's the boss?

167
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:07,181
The boss? You mean Anjo?

168
00:16:09,688 --> 00:16:13,624
He and that girl took off with
your money, didn't he?

169
00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:16,995
What did you say?

170
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:26,035
Wait! Stop, damn it! You're doing this
because you think I took Boss Anjo?

171
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:30,404
I know that you're pissed off
because I cut you out of that video deal.

172
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:34,913
And that you've been going around
bad-mouthing me.

173
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:36,605
No, I haven't!

174
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:39,943
Yes, you have...hasn't he, old man?

175
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:41,584
Who the fuck are you?

176
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:45,985
So, Mr. Suzuki, then you aren't
dubbing videos behind his back?

177
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:50,284
So you are doing stuff behind my back...

178
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:52,224
OK, it's true about the videos,

179
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:54,092
I'll admit that.

180
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,291
But I don't know anything
about your boss.

181
00:16:56,469 --> 00:16:58,300
You've got to believe me!

182
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:00,805
Please! Believe me.

183
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:07,576
I'll ask you again. Where's the boss?

184
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,315
I don't know! I haven't got any idea!

185
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:18,449
Boss, that's too...

186
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:29,892
I wonder how the old man ever managed
to get a camera and a mike in there.

187
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:31,669
I put it there.

188
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:34,371
You did?

189
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:41,138
Jijii asked me to before
I was kicked out of Anjo Group.

190
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:44,174
You knew Kakihara then?

191
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,808
He wouldn't recognize me.

192
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:48,883
I got my face changed after
they kicked me out.

193
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,181
Plastic surgery?

194
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,228
Why did you change it to this?

195
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,298
Shut up!

196
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:05,795
Well, I have to make a call.

197
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:09,464
Give me a break, damn it!

198
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:16,480
What the hell?

199
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:22,747
Is it ...Suzuki?

200
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:29,083
Kakihara! What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

201
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:34,061
This? Just a little torture.

202
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,630
What did Suzuki do?

203
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:41,466
Stop it!

204
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:43,798
Take that off, Mr. Kaneko.

205
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,705
Who the hell are you?

206
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,739
Perhaps I might first ask what you're
doing here, Mr. Funaki.

207
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:55,215
We got a phone call saying that Suzuki
was in big trouble with the Anjo gang.

208
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:00,587
He thinks I took Boss Anjo.

209
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,322
Suzuki wouldn't do anything that stupid!

210
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:05,793
Let him go.

211
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:07,993
You wouldn't happen to be mixed up
in this, would you?

212
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:09,225
What?

213
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:16,500
Someone told us that Suzuki has
taken the boss.

214
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,108
Who?

215
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:19,542
This old man here.

216
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:26,547
Who came to you with the information?

217
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,744
The old man here...

218
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:30,854
So who?

219
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:36,656
You! Go and find him!

220
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,871
Welcome.

221
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,177
So you came back...

222
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:26,369
You're the only one who's happy
to see a girl all marked up like this.

223
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:51,293
How...

224
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:55,103
How what?

225
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,832
How did he beat you up yesterday?

226
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:00,369
What?

227
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:03,337
Did it hurt?

228
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,614
I thought I was going to die!

229
00:21:13,325 --> 00:21:16,658
The bastard...l wish he'd die!

230
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:20,524
"Die"...

231
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,864
Yeah! I wish he'd die!

232
00:21:32,344 --> 00:21:37,281
Shall I do that for you?

233
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:40,214
Huh?

234
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:45,612
Ten million yen?

235
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:47,883
No, you dumb ass! A hundred million yen!

236
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,319
That's appropriate.

237
00:21:53,632 --> 00:21:55,623
We don't have that kind of
money at the moment.

238
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:59,562
OK, then give me the video business
and we'll call it quits.

239
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:02,907
All of our money disappeared
with the boss.

240
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:06,009
If you take the videos,
we're out of business.

241
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:09,942
So you expect to pull a damn fool stunt
like that and get off not paying a thing?

242
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:14,385
Kick this asshole out of the
syndicate, please.

243
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:16,043
It's much easier.

244
00:22:16,855 --> 00:22:18,584
You may be right.

245
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:25,323
I'll make a sincere apology.

246
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,943
It's not the matter of one or
two of your fingers.

247
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,972
I have a taste for sweet things.

248
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:44,204
So what?

249
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,841
In apology, I'll cut out the part of me
that tastes those things.

250
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:49,678
What do you mean?

251
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:18,833
Ka-en?...OK...I'm on my way.

252
00:24:21,246 --> 00:24:25,046
I'm going to look for the boss.

253
00:24:34,726 --> 00:24:35,920
Boss.

254
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:48,432
Why so late?

255
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:52,132
I had to stop at the hospital.

256
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:53,635
The hospital?

257
00:24:58,283 --> 00:25:00,376
Disgusting

258
00:25:00,652 --> 00:25:02,415
Look, it's amazing.

259
00:25:02,487 --> 00:25:03,818
What do you mean?

260
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:06,684
It's alright. The human body
regenerates itself.

261
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:10,191
I'm OK now. See?

262
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:14,428
OK, anyway listen,
remember when you met jijii

263
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:15,966
and his gang at the club? OK.

264
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:18,125
And one of this guy was popping veins,

265
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:19,998
got one of the girls to check it out

266
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:21,672
and she said it's heroin.

267
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:27,435
and here, I found this
really fancy place

268
00:25:27,512 --> 00:25:30,208
for heroin. come up, come up.

269
00:25:57,242 --> 00:25:58,368
Who is it?

270
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:01,511
I'm Karen from "Hirando"

271
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,944
Good morning!

272
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:12,415
Have you heard from him?

273
00:26:13,692 --> 00:26:16,593
What do I owe you that I'd tell you
something like that?

274
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:20,060
If you're not here to score,
then fuck off.

275
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:25,032
When you ask something,
you should be more polite.

276
00:26:25,237 --> 00:26:27,205
What kind of person are you?

277
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:31,669
This guy is Kakihara, the pierced guy,
of Anjo Group.

278
00:26:31,743 --> 00:26:32,641
I'm coming in.

279
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:36,704
Hey, who said you can come in?

280
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:43,850
I don't know about that, but I don't
associate with these bad-mannered guys.

281
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:48,450
The boss is going to die.

282
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:52,926
Huh? What's this guy talking about?

283
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:55,861
If I don't hurry, the boss dies!

284
00:26:56,501 --> 00:27:00,096
I told you, if you're not here to score,
you're in the way,

285
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:02,136
so get the hell out of here. Scram!

286
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,203
What happens if he dies?!

287
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:15,113
Jijii! Come back quickly
and give me a hit!

288
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:32,967
He was already in there when we got here.

289
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:37,471
I tied him up just in case
he tried to escape.

290
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:44,876
Where's the old man?

291
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:52,253
What's this?

292
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:00,423
That's our office!

293
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,924
I found this.

294
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:20,281
Boss Anjo...

295
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:27,149
So it was you who did it!

296
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:31,620
Where's the boss?

297
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:37,995
I'll tell you...just get me a hit first.

298
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:41,505
Where's the boss?! Where is he?

299
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:46,068
Anjo...has gone underground.

300
00:28:49,214 --> 00:28:52,308
If you aren't going to give me a hit,
then hurry up and kill me,

301
00:28:52,384 --> 00:28:53,851
"Older Brother"!

302
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:00,484
Who are you?

303
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:03,554
I know how you work.

304
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:08,293
If you're going to kill me anyway,
at least do it quick, "Older Brother".

305
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:12,660
Kano?

306
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:15,270
That's me.

307
00:29:15,974 --> 00:29:19,910
Kano? You're Kano?!

308
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,213
But your face is different!

309
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,515
So you did this?

310
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:34,348
It was Ichi who did it.

311
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:36,591
Who's this "Ichi"?

312
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:39,728
All I did was go in and clean up
when he'd finished.

313
00:29:40,565 --> 00:29:44,262
But Ichi's next target is you,
"Older Brother".

314
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:50,136
You were in love with Anjo, weren't you!

315
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:55,544
But it wasn't because you were queer
or you admired him or anything.

316
00:29:56,348 --> 00:30:02,344
It was because you loved the pain you
felt when he beat you up!

317
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:06,018
That's why you're looking for
him so hard, isn't it!

318
00:30:06,258 --> 00:30:09,921
So he can hurt you again!

319
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:33,849
I'm not going to forget
what you did to me!

320
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:45,862
Kakihara, I'll never forgive you!

321
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:51,958
I'm going to blow that fucker away!

322
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:11,114
What did you do with the girl?

323
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:14,648
He asked where girl with Anjo is.

324
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,761
Girl?

325
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:24,159
Man want us find girl you take with Anjo.

326
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:26,495
You give back now.

327
00:31:27,272 --> 00:31:29,797
Wait a minute!

328
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:33,743
You guys are making a mistake!

329
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,412
We'll kill you!

330
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:38,912
You no say, we kill whole family.

331
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:46,249
Will you listen to me, damn it!

332
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:48,087
It wasn't me!

333
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:50,557
I didn't have anything to do with it!

334
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:52,127
Believe me, please!

335
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,969
Ask somebody else, please.

336
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:14,583
We're running out of time.

337
00:32:14,753 --> 00:32:15,981
Time's up.

338
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:18,484
What do you mean "Time's up"?

339
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:23,027
We cut you here. It won't hurt much.

340
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:28,724
No! Please! Help!

341
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:02,930
Someone says he saw a man with a torn-up
mouth attack Anjo's office?

342
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:09,202
That's Kakihara! I knew it!

343
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:16,438
I can't breathe with this mask.

344
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:20,240
...Should have made it nicer.

345
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:25,117
It gets fogged and I can't see
anything when I breathe.

346
00:33:25,657 --> 00:33:27,887
Hi, Miyu Miyu, how are you?

347
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:35,056
Telling me you've worked all day
and only made 30,000 Yen?!

348
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:40,170
Stop it! Don't hit me anymore!

349
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,535
Hey, tell me.

350
00:33:49,347 --> 00:33:50,712
You can suck dick and you've got a cunt

351
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:52,713
and you're telling me
this is all you got?!

352
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:03,352
No one wants to look at me
because you keep beating me up!

353
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,358
Don't you talk back to me, bitch!

354
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:12,827
How do you feel, huh?

355
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:46,502
Oh ! Willy is erect

356
00:35:06,991 --> 00:35:08,515
Who the fuck are you?

357
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:12,762
Oh ! Willy is erect

358
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,268
Come in here!

359
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:22,065
What are you doing?

360
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,333
Goddamn peeping tom.

361
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:29,406
What the fuck is this costume?

362
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:31,747
What are you doing?

363
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:34,274
Can't you talk, asshole?

364
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:36,347
I'm sorry.

365
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:38,449
I'm sorry.

366
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:41,589
What's this "I'm sorry" bullshit?
What's the matter with you?

367
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,532
Why are you crying?

368
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,202
No, I'm not.

369
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,774
Yes, you are!

370
00:36:01,512 --> 00:36:02,774
I'm not.

371
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:04,414
You're fucking crying!

372
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:11,145
You ARE crying!

373
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:12,880
No, I'm not!

374
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:25,060
What are you doing?

375
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:34,533
I killed him for you.

376
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,283
I promised I'd kill him for you.

377
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:05,225
...but don't worry...
I'll hit you instead.

378
00:38:17,281 --> 00:38:20,546
You'll do it for me?

379
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:36,729
Thank you!

380
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:37,886
Kakihara, you are expelled
from the Syndicate.

381
00:39:41,232 --> 00:39:47,262
The Syndicate has come to this decision
based on the arrogance of

382
00:39:47,538 --> 00:39:51,907
the actions of you and your men
in the way you have

383
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:56,575
chosen to search for Anjo,
in your lynching of Suzuki,

384
00:39:56,781 --> 00:40:05,655
and in your refusing Funaki's offer.

385
00:40:10,394 --> 00:40:13,488
Have you anything to say?

386
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:18,728
Hey, are you listening?

387
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:20,268
Kakihara!

388
00:40:31,949 --> 00:40:34,213
Is that all you wanted to see me about?

389
00:40:38,022 --> 00:40:40,820
That's all.

390
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:45,620
Well, thanks for everything.

391
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:59,104
I guess he's gone.

392
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:05,943
Hey, Suzuki...you're sure this is
right thing to do?

393
00:41:07,218 --> 00:41:08,845
I don't like how easily he accepted it
and then just walked away.

394
00:41:09,053 --> 00:41:10,850
You don't think he's planning to
take some kind of revenge, do you?

395
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:15,654
I forgot one thing.

396
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:16,852
What's that?

397
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:18,919
I'm taking over the Anjo Group.

398
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:26,968
Ouch... !

399
00:41:28,673 --> 00:41:30,903
So we've been expelled?

400
00:41:31,442 --> 00:41:32,875
That's right.

401
00:41:33,611 --> 00:41:37,377
So every Yakuza in Shinjuku is
now our enemy.

402
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:40,210
Anyone who wants out better say so now.

403
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:45,019
I'm sorry.

404
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:49,818
I'd like to give back the sake cup
I used to pledge allegiance.

405
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:51,353
Oh, you do?

406
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:41,168
They've expelled Kakihara.

407
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:55,914
Where's the money?

408
00:42:56,494 --> 00:42:58,485
I've put half into the account
you told me to.

409
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:01,593
Half? You broke your promise.

410
00:43:02,933 --> 00:43:05,561
I'll put the rest in once you succeed.

411
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:08,704
300 million yen is a lot of money.

412
00:43:11,108 --> 00:43:14,168
What if you blow it?

413
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:21,678
Next three, four days, you get everyone
out of the Yakuza mansion.

414
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:25,245
They get in the way. You can do that?

415
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:29,784
Right. I'll get started on it right away.

416
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,194
You be sure you squash them good.

417
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,898
Where are you going?

418
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:16,863
What am I supposed to do?

419
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:20,669
Just wait here. Don't move.

420
00:44:36,393 --> 00:44:37,587
Ichi...

421
00:44:52,243 --> 00:44:53,608
Ichi!

422
00:45:03,654 --> 00:45:08,682
I had a dream... about Miss Tachibana.

423
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:11,693
The girl who tried to help you when
you were being bullied,

424
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:14,729
the girl who ended up getting raped?

425
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:20,462
When they were raping her
she asked me to help.

426
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:27,104
But my legs were shaking so bad
I couldn't move.

427
00:45:29,947 --> 00:45:33,747
I still have dreams about
her calling to me for help.

428
00:45:35,186 --> 00:45:39,452
You wanted to save her so much?

429
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:47,320
I wanted to rape her.

430
00:45:47,531 --> 00:45:50,193
You wanted to save her, didn't you?

431
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:56,872
She wanted it to be me, that did it.

432
00:45:57,441 --> 00:46:01,070
Ichi! Open your eyes, damn it!

433
00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:04,407
You have been expelled from
the Syndicate, haven't you?

434
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:07,277
If you come, it'll cause trouble...

435
00:46:08,118 --> 00:46:11,645
Who do you think you're talking to?

436
00:46:18,596 --> 00:46:20,928
It hurts.

437
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,991
Mr. Kakihara, stop it, please.

438
00:46:34,245 --> 00:46:37,180
It'll be torn off!

439
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:43,377
Karen, Karen!

440
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:47,219
Karen, do something, will you?

441
00:46:49,093 --> 00:46:50,355
Can I do it, too?

442
00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:21,988
Take your shoes off.

443
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:23,653
Hurry up!

444
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:30,123
Go and get it.

445
00:47:31,502 --> 00:47:32,935
Come on, hurry!

446
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:37,297
Hey, give it back to me.

447
00:47:37,374 --> 00:47:38,568
What?

448
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,508
Asshole.

449
00:47:42,813 --> 00:47:49,241
Your dad had to quit the police
because he lost his pistol.

450
00:47:49,787 --> 00:47:51,687
What an idiot!

451
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:53,550
They're both idiots, him and his dad!

452
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:56,089
They use tax money to make those guns,
don't they?

453
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:58,654
Yeah! Give us our money back, asshole!

454
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:17,705
Come on, hurry and fetch it.

455
00:48:20,117 --> 00:48:23,450
Hey! Hurry up!

456
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:30,750
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

457
00:48:42,106 --> 00:48:43,630
Hey!

458
00:48:46,543 --> 00:48:50,445
Quit staring! Fuck off, you jerk!

459
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:17,195
More?

460
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:19,208
You're my woman now, aren't you?

461
00:49:19,276 --> 00:49:21,972
Do it like you did before, then.

462
00:49:22,913 --> 00:49:24,039
Does it hurt?

463
00:49:24,314 --> 00:49:25,508
Keep going.

464
00:49:31,822 --> 00:49:34,188
Listen, when you're giving
pain to someone,

465
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:38,088
don't think about the pain that
person is feeling.

466
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,779
Do it like you want to kill me.

467
00:50:07,024 --> 00:50:09,151
The boss was much better than you.

468
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:29,338
That's enough,

469
00:50:33,817 --> 00:50:35,375
You're not the one.

470
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:40,952
Hey, come back!

471
00:50:54,738 --> 00:50:56,535
Turn on the TV, Ichi.

472
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:01,573
The ones you kill are those guys.

473
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:03,905
Get in fast and finish them off.

474
00:51:04,615 --> 00:51:05,604
I can't

475
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:07,679
Sure you can!

476
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:11,409
They're bullies, all of them. They work
for the man you killed before.

477
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:14,716
They won't be any problem for you.
Just go in there and go crazy.

478
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,289
No way. There's too many of them.

479
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:21,021
Come on! You want revenge, don't you?

480
00:51:21,798 --> 00:51:24,961
Weren't you going to
kill all the bullies?

481
00:51:26,737 --> 00:51:28,796
Those men extort money from poor people.

482
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:31,707
They beat up the weak

483
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:34,604
and strut around like
they're something special.

484
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:39,706
You've got to take revenge!

485
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,542
See that guy with the shaved head?

486
00:51:41,885 --> 00:51:45,844
Doesn't he look like Imamura
who bullied you in middle school?

487
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:52,923
And isn't the guy beside him
a dead ringer for Tokito,

488
00:51:53,096 --> 00:51:55,894
the boy who scribbled all over
your textbooks?

489
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:59,133
Well, Ichi?

490
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:05,166
He does look like him.

491
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:51,821
Did you take revenge?

492
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:54,086
Killing's not nice.

493
00:52:55,525 --> 00:52:59,222
I told you not to worry about that.
They're all just a bunch of bullies.

494
00:53:01,865 --> 00:53:05,801
The people I just killed...
they weren't the ones who bullied me.

495
00:53:07,871 --> 00:53:10,499
They're bad people.
Of course they should die.

496
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:13,607
How did it feel today?

497
00:53:15,312 --> 00:53:17,644
I don't want to kill any more.

498
00:53:18,882 --> 00:53:20,782
Don't be stupid!

499
00:53:21,518 --> 00:53:24,578
If you don't kill the bad guys,
who will?

500
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:28,285
I don't want to kill.

501
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,895
You're going to keep on killing them,
aren't you?

502
00:53:33,563 --> 00:53:35,053
I don't want to.

503
00:53:35,999 --> 00:53:38,524
Kill the bad guys.

504
00:53:39,236 --> 00:53:40,897
Kill.

505
00:54:20,877 --> 00:54:24,973
Thank you for saving me.

506
00:54:29,786 --> 00:54:31,413
What's wrong with you?

507
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:32,882
Are you all right?

508
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:39,659
What's your name?

509
00:54:42,399 --> 00:54:43,593
Ichi.

510
00:54:46,269 --> 00:54:48,169
We're friends, aren't we?

511
00:55:30,947 --> 00:55:32,574
Fuck!

512
00:55:37,988 --> 00:55:40,684
What is this mess?

513
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:46,258
Boss... What's this?

514
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:54,059
So he came after all...
Isn't this something?

515
00:55:54,704 --> 00:55:55,898
I'm scared!

516
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:59,066
Hey, all of you! Don't run away!

517
00:55:59,342 --> 00:56:01,572
Everything's bursting out...

518
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:09,413
Aren't you going to run?

519
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:12,952
I'm sorry, boss. They are all gone.

520
00:56:13,356 --> 00:56:14,550
Don't bother.

521
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:18,890
Takayama, call the
East Shinjuku Police Station.

522
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:21,455
Will you report this to the police?

523
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:25,692
No. I'm going to get them
to give us a hand.

524
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:25,594
Some kids were bullying me and
this really strong guy came along

525
00:57:26,263 --> 00:57:28,288
and kicked their asses!

526
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:33,330
You can do karate and all that stuff,
can't you?

527
00:57:35,705 --> 00:57:37,000
Teach me how.
