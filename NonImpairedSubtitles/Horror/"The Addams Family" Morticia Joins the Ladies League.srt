1
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:13,114
These conventions, they're so exciting!

2
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:16,747
I remember the first time I voted. 1906.

3
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:21,589
Now, Mama, you know
there was no woman suffrage in 1906.

4
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,494
- That didn't stop me.
- You're a real Addams.

5
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:26,425
What's all the noise?

6
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,661
The conventions, Morticia,
the conventions.

7
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:31,203
I do wish they wouldn't shout so.

8
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:33,864
It keeps little Pugsley's octopus awake.

9
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:37,000
The poor thing's getting rings
under his tentacles.

10
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:40,102
And my African strangler, too.

11
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,511
It just loses all desire to strangle anyone.

12
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,055
Thank you, Thing.

13
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:56,622
Dear Thing.
It sets such a good example for us.

14
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,330
Show-off.

15
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,830
- Uncle Fester!
- I'm sorry.

16
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,839
Now, you know I don't like
petty jealousies.

17
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:08,199
Where's Gomez?

18
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,970
He's down in the playroom
hanging pictures.

19
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:14,810
Oh, dear. I do hope he isn't hanging
the picture of Cousin Grisly

20
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,372
facing the firing squad down there.

21
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:19,414
It looks so right in the hall.

22
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:26,987
What are you doing, darling?

23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,927
Just getting the playroom
into the election spirit.

24
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:36,065
Is he running again?

25
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:38,431
No, but I thought I'd bring out
the pictures of the men

26
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:40,369
we Addamses have supported in the past.

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,930
Very appropriate.

28
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:49,545
- We really backed Landon to the hilt.
- Yes. I must say he was a very good loser.

29
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,217
No better than Al Smith here.

30
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:54,349
Or Wendell Willkie.

31
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:57,682
Or Adlai.

32
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,824
Uncle Blight masterminded
their campaigns.

33
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:03,727
Old "Kiss-of-Death" Blight,
they called him.

34
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,360
I never quite knew why.

35
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,266
Grandpa Squint says
it's an old family nickname.

36
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:12,634
Grandpa knew his way
around the political arena, too.

37
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,307
Abe Lincoln begged him for his support.
But there's the man who got it.

38
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:19,709
Stephen Douglas.

39
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:23,609
Darling, with all this natural
political talent,

40
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:25,742
shouldn't you be running for public office?

41
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,311
No, we Addamses prefer
to think of ourselves as king-makers.

42
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:34,155
The man I've decided to throw
my support to, in every way,

43
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,820
is Leonard G. Quimby.

44
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:55,437
- Howdy, neighbor.
- How do you do?

45
00:03:55,515 --> 00:03:57,847
- Well, I see you've picked your man.
- Yes, I have.

46
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,681
Even heard you made
a substantial contribution to his campaign.

47
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,345
It's only money.

48
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:03,680
Good.

49
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,717
- George Bass is my name.
- Addams here.

50
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:12,025
- Is all this yours?
- Well, we go back to the cemetery.

51
00:04:12,866 --> 00:04:14,834
We all do, sometime.

52
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,837
It's nice to see citizens
taking an interest in the election,

53
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:24,137
even if they have backed the wrong man.

54
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,178
Quimby? Why, he's our insurance man.

55
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,215
Got us off the hook when my son,
Pugsley, accidentally blew up the garage.

56
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:33,144
But that's neither here nor there.

57
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,616
You're right.

58
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,385
My man promises to modernize the city,

59
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:42,222
put in more streetlights,
drain the swamps.

60
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,221
- Drain the swamps?
- That and more.

61
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,397
Well, maybe I have been a little hasty.

62
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:53,003
- Do you have a picture of your man?
- Do I have a picture of my...

63
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,974
There he is, the voice of progress.

64
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:59,239
That's Sam L. Hilliard.
Why, he's an old friend.

65
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:02,078
I hope the L stands for Lucifer.

66
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:06,577
- It does, it does.
- Good. He's a fine man.

67
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:10,488
Last time he was around here,
he went away with the shakes.

68
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,047
I wonder why.

69
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:16,026
Overworked. Then you'll vote for him?

70
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:18,826
We'll do better than that.
We'll go out and campaign for him.

71
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:22,197
Wonderful! Wait till I tell Mr. Hilliard.

72
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:24,496
Here.

73
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,834
Welcome, fellow campaigner.

74
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,269
Sorry, Quimby.

75
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:38,444
You can sprinkle later, Tish.
Take a look at this.

76
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,878
- I could have sworn he was bald.
- My dear. That's another man.

77
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:47,085
That's our old friend from
the School Board, Sam L. Hilliard.

78
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:49,286
I've changed horses in midstream.

79
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:52,388
- That's the Addams way.
- Of course.

80
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,524
The L stands for Lucifer.

81
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:57,601
Very appropriate for a politician.

82
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,130
But, darling, look at his platform.

83
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:04,870
"Modernize the city,
put in more streetlights,

84
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:08,607
"drain the swamps!"
Drain our lovely swamps?

85
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:14,119
- The man's an extremist.
<i>- Querida mía,</i> our swamps are safe.

86
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:16,816
Mr. Hilliard won't do any
of those terrible things.

87
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:20,290
Don't you realize politicians
always make extravagant promises?

88
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:23,089
Fortunately
I can see through their little games.

89
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:25,290
Darling, you're so clever.

90
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:29,801
I'm sure Mr. Hilliard will be very happy
we've decided to join his campaign.

91
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,304
I can just see his face.

92
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:36,637
No, no, no.
I want no part of that Addams family.

93
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:39,735
But they're good
for a nice campaign contribution.

94
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:40,973
You get it.

95
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:44,608
Look, the public likes personal contact
with the candidate,

96
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,016
you know, the old handshake,
the baby kissing.

97
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,918
You've got to go over
and welcome them officially.

98
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,456
I'd rather lose.

99
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:56,325
You may, if you don't lay your hands
on some more campaign funds.

100
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,958
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

101
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,825
It's still not worth it.

102
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:26,952
Community pride,
public service, civic duty.

103
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,587
I wonder if we're doing the right thing.

104
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,130
Don't you want
to save our lovely swamps?

105
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:34,800
That is a good cause.

106
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,767
- Besides, elections are fun.
- We should vote more often.

107
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,800
How's this one?

108
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,712
That's nice, Uncle Fester,
and very original, too.

109
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:51,846
- Yours is nice too, my dear.
- Thank you, darling.

110
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:56,511
- You left the R out of "friend."
- I thought it looked better that way.

111
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,890
By Jove, it does.

112
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,561
I wonder why Mr. Hilliard hasn't called
to thank us for joining his campaign.

113
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,893
Busy, no doubt. That reminds me.

114
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:09,696
I think I'll send Lurch over and
invite Hilliard to a little strategy meeting.

115
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,968
Our candidate. Welcome.

116
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,032
Mr. Hilliard, how nice of you to join us.

117
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:27,414
We've been up nights just planning
and planning for you.

118
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,078
What are you planning?

119
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,885
Show him the wonderful sign
you painted for him.

120
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,923
"Everybody's fiend?"

121
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,925
I didn't think you'd notice.

122
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,161
Sit down, Mr. Hilliard, I'll have Lurch
serve some refreshments.

123
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,599
You rang?

124
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:51,108
- Name it, Mr. Hilliard. Coffee, tea?
- Brew?

125
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:53,937
Oh, no, thank you.

126
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,282
Won't you sit down, Mr. Hilliard?

127
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:05,180
Mrs. Addams and I would like to discuss
some campaign strategy with you.

128
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:08,352
Look, I just remembered
a speaking engagement.

129
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:17,027
Yes, thank you.

130
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:24,410
Now then, what's the key
to every successful political campaign?

131
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,875
- Money.
- Exactly.

132
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:31,042
- Gomez is such a brilliant strategist.
- She really knows me.

133
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:37,716
Sure, sure. Well, why don't you just
make out a check for, say, $5,000?

134
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,619
- A drop in the bucket.
- $10,000?

135
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,627
- $20,000 or nothing.
- $20,000?

136
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:43,787
We insist.

137
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,990
- Well, if you put it that way.
- We do.

138
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:49,432
But more important than money
is how it's going to be spent.

139
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,104
We have some wonderful ideas.

140
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:55,334
- Like that sign?
- Better.

141
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,843
Well, why don't you just make out a check
and leave the campaigning to us.

142
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,414
But these are sure-fire strategies.

143
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:05,940
Number one: We wanna get our butler,
Lurch, on television.

144
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:09,319
We feel he'll appeal to the women's vote.

145
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,821
Camera moves in. It's a close-up of Lurch.

146
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:19,289
Lurch expresses himself
on the candidacy of Sam L. Hilliard.

147
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:28,266
Animal magnetism. You can't top that.

148
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:32,868
Tell you what? Make it $10,000.

149
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,844
Our children can appeal
to the junior voters.

150
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,645
Junior voters? Kids don't vote.

151
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,180
By George, you're right.

152
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,521
How about $5,000?

153
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:46,654
Gomez, darling, we'll still have
to let the children go on television.

154
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,353
They'll be so disappointed.

155
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:50,361
Besides, they wrote
such brilliant speeches.

156
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:51,953
$2,500.

157
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,731
You'll forget all about money
when you hear the song

158
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:58,531
that Uncle Fester wrote for you.
A campaign song.

159
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,364
- $1,000.
- Uncle Fester!

160
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:10,412
Uncle Fester, sing your campaign song
for Mr. Hilliard.

161
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,341
- This will kill you.
- Oh, no.

162
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:16,246
You...

163
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:19,223
To the harpsichord, Lurch,
we're gonna do the song.

164
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:28,500
It's the kind of song
that gets you right here.

165
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:30,828
$500.

166
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:11,202
Well, what do you think?

167
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:14,075
I think we've got more money
than we need.

168
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:17,912
Uncle Fester can do the song
with special effects, too. He lights up.

169
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:19,281
Lights up?

170
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:30,592
Don't worry about the flickering.
We'll have him recharged.

171
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,600
- I better go.
- You haven't seen anything yet.

172
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,161
- Please, I'll give you a little money.
- Nonsense.

173
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,935
- I'm really unworthy of your support.
- Twaddle.

174
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm a grafter.

175
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,906
You mean all your campaign promises
are phony?

176
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:50,647
- As a $3 bill.
- I got a lot of $3 bills.

177
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:55,783
I'm not going to do anything
about the streetlights.

178
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,982
- The streets stay dark and gloomy.
- Wonderful.

179
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,785
And the bogs and marshes,
I'm gonna make them even boggier.

180
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:03,953
Capital!

181
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:06,793
I knew you'd appreciate
my leveling with you.

182
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,127
We do! We do, Mr. Hilliard.

183
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,668
I almost forgot the most important thing.
Our party mascot!

184
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,965
- We don't need a party mascot.
- Yes, we do.

185
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:15,472
The Democrats have their donkey,
the Republicans have their elephant.

186
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,805
- Guess what we have?
- I couldn't begin to.

187
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,140
We have Kitty cat.

188
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:23,446
Kitty. Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.

189
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,422
Don't frighten the poor dear.

190
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:36,985
I'll send you a letter of apology
first thing in the morning.

191
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,826
- Forgot your hat.
- Keep it!

192
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:46,467
Well, it looks like
we backed the right man.

193
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,700
No question about it.
I'm just sorry about one thing.

194
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:51,572
- What's that, dear?
- I forgot to register.

195
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:03,020
"In the course of human events,

196
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,183
"there are many moments
that try men's souls.

197
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:12,696
"There are moments
of crisis, of tragedy, turmoil,

198
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,590
"doubt. There are even moments..."

199
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:23,075
I've put Kitty to sleep.

200
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:27,243
What does it matter, darling?
He doesn't vote, anyway.

201
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,742
No, no, it's my speech.

202
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,409
Let's go through it. Start at the beginning.

203
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,618
- "My friends..."
- Hold it. That'll never go, dear.

204
00:14:38,024 --> 00:14:41,084
- Get right to the issues.
- You're right.

205
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:45,860
"One of the major issues
of the day is peace."

206
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:48,628
Well, that's true, dear.
But everybody wants peace.

207
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,464
- Even Mr. Quimby.
- You're right.

208
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,535
"And now, to the matter of taxes.

209
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:58,407
"Shall we have high taxes?
Or shall we have low taxes?"

210
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,611
- Isn't that a dangerous position?
- You're right.

211
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:05,208
"Which brings us to the question
of education..."

212
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:08,412
- Nope, much too controversial.
- You're right.

213
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,982
"Also the question of social welfare?"

214
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:23,535
"Now we come to the biggest,
the most burning issue of the day,

215
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:26,763
"the question of..."

216
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,611
- You make that out?
- "Question of swamps."

217
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,976
Oh, yes.

218
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,011
"As to the matter of swamps..."

219
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:44,055
Darling, the less said about that
the better.

220
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,226
Very clever, <i>querida,</i> very clever.

221
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,523
- "I thank you."
- Well...

222
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:55,794
I know what you're going to say.

223
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:58,200
After such an enlightening
and courageous speech,

224
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,966
I shouldn't thank them,
they should thank me.

225
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,803
I agree completely.

226
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,913
Now, you all know
what you're supposed to do?

227
00:16:18,024 --> 00:16:20,151
Lurch, you hit
the swanky Oak Knoll section.

228
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:21,420
Roger.

229
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:25,224
- Mama?
- I get off in the business district.

230
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:29,097
You parade up and down the street with
your placard and you blow your bugle.

231
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,169
Uncle Fester, is your assignment clear?

232
00:16:31,237 --> 00:16:35,003
I sing, light up and pass out $3 bills.

233
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:38,407
Remember, the secret word is "dignity."

234
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:42,040
All right, Lurch, blast off.

235
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:51,252
Don't they make a fine-Iooking group?

236
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:53,450
Mr. Hilliard is as good as elected.

237
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:59,724
Oak Knoll is in the bag, huh?
Great, keep in touch.

238
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,393
Well, everything looks good so far.

239
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:04,133
Polls say you're a shoo-in.

240
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,727
I wouldn't be if I hadn't got rid
of that Addams family.

241
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,741
- Please, let's not mention them again.
- You're right.

242
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,504
Now hop on down to the polls
and keep an eye on things.

243
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,736
Right.

244
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:15,576
- Lf anything goes wrong, call me.
- Right.

245
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:30,694
Boss? Bass. You better get over here
to the Fourth Ward.

246
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,661
The Addamses are loose.

247
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,364
<i>As I told you before, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

248
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:39,370
<i>we're speaking to you from the busy</i>
<i>intersection of Broadway and Main.</i>

249
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:43,306
<i>Well, I've seen election campaigns,</i>
<i>but this one beats them all.</i>

250
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:44,602
Looks like we've done it.

251
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:48,113
<i>Our on-the-spot broadcast today</i>
<i>features... Wait a minute.</i>

252
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,808
<i>There's candidate Sam Hilliard,</i>
<i>and he's chasing a campaign runner</i>

253
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,044
<i>down the street with a stick!</i>

254
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:57,781
- Isn't that Uncle Fester?
- Uncle... Yes, he just lit up!

255
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:02,657
<i>I better return you to our studios KBHL.</i>
<i>I'm beginning to see things.</i>

256
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:05,458
<i>Thank you, Mel, and there you see...</i>

257
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,661
Why would Mr. Hilliard
chase Uncle Fester with a stick?

258
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:12,397
Nonsense, dear. Didn't you hear
the reporter admit he was seeing things?

259
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:13,665
Of course.

260
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:16,799
Hilliard will probably be along any minute
to express his gratitude.

261
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,972
Boss, you can't go in there. It's suicide.

262
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:22,673
- That's my mood exactly.
- But...

263
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:25,478
I've got to get those Addamses
off the street or I'm sunk.

264
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:26,848
Well, I'm not going in.

265
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:30,013
That's the first intelligent thing
you've said in the entire campaign.

266
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,614
Get down to the polls
and see what's going on.

267
00:18:32,725 --> 00:18:33,919
Right.

268
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,023
- Bass.
- Boss?

269
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:44,967
Call my mother
and tell her not to wait up for me.

270
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,367
Good idea.

271
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:10,987
- Hilliard, we've been expecting you.
- I should think so.

272
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:14,259
- I'll take your hat.
- No, no, no, I'm holding on to it this time.

273
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,732
Come on in.

274
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,570
- Mrs. Addams...
- Please don't say it.

275
00:19:19,638 --> 00:19:20,969
I will, too, say it!

276
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:24,406
Mr. Addams and I find expressions
of gratitude so embarrassing.

277
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:25,944
Expressions of gratitude?

278
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,740
Your election will be our reward.

279
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,179
I'm going to turn this whole thing over
to a lawyer.

280
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:31,909
- A lawyer?
- Yes.

281
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:33,578
My card.

282
00:19:33,853 --> 00:19:37,254
Gomez is responsible
for putting more criminals behind bars

283
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:39,291
than any other man in the United States.

284
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,656
You, a prosecuting attorney?

285
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,159
Attorney for the defense.

286
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,955
Well, I don't need you for my lawyer

287
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:49,592
and I don't need you
for my campaign manager.

288
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:52,034
You see, our man's a politician
of the old school.

289
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:56,301
Not only forgets his campaign promises,
he forgets his campaigners.

290
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,311
I knew we backed the right horse.

291
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:02,840
Excuse me.

292
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:08,079
Thank you, Thing. Addams here.
Yes, he's here too.

293
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:12,321
It's for you. Probably your opponent,
Quimby, conceding the election.

294
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,227
- Only a case of election day jitters.
- I hope so.

295
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:20,365
- Why don't you answer it?
- You answer it.

296
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:21,899
Of course, old boy.

297
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,495
Addams here. I'll take the message.

298
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:26,766
Oh, hello, Bass!

299
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:30,267
Really? Some of the first returns are in.

300
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,604
Oak Knoll, eh?

301
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,109
Good. I see. Good work, Bass.

302
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:37,781
- It's a landslide.
- For Hilliard?

303
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,942
For Quimby. 76 to nothing.

304
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:43,513
- I knew it, I knew it.
- Those early returns.

305
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:45,523
Of course, the Oak Knoll section,
upper class snobs,

306
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:48,059
always contrary to the main trend.

307
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:49,560
I'll get it.

308
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,724
Thank you, Thing.

309
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:56,863
Darling, you look a little tired.
Why don't you just relax?

310
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:03,435
Hello. This is Mrs. Addams speaking.

311
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,801
Yes, he's here.

312
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:10,214
- It's for you again.
- I'm not going near that thing.

313
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,279
I'll take the message.

314
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:16,252
Oh hello, Mr. Bass. Really?

315
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,414
It's the 9th Precinct.

316
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,983
Well, that's much better.

317
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:24,486
Hilliard 6, Quimby 110.

318
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:28,990
- See? You're beginning to gain.
- I'm ruined. Ruined!

319
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:32,404
Come now, Mr. Hilliard,
that's the 9th Precinct.

320
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:36,066
Nothing but lower class people.
That's not where your strength is.

321
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,974
If that's for me,
I don't wanna talk to anybody.

322
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:41,672
Addams here. Bass, what's the word?

323
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:45,545
Come, now, Bass,
you can think of another word.

324
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:46,811
I see.

325
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:50,713
Well, the middle class section
is the most important.

326
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:53,986
- Fine.
- All right, let me have it.

327
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,857
- Lf I were you, I'd demand a recount.
- Oh, no.

328
00:21:56,962 --> 00:21:58,987
Hilliard 5, Quimby 204.

329
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:00,893
Not bad, really. You only lost one vote.

330
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,161
I'm sure there's been some fraud.

331
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:06,170
Yes, Bass admits it.
Too bad they caught him.

332
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:07,895
I'll get it.

333
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:12,001
Hello, Mrs. Addams speaking.

334
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:14,805
Yes, Mr. Quimby.

335
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:20,145
Mr. Hilliard's here. I'm afraid he can't
come to the phone right now.

336
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:23,711
What?
Mr. Quimby, I'm sure you're mistaken.

337
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,380
Electronic computers do not vote.

338
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,251
Mr. Quimby is claiming victory.

339
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:31,522
- Wonderful.
- What's wonderful about it?

340
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:34,998
Can't you see, old man?
The trap. The Achilles' heel.

341
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:38,400
The Waterloo of every politician.
Overconfidence.

342
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,899
The poor dear.

343
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:47,410
The sweet smell of success
must have been too much for him.

344
00:22:56,588 --> 00:23:01,048
I'm so glad you joined
the Zen-Yogi society, darling.

345
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,918
Right, <i>querida.</i>

346
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:08,096
After a strenuous campaign,
at least you can relax.

347
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,098
Every man should learn to relax this way.

348
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,433
It's a wonderful gift.

349
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:20,476
- It says Mr. Hilliard is quitting politics.
- Really?

350
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:22,910
- Must be his health.
- Must be.

351
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:25,973
Because it says he's thinking
of leaving town, too.

352
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:30,143
As a matter of fact, it says he's thinking
of leaving the country.

353
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:33,520
Poor man, I was so sure he'd win.

354
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:37,460
I guess we got into the campaign too late.

355
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,691
Gomez, I'm afraid we failed.

356
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:47,533
Not according to Quimby. He says
if it wasn't for us, he wouldn't have won.

357
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,834
What a generous thing to say.

358
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,169
Why, thank you, Thing.

359
00:23:57,516 --> 00:24:00,849
Maybe we should have gotten Thing
into the campaign.

360
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,780
No, I guess not.

361
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:06,116
Hello? This is Mrs. Addams speaking.

362
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:09,160
Why, hello, Mr. Hilliard.

363
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:13,457
Really? Isn't that nice.

364
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,499
Well, thank you. Goodbye.

365
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:21,570
That was that nice Mr. Hilliard.
He says he's glad he lost.

366
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:25,473
The Mayor appointed him head of the
School Board. It's a much better position.

367
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:28,035
In that case, I'm proud to have served.

368
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,319
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the playroom.

369
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,655
To add Mr. Hilliard
to our illustrious collection.
