1
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,938
<i>Ten, nine...</i>

2
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:43,503
<i>... eight, seven...</i>

3
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:45,941
<i>... six, five...</i>

4
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,136
<i>... four...</i>

5
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:49,443
<i>... three, two...</i>

6
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,782
<i>... one!</i>

7
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:45,364
<i>Here goes.</i>

8
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:48,297
Bravo, Mr. Van der Veer!

9
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,327
<i>- Yes, Mr. Van der Veer?
- We'll go to the penthouse.</i>

10
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:16,835
Stop by Battery Park.

11
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:42,889
Roger, routing change.
Penthouse, ETA: 0615.

12
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:46,262
What will Van der Veer do
at the Battery at 6:00 a.m.?

13
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,665
- Visit his ancestors.
- Whatever he wants.

14
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:53,067
Roger, Manattan arrival.
All clear, Romulus.

15
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,936
You've got sector five read-out on three.

16
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:31,453
Chris?

17
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:36,862
Darling?

18
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:44,633
Chris!

19
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:03,351
Chris!

20
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,127
You scared me!

21
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:17,137
Darling!

22
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,711
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

23
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:34,967
<i>Pauline!</i>

24
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,313
Forget it, kid.

25
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,488
Oh, good. Put him on.

26
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:59,421
Good morning, it's Warren.
We got a problem.

27
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,393
<i>- You're up early.
- Yeah.</i>

28
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,925
Well, there's a nightmare
down in the Battery.

29
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,789
Three bodies.
Mutilation, possible sexual assault...

30
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,232
<i>... some dismemberment.
Maybe even cannibalism.</i>

31
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:12,134
<i>I'd love to see it, but I've...</i>

32
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,439
I'm late for Mass
and I got a heavy golf date.

33
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:17,966
Oh, you'll see it, Dewey.

34
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:22,505
It's very weird and it's very strange,
just like you. So, it's back to work.

35
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,141
<i>- I'm leaving now. Are you in Staten Island?
- Yeah.</i>

36
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:27,709
<i>- Get your ass over there as fast as you can.
- How?</i>

37
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,777
Fly!

38
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,987
- How are you?
- Fine.

39
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:10,685
Food.

40
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:27,170
- How can you eat that crap?
- It settles my stomach.

41
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,384
Well?

42
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:34,516
Nothing. I didn't find anything aft, either.

43
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:46,356
So?

44
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,992
So, what?

45
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:51,693
So, who got killed? The governor?

46
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:56,105
Somebody bigger.
Christopher Van der Veer.

47
00:13:58,578 --> 00:13:59,977
Megabucks.

48
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,579
Heir to the fortune,
maybe even the presidency.

49
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,978
So much for heirs.

50
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:08,919
His bodyguard. His wife is over there.

51
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:16,223
- Witnesses?
- Lf seagulls could talk, sure.

52
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,231
- Kidnapping?
- No sign of a struggle.

53
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:24,064
Take a look around.
See if you can sniff out anything.

54
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,131
Does this mean I'm back on the job?

55
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:33,371
- You're a detective, aren't you?
- I'll try and remember that.

56
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,349
<i>- It's a good thing to happen on a Sunday.
- How long...</i>

57
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,884
Oh, Christ!

58
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:41,553
- Let me handle this.
- I always do.

59
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,022
Commissioner. Mr. Mayor.

60
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,559
You handled that nicely.

61
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,942
This is just wonderful!
God knows what's next.

62
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:09,342
- Where's the damn coroner?
- We haven't located him yet.

63
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,112
I want him here!
Van der Veer was my friend.

64
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,516
You've got your best man here already.

65
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:17,546
Any more film, John?

66
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,191
Warren, what the hell happened?

67
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,788
It wasrt robbery.
Their money and jewelry werert touched.

68
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,499
There was some cocaine.

69
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:31,868
<i>Party favors. But more than that...</i>

70
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:35,738
Two factors have the potential
to make this international, Mr. Mayor.

71
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,970
Executions and terrorism.

72
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:42,477
Makes a bombing seem like child's play.

73
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,675
Excuse me.

74
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:46,710
Dewey Wilson?

75
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:49,914
Homicide, kidnapping and results.
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

76
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,016
Jonathan Ross,
Bureau Chief of Executive Security.

77
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,324
His firm's responsible for some
of the top executives in the world.

78
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:57,693
They have resources we don't have.

79
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:01,630
No matter how sophisticated
technology gets, there's no guarantee.

80
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,968
God, it stinks down here.

81
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,976
<i>Severely inflicted wounds...</i>

82
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:21,284
Dew! The old jogging trip?

83
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:25,983
The six month's annual bionic,
shed-the-twenty-pounds marathon resolve.

84
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:28,560
Sound mind, sound body.

85
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:31,455
You got to get into chemicals.
They keep you going.

86
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,891
Your body'll malfunction on you
one way or another.

87
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:37,459
Yeah. Tell me about it.

88
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:40,700
Wanna peek?

89
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:44,174
Something to tell
your grandchildren about.

90
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:48,538
Took his brain. What the hell
do you suppose they did with it?

91
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:50,708
Maybe they dribbled it down Wall Street.

92
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,582
I got a hand in a baggie.

93
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:59,714
It belongs to that guy over there.
Had a gun in it.

94
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,523
SR says he didn't even get a shot off.
How's that for fast?

95
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:06,763
Fraternity ring?

96
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,063
Pentagram and a goat. Voodoo.

97
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:11,826
Yeah?

98
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:39,664
Now, ain't this a shame?

99
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,862
Bizarre, man. It almost severed her head.

100
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:48,102
- It was instantaneous?
- Instantaneous?

101
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,771
You seen a chicken run around
with its head cut off?

102
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:55,005
Hey, nobody ever thinks about the head.

103
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,880
During the French Revolution,
when they chopped heads off...

104
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:02,115
...they'd pick them out the basket
and look them in the face.

105
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:04,281
Most went out right away, in shock.

106
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:07,349
Every fifth head or so was alive.
Wide awake...

107
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,929
...eyes blinking,
mouth trying to say something.

108
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:12,086
Yeah, sure.

109
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:14,996
The brain can live without oxygen
for more than a minute.

110
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:16,660
That's a long time, buddy boy.

111
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:19,500
How'd you like to see your own body
and know you're dead?

112
00:18:20,373 --> 00:18:22,432
Give me a nice death in bed.

113
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,475
Preferably with a partner.

114
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,237
You can take her away now.

115
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:38,013
Hey, careful with her...

116
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:40,648
...head.

117
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,838
Well, let's see what happened to my man.

118
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:36,946
Two bullet holes upside the head!

119
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:41,143
See! You shouldn't have been fucking
with that bitch.

120
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:47,015
You going to push, man?
I'm working by myself today, right?

121
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:49,184
Ain't nobody working but me. Shit!

122
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:57,769
- Another hot Saturday night.
- I heard that.

123
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:02,500
- What's today's special?
- Tennis shoes and jock straps.

124
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:06,104
A lot of joggers are going out of business.

125
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,607
You check out that dude yet?

126
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:15,543
Dew!

127
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:20,557
Weird shit happening here, man.
Give us a few more minutes.

128
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,256
How's it going, Captain?

129
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:51,783
Why do I always have to get
the hard ones?

130
00:21:29,262 --> 00:21:31,924
There's nothing there.
There's nothing there!

131
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,726
Hey, Dew!

132
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:41,070
The Chief will tell him what we got.
Severance of the jugular and carotids...

133
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,903
...destruction of the esophagus.

134
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:45,570
<i>Lethal trauma on the throats,
resulting in...</i>

135
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:48,307
But what's really interesting
is what we haven't got.

136
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:58,614
There's not a trace of metal.

137
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:05,861
You know how every piece of metal,
no matter how sharp or smooth...

138
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:07,957
...will leave a residue when it cuts.

139
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:11,634
It could be as finite as dust.
Soft x-ray should pick it up.

140
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:16,405
Nothing!

141
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:21,576
And nothing softer could have ripped
and ravaged like this.

142
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,475
Some plastic weapon?

143
00:22:28,654 --> 00:22:29,985
Synthetics.

144
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:35,016
I don't think there's any way
I could check that.

145
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:43,765
You know, Dew, you could use a haircut.
Want to lie down?

146
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:46,467
Not till it's my turn.

147
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:56,312
How's it going?

148
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,342
Identification?

149
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,454
- My face.
- I need credentials.

150
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,657
All that separates you from a guard dog
is a brain.

151
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:09,959
All right, Captain.

152
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,661
Good dog!

153
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:16,033
- Hey, Dewey. What's happening?
- Hi, Captain.

154
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,704
- What's this?
- ME's report.

155
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:23,674
Oh, yeah? What's with the morgue?

156
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,468
No answers to a lot of questions.

157
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,979
- Is that it?
- That's it.

158
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:35,051
What's the matter with you? You bored?

159
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:37,783
I'm thinking.
You're just not used to the expression.

160
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:41,886
Dungeman? Did you find out
what they were doing there?

161
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:44,828
Anniversary party
with 100 of their closest friends.

162
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:46,694
We know! We're checking the guest list.

163
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,563
Big party at the family compound.

164
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:51,602
It breaks up at 5:00 a.m.
They head back to their penthouse.

165
00:23:52,038 --> 00:23:54,006
A little pearl gift...

166
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:58,838
...a little booze, a little drugs.
They decide to boogie.

167
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,803
They were married there.

168
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,113
- How do you know that?
- I asked.

169
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:10,617
- You really are thinking.
- It's better than the Sunday crossword.

170
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,622
Maybe.

171
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:16,019
- Any Jack the Rippers out there?
- No psychos missing from the loony bins.

172
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:19,258
If it is the Ripper,
the ME can't find a trace of any weapon.

173
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:20,354
What?

174
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,027
Who knows?

175
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:25,527
The Filipinos remove organs
with their hands.

176
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:29,167
- That driver was a Haitian, right?
- Yeah.

177
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:32,275
One tough son of a bitch.
Worth three normals.

178
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:35,174
Ex-Papa Doc Secret Police.
Ton Ton Macoute.

179
00:24:35,248 --> 00:24:38,240
Van der Veer had
a big liquor import business in the islands.

180
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:40,842
How that Haitian gets jumped
beats the shit out of me.

181
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,251
You check the voodoo angle?

182
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:45,119
Voodoo? There's 80 goddamn sects
in Manattan alone.

183
00:24:45,258 --> 00:24:48,284
Come here, I want to show you something.
The meat and potatoes.

184
00:24:48,494 --> 00:24:51,657
- Business and political enemies.
- Fuchek, what do you got?

185
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:55,730
Business enemies he ain't got.
Just one big corporate family.

186
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:58,292
Political, well, there's the action.

187
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:01,262
The family's got interests
on every continent.

188
00:25:01,774 --> 00:25:03,503
Funding a government overthrow.

189
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:06,607
Putting a mine in some holy ground.
Moving a town.

190
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,647
A real friend of the Third World.

191
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,280
International terrorism, huh?

192
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,953
- You got quadrant four secured already?
- Yes, I do.

193
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:33,730
- Punch me up 20 on this.
- Roger, 20.

194
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,897
Got a demo run faction.

195
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:38,808
File facts negative so far.
Unknown radical connections.

196
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:42,207
Wait, wait. Give me the stats on 20.

197
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:46,915
- Well, hello! That's Van der Veer's niece.
- Have the police pick her up.

198
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,357
Give me 20.

199
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:07,199
<i>Somewhere in the world, every other day...</i>

200
00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:11,136
<i>... a corporate executive is kidnapped
or assassinated...</i>

201
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,801
<i>... netting ransoms in excess of $1 billion...</i>

202
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:18,043
<i>... and forcing the expenditure of $50 million
in corporate security measures.</i>

203
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:23,418
<i>Transnational terrorism would rival
their victims in profit if you guys...</i>

204
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:24,786
I want her.

205
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:29,521
<i>... sophisticated Joseph Richmond, central
chemical plant manager in Columbia.</i>

206
00:26:30,196 --> 00:26:31,185
Yeah?

207
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,453
Good morning.

208
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:34,795
Hi! Good morning. Come in. Sit down.

209
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:39,197
<i>I was reading the response you got
on that Psychology of Violence report.</i>

210
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:41,398
- That must be very gratifying.
- Yes, it is.

211
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,463
Good.

212
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:46,009
I'm teaming you up with Dewey Wilson
on the Van der Veer case.

213
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:49,570
I didn't know he was back.
I thought he retired. Disabled. Mental?

214
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,118
<i>He had a lot of family problems.
He started to drink a little too much. He...</i>

215
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:58,782
Police work piled up on him.
He's a good man. You'll like him.

216
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:00,623
Okay, fine.

217
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:04,660
We also had a little break this morning.
Van der Veer's niece was picked up.

218
00:27:05,331 --> 00:27:08,630
She's Weather underground.
I want you to chat her up.

219
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:11,226
Put her on your machine.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

220
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:17,239
So what's new on the international
mutilation front? Run down the list.

221
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:21,840
Well, kneecappings, Red Brigade, Italy.

222
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:25,313
Slashed Achilles tendons,
eyes gouged out, ears cut off...

223
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:26,715
...Red Army faction.

224
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:30,278
Let's see, PFLP, Carlos,
Baader, Tuperamos...

225
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,920
...Fifth Estate, a few decapitations.

226
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:36,553
The Uno Mondo.
They slash off the male genitalia.

227
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,390
The cock and balls.
They stuff them in their victim's mouth.

228
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,066
- You ever seen anybody killed?
- Pardon me?

229
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,337
Somebody's insides on a wall?
Hold your nose.

230
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,874
So, who collects brains?

231
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,111
It's probably a symbol.

232
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:03,377
Miss Rensselaer
probably went to Radcliffe...

233
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,814
...and took a course in symbolism.

234
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:10,225
<i>- What is your full name?
- Cicely Marie Rensselaer.</i>

235
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:13,029
<i>- What city are we in?
- That's a good question.</i>

236
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:17,432
<i>- Well, what city?
- We're in New York, aren't we?</i>

237
00:28:17,837 --> 00:28:19,099
<i>We're in New York.</i>

238
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:25,774
What are you watching?

239
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:29,440
She is an urban guerrilla
fighting the just war...

240
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:32,116
...against all us fascist swine.

241
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:36,178
And she is a chain-jerked...

242
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:41,523
...pussy of an amoral society.
Well, that's what she's just been called.

243
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,561
<i>What is this crap?
Am I on some kind of a lie detector?</i>

244
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:47,261
<i>You know that would be illegal.</i>

245
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:51,326
Yeah, the whole room's a lie detector.
This is a high-end infrared imager.

246
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:53,398
<i>Well, you were always a good kid...</i>

247
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,700
The register's heat changes
in the 8 to 12 micron range.

248
00:28:56,776 --> 00:29:00,769
Thermo-graphic systems equipment,
voice analyzers.

249
00:29:01,947 --> 00:29:04,006
Computers and recorders are back there.

250
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:07,246
Micro-frequency levels
indicate psychological stress.

251
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:10,982
These things should be monitoring
Congress and the White House.

252
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:12,284
Country would grind to a halt.

253
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:15,452
This stuff's all remote. Covert.
You don't hook them up with...

254
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:17,428
...a bandage on the arm and a sweat meter.

255
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:21,330
One death is a tragedy. A million
is a statistic. You tell me about our wars.

256
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,425
Tell me about three deaths.

257
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,970
Three deaths?

258
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,697
Well?

259
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:36,103
She's hiding something.

260
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,815
Did you, or anyone you know, participate
in the murder of Christopher Van der Veer?

261
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,888
That's one startled kid.

262
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,899
Are you aware of any information...

263
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:58,300
...about the murder
of Christopher and Pauline Van der Veer?

264
00:30:05,277 --> 00:30:07,006
It wasrt a murder, Rebecca.

265
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:10,207
<i>- It wasrt a murder, Rebecca.
- It was an execution.</i>

266
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,579
Jesus Christ!

267
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:14,619
<i>It was an execution.</i>

268
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:19,652
<i>It wasrt a murder, Rebecca.
It was an execution.</i>

269
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:22,486
She's lying.
She knows nothing about the murders.

270
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:28,096
Got you. Urban guerilla.
Till your goddamn trust fund runs out.

271
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:31,099
- You're sure she's lying?
- Absolutely.

272
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:36,603
- Great! Now where does that leave us?
- Like this just didn't happen.

273
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,731
I got to get straight.
What'll you give me for it?

274
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:27,675
<i>No Hustler pinups!</i>

275
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,774
I don't think
this has anything to do with terrorism.

276
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,545
What does it have to do with?

277
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:35,982
- Paranoia.
- Paranoia?

278
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:40,817
Your people want it to be political.
It justifies your existence.

279
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:42,587
She was a logical suspect.

280
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:44,720
What weapon did that?

281
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:49,232
Why hasn't anybody called the press?
Especially for such a beautiful job.

282
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,894
They all don't right away.

283
00:33:58,577 --> 00:33:59,908
You wanna a shot?

284
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,640
- Have you got any ice?
- Only in my heart.

285
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:17,852
"God, guns and guts...

286
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:22,233
"...made America. Let's keep all three."

287
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,801
Why are you a cop?

288
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:30,101
<i>Oh, I like to kill. It's a habit
I picked up and it's...</i>

289
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:32,107
It's hard to shake.

290
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:35,803
Killed anyone lately?

291
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:39,714
Well, I tried to kill a rabbit this morning,
but it went down a hole.

292
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,209
What do you make of that?

293
00:34:42,654 --> 00:34:45,987
Well, something sexual, I suppose.

294
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:00,127
Good night, Dewey.

295
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:01,803
Good night, Rebecca.

296
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:06,270
- Where are you staying?
- A company apartment.

297
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:08,840
Got a ride?

298
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:10,981
- You asking?
- Yeah.

299
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:12,506
No.

300
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,111
You want one?

301
00:35:15,387 --> 00:35:16,684
Not tonight.

302
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:09,397
Stop! Stop!

303
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:16,878
Jesus Christ!

304
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:20,543
Over here! Come over here!

305
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:25,286
<i>- Come on, man, hurry!
- Come on, let's go take a look.</i>

306
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:27,120
<i>Cesspool! Look at this sewer!</i>

307
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:29,922
<i>Jesus Christ!
Didrt expect that kind of work in here.</i>

308
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:47,312
How many houses
did the Van der Veers have?

309
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:50,212
Locust Valley, Long Island, the Bahamas...

310
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:53,410
...Johannesburg, Rome, San Francisco...

311
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:55,817
...and this little pied-à-terre.

312
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:58,445
Peter Van der Veer.

313
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:05,295
And old John Joachim, himself.

314
00:37:06,798 --> 00:37:09,961
He even looks like God!
Except his hands are in his pockets.

315
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:13,129
They'd better be! He's got
about four dead presidents in them.

316
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,948
Mrs. Van der Veer painted this?

317
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:31,850
- It's such a disturbing picture!
- It sure disturbs me.

318
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,752
- She was asking for help.
- With her art lessons.

319
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:39,060
It's not me.

320
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:41,398
- Got a phone I could use?
- On the desk.

321
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:58,273
What's this?

322
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:03,583
Mr. Van der Veer's real estate project.
Ground breaking ceremony was Saturday.

323
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:04,747
<i>- Whittington.
- Dew.</i>

324
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:07,018
<i>They found some body parts
in the South Bronx.</i>

325
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:10,789
<i>- What's the South Bronx got to do...
- This is hot, man! Meet me at Baldy's.</i>

326
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,820
I'll be right there.

327
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:18,166
We've got hair files on every race running,
plus your basic sub-flavors.

328
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:21,399
Facial, axillary, chest, pubic.

329
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,538
They're all different. All identifiable.

330
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:27,375
The one on the left came off
the Bronx kidney.

331
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:30,472
The one on the right was found
on Pauline Van der Veer.

332
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,511
Identical.

333
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,149
A hair is like a fingerprint.

334
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:39,823
And those two
came from the same source.

335
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:42,324
What are they?

336
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:47,157
Captain, they don't match anything I have.
All I know is they ain't human.

337
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:49,130
And in New York?

338
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:52,566
South Bronx and Wall Street.
What's the connection?

339
00:38:53,872 --> 00:38:55,134
They're both dead.

340
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:57,432
- Thanks, Baldy.
- Thank you.

341
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,201
- See you, Baldy.
- Keep combing it.

342
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:35,068
My God!

343
00:39:57,169 --> 00:40:01,128
- I haven't been in a church in years.
- Lost your faith?

344
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:03,864
<i>No. I got married in one.</i>

345
00:40:05,243 --> 00:40:06,904
<i>Is he still around?</i>

346
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:08,576
<i>Not anymore.</i>

347
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:13,151
<i>I was an altar boy once.</i>

348
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:17,544
<i>An old nun ran the show.
Used to beat the shit out of me.</i>

349
00:40:24,996 --> 00:40:27,794
<i>- Take a look inside?
- No, thanks.</i>

350
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:35,432
- What was that?
- What?

351
00:40:36,108 --> 00:40:38,440
<i>That sound! Like a baby!</i>

352
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:41,606
<i>There! Inside!</i>

353
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:50,345
"The devil on one shoulder,
an angel on the other."

354
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,816
- What?
- Let's get out of here!

355
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:03,358
Did you hear that?

356
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:06,827
Wind.

357
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:02,037
I haven't been to a place like this
since school.

358
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,404
You really know
how to treat a woman, Wilson.

359
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:06,134
This isn't a date, Neff.

360
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,103
What do you think it was?

361
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:16,242
Kids.

362
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:17,944
Junkies.

363
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:21,489
Hallucinations. I don't know.

364
00:45:33,004 --> 00:45:34,665
Have you killed anyone?

365
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,269
Well, I wounded someone.

366
00:45:38,743 --> 00:45:43,237
I shot a rookie in the leg, cleaning my gun
in the locker room second week in uniform.

367
00:45:46,384 --> 00:45:47,544
Have you?

368
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,411
Why don't you ask how many?

369
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:16,662
Thank you.
