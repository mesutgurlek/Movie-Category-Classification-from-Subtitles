00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:16,148
Hey, kiddo.

3
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:19,408
Hey, Dad.
Are you coming home soon?

4
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:22,875
Yeah, in an hour or so.

5
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,249
What's-What's up?
Where's mom?

6
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:29,279
I don't think she's feeling good.

7
00:01:29,304 --> 00:01:31,227
I know.

8
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,748
Don't worry.

9
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:35,914
I'm working on
getting her better, okay?

10
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,488
She's...

11
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:42,479
She's been talking to herself.

12
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,303
Listen.

13
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:52,451
I will be home with you very soon and
I'm going to get Mom better, I promise.

14
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:53,998
Okay.

15
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:57,236
- I'll see you soon, buddy.
- See you soon

17
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,420
Do you want anyone on overtime?

18
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,648
No, I got to...

19
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:19,591
I got to...

20
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:22,115
Just go ahead and close up.

21
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:23,735
Okay.

22
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:33,277
The very least, maybe you could get her
to stop locking herself in the closet, okay?

23
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:35,704
Right?

24
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,673
So we don't call it an intervention,
we call it a...

25
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:40,083
Paul?

26
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:42,366
I saw something.

27
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:44,672
This thing is really starting
to take it's toll on him.

28
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:45,830
Paul.

29
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:47,387
One second, please.

30
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:48,355
What?

31
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,294
There was something in the back room.

32
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,817
What do you mean something?

33
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:55,833
I don't know.
It disappeared.

34
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:59,820
Esther, I really got to
deal with this, so...

35
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:01,499
Just go home, okay?

36
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:04,202
Be careful on
your way out, okay?

37
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:07,904
Okay, so I'll be home in about a...
an hour.

38
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:10,219
Okay.
Yep

39
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:11,551
Bye.

40
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,207
Esther?

41
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:22,794
Oh, no, no, no...
Come on!

42
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,365
Whoa!

43
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:12,625
lights out

44
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,255
Hey.

45
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,432
What's the chance that
we go again?

46
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,582
- Slim to none.
- Mm.

47
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,012
Yeah, that.

48
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:41,993
- No?
- No.

49
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,005
I'm going to go take a shower.

50
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:46,539
Hey, maybe I'll join you.

51
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:49,199
You will smell like girlie soap.

52
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,139
Hey.

53
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:35,655
- Marathon man.
- I'm up.

54
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,708
Don't think you're staying.

55
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,339
Becca.

56
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:41,757
- Just one night?
- No.

57
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,966
You're going to kick me out
in the middle of the night?

58
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,328
You're going to be okay.
You're not a puppy.

59
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:49,423
I thought I was your boyfriend.

60
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:51,174
Boyfriend?

61
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:53,778
Who said anything about boyfriend?

62
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,610
Yeah.
Uh, you're a...

63
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:01,827
 a guy, the only guy
that I've been seeing.

64
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:03,436
It's been eight months.

65
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,035
Really?
Eight months?

66
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,380
Eight months.

67
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:10,356
Wow.
That officially puts you in the first place.

68
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,068
- How about I keep a pair of jeans here?
- Nope.

69
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,722
A sock?
I mean, just one sock but, of course.

70
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:21,595
What are you going to do
with one sock?

71
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,180
Is that a yes?

72
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:26,472
No, get out of here.
I've work tomorrow.

73
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:29,805
Not like, having a sock here
means you can't get rid of me.

74
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,280
Socks are not anchors.

75
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,490
Okay, I'm going to see you
tomorrow night, at that gig.

76
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:35,609
Can we just agreed to that, please?

77
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:37,154
Alright.

78
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,251
Are you still there?

79
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,504
I'll see you tomorrow.

80
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,877
You know, one of these nights,
you're going to let me s...

81
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:00,716
I love you too.

82
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,684
Hey, sexy.

83
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:13,114
I like you,
a lot.

84
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:15,067
Is that all?

85
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:18,983
No, there is one more thing.

86
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:27,350
So close.

87
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,352
Compassionate Entrepreneur
OBITUARY

88
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:16,889
Mom?

89
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,248
Mom?

90
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:06,579
I just don't know what to do about it.
I...

91
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:11,198
I'm so sorry.
I... I really don't know.

92
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:12,961
Mom?

93
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:16,435
Hey, Martin.
What's up?

94
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,249
You okay?

95
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:22,032
Yeah, I will be.
Just... it will take a bit.

96
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:26,519
Did we wake you?

97
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,132
What?

98
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:29,500
Hey.

99
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:32,367
You got to go back
to bed, sweetie.

100
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:34,452
Hey, the only ones that
should be wondering the halls

101
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,894
at this hour are grown ups.

102
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:53,956
Good night, Martin.

103
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,788
She isn't answering.

104
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,012
Hey, Martin?

105
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:19,579
Is there someone else
we can call for you?

106
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,571
It's just...
I didn't know you had a brother.

107
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,398
Yeah.

108
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,198
Are you, Rebecca?

109
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:33,455
- Yeah.
- I'm Emma, I'm with Child Services.

110
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,115
I was assigned to Martin
after your father died.

111
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:37,333
Stepfather.

112
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,928
- Excuse me?
- He was my stepfather.

113
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:42,528
My dad ran off when I was ten
and did not come back.

114
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:45,367
If we could just...
talk about Martin for a minute.

115
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:49,013
How is he when he is at home?
Is he sleeping?

116
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:51,469
I wouldn't know.
I don't live there.

117
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:53,598
So, it's just your mother
in the house then?

118
00:14:53,623 --> 00:14:55,032
Yeah.

119
00:14:55,236 --> 00:14:57,294
How is she holding up?

120
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,895
Um, well.
She's...

121
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,482
She's taking her antidepressants
if that's what you're asking.

122
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:07,120
Okay, and...
how bad is it, this depression?

123
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,611
I'm sorry, is Martin okay?
Because...

124
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:12,487
you're grilling me like
he has a black eye or something.

125
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,938
He fell asleep in
homeroom this morning...

126
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:17,508
for the third time
in the past week.

127
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:21,688
Okay, excuse me.

128
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:27,040
Hey.

129
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:29,608
You showed up.

130
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,323
Yeah..

131
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,222
I didn't know if you would.

132
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,256
Okay.

133
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:38,681
Uh, where is Mom?

134
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:48,379
Martin, I know you and your mother
are going through a lot.

135
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:53,506
And it's harder for you because
you can't talk to mom about it.

136
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:56,901
Maybe you even tried to help her?

137
00:15:56,926 --> 00:16:01,685
If you ever want to talk about it,
I'm here, okay?

138
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:05,936
This is why you left, isn't it?

139
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:10,869
Uh, no.
My deal was a lot more complicated.

140
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:15,149
Okay.
Let's go, I'll get you home.

141
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,093
Your house or Mom's?

142
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,295
Where you live.

143
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,362
Hey.

144
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,531
You're going to be okay.

145
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:30,062
Come on.

146
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:32,938
He'll be fine.

147
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,701
Okay.

148
00:16:34,862 --> 00:16:37,820
- We'll be in touch.
- Uh-huh.

149
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:58,122
Here we are.

150
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:01,624
You should let me stay at your place,
just for a night.

151
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,055
Good luck with that one, buddy.

152
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:06,587
Um.
You know what?

153
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,765
I do not think you're really
going to like it there.

154
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,463
Because I have these... like weird
kind of scary posters on the wall.

155
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:15,718
I just need sleep.

156
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:20,477
We can talk about it.
Yeah.

157
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,131
- Any tips for the Mom's?
- Uh, you are not coming in.

158
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:27,700
Come on, why not?

159
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:29,839
Because she's crazy.

160
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:35,992
Mom goes through phases like this.
Just give her time.

161
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:38,325
Has she been social with anyone?

162
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,826
Someone keeps on coming over.

163
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,464
Good, who?

164
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:44,317
Diana.

165
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,066
What did you say?

166
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:51,300
Her name is Diana.

167
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,814
Hey.

168
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,249
I know what you're going through,

169
00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:01,549
because Mom did the same thing
to me when my dad left.

170
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:06,166
And I had really
bad dreams about Diana.

171
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:09,097
That's all that they are, okay?

172
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,639
Because she isn't real.

173
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,164
Becca, hi.

174
00:18:16,189 --> 00:18:18,519
Hi, Mom.

175
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:22,133
Hey, what are you doing home?
little Mister?

176
00:18:22,158 --> 00:18:23,925
She'll tell you.

177
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,788
He hasn't been sleeping.

178
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:31,979
Well.

179
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:33,430
Can you blame him?

180
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,584
Paul was everything to us.

181
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:38,033
Nearly everything.

182
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,481
Have you been
seeing a therapist, Mom?

183
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:47,400
I am not going to go to a stranger
to talk about my problems.

184
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,381
I've gone through that before.

185
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:51,054
You remember?

186
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,405
Yeah, I do remember.

187
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,945
How long have you
been off your meds?

188
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,535
Excuse me?

189
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,213
Yeah.

190
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,795
Do you think I wanted
any of this to happen to me?

191
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,551
What about Martin?
Have you thought of him?

192
00:19:57,576 --> 00:20:00,644
Are you really going to play
the "Bad mother" card with me?

193
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,203
You, of all people, huh?

194
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:07,405
Do you know what it's like
to raise him without a father?

195
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:12,084
Look how you turn out.

196
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:21,588
I'm gonna give you
a few days.

197
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,792
And until you stop
being completely manic,

198
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,972
I'm going to have
Martin staying with me.

199
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,485
- Mm-mm.
- Yeah.

200
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,942
- That's what's going to happen, Mom.
- Mm-mm.

201
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,374
- And you can call me when
  you are feeling better.
- No, no, no.

202
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,715
- Pack your bags.
- No, Martin...

203
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,110
I'm ready.

204
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:39,125
Martin, no, no, no.

205
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,596
Martin, please.
Please. Please.

206
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:42,972
- You planned this, didn't you.
- Let's go.

207
00:20:42,997 --> 00:20:46,630
- You planned this.
- I didn't plan anything, Mom.

208
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:51,813
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Remember to take your vitamins.

209
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:52,891
Rebecca.

210
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,266
- What's going on?
- We're going home.

211
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:59,085
No, no.
Rebecca, please.

212
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,866
I'm sorry, Mom.

213
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:10,838
Okay.

214
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:14,593
Here we are.
You can take the bed.

215
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:19,085
Or the couch if you want.

216
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,469
No.

217
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,906
This is good.

218
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:25,543
Okay.

219
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:27,797
Cool.

220
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,119
My god.

221
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,088
This your idea?

222
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,470
- What do you mean?
- Bring the kid here.

223
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:45,425
Yeah, he's not safe there.

224
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,537
So, you called the lady
at the school.

225
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:50,521
That's what CPS is for.
(Child Protective Services)

226
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:52,433
Exactly this.

227
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:55,036
- He's my brother.
- And she's his mother.

228
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,463
So?

229
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,384
Are you doing this to help him
or to hurt her?

230
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,902
You should leave now.

231
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:29,477
I know it's a little past dinner time,
so we can call this a midnight snack.

232
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,592
Do you want
crust or no crust?

233
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,412
Um...
Yeah, crust is fine.

234
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:38,632
Can you make them triangles?

235
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,119
Yeah.
You're just like your big sister.

236
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:45,731
I used to think love that, already.

237
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:50,503
Here we go.

238
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,131
Okay.

239
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:57,182
That's good, it's not even...
Oh.

240
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,279
Sorry, you had a knot.

241
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:02,946
Rebecca?

242
00:23:03,124 --> 00:23:04,529
Yeah?

243
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,608
If Mom's crazy,

244
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,180
does it mean we're crazy too?

245
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,491
Nope.

246
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,988
Martin?

247
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,391
Hey.

248
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:07,230
What are you doing down there?

249
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,239
You have to turn the light switch
or...

250
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,489
- Did you take Martin?
- Uh... What?

251
00:26:19,514 --> 00:26:21,181
Who is it?

252
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,510
You can't do this.

253
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:29,396
She's unstable. It's not...
It's not a safe environment for him.

254
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,730
- Where is he?
- He's in there getting dress for school.

255
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:32,891
Okay.

256
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:36,810
- Think about what you want to do.
- Yeah. I did and I brought him here.

257
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:39,644
I'm not talking about
some knee-jerk reaction.

258
00:26:40,152 --> 00:26:41,501
He can't stay here.

259
00:26:41,526 --> 00:26:42,990
He...
Sure, he can.

260
00:26:43,015 --> 00:26:45,867
Not with...
Rebecca, come on.

261
00:26:45,892 --> 00:26:49,189
You know why I'm here?
She called me.

262
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,774
So Child Services takes orders
from nut jobs now?

263
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,134
I stopped by in person to make sure
she was lucid and she was.

264
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,120
But you know what?
That's-That's not how this works.

265
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:01,444
Why not?

266
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:04,761
Sophie's his birth mother,
his legal guardian.

267
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:08,831
To get Martin from her custody requires
you to file charges against her,

268
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:10,671
take her to court.

269
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:13,719
Now that's a long
painful process.

270
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:15,174
And that's only the first half.

271
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,550
To keep Martin from
being placed in foster care

272
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:21,973
requires you to prove yourself and
your home as an appropriate surrogate.

273
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,342
That's 2 major choices
for you to make.

274
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:27,451
Declaring war on your mother and...

275
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:32,179
transforming yourself into a
responsible guardian for him.

276
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:35,828
You ready to do that?

277
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,956
I can be a responsible guardian.

278
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:54,795
It's okay.
I got some sleep.

279
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:57,118
I'll be better tonight.

280
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:17,790
Hey.

281
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,564
I got your text, what's up?

282
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:24,905
- Can you take me to my Mom's?
- Really?

283
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,017
- Really?
- Hey.

284
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:27,952
- With this whole thing again?
- What?

285
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:30,694
No, I'll tell you about it in the car.
What are you doing?

286
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:33,095
- I think we should talk about last night.
- What?

287
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,335
Yeah. How you kicked me out
for being honest with you.

288
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,206
Oh.
Um.

289
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:40,586
Yeah, I just...
I'm sorry.

290
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:44,283
You were right.
I was using Martin to get to mom.

291
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:46,809
Thank you for pointing that out.

292
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:48,241
- Can we...?
- Mm-mm.

293
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:50,660
You should apologize to Martin.

294
00:30:54,755 --> 00:30:56,952
Not like that,
but you should still apologize.

295
00:30:56,977 --> 00:30:59,355
Okay, I got to
find out about Diana.

296
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,723
The bitch is real.

297
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:04,796
Wait.
Who's Diana?

298
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:07,516
Mom?

299
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:24,788
Alright, what are we looking for?

300
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,171
We're looking for mom.

301
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:28,592
If you see her,
we hit the back door, got it?

302
00:31:28,617 --> 00:31:30,127
Got it.

303
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:27,172
<i>Sophie & Diana
Mulberry Hill, CA</i>

304
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:53,149
Patient 283,
on October 6th, 1984.

305
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:57,015
The patient suffers from a unique
skin disorder that manifest itself

306
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,069
with an extreme sensitivity to light.

307
00:34:00,094 --> 00:34:04,166
The patient's stay here
has been very problematic.

308
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:07,120
She has a history
of violence and...

309
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:11,565
lately she's obsessed with one of the
patients in the heliotherapy ward.

310
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:13,548
A young girl named Sophie.

311
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,542
And...
Oh, bring her .

312
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,275
Keep her restraints on.
Thank you.

313
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,731
Hello, Diana.

314
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:22,493
Keep the lights out.

315
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,570
I hear you've been
very bad again.

316
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,670
Diana, I want you to
stay away from Sophie .

317
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:29,720
She's my friend.

318
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:31,646
Then why did you hurt her?

319
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:34,144
She was getting better.

320
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,277
November the 13th.

321
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:38,777
The patient's skin
condition is worsening.

322
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:41,100
We're preparing an experimental treat...

323
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,690
Hold her down!

324
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:46,458
Use full dose now, 1200 watts.

325
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:53,304
Turn it off!
Now!

326
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:01,547
Jesus Chri...

327
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:32,747
Bret!

328
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:36,546
Bret!

329
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:40,233
Stay away.

330
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:43,328
Stay away, Becca.

331
00:36:43,353 --> 00:36:47,192
I won't be sent away again.

332
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:58,754
You okay?
What happened?

333
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:01,456
We got to go, your mom's here.
Get up.

334
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:03,526
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

335
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:04,707
- Shit.
- Talk to me.

336
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,491
- Oh god.
- What happened up there?

337
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,417
I don't know.

338
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:11,536
- I was attacked.
- Yeah, by what?

339
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:14,264
I don't know.
I can't explain it.

340
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:16,790
What's all this for?

341
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:20,558
Proof.
That's proof.

342
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,440
I know.
I'm just saying,

343
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:26,825
you can talk about
your sister to me, okay?

344
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,609
She's fine.

345
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:30,956
Did you take your vitamins?

346
00:37:31,322 --> 00:37:32,392
Oh.

347
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,665
I am feeling a little better.

348
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:36,815
But, hey.
Listen, bud, I...

349
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,509
I know I've been a little distant lately
and I really want to fix that.

350
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,591
How about a popcorn and
movie night tonight?

351
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:44,263
Yes, please.

352
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:45,457
Good.

353
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:48,635
 I think a little personal time
is just what we need.

354
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,421
The three of us.

355
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,011
- Mom?
- Huh?

356
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:59,996
How about just you and me tonight?
Okay?

357
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,602
We'll see.

358
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:21,887
Child, how can you see
with all that light?

359
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:24,355
Ah. Now that's better.
Now be an angel and run along to Ito

360
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,398
and tell him to bring me
a very light breakfast.

361
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:28,035
How are you doing down there?

362
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,718
I'm fine.
How are you?

363
00:38:32,283 --> 00:38:34,653
I'm going to be fine.

364
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,583
I am.

365
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,930
I miss your dad.

366
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:42,949
He made me feel strong.

367
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:46,329
He made me feel protected and...

368
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:50,088
I think I need to feel those things
sometimes, you know?

369
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:53,292
- I think you do too.
- I'm okay.

370
00:38:53,863 --> 00:38:55,907
Rebecca's strong.

371
00:38:56,783 --> 00:39:02,282
Uh, Rebecca acts like she's strong.
And she is sometimes.

372
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:06,794
But, let me tell you, when things
got tough, she abandoned me.

373
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:09,598
And I don't want that
to happen to you.

374
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:12,687
Sometimes the strongest thing to do...

375
00:39:12,712 --> 00:39:15,373
is just to face your fears.

376
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:17,567
That's what Emma told me.

377
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:21,330
Yeah.

378
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:25,687
I think you might be right.

379
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,514
I'll be back.

380
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:38,843
Mom?

381
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:41,253
Hey, hey, hey. It's all right.
It's okay, love.

382
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,545
- What are you doing?
- It's okay. It's alright.

383
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,892
Look at me.
Trust me, okay?

384
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:46,042
- I'm going to tell you a story.
- Mom, please, please.

385
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:48,618
Shhh, baby.

386
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:51,605
It was a long time ago.

387
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,993
and I had a friend named Diana.

388
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:59,567
She was so different, so special.
And...

389
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:00,895
Look at me.

390
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,921
And later I found out something
really bad happened to her.

391
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:09,034
But the news, the news
had it wrong, you see.

392
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:11,325
And she was-she was still there.

393
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,395
And she finally came back.

394
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,712
Mom, please.
Please let go.

395
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:18,028
No, listen to me.
See... see...

396
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:23,322
I left her alone for so many years,
I abandoned her.

397
00:40:23,347 --> 00:40:25,797
But now,
she's going to stay, okay?

398
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:30,369
As long as I keep my head clear
and you keep the lights out.

399
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:33,046
- NO!
- Martin.

400
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:35,394
Martin, don't turn on the lights.

401
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:37,597
Diana doesn't know any better.

402
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:39,528
No, Diana.

403
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:44,168
He doesn't understand.
He didn't mean it.

404
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:48,652
Martin, she didn't mean it.

405
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:56,951
Please don't do this.

406
00:40:58,083 --> 00:40:59,087
Wait.

407
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:02,592
So your mother was in a mental
institution when she was younger?

408
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:04,965
Yeah.

409
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,502
Yeah, it looks that way.

410
00:41:07,546 --> 00:41:10,151
You just never talked about it, that's all.

411
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:14,813
Neither did she.

412
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:20,304
I guess it's not really something
that you talk about.

413
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,772
How about I just listen?

414
00:41:25,013 --> 00:41:27,932
Because I'm still don't know
who Diana is.

415
00:41:30,642 --> 00:41:32,348
She's...

416
00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:48,374
It getting worse.

417
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,210
We need to go shopping, babe.

418
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:57,642
Right.

419
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:00,422
Can you run to the store?

420
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:02,563
Okay.
Copy that.

421
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:04,031
See you in a while.

422
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,727
You want to talk about it now?

423
00:42:13,516 --> 00:42:15,846
I know you don't believe me,

424
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:18,314
but Diana is real.

425
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:20,674
- She touched my hair.
- Hey, hey, hey.

426
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:25,724
Listen to me.

427
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,007
I'm going to tell you something...

428
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,767
that nobody ever told me.

429
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:35,363
I believe you.

430
00:42:36,968 --> 00:42:40,660
- I don't know what she is.
- She doesn't like the light.

431
00:42:43,263 --> 00:42:44,741
Okay.

432
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:47,723
Come with me.

433
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:52,244
Okay.

434
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:54,106
So.

435
00:42:54,131 --> 00:43:00,886
It turns out that your dad was doing a lot
of research into Mom and Diana's past.

436
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:08,057
Diana was found in a basement
locked away when she was 13 years old .

437
00:43:08,082 --> 00:43:11,462
And her father had killed himself.
<font color="#ff8080">*SHE IS IN MY HEAD</font>

438
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:17,115
She had a very strange skin disorder.

439
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:21,065
There were stories about her.

440
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,474
People used to say that
she was evil.

441
00:43:23,506 --> 00:43:30,278
And that she could get inside people's heads,
changed them.

442
00:43:31,261 --> 00:43:36,404
She was taken to
Mulberry Hill Psychiatric Hospital
where she met mom.

443
00:43:36,429 --> 00:43:40,190
And I think she got
inside mom's head...

444
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:43,396
and made her think that
they were friends.

445
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,075
- But they weren't?
- No.

446
00:43:47,076 --> 00:43:50,823
Diana only comes around
when mom is at her worst.

447
00:43:50,848 --> 00:43:53,962
I went through it too
when I was your age.

448
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:56,292
When your dad left.

449
00:43:56,777 --> 00:43:58,288
Yeah.

450
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:02,278
So, what happened to Diana?

451
00:44:02,303 --> 00:44:08,420
The doctors tried an experimental treatment
on her and something went wrong.

452
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:12,225
And she died.

453
00:44:12,612 --> 00:44:16,214
But...
if she's dead...

454
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:20,218
How could she be
doing this to us?

455
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:24,588
I don't know.

456
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:30,553
But I think that mom is the only
connection Diana has to this world.

457
00:44:30,578 --> 00:44:33,464
You know, I think if
we can get mom better,

458
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,602
get her mind strong again...

459
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:39,741
Then we can maybe
break that connection.

460
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:42,103
No.

461
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:45,621
Diana won't let that happen.

462
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:48,795
Why do you say that?

463
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,973
Because that's what
my dad was trying to do.

464
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,816
Okay, it's the food.

465
00:45:01,137 --> 00:45:02,549
Hey.

466
00:45:14,182 --> 00:45:15,641
Bret?

467
00:45:38,288 --> 00:45:40,032
Stay there.

468
00:46:25,696 --> 00:46:27,421
REBECCA!

469
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:35,706
Oh.
Oh god.

470
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:49,340
Mom, we need to talk.

471
00:47:06,614 --> 00:47:08,093
What?

472
00:47:08,094 --> 00:47:11,258
Can you tell us about Diana?

473
00:47:12,783 --> 00:47:14,470
What are you talking about?

474
00:47:14,495 --> 00:47:17,685
Your friend, Diana.

475
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,739
Martin said that
she was here an hour ago.

476
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:27,373
Yes.
She's my friend.

477
00:47:31,524 --> 00:47:34,260
Is this your friend, Diana?

478
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:36,155
Is this her?

479
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:38,322
Where did you get this?

480
00:47:38,347 --> 00:47:41,463
- Answer my question.
- No, you answer mine.

481
00:47:41,563 --> 00:47:44,149
You met Diana at Mulberry Hill

482
00:47:44,174 --> 00:47:47,185
when you were taken there
for your depression.

483
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,797
- Am I right?
- What does it matter...

484
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:49,978
- Am I right?
- ... when we met?

485
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:52,853
What does it matter
when we met?

486
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:54,318
Because she died.

487
00:47:54,343 --> 00:47:56,647
- She died a year after this photo.
- That is a lie. That is a lie. That is a lie.

488
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:58,124
I don't know what
you are saying, okay?

489
00:47:58,149 --> 00:47:59,797
- It's the truth. Mom, it's the truth.
- Okay, stop.

490
00:47:59,822 --> 00:48:01,114
Stop.
Okay, I understand.

491
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:03,968
You are trying to take
him away from me again.

492
00:48:03,993 --> 00:48:05,936
You're trying to take my
son away from me again

493
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:07,786
so you're making up
these wild stories.

494
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:10,394
I found her obituary, Mom.

495
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:13,055
- Explain that.
- You know, those things can be faked.

496
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,058
They can be faked.
You sound crazy.

497
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:15,969
- Listen to her.
- Me?

498
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:18,308
I know. I know.
This all sounds a little crazy.

499
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,785
There's a dead woman
in this house.

500
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,796
And you let her in, Mom.
You let her stay.

501
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:27,113
I know. I see.
I get it.

502
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:31,063
You came because you feel
bad about leaving me.

503
00:48:31,088 --> 00:48:33,028
Am I right?

504
00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:36,514
I didn't hear from you.
You didn't come see me like most people.

505
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,938
Do you know how
much that hurt me?

506
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:41,552
And now...
as it turns out

507
00:48:41,577 --> 00:48:45,999
I've shutting Diana out
the same way all this time.

508
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:49,975
And I'm not going to be the kind
of person that does that to a friend.

509
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:52,331
A friend?

510
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:57,767
Mom, we're talking about
a dead person.

511
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:00,782
Oh, sweetie.

512
00:49:01,866 --> 00:49:05,678
Ghosts aren't real.

513
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:09,536
Then, what is she?

514
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,164
Then, what is she?

515
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,909
You can sleep over again
at my place tonight.

516
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:28,552
I'll call CPS in the morning

517
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:31,125
No.

518
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,255
What do you mean "No"?

519
00:49:35,637 --> 00:49:40,039
I know you've been gone a long time,
but she's our mom.

520
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:42,900
She needs us now
more than ever.

521
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,432
Hey.

522
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:48,343
I'm not here for her.
I'm here for you.

523
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:50,062
You're my priority.

524
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,478
I can't just leave her.

525
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:56,677
Okay.
But it's not safe here.

526
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:59,487
It's not safe anywhere.

527
00:50:05,573 --> 00:50:08,021
How long does she usually
stay up in her at night?

528
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,263
Mom?

529
00:50:09,288 --> 00:50:12,247
She doesn't usually come out
again until morning.

530
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:13,212
Okay.

531
00:50:13,237 --> 00:50:17,712
First priority, we put in
some safeguards.

532
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:46,273
Bret and I are going to be
on the couch downstairs.

533
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:47,933
- Okay?
- Okay.

534
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:50,753
Do you want your door
open or close?

535
00:50:50,778 --> 00:50:52,339
Closed.

536
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:54,487
Wait.

537
00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:56,576
Can you...

538
00:50:57,061 --> 00:50:59,426
Can you sleep in here tonight?

539
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:02,505
Sure.

540
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:06,980
I just have to go tell Bret.
I'll be right back.

541
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:47,677
You don't have to stay, you know.

542
00:51:47,702 --> 00:51:49,053
I know.

543
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:52,491
Martin wants me to sleep up
in his room tonight.

544
00:51:52,516 --> 00:51:53,811
Yeah?

545
00:51:54,274 --> 00:51:56,556
He needs you more than
I do right now.

546
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,018
Yeah.

547
00:52:00,303 --> 00:52:01,946
Are you still going to stay?

548
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:05,698
Unless you say otherwise, yeah.

549
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:09,195
It will be kind of hard to sleep
with all these lights on.

550
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:15,447
You must think
we're all crazy.

551
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:17,204
You know...

552
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,462
I don't think that.

553
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,129
Thank you.

554
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,308
You can be this way around me.

555
00:52:33,691 --> 00:52:35,779
I'm not going anywhere.

556
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,219
Bottom drawer.

557
00:52:51,257 --> 00:52:55,989
- What?
- The bottom drawer.

558
00:52:56,735 --> 00:52:58,594
In the dresser.

559
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:02,217
I will clean it out for you.

560
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:04,297
Seriously?

561
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:06,808
No.
Maybe.

562
00:53:08,963 --> 00:53:12,506
- Okay, goodnight.
- Goodnight.

563
00:53:38,178 --> 00:53:39,689
Mom?

564
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,970
Uh, we're staying overnight.

565
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:51,387
Okay, I'll see you in the morning.

566
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,677
Love you.

567
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:03,356
You're staying?

568
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:05,620
Yes.

569
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,125
Good.

570
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,849
Um.
I was... um.

571
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:14,967
I would like...

572
00:54:14,992 --> 00:54:20,177
maybe tomorrow morning to start over,
if that's okay with you.

573
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,539
Yeah.

574
00:54:23,729 --> 00:54:25,391
Of course.

575
00:54:26,938 --> 00:54:31,213
Did you ever hear from Dad?

576
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,931
Letters or...

577
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:38,862
No.

578
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:40,922
I'm sorry.

579
00:54:40,923 --> 00:54:43,956
I wished I had,
I really wish you had.

580
00:54:45,012 --> 00:54:46,893
I know you blame me,
I don't blame you.

581
00:54:46,918 --> 00:54:49,289
No, I don't.

582
00:54:49,314 --> 00:54:52,783
It was his choice to leave,
not yours.

583
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,618
Okay.

584
00:55:03,486 --> 00:55:05,088
Okay.

585
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,666
Good night.

586
00:55:14,325 --> 00:55:16,147
I need help

587
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:33,855
Oh, shit!

588
00:56:24,066 --> 00:56:25,677
Rebecca?

589
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:27,976
Yeah?

590
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,878
Did you find your medicine?

591
00:56:33,948 --> 00:56:35,433
No.

592
00:56:36,297 --> 00:56:38,608
But we'll figure something out.

593
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:40,920
You think so?

594
00:56:43,096 --> 00:56:44,755
Yeah, bud.

595
00:56:45,888 --> 00:56:48,277
We'll make sure she get's better.

596
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:51,080
Okay.

597
00:56:52,047 --> 00:56:54,043
Get some sleep.

598
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,001
Shit!

599
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,405
Bret?

600
00:57:39,309 --> 00:57:40,797
Bret?

601
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,210
Shit.

602
00:58:32,353 --> 00:58:33,834
Shit.

603
00:58:41,669 --> 00:58:43,300
Come on.

604
00:58:47,321 --> 00:58:48,997
Rebecca!

605
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:00,229
Rebecca?

606
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,211
Rebecca?

607
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:27,810
Rebecca?

608
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:35,510
Becca.

609
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:01,763
Nooooo!

610
01:00:18,671 --> 01:00:20,236
Come on.

611
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:23,493
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

612
01:00:23,546 --> 01:00:25,302
Don't leave me again.

613
01:00:25,327 --> 01:00:27,561
- Okay.
- Ever!

614
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:29,707
Hey, alright.

615
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:32,377
I guess nothing's working.

616
01:00:32,402 --> 01:00:34,461
What else could it be?

617
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,238
A trap.

618
01:00:40,198 --> 01:00:41,640
No...

619
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:44,917
No! 
Hey!

620
01:00:44,918 --> 01:00:46,291
Help!

621
01:00:46,316 --> 01:00:48,133
- Help! 
- Bret!

622
01:00:48,158 --> 01:00:50,404
Let us out!

623
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,991
No!

624
01:01:00,004 --> 01:01:01,432
Becks?

625
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:03,635
Let us out!

626
01:01:03,636 --> 01:01:04,994
Becks!

627
01:01:05,019 --> 01:01:07,940
Bret! 
Bret, we're down here!

628
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,677
Alright, Becks, 
hold on.

629
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,388
Mrs. Wells?

630
01:01:17,192 --> 01:01:18,256
- Hello?
- NO!

631
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:19,624
No, Bret!

632
01:01:19,649 --> 01:01:21,008
- Bret!
- Mrs. Wells?

633
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:23,185
Stay in the light, Bret!

634
01:01:23,186 --> 01:01:24,637
Bret!

635
01:01:24,662 --> 01:01:26,280
Okay, Becks, hold on.

636
01:01:42,675 --> 01:01:44,027
Okay.

637
01:02:03,071 --> 01:02:05,063
Oh! 
Bret...

638
01:02:05,064 --> 01:02:08,551
Bret? 
Bret, come here!

639
01:02:31,341 --> 01:02:32,925
Is he leaving?

640
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:34,959
No.

641
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:37,952
No, no. 
He wouldn't do that.

642
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:39,774
You did.

643
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:44,918
Oh.
No!

644
01:02:44,943 --> 01:02:46,766
Oh, come on!

645
01:02:48,357 --> 01:02:50,833
That won't seem last long.

646
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:53,673
We need to find more light.

647
01:03:04,121 --> 01:03:05,729
Rebecca?

648
01:03:09,002 --> 01:03:10,642
Hello?

649
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:17,982
Martin?

650
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,694
Diana, where are you?

651
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:33,771
I told you not to 
hurt my children.

652
01:03:34,339 --> 01:03:37,050
They don't know any better.

653
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,315
Do not threaten me, Diana.

654
01:03:49,965 --> 01:03:52,760
No.
You need me, Diana!

655
01:03:56,157 --> 01:03:58,476
There's no you without me.

656
01:04:03,614 --> 01:04:04,907
Alright.

657
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:10,462
There's something that I should never...

658
01:04:18,425 --> 01:04:20,729
How long are we 
going to be in here?

659
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:22,372
I don't know.

660
01:04:24,891 --> 01:04:26,946
There's no windows.

661
01:04:28,074 --> 01:04:29,523
Yeah.

662
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:32,117
I'm working on a plan.

663
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:34,702
I'm not much help to you.

664
01:04:35,528 --> 01:04:36,571
Hey.

665
01:04:36,596 --> 01:04:39,338
You're doing great.
Okay?

666
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,612
Keep looking through that box.

667
01:04:51,675 --> 01:04:52,932


668
01:04:52,957 --> 01:04:57,318
I found a flashlight,
or something.

669
01:04:58,379 --> 01:05:00,186
It's a black light.

670
01:05:00,304 --> 01:05:02,310
It's still got some juice.

671
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,148
Wait.

672
01:05:04,173 --> 01:05:05,872
Where are you going?

673
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:09,192
To take an inventory.
Keep feeding the fire.

674
01:06:23,712 --> 01:06:25,157
Oh, God!

675
01:06:43,252 --> 01:06:44,907
Oh my god.

676
01:06:44,932 --> 01:06:48,678
JUST LIKE THE HOSPITAL

677
01:06:55,077 --> 01:07:00,279
TRAPPED DOWN HERE IN THE DARK.

678
01:07:12,939 --> 01:07:14,788
Holy shit!

679
01:07:17,999 --> 01:07:25,521
TRYING TO TAKE SOPHIE AWAY FROM ME

680
01:07:27,634 --> 01:07:31,176
JUST LIKE FATHER

681
01:07:34,544 --> 01:07:37,432
Forget Diana.

682
01:08:41,429 --> 01:08:42,967
Let's go!

683
01:08:46,991 --> 01:08:49,092
I saw her. 
She doesn't disappear in is light.

684
01:08:49,093 --> 01:08:49,910
So?

685
01:08:49,935 --> 01:08:52,481
So if we can see, at least
we know where he is.

686
01:08:52,506 --> 01:08:55,190
And maybe we can 
even hurt her with this.

687
01:09:05,036 --> 01:09:06,565
What now?

688
01:09:08,155 --> 01:09:11,530
- Mom!
- Mom!

689
01:09:11,922 --> 01:09:17,823
- Mom!
- Mom!

690
01:09:20,382 --> 01:09:22,096
Are we going to die?

691
01:09:23,923 --> 01:09:25,345
No.

692
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:28,894
We're fighters. You hear me?
We're fighters.

693
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,451
She's in there!
My girlfriend and her family.

694
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,483
Sir, get back in your vehicle.
You need to get to a hospital.

695
01:09:42,484 --> 01:09:46,628
- You need flashlights.
- Get back in your car. Okay?

696
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:50,754
Unit 81, we're at the Marigold house.

697
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:52,839
The power I'm afraid is out, over.

698
01:09:59,134 --> 01:10:00,853
LAPD.

699
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:02,781
Anyone home?

700
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:12,190
Hello?

701
01:10:16,297 --> 01:10:20,329
LAPD, we're responding 
to a domestic disturbance.

702
01:10:20,354 --> 01:10:21,750
We're here!

703
01:10:21,775 --> 01:10:23,799
We're down here!

704
01:10:25,816 --> 01:10:27,483
Help!

705
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:45,666
Diana?

706
01:10:45,691 --> 01:10:49,279
If you hurt my kids,
we're never speaking again!

707
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:57,215
Yeah.
Yeah.

708
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,578
Keep the light us.

709
01:11:02,269 --> 01:11:03,667
Ma'am?

710
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:10,889
Show yourself.

711
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,153
Back off!

712
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:23,689
Oh, God!

713
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:25,275
Andrews?

714
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,269
Oh, my God.

715
01:11:27,974 --> 01:11:29,202
Oh, God!

716
01:11:29,227 --> 01:11:32,764
Unit 99,  get me backup.
Officer down.

717
01:11:36,776 --> 01:11:39,807
Here, take this.
You won't see her either wise.

718
01:11:40,604 --> 01:11:42,067
- Take it!
- Stay back.

719
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:43,533
Take it!

720
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:45,894
- We have to go!
- No. No, we have to get mom!

721
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,851
- No, we got to go!
- I'm not leaving without mom!

722
01:11:48,879 --> 01:11:51,149
- Okay! I'll get it, I promise! Come on!
- No! Becca!

723
01:11:51,174 --> 01:11:53,064
- What?
- How?

724
01:12:03,758 --> 01:12:05,910
What?
What?

725
01:12:07,454 --> 01:12:08,499
Becks!

726
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,828
Go!
Go!

727
01:12:09,853 --> 01:12:11,377
Alright.
Come here, buddy.

728
01:12:11,402 --> 01:12:13,045
Oh god.

729
01:12:13,471 --> 01:12:14,552
Get him out of here.

730
01:12:14,553 --> 01:12:15,720
- No!
- It's okay. Come here.

731
01:12:15,745 --> 01:12:17,325
- Let go of me!
- I got you. I got you.

732
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:18,401
Rebecca!

733
01:12:18,426 --> 01:12:20,091
I'm going to get Mom!

734
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:21,693
Okay.

735
01:12:35,128 --> 01:12:36,597
Mom?

736
01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:03,189
Mom?

737
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:08,957
Stay away...

738
01:13:09,322 --> 01:13:13,985
or I'll show you 
where I put your father.

739
01:13:53,707 --> 01:13:55,861
I told you!

740
01:13:56,749 --> 01:13:59,878
Don't hurt my kids.

741
01:13:59,879 --> 01:14:02,228
Mom, she killed dad.

742
01:14:06,085 --> 01:14:08,664
That won't hurt me.

743
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:12,692
This will.

744
01:14:12,717 --> 01:14:14,578
There's no you without me.

745
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:17,340
No!
Mom, what are you doing?

746
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:19,753
Saving your lives.

747
01:14:25,308 --> 01:14:27,236
NO!

748
01:14:34,228 --> 01:14:35,764
No!

749
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,929
Mom!

750
01:14:45,168 --> 01:14:48,226
I'm here, bud.
I got you.

751
01:15:12,785 --> 01:15:14,188
Here you go.

752
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:19,662
You came back.

753
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:21,448
Of course.

754
01:15:23,942 --> 01:15:25,764
So did you.

755
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:29,405
Yeah

756
01:15:30,753 --> 01:15:33,062
No more running away.

757
01:15:36,548 --> 01:15:38,416
We're here to stay.

758
01:15:43,341 --> 01:15:45,144
Hey, it's okay.

759
01:15:45,702 --> 01:15:47,268
It's nothing.

760
01:15:48,776 --> 01:15:50,788
I got you guys, alright?

761
01:15:50,789 --> 01:15:54,156
Yeah. 
We're never going away.

762
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:58,781
Come here.
