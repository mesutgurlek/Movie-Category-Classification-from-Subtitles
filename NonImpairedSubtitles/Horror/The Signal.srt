1
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,981
Oh, my...

2
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,993
- I can see the...
- What?

3
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:51,083
I can see the keys.

4
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:52,692
The... The... The keys.

5
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:54,197
Here, I can see 'em. Okay?

6
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,833
- I can see 'em outside.
- Okay. Okay.

7
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:56,908
- It's okay.
- Okay.

8
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,659
I'm gonna come back

9
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,755
and I'm gonna bring the keys,

10
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:02,512
and we're gonna be okay. Okay?

11
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,217
- Okay.
- We're gonna be okay.

12
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:06,001
I'm gonna come back.

13
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:20,439
What was that?

14
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,545
That was strange.

15
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:23,995
What?

16
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,424
TV turned itself on.

17
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:28,125
Come back.

18
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,837
Okay.

19
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,067
What time is it?

20
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:47,185
Twelve-fifteen.

21
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,730
You're kidding.

22
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,526
Are you serious?

23
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,448
Oh, God.

24
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,747
I'm sorry, I have to call him.

25
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,089
My phone's out.

26
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,634
Thank you.

27
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,653
Your phone's out too.

28
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:30,395
What?

29
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,731
I have to go.

30
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:45,034
Just... Just sit down
and relax.

31
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,204
I can't relax, Ben.
I've never done this before.

32
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,842
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know how to do this.

33
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:52,208
I don't know
how to do this.

34
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,053
First you just breathe
and then...

35
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:55,837
realize that it's okay.

36
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,682
It's okay? What we're doing?

37
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,841
Do you love
your husband?

38
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,847
It doesn't matter.

39
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,350
All right.

40
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,895
I'm just gonna tell him

41
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,451
that I went and had drinks
with the girls

42
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:20,496
and my phone didn't work.

43
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,864
Makes sense, right?

44
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:25,126
Don't even have time
to shower here.

45
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:28,921
Wouldn't want him
to smell you on me.

46
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,002
You know, you could
just leave him.

47
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,089
It's not that simple, Ben.

48
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,351
I mean, I can't possibly just walk...

49
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:44,562
Anything's possible,
come on.

50
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:45,721
Anything.

51
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,182
You can just drop your stuff
right now

52
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,312
and stay here tonight
and never go back there again.

53
00:05:55,522 --> 00:06:00,406
Or we could...
go up to the rooftop

54
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:02,241
and build an exotic
flower garden,

55
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:06,506
or we could...
take one of my cameras

56
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:08,080
and dress up
like homeless people

57
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,329
and infiltrate their community

58
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,464
and take pictures
of their lives.

59
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:14,415
Or we could take my TV

60
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,708
and throw it off the balcony

61
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,539
and replace it
with coloring books.

62
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,845
Or we could
leave Terminus tomorrow.

63
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,726
New Year's fucking Eve.

64
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,733
We could.

65
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,637
Leave?

66
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:31,109
We'll go down to the station,
we'll walk up to Terminal 13

67
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,397
and we'll get on a train

68
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,646
and we'll get in
our own private compartment.

69
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:40,656
Rip each other's clothes off
and fuck our way to freedom.

70
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,862
We'll go to the country
and start a life.

71
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:48,282
A real life.

72
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,241
Mya and Ben.

73
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,915
New Year's Eve, Terminal 13,
Mya and Ben.

74
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,070
And you don't look back.

75
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,806
That's beautiful.

76
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,423
It's possible.

77
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:15,693
Leave him.

78
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,065
Leave him.

79
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,279
I have to go.

80
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,956
Okay.

81
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,783
Okay.

82
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,983
Heh. What's this?

83
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,788
It's a present.

84
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:39,969
It's a mix CD.
I made it for you.

85
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,223
Because I'm an awesome guy.

86
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:44,923
And I like you.

87
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,244
<i>Follow</i>

88
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:21,677
<i>In silence</i>

89
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,589
<i>Don't walk away</i>

90
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:31,386
<i>In silence</i>

91
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,960
Oh, Jesus.

92
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:55,702
Fuck.

93
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,664
Hello?

94
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,626
I need some help.

95
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,086
What?

96
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,750
Please.
Okay, I...

97
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:08,933
Look, I don't have
any money, all right?

98
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,258
I don't any need money.
I am hurt.

99
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,682
If you could come here a minute.
Please, I need some help.

100
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,180
Please.

101
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:20,519
If you could just come here
a minute. Okay?

102
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,196
Please, for fuck's sake,
you know?

103
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,584
I'm just walking around,
going to my car...

104
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:35,741
Are you okay?

105
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,983
...and now I'm bleeding.

106
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:40,121
Bleeding everywhere.

107
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,092
This guy comes up and cuts me
and he runs away,

108
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:45,178
and I think I...
- Look, okay, all right.

109
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,630
You need to go
to a hospital. Okay?

110
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,301
Oh! Whoa!

111
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,021
Please, just help me
right now. Please.

112
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:56,721
- Please, help me.
- No.

113
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,234
Don't listen to him.
He's crazy.

114
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:00,934
You're out of your mind.

115
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,609
Okay.

116
00:11:44,213 --> 00:11:45,632
<i>And just because you came back early,</i>

117
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:46,867
<i>doesn't mean I will.</i>

118
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:47,999
<i>When I leave here, I'm...</i>

119
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,781
<i>I'm not coming back
into your life.</i>

120
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:51,512
<i>Did you?
Did you have any money?</i>

121
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:53,045
<i>Bullshit. I am tired of it.</i>

122
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,006
<i>I am a woman.
I cook, I clean, I wash.</i>

123
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,269
<i>That's it. It's your deal.
Now, I'm leaving here.</i>

124
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,940
<i>I'm out of here.
Do you hear me? Fuck off.</i>

125
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:04,349
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

126
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,673
Hey.

127
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,841
Hey, Janice.

128
00:12:39,724 --> 00:12:40,668
Lewis is looking for you.

129
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:41,844
I know, thank you.

130
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,856
He's got his friends in there.
You look rough.

131
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:45,149
You've got blood on your shirt.

132
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,017
Huh?

133
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,362
Would you guys
shut the hell up already?

134
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,145
It's 1:00 in the morning!

135
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,023
Thank you, Janice.
I'm going in.

136
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,610
It's not gonna work.

137
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,434
Would you shut up
for two seconds?

138
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:00,972
Damn it, man,
give me a hand here.

139
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:02,458
- What's going on?
- Cable's out.

140
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:03,658
No, outside in the hallway.

141
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,296
This sucks.
It was the best game,

142
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:08,089
probably there ever was.

143
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,038
Where's Lewis?

144
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,207
He's in the bathroom.

145
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,657
Jerry? Jerry, put
the bat down and help me.

146
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:16,055
First, the bat doesn't
get put down, okay?

147
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,229
Jesus Christ.
Where have you been?

148
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,213
I went to have a drink
with the girls.

149
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:22,060
I tried calling you,
but my phone's dead.

150
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:23,796
And then I tried calling you
from the bar,

151
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:25,429
but the phone
was dead there too, so...

152
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,598
Jerry, what are you doing?
Give me the duct...

153
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,986
I decided I was ready to leave,
so I just finally left.

154
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:31,644
- Duct tape.
- But I don't...

155
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,980
Reach your hand out
and give me the tape.

156
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,034
This was to be used
in case of a chemical attack.

157
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:38,151
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry,
Jerry, Jerry.

158
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:40,444
What's going on?

159
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,779
Why isn't anything working?

160
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,573
Everybody's out in the hallway.
Is your phone working?

161
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:48,046
No. I tried calling you.
I didn't know where you were.

162
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,162
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,454
I should have called you

164
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,165
before I left
the restaurant.

165
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,042
- That was stupid.
- Give me the duct...

166
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,796
Who'd you have drinks with?

167
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,601
Donna and Emily.

168
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:03,135
Where'd you go?

169
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,887
Who's Donna?

170
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:09,692
Starbar. Donna's new,
she just started yesterday.

171
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:12,728
- She's a waitress?
- Hostess.

172
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,324
What did you have?

173
00:14:16,325 --> 00:14:17,690
What'd I have?

174
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,152
What did you have to drink?

175
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:26,199
Gin and tonic
and a shot of tequila.

176
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,331
You got something
on your shirt.

177
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,666
Yeah.

178
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,167
What is it?

179
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:39,504
Heh. It's barbecue sauce.

180
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,924
Or something, I don't know.

181
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,678
You reek of perfume.

182
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,015
I don't want to smell
like a restaurant.

183
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,493
I feel gross.

184
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:19,806
You know how much
I love you.

185
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,677
You know how much
I love you.

186
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,939
You can look at me
when you say that.

187
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,800
Did you pay
the cable bill, man?

188
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,976
I'm having a moment
with my wife.

189
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:37,231
Excuse me.

190
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:42,660
Why don't you go wash up?
Get rid of that perfume.

191
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:44,278
I like the way
you sweat.

192
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,672
<i>It's really odd, man.</i>

193
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:09,011
<i>It's the same sound
that's coming from the phone.</i>

194
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,894
Go on, take a shower, Mya.

195
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,162
Hey, put the fucking bat down.

196
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,111
What?

197
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,031
You almost clocked Mya
in the head.

198
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,690
Put the fucking bat down now.

199
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,338
Dude, it's not
hurting anybody.

200
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,761
Oh, just put the bat down.

201
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,762
No. I can't watch the game,

202
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,926
I'm gonna swing the bat,
all right?

203
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:41,766
I told you,
put it down. Sit.

204
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,273
What's the matter
with you?

205
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:45,922
You could hurt somebody.

206
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,913
Why are you looking at me
like that? Stop it.

207
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:49,852
You almost fucking
killed my wife. Sit down.

208
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:51,525
Dude, what is wrong
with you?

209
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:53,513
You almost fucked my wife.

210
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,391
What did you just say?

211
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,029
You almost fucking hit her
in the head.

212
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,729
Okay, okay, okay, boys.

213
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,366
Just relax.
L-Lewis, take a seat.

214
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:04,899
I'm not sitting down.

215
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,194
This is my house.
You guys are my guests.

216
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,915
You're watching my TV.
You're drinking my beer.

217
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,573
This is my baseball bat.

218
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,210
That's my wife
you almost hit.

219
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,119
Lewis, I think maybe we...

220
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,455
Take a shower, baby.

221
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,350
I... Okay. I understand that.

222
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:41,529
You... You're a little aggressive
right now, man.

223
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,181
Why is he staring at me like that?

224
00:17:43,182 --> 00:17:44,782
Shut up.
I'm not even looking at you.

225
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:46,440
You're doing it right now.

226
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,660
Look, look at him.
He's doing it now.

227
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,277
Okay, fellas, look,

228
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,822
just take a deep breath
and sit down, please.

229
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,166
Lewis, God...

230
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:06,086
Lewis!

231
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,005
What?

232
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:11,592
Lewis! What have you done?
What's wrong with you?

233
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,678
Lewis, calm down!

234
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,512
Let go!

235
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,149
- Get off me.
- Let go.

236
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,100
Take a shower, baby.

237
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,573
Lewis, what's the matter with you?

238
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:27,774
Lewis, what have you done?

239
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,750
Janice.

240
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,170
Janice.

241
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,798
Janice. Janice! Janice!

242
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,009
Janice! Janice!

243
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,220
Janice! Janice, the door!

244
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,347
Come inside. Come inside.

245
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,693
Close the door.
Look, you gotta close the door.

246
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:02,892
No, no, you're safe.

247
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,571
Janice, there's a...
There's a man...

248
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:06,103
Stay in here.
Just stay in here.

249
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,742
Just stay in here.
Honey, I'll... Shh. Shh.

250
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:12,704
You're gonna be okay.
You're with me.

251
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:14,821
You're gonna be okay.

252
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,555
Steven, come out here now!

253
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:40,597
Steven, come over here!

254
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,316
Did you hear me?

255
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,530
Steven, help me!

256
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,419
Come here, come here.
Come here.

257
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,231
Mya?

258
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:53,285
Did you get crazy in your head?

259
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,830
How am I supposed to know?
Tell me.

260
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,967
Look me in the eyes.

261
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:01,835
Are you looking?

262
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,847
Look, I'm gonna pull
this duct tape off.

263
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:06,297
You make any unnecessary noises,

264
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,518
I... I'm gonna whack you,
do you understand?

265
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,607
Hm?

266
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,011
Huh?

267
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,642
Did you kill anybody
last night?

268
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,113
How am I supposed to know?
Tell me, I'm...

269
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:23,496
Where... Where did you go?
Where were you?

270
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:27,194
I hid in the apartment
across the hall.

271
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,967
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

272
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:42,500
I-I-I couldn't trust anybody,

273
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,627
I went looking for you,
I couldn't find shit.

274
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,849
Every... Everybody's either dead,
dying or completely flipped.

275
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,351
Mad, crazy.
Why did Lewis hurt Jerry?

276
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:52,635
Hurt? Jerry's dead, lady.

277
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:55,513
Lewis got him.
Fucking snapped.

278
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:58,026
I couldn't get any sense into him.
I got his bat and knocked him out.

279
00:25:58,027 --> 00:26:00,033
I taped him up
so he couldn't hurt anybody else.

280
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:02,019
I had no choice.

281
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,563
Then I saw the hallway.

282
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,565
I've never seen
anything like that.

283
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,952
One out of two people just
started killing each other.

284
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:10,236
They just decided to kill people.

285
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,874
I mean, what... I've never killed
anybody before. What do I do?

286
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,534
I'm not gonna fuck around.
But, you know, what do I do?

287
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,351
<i>So anybody who comes at me,</i>

288
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:33,509
<i>I take 'em out.</i>

289
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,105
<i>No questions asked.
Got to. Anybody.</i>

290
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:38,067
<i>Anybody else,</i>

291
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:39,807
<i>I secure and I put in a safe place.</i>

292
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,527
<i>No telling
who's gonna go crazy next.</i>

293
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:43,352
<i>You got to put 'em up.</i>

294
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:44,729
<i>I pulled the fire alarm.</i>

295
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,368
<i>I don't know why.
Maybe somebody'll come.</i>

296
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:49,859
<i>Maybe they won't.</i>

297
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,789
<i>Maybe they're screwed up too.
So I fight my way to the roof.</i>

298
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,238
<i>Got to see the big picture.</i>

299
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,459
One's got to know,
I have to know, right?

300
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,951
Then I see it, in the streets.

301
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,621
<i>All of Terminus,
it's happening everywhere.</i>

302
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,133
<i>People are going crazy
in their head all over.</i>

303
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:06,536
<i>But first it's just murder,
the crazy</i>

304
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:08,739
<i>kill anybody, everybody, each other.</i>

305
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,838
<i>Indiscriminate,
it looks like chaos.</i>

306
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,715
<i>But then I realized,
they're thinking.</i>

307
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:15,082
<i>Then I really get scared
because it's rational.</i>

308
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,093
They know what they're doing.

309
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,754
I mean, they think it makes sense.

310
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:20,097
But it doesn't make any sense.

311
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,437
It's different for everybody.
Let me tell you,

312
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:24,846
they are gonna
fucking murder the world.

313
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:26,945
And I'm thinking
they all got to die.

314
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:28,940
You know,
but I can't kill 'em all.

315
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,869
I'm thinking that...
That there's too many.

316
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,071
Maybe I'll run.

317
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,270
But run where?

318
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:39,325
I'm thinking...

319
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,421
then I get hit in the head.

320
00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:43,845
Is it so bad?

321
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:46,165
You'll be fine.

322
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,959
Fucker has a hammer.

323
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,846
<i>I have a hammer go
into my head.</i>

324
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:52,338
<i>So I smash his face.</i>

325
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,301
<i>And I realize he's not crazy.</i>

326
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,637
<i>He thinks I'm crazy.</i>

327
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,143
I'm not crazy.

328
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,822
He's hurt really bad,
so I finish him.

329
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,324
I taped up 12 people
last night.

330
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,161
All of them had been killed
by morning.

331
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,998
All but Lewis.

332
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,459
What do I do?

333
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:47,352
Yeah, we go. We go.

334
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,479
We walk out that door

335
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,859
and we start walking,
and we don't stop.

336
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:58,810
We don't stop.
We don't talk to anybody.

337
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:02,502
We don't draw attention
to ourselves.

338
00:29:02,503 --> 00:29:05,260
We just keep walking.

339
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:07,914
And we go to my car...

340
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:11,219
We go to my car, and we get in

341
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,711
and we drive.

342
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,175
Okay?

343
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:23,180
We do this right now.

344
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,359
We drive?

345
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,642
Yeah.

346
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:29,561
Where we gonna go?

347
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:45,076
Is it safe?

348
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:47,547
Come on, Rod, keep walking.

349
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:49,957
Walk, Rod!

350
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:53,251
Hey! Roger?

351
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,263
Is that you?
Keep walking, Rod.

352
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:57,171
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Rod!

353
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:59,017
Maybe... Maybe she's
just confused.

354
00:29:59,018 --> 00:30:01,051
Rod!
Um, do you, uh...?

355
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:03,595
- Rod!
- Do you have the crazy?

356
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:07,975
Fuck.

357
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:13,689
You fucking bitch.

358
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:20,237
You fucking bitch,
you fucking bitch!

359
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,748
Fuck.

360
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:50,401
Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait.

361
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:52,936
Wait! Wait!

362
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,480
What are you...? Wait!

363
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:04,531
I got a gun.

364
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,838
I got shot.

365
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:24,477
I got shot, and you were gonna
leave me back there.

366
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:26,052
Put your seat belt on.

367
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,429
You were gonna leave me, and...

368
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,067
Fuck! Yeah, fuck right,
you were gonna leave me.

369
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:32,893
Can't trust anyone.

370
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,817
Fuck, the radio too.

371
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:43,830
Turn it off.
Rod, turn the fucking radio off.

372
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:45,404
Do you hear that?

373
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:47,625
Do you think I wanted to kill
those people? I had to!

374
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:49,159
I'm sorry.

375
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:51,869
Goddamn it. Goddamn it!

376
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,798
Now I'm gonna fucking bleed to death.

377
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,675
You're gonna be okay.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

378
00:31:55,676 --> 00:31:57,244
I don't wanna die like this.

379
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:59,127
You're gonna be okay, Rod.

380
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:02,255
You're lying.

381
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,809
You're lying to me.
We should not be out here.

382
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,145
We should have stayed.
I trusted you.

383
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:08,469
Please be quiet, Rod.

384
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,054
Look at me, you fucking crazy bitch.

385
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,817
I'm bleeding to death!
Please be quiet. Shut up!

386
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:14,392
You shot me in the stomach.

387
00:32:14,393 --> 00:32:16,863
You left me to bleed
in the street.

388
00:32:16,864 --> 00:32:18,807
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

389
00:32:18,808 --> 00:32:21,066
I'm not saying anything.

390
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,116
What are you doing?

391
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,200
Don't leave me.

392
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:58,162
You're crazy, Rod.

393
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:01,050
Just like all those
other people.

394
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:04,253
Don't.
I don't have the crazy.

395
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:13,302
Are you okay?

396
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:15,681
Don't come near me.

397
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,306
I'm just trying to help.

398
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,141
Hey, it's not safe
out here.

399
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:22,739
I've got a place here.
You should come inside.

400
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,689
Where are you going?

401
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,889
I'm going to Terminal 13
to meet somebody

402
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,037
and we're gonna leave
this fucking town

403
00:34:29,038 --> 00:34:30,105
and never look back.

404
00:34:30,106 --> 00:34:31,070
Do you understand?

405
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,864
Don't fucking follow me.

406
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,663
Well, what about
the guy in the car?

407
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:21,005
I know what you're thinking.

408
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:23,122
You don't have to say it.

409
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:27,126
No need to tell me,
'cause I already know.

410
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,379
You think this party is
a bad idea.

411
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:34,968
I just don't think we can have
people over right now.

412
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,600
I'll just tell them that
the party's been canceled.

413
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:48,106
Clark?

414
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:52,610
You look chapped.

415
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,111
This is a dress-up party
here tonight.

416
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:56,291
Anna, I need a couple of things
that Ken borrowed,

417
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,776
namely my hatchet.

418
00:35:57,777 --> 00:35:59,576
And some garbage bags.

419
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,757
Ken, I'm gonna need
that hatchet you borrowed.

420
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:07,000
I also need to borrow
a couple of, um...

421
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,054
He's dead.

422
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:11,922
Yeah.

423
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:18,146
I'm going to turn
our program on.

424
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:20,680
Sounds glorious.
Heh.

425
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,567
How many more balloons
do you think we need?

426
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:23,850
At least seven.

427
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,069
That's how many
I was thinking.

428
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,603
Well, that's why
you married me.

429
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,372
Honey?

430
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:48,249
What is it?

431
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,503
Honey,
people are coming over.

432
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,554
Honey.

433
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:56,505
Honey.

434
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,093
You're hurting me.

435
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:02,472
Stop, honey,
you're hurting me!

436
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,392
Honey, stop!

437
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:22,168
Oh, my God.

438
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:24,368
I know.

439
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,215
He's kind of gross now.

440
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:29,333
Anna, I'm sorry.

441
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:32,512
Are you mad at me
for killing your friend?

442
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:33,503
What?

443
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:35,824
I know he's your friend
and all.

444
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:37,225
We weren't that close.

445
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:39,102
Well, you always
helped him fix stuff.

446
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:40,593
I'm your landlord.

447
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,230
I know,
but are you mad at me?

448
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:43,179
No.

449
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,355
You did what you had to do.

450
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:49,380
We all do what
we have to do sometimes.

451
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,271
Oh, shit.

452
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,650
What are you doing?

453
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:41,331
So I guess we're
in this together.

454
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:43,030
What should we do now?

455
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,251
I'm still trying
to figure out that one.

456
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:47,244
What if my party guests
show up?

457
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:51,445
Anna, I don't know
if you know this,

458
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:54,052
but there is some
seriously insane shit

459
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:56,351
going on out there
right now.

460
00:38:56,352 --> 00:38:58,964
People are losing
their minds.

461
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:03,853
There's a bad sector
in the electromagnetic spectrum,

462
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:06,470
which is causing the rift
in logical thinking.

463
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:09,850
Rational behavior has given way
to pri... Primordial action.

464
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,272
We've reached
a critical juncture

465
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:18,816
in the consistency
of everyday living.

466
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:21,371
Societal norms are being
completely abandoned.

467
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:24,030
Anarchy has replaced etiquette.

468
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,084
Chaos is the ruling class
of this civilization.

469
00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:28,086
So I think coming to
a goddamn New Year's Eve party

470
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:30,454
is the last thing
on people's minds!

471
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,462
All right.

472
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:42,215
You get rid of them,

473
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:43,967
I'm gonna move Ken
into the bedroom.

474
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,313
Well, what...
What should I say?

475
00:39:47,314 --> 00:39:49,180
Anything.

476
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:52,110
Just don't let them in,
no matter what.

477
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:54,353
Okay.

478
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:57,563
Yes?

479
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,023
Pest control.

480
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:01,067
There's no party, thanks.

481
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:03,445
Somebody here call
an exterminator?

482
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:06,531
We don't have bugs!

483
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,199
Think they were rats, ma'am.

484
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,378
Your husband
must have called it in.

485
00:40:10,379 --> 00:40:12,078
- Ken?
- Yeah.

486
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,998
- Ken.
- Hey, we're fine.

487
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:28,730
Thank God it's you.

488
00:40:28,731 --> 00:40:29,679
You're alive.

489
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,983
Wait, do you have it?

490
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:34,059
Are you crazy?

491
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,435
Look...

492
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,489
I know you left me
in the chair

493
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,491
because you'd thought
I lost it.

494
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:41,440
But I didn't.

495
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,692
I saw your car outside,

496
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:44,601
and I thought
the worst had happened.

497
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:46,015
<i>I thought that one of the...</i>

498
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:48,374
<i>One of those people
had gotten you</i>

499
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,043
<i>and taken you away from me.</i>

500
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:52,091
They can't get to you.

501
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:54,454
No one can get
to you.

502
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,458
What's this, now?

503
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,807
Stop, what are you doing?

504
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:06,299
Don't do that to him.

505
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,603
He was coming at you, I thought
he might be one of them.

506
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:10,193
He's my friend,
he's helping me.

507
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:11,679
You can't do that
to friends.

508
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,733
Looked like he was going
to try and hurt you.

509
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:16,436
He's Clark, you idiot.
He's not gonna hurt me.

510
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:17,596
You can't trust anybody
right now.

511
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:19,405
Oh, his poor eyes
are burning.

512
00:41:19,406 --> 00:41:20,865
Mya, I'm sorry.

513
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:22,482
Who's Mya?

514
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:32,325
I'll... check in the bathroom

515
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,536
to see if there's anything
to flush the poison with.

516
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:36,997
Don't go in there!

517
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,583
Don't go in there!

518
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:45,890
What do you have here?

519
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,601
It's, you know, Ken.

520
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:49,962
He's napping.

521
00:41:49,963 --> 00:41:51,372
He looks dead.

522
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:53,096
- He is.
- I see.

523
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:55,399
- Who did this?
- I did.

524
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,859
But I didn't want to.

525
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,101
You killed him?

526
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:00,613
And Clark killed somebody too.

527
00:42:00,614 --> 00:42:02,620
I didn't... I did.

528
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,524
It was self-defense.

529
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:05,869
You chopped
his head off.

530
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,277
He had it coming.

531
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:10,154
Probably.

532
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:11,823
These are wild times.

533
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:15,628
Everybody's being driven
to desperate measures.

534
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:17,155
I guess this happens
to everybody.

535
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:18,997
I've got something
to show you too.

536
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,715
You just don't know
who to trust right now.

537
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:54,491
Mya.

538
00:43:18,182 --> 00:43:20,142
Where's Mya?

539
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:24,187
Untie me.

540
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:33,572
Fuck.

541
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:57,888
You're him.

542
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,725
Rod!

543
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:26,926
The TV must have gotten
into his head

544
00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:28,668
and told him to kill you.

545
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:30,211
Yeah, that's
what happened to Ken.

546
00:44:30,212 --> 00:44:32,965
He was watching TV
and it made him go bad.

547
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:41,733
This is, without a doubt,
the most fucked up day

548
00:44:41,734 --> 00:44:43,809
in the history
of mankind.

549
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:46,478
We should get back inside.

550
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:49,231
Who wants cocktails?

551
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:45,630
Party guests.

552
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:47,581
Act natural.

553
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:53,669
Hi.
You've got to help me.

554
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,224
My mom was trying to kill me and
so I ran over her with the car

555
00:45:56,225 --> 00:45:58,564
and my dad was in the house
and he made the dog die

556
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:00,853
because it tried to bite me
and I left in the car,

557
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:02,428
and I didn't know where to go

558
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,524
and I remembered
that Anna and Ken lived here,

559
00:46:04,525 --> 00:46:05,775
and I'm Laura.

560
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:06,906
Laura.

561
00:46:06,907 --> 00:46:08,352
Anna!

562
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,728
Laura!

563
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,898
What the fuck?

564
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:24,910
You killed Laura.

565
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:27,371
She was coming at you.

566
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,174
Stay away from me.

567
00:46:30,175 --> 00:46:32,166
You killed Laura!

568
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,012
She was heading for you
with that knife.

569
00:46:34,013 --> 00:46:35,763
She doesn't have a knife!

570
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:37,339
That's a key chain.

571
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:52,437
I was trying
to protect you.

572
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:04,615
Oof.

573
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:06,878
It's okay. It's okay.

574
00:47:06,879 --> 00:47:08,661
It's okay.

575
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:10,788
It's all right.

576
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,383
He beat her face in.

577
00:47:12,384 --> 00:47:14,000
I know.

578
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:16,054
I know, and I'm gonna
find out what happened,

579
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:19,390
but I... I need you
to be strong for me.

580
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:21,382
Okay?

581
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:24,062
Laura might have
actually wanted to hurt you.

582
00:47:24,063 --> 00:47:26,805
Her puppy's name
was Charlie Man.

583
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,985
We don't know where Laura
was at in her head.

584
00:47:30,986 --> 00:47:32,894
We don't, okay?

585
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:35,740
For all we know, she might have
received this cancerous signal.

586
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:38,268
This hypnotic frequency
that's all around. All right?

587
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:41,534
She might have transmitted it,
from her car radio.

588
00:47:41,535 --> 00:47:44,697
Or the television, or...
Or s... Stereo, or...

589
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:48,327
We don't know. Everybody's
a suspect right now. Everyone.

590
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,205
Turn that off!

591
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:56,761
Why'd you turn that on?

592
00:47:56,762 --> 00:47:58,211
I didn't. She did.

593
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,619
When the TV went on,

594
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,839
she came back to life.

595
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,175
She's trying to get me.
Ah...

596
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,386
Get back at me
for what I did to her.

597
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,932
God, this is getting
to be ridiculous.

598
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:22,611
Ah...

599
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:32,537
God in heaven!

600
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,259
Just open the door
and then I'll take them down.

601
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,750
That's not the way
to play this.

602
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,304
We can't be sure.
We have to exterminate

603
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:40,336
with extreme prejudice.

604
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:42,432
It might be somebody
who could help us.

605
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,216
We don't know.

606
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,634
We can't risk it.

607
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,679
I'm killing whoever walks
through that door.

608
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,226
It's Jim.

609
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:56,602
It's Jim Parsons.

610
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:59,157
Trust no one.
You were the one watching TV.

611
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:01,440
I told you,
I wasn't watching the TV.

612
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:04,278
Listen, if I had it, I would
have killed you by now, right?

613
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:06,914
I guess.

614
00:49:06,915 --> 00:49:09,500
I'm fine, and you're fine,
and she's fine.

615
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:11,117
This we know.

616
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:13,203
But he may not be
and probably isn't.

617
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:15,986
You might be right.

618
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:17,874
He might be infected.

619
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,344
Then we'd have to kill Jim.

620
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:22,461
Jim Parsons.

621
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,715
Maybe if we're quiet,
he'll go away.

622
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:28,885
He wants in... to get us!
Shh!

623
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:57,414
He's gone.

624
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,086
Sweet...

625
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:04,504
Clark.

626
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:06,714
Clark, is that you?

627
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:08,382
I have to let the poor guy in,

628
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:09,685
he might be in trouble.

629
00:50:09,686 --> 00:50:10,937
Please, let me handle this.

630
00:50:10,938 --> 00:50:12,485
If he's not okay,

631
00:50:12,486 --> 00:50:14,348
I'll kill him myself.

632
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,268
Don't leave me out here, man.

633
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:21,760
Clark, come on, let me in.

634
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:23,465
Jim? Yeah, it's me, Clark.

635
00:50:23,466 --> 00:50:25,484
Hey, Clark. Let me in.

636
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,404
Okay, just give me a second.

637
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,740
Come on, buddy.

638
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:36,119
I ain't got any...
Anywhere else to go tonight.

639
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,412
Clark.

640
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:41,124
You've just got
to turn the handle. Heh.

641
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:09,528
Where is everybody?

642
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:13,208
Oh, I'm early.

643
00:51:13,209 --> 00:51:15,366
Early?

644
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:16,410
The shindig.

645
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:18,411
The fiesta?

646
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,789
It's tonight, right?

647
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,000
It better be.

648
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:26,095
When that ball drops,
I'm gonna grab a slut

649
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:27,879
and I'm just gonna pee
in her butt.

650
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:33,728
Jim, are you aware that...?
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

651
00:51:33,729 --> 00:51:35,553
Uh, Jim. Jim Parsons.

652
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,806
Jim Parsons, this is, um...

653
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:39,984
Lewis.
Lewis.

654
00:51:39,985 --> 00:51:42,095
Lewis.

655
00:51:42,096 --> 00:51:44,103
Clark.

656
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,106
Lewis and Clark.

657
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:49,109
Where's Sacajawea?

658
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:53,864
I would totally fuck
an Indian girl. I would.

659
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:00,328
Uh, those kind,
if I ever saw one.

660
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:03,091
I would just take her back
to the tepee,

661
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:04,999
"Oh, nice little squaw.

662
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,585
Oh, peel my corn," you know?

663
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,600
Seriously, is there gonna be
some pussy here tonight?

664
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:14,383
'Cause I really don't
want to, um,

665
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:17,521
make out with
my two brave explorers here.

666
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:20,608
So you're...
You're here for the party?

667
00:52:20,609 --> 00:52:22,601
You know this, yeah.

668
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:26,322
Are Ken and Anna around?

669
00:52:26,323 --> 00:52:28,898
Anna's, uh, getting ready.

670
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:32,745
And Ken is just laying down
for a second.

671
00:52:32,746 --> 00:52:34,112
He's dead tired.

672
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:38,877
Can I get you
a cocktail, Jim?

673
00:52:38,878 --> 00:52:41,244
Oh, yeah, please.

674
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,526
Put that in the fridge.

675
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:44,122
I'll get that later.

676
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:50,754
Hm.

677
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:54,392
It says Lewis on your shirt.
Heh-heh.

678
00:52:54,393 --> 00:52:56,801
That's funny.

679
00:52:56,802 --> 00:52:59,221
I didn't even see it.
Place looks good.

680
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:58,446
Ken.

681
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:00,699
I knew you'd get better.

682
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:06,556
She's got nice boobs
in there.

683
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:12,229
I hope she has
some cute friends.

684
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:14,856
That'd be nice.

685
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:17,651
I went
to a party last year.

686
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,164
Everybody started kissing
each other, you know,

687
00:55:21,165 --> 00:55:23,833
at midnight,
like the tradition, or...

688
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:25,616
How did that start? Heh.

689
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:28,483
Everybody starts kissing
each other,

690
00:55:28,484 --> 00:55:31,299
and I had no one else
to kiss, so I,

691
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,625
just as a joke,
kissed the dog.

692
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,961
But then I realized
when I got home

693
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:39,381
I made out with the dog
for my New Year's.

694
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:42,634
It's wrong.

695
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:45,803
Tonight I really wouldn't mind

696
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:48,015
just cleaning out my pipes,
you know?

697
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:51,694
Maybe a ménage à three
in there.

698
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,197
Clark's been
in there a long time.

699
00:55:54,198 --> 00:55:55,647
You know...

700
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:59,744
she's with everybody,
I guess.

701
00:55:59,745 --> 00:56:01,668
You.

702
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:03,318
Me.

703
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:04,864
Clark.

704
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:06,658
The milkman.

705
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,537
She's damaged goods.

706
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:13,237
Somebody should just...

707
00:56:13,238 --> 00:56:15,626
put her out of her misery.

708
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,545
That's my wife.

709
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,548
What?

710
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:26,062
That's not your wife,
that's Ken's wife.

711
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:28,429
Your wife's not here.

712
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,015
Your wife has gone
far away...

713
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,476
out of your sight

714
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:36,188
where you can't
help her anymore.

715
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,158
You don't know
what you're saying.

716
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:41,150
No.

717
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:44,122
You don't know
what you're saying.

718
00:56:44,123 --> 00:56:45,321
That TV got in your brain

719
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:48,200
and has, uh, distorted
your perception.

720
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:51,912
I'm not crazy
like those others.

721
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:54,873
No, man.

722
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:58,626
You're much worse off

723
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:01,213
'cause you don't even realize
what's happening to you.

724
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:05,184
Heh. You don't even know.

725
00:57:05,185 --> 00:57:08,313
Your wife left you, alone,

726
00:57:08,314 --> 00:57:09,846
tied to a chair,

727
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:11,264
helpless so the world could
take your life

728
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:14,726
and the savages could feast
on your bloody remains.

729
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:18,730
No. She's here.

730
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,071
She's fine.

731
00:57:21,072 --> 00:57:22,646
<i>Sorry.</i>

732
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:24,746
<i>But that's just not true.</i>

733
00:57:24,747 --> 00:57:26,822
I love you, Ken.

734
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:30,606
<i>But I know where she is,</i>

735
00:57:30,607 --> 00:57:32,702
<i>and I'm going to find her</i>

736
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:34,668
and free her of the burden
of being the used up,

737
00:57:34,669 --> 00:57:37,759
adulterous whore
that she is.

738
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,666
I'm going to get to her.

739
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:41,169
I'm gonna get to her
before you

740
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:43,463
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

741
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,772
My wife's in there,

742
00:57:51,773 --> 00:57:53,639
and she's upset

743
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,018
because I accidentally
killed her friend.

744
00:57:57,686 --> 00:57:59,854
But she's safe now

745
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:02,012
and you can't get to her.

746
00:58:02,013 --> 00:58:04,484
I won't let you get to her.

747
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:07,863
What?

748
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:10,416
That was kind of odd.

749
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:12,492
What are you saying?

750
00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:15,495
Where is she?

751
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:17,925
Who?

752
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:19,458
My wife.

753
00:58:19,817 --> 00:58:22,162
How the hell do I know?
I just met you.

754
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:24,185
I didn't know
you were married.

755
00:58:24,186 --> 00:58:25,890
That's kind of...
Kind of cool.

756
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:28,383
I wish I was married.

757
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:35,474
What'd you do that for?

758
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:39,216
Where's my wife?

759
00:58:39,217 --> 00:58:41,396
Where's Mya?

760
00:58:42,314 --> 00:58:44,242
She's fine.
She didn't leave me.

761
00:58:44,243 --> 00:58:46,360
She loves me and only me.

762
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:48,704
And everything is going

763
00:58:48,705 --> 00:58:50,697
to be safe and quiet.

764
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:08,433
Don't touch her.

765
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:10,216
She was just upset,

766
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:11,426
and I was consoling her.

767
00:59:12,845 --> 00:59:14,898
Please leave us alone,
we don't want you here.

768
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:16,472
I'm trying to have
an intimate moment

769
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:18,225
with my husband
before the end of the world.

770
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:21,853
But I'm your husband.

771
00:59:22,847 --> 00:59:24,587
You're not my husband.

772
00:59:25,263 --> 00:59:27,317
You're a homicidal maniac.

773
00:59:29,118 --> 00:59:30,410
But I killed him
for you.

774
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:33,448
I didn't want that,
and I didn't ask for it.

775
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:39,973
And the last person
I want to die with is you.

776
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,584
Ken.

777
00:59:44,585 --> 00:59:45,845
I think he's gonna kill us.

778
00:59:45,846 --> 00:59:48,337
I'm not Ken.

779
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,132
Okay? Look, that's Ken!

780
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:57,096
Shit, o... Okay.

781
00:59:57,097 --> 01:00:00,443
No, I... I'm Ken.
I can be Ken.

782
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:01,768
You're not Ken.

783
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:04,813
She's not Mya.

784
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:08,108
Look, I'll be whoever you guys
want me to be.

785
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:10,151
If she's not Mya,

786
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:12,830
that means you did something
to Mya.

787
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:15,875
No, no, no, no.
She can be Mya.

788
01:00:15,876 --> 01:00:17,340
Right? Right.

789
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:19,119
Mya, Mya... Ah!

790
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:02,014
Look at me. Look at me.

791
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:26,256
So I was admittedly
a little fucked up earlier.

792
01:02:26,257 --> 01:02:28,122
It's been
a crazy day for me

793
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:31,052
as I'm sure it has been
for you as well.

794
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:33,596
But I get it now.
You're not Mya.

795
01:02:33,597 --> 01:02:35,421
You never were Mya.

796
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:37,966
You're just some other woman
that doesn't matter.

797
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,398
So, what I need you
to tell me...

798
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:42,888
so that we don't have
to stretch this out

799
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:45,173
any longer than either
of us wants to...

800
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,019
where is Mya?

801
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,900
Where is my wife?

802
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:08,131
Answer me or you get
the spray again.

803
01:03:08,132 --> 01:03:10,832
Where is Mya?

804
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:24,638
I can't see.

805
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:27,121
She has to be here somewhere.

806
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:29,679
Her car is outside.
I know she's been here.

807
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,697
I can smell her perfume
all over this place.

808
01:03:32,698 --> 01:03:35,524
We were having a party.

809
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:39,579
I need to know
where she is.

810
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:42,223
I have to find her.

811
01:03:42,224 --> 01:03:44,476
I love her.
I have to save her.

812
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:47,618
I gotta see

813
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:50,163
so I can have a party.

814
01:03:50,164 --> 01:03:52,727
Look, I know
my wife came in here,

815
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:55,713
so tell me where you're
hiding her or where she went,

816
01:03:55,714 --> 01:03:57,681
so I can kill you
and get it over with,

817
01:03:57,682 --> 01:04:00,099
and then I'll know
where she is.

818
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,259
Where's Ken?

819
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:06,304
I want to see Ken.

820
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:08,127
Ken's enjoying the party.

821
01:04:08,128 --> 01:04:09,952
Ken. I...

822
01:04:10,601 --> 01:04:12,737
I want to see you.

823
01:04:12,738 --> 01:04:14,771
Ken? Ken?

824
01:04:21,195 --> 01:04:23,822
What are you doing to her?

825
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:28,580
It's time
to go home now.

826
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:31,699
Ken, I am home, silly.

827
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:43,508
Oh, my God.

828
01:04:53,936 --> 01:04:57,271
You. You know.

829
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:59,774
You know
where she went.

830
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:01,968
You're wrong.
You're wrong, man.

831
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:03,062
You're seeing things wrong.

832
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:06,082
The stuff that's in your head
is not real.

833
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:08,585
You'll see things
the way I'm seeing them.

834
01:05:08,586 --> 01:05:10,160
You just
gotta understand.

835
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:14,359
Understand the message
coming through.

836
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,135
No, it's making people think
the wrong things.

837
01:05:17,136 --> 01:05:19,670
Everything is not what it seems.

838
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:23,728
I was misunderstanding it
before, but I get it now.

839
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:26,259
It's telling me
what I should do.

840
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,006
What I should want.

841
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,557
I want my wife,
and I want my home.

842
01:05:30,558 --> 01:05:34,277
And I want all of you people
to stop bothering us.

843
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:37,389
So tell me
where she is.

844
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:40,398
You can't just kill...

845
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:41,868
What's in your head
to tell you...

846
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:44,152
It's not what...

847
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:47,906
It's a... It's a poisonous,
radioactive...

848
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,926
You had to kill
those people, didn't you?

849
01:05:57,927 --> 01:06:00,126
That's right.

850
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,056
They were keeping you
from happiness.

851
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:05,605
Now you understand.

852
01:06:05,606 --> 01:06:08,102
I wanna be happy.

853
01:06:08,103 --> 01:06:10,052
You will.

854
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:11,397
You will if you let go

855
01:06:11,398 --> 01:06:13,640
and tell me.

856
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,089
Tell me where she went.

857
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:18,931
Terminal 13.

858
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:23,576
She said she was going
to Terminal 13 to get out.

859
01:06:23,577 --> 01:06:25,846
Get out of, uh, Terminus.

860
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:26,965
See?

861
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,909
See how easy that was?

862
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:15,637
You're him.

863
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:23,729
Rod!

864
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:43,874
Fuck.

865
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:00,450
Come on.

866
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:05,288
Stand up. Come on.

867
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:07,374
Oh, don't do that.
Get up.

868
01:11:27,035 --> 01:11:29,998
See how easy that was?

869
01:11:57,082 --> 01:11:58,082
Stop.

870
01:12:01,228 --> 01:12:02,690
Please stop.

871
01:12:04,758 --> 01:12:06,598
Please stop, Lewis.

872
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:10,050
I'm not Lewis.

873
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:45,936
I really need your help, Okay?

874
01:12:48,969 --> 01:12:52,027
The girl in the car outside.
Did you see her?

875
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:55,869
Did you see where she went?

876
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:58,482
Look, everything's going to be fine. Okay?

877
01:12:58,703 --> 01:13:01,747
But I need you to listen to me, okay?

878
01:13:01,748 --> 01:13:05,352
Just listen. If you listen to me,
I can help you make it go away.

879
01:13:06,161 --> 01:13:07,161
Okay?

880
01:13:08,621 --> 01:13:11,217
Who are you? What's your name?

881
01:13:14,253 --> 01:13:17,563
- Na...
- Just tell me your name.

882
01:13:18,271 --> 01:13:19,859
It's... Clark...

883
01:13:21,812 --> 01:13:23,316
- I'm Clark.
- Hi, Clark.

884
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:26,459
- Um... I'm Ben.
- Ben.

885
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:31,630
We need to get out of here right now.
All right?

886
01:13:33,128 --> 01:13:34,128
Um...

887
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:36,661
No, no.

888
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,670
- You just hold on.
- No, no, no!

889
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:41,535
It's all right. Alright?
It might hurt, just a little bit.

890
01:13:41,536 --> 01:13:42,536
No, no, no, no!

891
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:50,405
Wait! Wait! Wait!

892
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:54,334
Clark!

893
01:13:57,858 --> 01:13:58,858
Clark!

894
01:14:01,089 --> 01:14:03,223
Clark. I need your help.

895
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:07,901
Clark?

896
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:11,345
Clark?

897
01:14:11,808 --> 01:14:13,060
Clark?

898
01:14:21,185 --> 01:14:23,571
Clark? Open the door!

899
01:14:24,218 --> 01:14:25,370
Right now?

900
01:14:35,486 --> 01:14:36,486
Clark?

901
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:38,251
Lewis Denton.

902
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:42,937
<i>Open the door!</i>

903
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:44,210
Listen to me.

904
01:14:44,211 --> 01:14:45,211
<i>Open the fucking door!</i>

905
01:14:45,545 --> 01:14:46,545
The car. The one that's wrecked.

906
01:14:46,754 --> 01:14:48,776
The one that's outside...
the girl inside there...

907
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:50,582
where... where did she go?

908
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:53,263
- I told you already!
- Not me, that wasn't me.

909
01:14:54,686 --> 01:14:56,358
We've got to find her.

910
01:14:57,578 --> 01:15:00,090
- I don't know. I don't know.
- I need you to do me a favor.

911
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:05,060
- Maybe he knows.
- Open the door, all right?

912
01:15:06,818 --> 01:15:08,406
He was with her.

913
01:15:09,094 --> 01:15:11,675
Man, he's not going to be able
to talk to us.

914
01:15:11,676 --> 01:15:13,656
I killed him.

915
01:15:14,245 --> 01:15:15,245
Didn't I?

916
01:15:17,215 --> 01:15:18,749
Think back. Okay?

917
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:22,102
Did he say anything before... he died?

918
01:15:22,749 --> 01:15:24,043
Oh God!

919
01:15:25,502 --> 01:15:26,502
Fuck!

920
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,640
He's going to help us, all right?

921
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:29,449
We just gotta get the brains fired.

922
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:31,409
What?

923
01:15:31,812 --> 01:15:33,909
If we stimulate the pre-motor cortex...
we can...

924
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:36,296
we can definitely restore
some limited speech patterns.

925
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:37,589
Right?

926
01:15:37,914 --> 01:15:40,216
Okay. Sure, do it.

927
01:15:41,028 --> 01:15:43,750
- Oh God! Oh God!
- Just relax. Relax.

928
01:15:44,288 --> 01:15:46,451
Just hold on. I got this, okay?

929
01:15:46,452 --> 01:15:49,846
You just finish jump starting your head.
Okay?

930
01:15:49,931 --> 01:15:51,099
Okay.

931
01:15:53,226 --> 01:15:54,478
Clark?

932
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:57,930
All right then!

933
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:14,331
Fuck you want...?

934
01:16:14,492 --> 01:16:15,828
Can you hear me?

935
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:18,761
Got a smoke?

936
01:16:19,495 --> 01:16:20,495
I don't smoke.

937
01:16:21,038 --> 01:16:22,794
Ask him about the girl.

938
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:27,042
Want to know about the girl,
give me a cig...

939
01:16:27,673 --> 01:16:29,849
cigarette.
- He wants a cigarette.

940
01:16:30,247 --> 01:16:31,247
What?

941
01:16:34,954 --> 01:16:37,298
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

942
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:51,455
What's he saying?

943
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:54,559
Where'd she go?

944
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:01,311
She told you she went to Terminal 13.

945
01:17:01,732 --> 01:17:02,732
Bitch.

946
01:17:03,746 --> 01:17:04,745
Terminal 13.

947
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:07,846
She said she was going to terminal 13.

948
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:12,717
Terminal 13.

949
01:17:17,456 --> 01:17:18,502
No!

950
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:21,309
- She was going to find you.
- Nobody leaves Terminus.

951
01:17:22,403 --> 01:17:26,469
Hey, he also says
that no one can leave Terminus.

952
01:17:26,835 --> 01:17:30,353
Because it's an impossibility, so...
That's what's there.

953
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:31,522
- Is that right?
- Ya.

954
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:34,562
Good work.

955
01:17:38,864 --> 01:17:43,896
You're aware you're having a conversation
with a decapitated head. Right?

956
01:17:45,315 --> 01:17:47,949
Listen to me. Listen.

957
01:17:47,992 --> 01:17:48,992
Listen to me.

958
01:17:50,876 --> 01:17:54,383
Do you hear that... listen...

959
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:57,568
It's past the noise in your head.

960
01:17:58,188 --> 01:18:00,472
That is the natural world...

961
01:18:00,473 --> 01:18:01,991
that has been here a long time before us.

962
01:18:01,992 --> 01:18:04,363
It's going to be here
a long time after we are gone.

963
01:18:04,406 --> 01:18:06,501
That is real.

964
01:18:06,712 --> 01:18:10,261
And that... is what we focus on.

965
01:18:10,346 --> 01:18:12,258
Past the noise.

966
01:18:12,301 --> 01:18:13,889
Ya.

967
01:18:15,698 --> 01:18:19,960
This calls for a radical reassessment
of all the facts.

968
01:18:20,045 --> 01:18:21,343
<i>Clark?</i>

969
01:18:21,386 --> 01:18:22,529
<i>Lewis Denton again...</i>

970
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:26,482
<i>Look man, ahh... I think I found
that your sledge hammer out here so</i>

971
01:18:26,483 --> 01:18:29,239
<i>I'm going to borrow it for a second,
if that's okay.</i>

972
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,256
<i>I'm going to knock this door
off its fucking hinges.</i>

973
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,781
<i>I thought we had an understanding.</i>

974
01:18:34,782 --> 01:18:37,504
<i>Apparently, I was wrong.</i>

975
01:19:06,082 --> 01:19:08,384
<i>Fuck! What the...!</i>

976
01:19:22,599 --> 01:19:25,279
Breathe! Breathe man.
You're... breathe.

977
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:28,910
What's I say about breathe?

978
01:19:55,913 --> 01:19:56,913
Do you have a car?

979
01:19:58,571 --> 01:20:01,125
- Sorry...
- Ow! Fuck!

980
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:03,683
Okay. You got it?

981
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:05,953
Are you sure you're okay to drive?

982
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:08,379
- It's that generator...
- What?

983
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:10,682
It's supposed to be self-sustaining...
adaptable.

984
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,885
The only way to get the system
out of the local minimum is...

985
01:20:13,886 --> 01:20:15,474
- to add a degree of a determin...
- Watch the road!

986
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:16,475
...to the dynamic.

987
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:20,367
To give the system the possibility
to make transitions to smarter states.

988
01:20:20,368 --> 01:20:22,230
At least you're making complete sentences.
I guess that's good.

989
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:24,338
But... but the filter must have failed.

990
01:20:24,339 --> 01:20:26,814
So now it's broadcasting that frequency.

991
01:20:26,815 --> 01:20:29,069
What the hell are you talking about?

992
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:33,959
It disrupts synaptic neural networks
causing extreme behavioural shifts.

993
01:20:34,093 --> 01:20:35,966
- ...panic.
- I got it.

994
01:20:35,967 --> 01:20:41,335
Paranoia, rage, enhanced suggestibility...

995
01:20:42,042 --> 01:20:45,982
There go your calcium ions...
snap, crackle, pop...

996
01:20:46,183 --> 01:20:47,479
What the hell are you talking about, man?

997
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,711
- right out of your brain cells...
- What are you trying to tell me, Clark?

998
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,888
Psychotron resonance.

999
01:20:53,603 --> 01:20:57,207
A broadcast on that scale
could cause mass psychosis.

1000
01:20:58,328 --> 01:21:01,819
Clark, I don't know who
or what started it...

1001
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,752
but we don't sure as shit signed up for it.

1002
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,754
<i>We made ourselves vulnerable.</i>

1003
01:21:07,923 --> 01:21:10,348
<i>When Mya left last night.</i>

1004
01:21:10,979 --> 01:21:15,640
<i>I turned the TV back on and there it was.</i>

1005
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:18,909
<i>It was replacing my thoughts.</i>

1006
01:21:21,512 --> 01:21:22,512
<i>But the sun came up and I think I...</i>

1007
01:21:25,286 --> 01:21:27,124
<i>I see it...</i>

1008
01:21:27,293 --> 01:21:31,275
<i>It's a lie. The signal... it's a trick.</i>

1009
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,792
<i>We changed the way we look at things.</i>

1010
01:21:35,793 --> 01:21:38,137
The things we look at will change.

1011
01:21:44,582 --> 01:21:45,708
What?

1012
01:21:46,782 --> 01:21:48,412
We're out of gas.

1013
01:23:18,448 --> 01:23:19,448
Music.

1014
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,356
Mya?

1015
01:24:23,797 --> 01:24:27,401
Why did you...
Why did you bring me here?

1016
01:24:29,391 --> 01:24:30,924
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1017
01:24:31,513 --> 01:24:33,353
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1018
01:24:37,977 --> 01:24:38,977
I'm...

1019
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:49,965
Breathe, Ben... breathe for me.

1020
01:24:51,629 --> 01:24:52,839
Breathe...

1021
01:24:53,103 --> 01:24:54,523
There's nothing there.

1022
01:24:55,205 --> 01:24:57,666
- It's not Mya?
- No, it's not Mya.

1023
01:25:00,919 --> 01:25:02,087
Look.

1024
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,730
13 is right up here.

1025
01:25:09,731 --> 01:25:12,495
If she's here, we're going to find her.
Okay?

1026
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:15,092
Mya.

1027
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,745
Is there any water around here?
She needs water.

1028
01:26:21,872 --> 01:26:24,314
- Sure.
- Mya. Mya.

1029
01:26:27,894 --> 01:26:30,112
Mya, it's all right. It's me.

1030
01:26:56,765 --> 01:26:59,277
Mya, look at me.

1031
01:26:59,788 --> 01:27:01,250
Look at me.

1032
01:27:04,029 --> 01:27:05,827
<i>Here you go.</i>

1033
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:21,447
You want to fuck around?

1034
01:27:21,448 --> 01:27:23,498
All I gotta to do is tighten my grip.

1035
01:27:23,766 --> 01:27:24,976
Please.

1036
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:27,339
Just let him go.

1037
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:29,936
And leave... just let him go?

1038
01:27:34,467 --> 01:27:35,593
Clark?

1039
01:27:47,714 --> 01:27:49,262
You fucking people.

1040
01:27:49,263 --> 01:27:50,495
Never quit.

1041
01:27:50,496 --> 01:27:51,496
Where are you going?

1042
01:27:51,497 --> 01:27:53,295
You don't need that.

1043
01:27:59,192 --> 01:28:01,872
Let's take a walk for a second.

1044
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:15,415
Your fucking lies have poisoned her brain.

1045
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:18,706
She doesn't even know who she is any more.

1046
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:20,071
It's amazing...

1047
01:28:20,072 --> 01:28:23,997
but even now...
even with that far away stare...

1048
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:26,640
She looks just like she did
in our wedding video.

1049
01:28:26,641 --> 01:28:28,104
It's so strange.

1050
01:28:28,105 --> 01:28:31,183
Two people... hardly know each other...

1051
01:28:31,184 --> 01:28:33,124
and 'till death do us part' and all that.

1052
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:34,125
I love it.

1053
01:28:34,995 --> 01:28:37,470
We've got a good life here.

1054
01:28:37,597 --> 01:28:38,946
A home...

1055
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:40,919
that... is precious...

1056
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,145
and you will never know the beauty of that.

1057
01:28:43,146 --> 01:28:44,963
- You're killing her...
- I'm saving her.

1058
01:28:44,964 --> 01:28:47,565
No you're not.
You can't see it.

1059
01:28:47,566 --> 01:28:50,246
It's a trick. The signal...

1060
01:28:53,498 --> 01:28:55,422
You have to trust me.

1061
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:56,487
Really?

1062
01:28:56,488 --> 01:28:59,982
You want me to trust you...
with my wife.

1063
01:28:59,983 --> 01:29:01,235
I don't think so.

1064
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,796
Look at her. Go ahead!

1065
01:29:05,259 --> 01:29:07,263
Take a good fucking look!

1066
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:09,314
Look at how pretty she is.

1067
01:29:09,549 --> 01:29:12,342
She's gorgeous, ya?

1068
01:29:12,343 --> 01:29:17,155
How long do you think you can possibly
hold on to that image?

1069
01:29:17,282 --> 01:29:18,854
For a few months?

1070
01:29:18,855 --> 01:29:21,732
A year? Before it fades?

1071
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:24,623
She doesn't deserve that.

1072
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:29,359
And you are never
going to look upon my wife again.

1073
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,376
Mya. Don't...

1074
01:29:39,234 --> 01:29:40,404
Not now, Mya.

1075
01:29:40,405 --> 01:29:42,203
I need you to be quiet now.

1076
01:29:43,036 --> 01:29:44,036
Let me handle this.

1077
01:29:46,216 --> 01:29:47,216
Not now, Mya.

1078
01:29:47,812 --> 01:29:48,812
Mya, shut up!

1079
01:29:55,105 --> 01:29:56,105
What did I tell you?

1080
01:29:57,235 --> 01:30:00,755
Why can't you just keep your
fucking mouth shut and watch TV?

1081
01:30:03,834 --> 01:30:05,674
<i>You know I want to love you.</i>

1082
01:30:07,948 --> 01:30:09,956
I'm sorry, baby.

1083
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:13,714
But you don't understand the situation here.

1084
01:30:18,568 --> 01:30:19,568
What?

1085
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,669
What are you trying to say?

1086
01:30:23,121 --> 01:30:25,140
No, but you're implying it.

1087
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,586
That it's my fault.

1088
01:30:31,976 --> 01:30:35,691
I don't know what you expect of me.

1089
01:30:35,692 --> 01:30:38,870
Maybe I'm not the man
you thought you married.

1090
01:30:38,871 --> 01:30:39,871
Did you think of that?

1091
01:30:40,511 --> 01:30:44,871
Do you have any idea how hard I worked
to be the person you wanted me to be?

1092
01:30:47,677 --> 01:30:49,139
Where did you go?

1093
01:30:51,425 --> 01:30:54,399
<i>You keep putting on thee masks
and I get really confused.</i>

1094
01:31:23,084 --> 01:31:26,562
<i>You keep putting on thee masks
and I get really confused.</i>

1095
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:29,704
Okay! Now it's not funny.

1096
01:31:30,221 --> 01:31:31,221
Take it off.

1097
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:36,633
Take that mask off or I'll whip it off!

1098
01:31:36,634 --> 01:31:38,768
Who do you think you're talking to?

1099
01:31:41,153 --> 01:31:42,153
What?

1100
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,277
I'm talking to my wife. Do you mind?

1101
01:31:44,278 --> 01:31:46,973
That's not your wife... that's my wife.

1102
01:31:46,974 --> 01:31:49,510
- What did you just say?
- What did you just say?

1103
01:31:49,511 --> 01:31:50,648
You do not look at her

1104
01:31:50,649 --> 01:31:53,875
You do not speak to her.
I am speaking to you!

1105
01:31:55,342 --> 01:31:56,342
Honey?

1106
01:31:58,724 --> 01:32:01,875
This man try to hurt you?

1107
01:32:01,876 --> 01:32:04,388
- Mya?
- Shut the fuck up!

1108
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,072
What have you done to my wife?

1109
01:32:09,073 --> 01:32:10,362
What?

1110
01:32:10,363 --> 01:32:13,930
You will not speak to my wife again!

1111
01:32:16,065 --> 01:32:17,065
Now...

1112
01:32:20,779 --> 01:32:22,241
Who are you?

1113
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:28,268
Say your fucking name!

1114
01:32:30,808 --> 01:32:32,524
Lewis.

1115
01:32:33,155 --> 01:32:34,575
Is this a game?

1116
01:32:37,988 --> 01:32:40,416
Or do you actually think you're me?

1117
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:43,960
I...

1118
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:46,970
- I am.
- Okay.

1119
01:32:48,918 --> 01:32:50,422
Look at me!

1120
01:32:54,643 --> 01:32:55,643
I'm Lewis.

1121
01:33:07,321 --> 01:33:08,321
So...

1122
01:33:10,896 --> 01:33:12,484
Who are you?

1123
01:33:18,369 --> 01:33:19,369
Wait a minute.

1124
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:24,770
Wait a minute.

1125
01:33:26,593 --> 01:33:27,593
You're him.

1126
01:33:33,676 --> 01:33:34,676
You're the one.

1127
01:33:40,143 --> 01:33:42,949
You actually think she loves you?

1128
01:33:43,499 --> 01:33:44,499
Can't you see?

1129
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:47,386
She is using you.

1130
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:52,925
She's using you.

1131
01:33:57,050 --> 01:34:00,276
She doesn't love you.

1132
01:34:01,792 --> 01:34:03,590
She never has...

1133
01:34:04,645 --> 01:34:06,233
and she never will.

1134
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:11,961
It's a trick.

1135
01:35:08,285 --> 01:35:09,579
Maya.

1136
01:35:16,462 --> 01:35:18,302
For real.

1137
01:35:23,035 --> 01:35:25,253
- Ben.
- I'm here baby.

1138
01:35:37,489 --> 01:35:38,867
Clark.

1139
01:35:39,576 --> 01:35:40,996
It's okay.

1140
01:37:26,687 --> 01:37:28,024
Mya.
