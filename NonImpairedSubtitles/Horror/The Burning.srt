Two bottles of whisky a day, no problem.

460
00:40:58,142 --> 00:41:01,669
Like, most of the time he was
somewhere out in space,

461
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:04,943
but if he caught you, look out!

462
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:10,116
Because Cropsy could strip the paint
off the walls,

463
00:41:10,188 --> 00:41:12,281
just by breathing on them.

(ALL CHUCKLlNG)

465
00:41:15,593 --> 00:41:17,788
Now this Cropsy was a sadist.

466
00:41:18,362 --> 00:41:23,095
I mean, he got real pleasure
out of hurting people, scaring them.

467
00:41:24,302 --> 00:41:28,830
And he had these garden shears,
you know?

468
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:32,174
The kind with long thin blades.

469
00:41:33,077 --> 00:41:36,308
And he carried them all the time,
wherever he went.

470
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:40,150
And he had this kind of demonic way
of looking at you.

471
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:44,517
One time, this Cropsy really went after
this kid from Brooklyn.

472
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:49,584
Followed him around night and day.
He made this kid's life a living hell.

473
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:52,795
But this time he chose the wrong guy.

474
00:41:53,264 --> 00:41:56,062
Because the kid and some of his buddies
had planned a little prank

475
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:59,193
that would scare the living shit
out of Cropsy.

476

Only problem was, the gag went wrong.

477
00:42:04,342 --> 00:42:08,403
The next thing anyone knows, Cropsy's
trapped alive and burning in his bunk.

478
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:11,504
They try to get him out but the fire's
so fierce they can't reach him.

479
00:42:11,582 --> 00:42:15,450
All they can do is stand outside,
and listen to him cry out in agony.

480
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,512
They say he smashed his way through
the bunkroom door, just a mass of flames.

481
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:24,186
And as he screamed out, burned alive,
he cried out,

482
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:28,028
"l will return. I will have my revenge."

483
00:42:31,035 --> 00:42:35,563
They never found his body. He survived.

484
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:41,275
He lives on whatever he can catch.
Eats them raw.

485

617

and search this whole area.

618

Yeah, something's wrong.

634

There's no way
all those canoes can just disappear

635
00:53:29,026 --> 00:53:33,087
and Karen wouldn't go back to
the main camp in the middle of the night.

636
00:53:34,264 --> 00:53:36,824
Well, what are we going to do
if we don't find the canoes?

637
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,368

be looking for, anyway?

Hey, guys, here's a piece of wood.

642

us to build a raft with all this stuff.

You know, you've never failed us.

644
00:53:57,054 --> 00:53:59,386

a Merkel engine on the back?

-What about that?

You wouldn't go.

654
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,874

you wouldn't even go with me.

-What's the matter?

656

-Glazer.

-Just cool your engines.

659

looking for wood.
