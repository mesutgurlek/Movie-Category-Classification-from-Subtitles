1
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:28,157
Elena 

2
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:33,061
I know this day's like your darkest
day of your life 

3
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:35,735
I know you miss your mother

4
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:41,073
And even though she's not here right now,
she'll always love you

5
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:46,061
You understand that, don't you darling?

6
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,229
Yes, Daddy

7
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:55,198
But i'm going to be around more,
I will always be here

8
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,101
Promise?

9
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:02,817
I promise

10
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,171
Trap his victims 

11
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:11,696
People still missing

12
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:13,832
going murderous 

13
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:14,896
vicious crime spree

14
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:17,906
we'll dedicating every availabe research to hunt this man down

15
00:01:31,316 --> 00:01:34,460
The Collection

16
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:43,681
the serial killer has claim to yet another victim

17
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:47,347
And what is becomes the most vicious crime spree in our city history

18
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,434
this unpleasant series of violent murders

19
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:54,468
has many stayings in doors and living
in fear 

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,895
Good morning.
I think we can share it this time

21
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,760
The serial killer can traps his victims at home,
business and work places

22
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,888
 And kills them

23
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:12,486
however,it appears that he takes one victim from each
crime scene,this people may be still alive or captive

24
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:17,915
More over fifty people
still missing 

25
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,346
grieving families are seeking answers

26
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:22,551
and the authorities have began
the man hunt 

27
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,841
that's why people wonders in the string of murders
the killer seems to strike without any pattern

28
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:29,325
which make it impossible
for police to track his moves 

29
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:36,525
it's best to described it's a predator without boundries


30
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,148
targeting men,women, 
 children, young, old

31
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,218
he does not discriminate


32
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:44,612
The last missing person is no stranger to crime himself

33
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:47,954
Arkin O'Brien,is a twice convicted flee


34
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:51,896
who is abducted shortly after 
paramedic responded to a 911 call

35
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:55,933
O'Brien's wife, Lisa, recently
reacted to the abduction

36
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:01,611
whoever's watching this

37
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:04,144
Please, if you see this and you have him 

38
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,220
Please let him go.

39
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:07,826
Please ...

40
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:09,918
let him go.

41
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,835
We'll hunt this man down, 
we'll hunt his trail

42
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:25,593
and we will bring him to justice

43
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,902

46
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:55,894

48
00:03:59,784 --> 00:04:01,102

49
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,468

- Brian bell on me.

55
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,549
I don't know, I'm kinda tired.
I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

56
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,748
yeah I got you, look out your window.

57
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:51,796
I'll be down in five

58
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,720
You think I pick right shirt?

59
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:25,454
 it's not about your shirt litle brother.
it's about how you wear it

60
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,232
All girls say that,dude,
and none of bit is true.

61
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,064
every detail counts

62
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,779
- I've been workin' on some.. 
- Stop it, stop

63
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:35,593
First of, don't call me "dude".

64
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:39,592
Look, when you want to be the one, you don't 
walk up to and say "hi, I need to sleep with you"

65
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,132
Say "nice shoes".

66
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,021
sound make sense?

67
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:48,058

68
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:50,914
lets go,lets go,lets go!

69
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:53,971

71
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:16,935
I can't believe your dad let you leave that

Wow, this really looks inviting.

77
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:34,084
this has to be it.

78
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:38,586
That's gonna be the doorman

79
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:40,411
Tell the password

80
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:46,772

114
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,297
What's wrong?

115
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:15,974

Have a good night.

123
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:55,011
Hello, Arkin.

124
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,553
I've told you guys everything I know.

125
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:59,315
I'm not a cop.

126
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,511
Who are you?

127
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:02,976
My name is Lucello.

128
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:08,042
- What the fuck are you doing?
- relax.

129
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,496
I'm here to help you.

130
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:12,431
I'm working for a man whose daughter gone missing.

131
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,510
Did you see her at the party?

132
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:27,265
Yeah.

133
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:29,405
were she alive?

134
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:31,670
The last time I saw her.

135
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,900
Did he take her?

136
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,317
If they didn't find a body,then
maybe.

137
00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:40,166
He always takes one.

138
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:41,675
Her name's Elena.

139
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,088
I got 48 hours tops
before she's dead.

140
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:50,247
I think you've pretty good idea 
where that man might be

141
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,410
But what you think you can find 
this guy when the cops can't

142
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:56,202
Because I'm allowing to do things they won't.

143
00:18:56,806 --> 00:19:00,024
I've assembled the team where 
we gonna find him and kill him.

144
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:06,454
What's the plan?

145
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:11,970
- He's gonna lead us to where he lives beings hell.
- what about the police?

146
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:15,010
They had their chance.

147
00:19:15,122 --> 00:19:17,681
This man deserves beyond the law

148
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,937
She's all I have.

149
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:25,185
- Find her.
- Sir, I'm always been there for you.

150
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:26,867
She'll be home tonight.

151
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:28,835
Thank you Lucello.

152
00:19:41,884 --> 00:19:43,117
Elena.

153
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,174
Dad.

154
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:47,390
Daddy.

155
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,779
- Elena
- Daddy.

156
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,686
I got you.

157
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:10,678
Whose house?

158
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,718

159
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:35,763

175
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,162
If we turn right or left I'll make this thing cuts

176
00:23:01,304 --> 00:23:03,209
Drive 5 miles under the speed limit.

I'm not gonna walk in there like this is

185
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:32,116
And he would cut your balls off

186
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:37,196
Stop.

187
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:00,799
This hotel has been abandoned for years.

188
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:02,415
This is the place.

189
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,266
You're the expert.
Can you get us in there?

190
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:13,736

Watch your back in there, it's built like a mess. 
The whole place is rift.

193
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:17,793

I'll kill the guy, but you gotta help us find Alena.

196
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,888

Guard the door and stay in the radio.

There's something moving in there.

202
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:03,273
No way man, put that gun in my head. 
No fuckin' way , I'm not going

205
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:19,509

- Nope.

206
00:30:13,007 --> 00:30:14,433

He messes with him.
He chop it off.

214
00:31:12,802 --> 00:31:15,221
They don't do what he says,

215
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,620
- It's like a zombie.
- He's not a zombie.

216
00:31:19,757 --> 00:31:21,311
Just a person.

327
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:36,569
Not a chance, we are on the third floor.
We leave this out as when we came in

328
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:38,672
we won't make it with those things down there.

329
00:53:39,935 --> 00:53:43,455
Look, it's time for you to trust me.

330
00:53:46,616 --> 00:53:48,175
Give me the gun.

331
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,786
If I want you dead,
I woldn't saved  your ass back there.

332
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:53,807
You left me.

333
00:53:57,816 --> 00:54:00,569
Look, there is nothing what I can do.

334
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,096
I am sorry, but there was nothing I can do.

335
00:54:03,937 --> 00:54:06,960
I can get us out of here
if you give me the fuckin' gun.

336
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:24,074
Did you just shoot somebody?

337
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:26,164
It just fire try to get attention.

338
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,146
Sorry, dude.

339
00:54:28,538 --> 00:54:30,276
He'll call the cops.

340
00:54:31,078 --> 00:54:32,478
Hopely

341
00:54:57,589 --> 00:55:00,720
Now he know exactly where we are.

342
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:10,608
Shots fired.
I repeat: Shots fired, need backup.

343
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:13,359
On the Road 6769 Argento hotel.

344
00:55:13,492 --> 00:55:15,480
The shot coming from the hotel.

345
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:23,529
We just need hold on,
and not draw attention to ourselves.

346
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:26,249
Sensible enough

347
00:55:30,566 --> 00:55:32,851
The fuck is she just do?

348
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:37,156
- He likes me now.

349
00:55:38,276 --> 00:55:40,418
Right here.

350
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:47,253
- Shut up.
- You're all gonna die

351
00:56:54,926 --> 00:56:56,860
Let's go.

352
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:59,178

353
00:57:15,351 --> 00:57:18,708
- Go now save her.
- I'm not leaving you like this.

354
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:26,443

There gotta be another way.

This way.

394
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:43,327
Oh, my God ...

395
01:04:27,911 --> 01:04:29,790

396
01:04:32,954 --> 01:04:34,982
Kill him, Arkin.

397
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,978
Help us.

01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:14,353
- help, we're here.
- There are people in there.

399
01:05:26,394 --> 01:05:28,627
How dare you?

400
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:38,776
Look at me.

401
01:06:28,052 --> 01:06:30,189
Come on, hurry.

402
01:09:20,432 --> 01:09:25,116
Place the body at the south in the parking lot
we're waiting for body count

403
01:12:08,403 --> 01:12:11,779
all those insects,
You quite The Collector.

404
01:12:12,164 --> 01:12:15,629
You're 200 miles in the radius
where we last saw each other

405
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:19,645
There are 14 licences entomologists.

406
01:12:21,445 --> 01:12:23,855
And you're number twelve.

407
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:26,921
It's better than a museum, didn't?

408
01:12:27,068 --> 01:12:29,366
Fucks you up real good.

409
01:12:30,044 --> 01:12:32,910
Turn around.

410
01:12:40,434 --> 01:12:42,842
Turn around.

411
01:12:50,817 --> 01:12:52,394
You here to kill me?

412
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:57,563
No.

413
01:12:57,715 --> 01:13:00,750
that'd be too nice.

414
01:13:00,913 --> 01:13:04,590
First I'm gonna make you feel
everything that I feel.

415
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:06,061
And then I 'm gonna kill you

416
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,330
So that you can never hurt any body again

417
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:17,654
Fuck you! fuck you! fuck you!

418
01:13:20,029 --> 01:20:33,482
