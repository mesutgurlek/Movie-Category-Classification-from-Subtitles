1
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,517
No! No! No! No! No!

2
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,672
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Die!

3
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,998
<i>Colonel Redding.
Now there's a piece of work.</i>

4
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,470
<i>I can't believe he's having us
wire up this hellhole.</i>

5
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,438
<i>He's obsessed with something.</i>

6
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,388
<i>What's he expecting to find down there?
Ghosts of old miners?</i>

7
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,551
<i>They're here.</i>

8
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,749
<i>Hey.</i>

9
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,239
<i>You ready to test?</i>

10
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,954
All right.
You got everybody?

11
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,794
Number one's dead.

12
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,555
How about now?

13
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,749
Good there.

14
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,592
<i>How about the security dummies?</i>

15
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,637
They're dead, too.

16
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,593
Hold on.

17
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,349
What the hell?

18
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,634
<i>What you got?</i>

19
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,510
I got a shitload of false readings.
Stand by.

20
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,671
<i>Again?
What's going on here?</i>

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,115
Damn it.

22
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,709
We just lost our feed.

23
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,791
I'll go check the main junction.

24
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,434
<i>Spooky down there, isn't it? We're
the first ones in there since the 50s.</i>

25
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,438
<i>Maybe it is haunted.</i>

26
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,512
<i>Glad it's you and not me in there.</i>

27
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,353
Oh, fuck!

28
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,113
<i>What's with the junction box?</i>

29
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,633
It's history.

30
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,350
Our friends the rats again.

31
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,671
They love the taste of the insulation.

32
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,594
All right, I'll call base, should be able
to get a backup here in an hour or so.

33
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,149
Shit.

34
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,314
Dr. Wilson, have you seen Foster?

35
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,358
Calibrating the infrared sensor
up top the mountain.

36
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,829
- Dumb sons-a-bitches.
- Sorry, Colonel Redding.

37
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,878
Guys aren't supposed to be here
without a goddamn escort!

38
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,033
Wilson.

39
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,229
Wilson?

40
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,832
<i>Wilson, come in.</i>

41
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,992
Where are these guys?

42
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,038
<i>Han, do you read me?
It's Foster.</i>

43
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,918
<i>Han, come in.</i>

44
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,117
<i>Han, it's Foster.</i>

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,035
Hi.

46
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,436
Are you lost?

47
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,672
My name is Dr. Foster.

48
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,438
Do you have a name?

49
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,676
- Roonawee.
- Roonwee?

50
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,274
- Roonawee!
- Run away?

51
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,269
Foster?

52
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,795
Foster!

53
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,151
Now where are you?
Come on.

54
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,796
Come out of your holes.

55
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,469
Come on, you cocksucker
motherfucker sons-a-bitches!

56
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,479
Foster!

57
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,550
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

58
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,149
Go! Go!
Move out! Move out! Go!

59
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,834
- Keep moving! Keep mo...
- Go!

60
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,789
Oh, shit!

61
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,151
- Take cover!
- Come on, Crank!

62
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,237
- Spitter!
- Leave it!

63
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,029
I got to get my helmet.

64
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,760
Spitter, forget your fucking helmet!
Get back here!

65
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,713
<i>It's not supposed to be this bad!</i>

66
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,952
Die!
America's mothers suck cocks!

67
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,157
- What the fuck did you say?
- Your American mothers suck cocks.

68
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,630
Fuck you!
America number one, bitch!

69
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,199
Crank, no!

70
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,555
- Crank!
- Let's move, pussies!

71
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,917
<i>Crank, you dumb motherfucker!
Don't freak out!</i>

72
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,997
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Get back!

73
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,792
I know what to do,
get out of the way.

74
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,030
- Give him some cover!
- I got this! I got this!

75
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,191
You get out!
This is fortress of Allah!

76
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,349
Come on.
Napoleon, get the door!

77
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,273
- Get the door, man!
- What? I can't hear you.

78
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,192
- Get the fucking door!
- Door!

79
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,032
This is the mother of all doors!

80
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,679
Fall back!

81
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,114
- Shit! Take cover!
- Run!

82
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,838
Shit.

83
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,715
<i>Mama.</i>

84
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,879
You killed my babies!
Oh, no!

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,838
You killed my babies!
You killed my babies!

86
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,433
Watch out.
Watch her!

87
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,556
- We didn't mean to.
- No, Napoleon!

88
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,312
Kaboom.

89
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,313
Oh, you're dead.

90
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,708
Idiot.

91
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,110
A stunning display of individual
and group stupidity!

92
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,792
17 civilians killed and yourselves!

93
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,068
I'm in fucking awe!

94
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,028
Cole!
Never leave cover to retrieve your helmet!

95
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,872
You won't have a head
to put it on anyway!

96
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,318
Johnson, do not drop your weapon
to protect your ears.

97
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,072
You are better off deaf than dead.

98
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,712
Medina, since you
are not Rambo resurrected...

99
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,519
...do not charge while your head
is securely up your ass.

100
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,636
<i>That's how innocent people get killed.</i>

101
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,028
And you, Napoleon.

102
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,599
It's Napoli, Sarge.

103
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,751
You're quite the killer, aren't you?
Napoleon?

104
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,878
Almost got your whole squad
blown to hell in six seconds.

105
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,952
<i>That's a mighty impressive body count
for somebody who's against the war.</i>

106
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,873
- What?
- Oh, yeah, your brother didn't tell you?

107
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,076
Pretty mouth here's got himself
a bumper sticker.

108
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,471
It says "Conversation, not confrontation".

109
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,198
What's up with that shit?

110
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,952
You against the war, Doonesbury?

111
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,112
Not all war, Sarge. I just think
that the President lies too much.

112
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,238
All presidents lie, asshole!
That's their fucking job.

113
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,389
Yes, sir.

114
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,030
No president has told the truth since
Truman. And do you know what he said?

115
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,112
- No, Sarge.
- He said that the buck stops here.

116
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,596
Now you have all failed combat
and are therefore officially dead.

117
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,672
Congratu-fucking-lations!

118
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,512
Fall in at that deuce-and-a-half
with all gear.

119
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,114
We will deploy to the
Agave Ridge rifle range.

120
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,874
There you can complete your failure
of these exercises...

121
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,759
<i>...by blowing each
others' dead heads off.</i>

122
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,559
And on our way, we're stopping
at Sector 16...

123
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,473
...to deliver equipment to scientists who
are working there.

124
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,997
This is a top secret area, so do not
wander off or talk to anybody.

125
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,391
Now get your sorry rookie butts
in the back of that truck! Now!

126
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,599
<i>Let's go!
Let's go!</i>

127
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,275
<i>Let's go, Spitter. If I had some steak
on a string, you'd move real fast!</i>

128
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,433
Jesus, how big is this place?

129
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,319
<i>It's about 1300 square miles.
They used to test nuclear weapons here.</i>

130
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,636
Well, isn't it radioactive then?

131
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,438
Not according to the Army.

132
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,233
Fuck.

133
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,716
Well, maybe I should thank Napoleon.

134
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,390
If we're all officially dead, like Sarge
said, I won't be tried for war crimes.

135
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,758
The killing of innocent mannequins
is serious shit.

136
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,195
<i>Where I come from it's never
good to be dead.</i>

137
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,635
Ah, Crank, you're taking all the fun
out of the afterlife.

138
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,189
- Shove the afterlife up your ass.
- That's cold, man.

139
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,232
Clyde, huh?

140
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,439
Made the same mistake when I was a kid.
So is Clyde still your dude?

141
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,194
<i>Yes, Stump, Clyde's still my dude.</i>

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,390
<i>Stump. That's her son.
He's, like, four years old.</i>

143
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,994
That is so fucked up.

144
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,634
One good thing about being dead.
Wouldn't have to listen to your bullshit.

145
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,269
<i>That's all there is out here.
It's a bunch of bullshit.</i>

146
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,112
This bullshit's got a crazy past.

147
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,158
You know they used to use this
as a test ground for A-bombs?

148
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,198
"You guys know this used to be a
test ground for A-bombs!"

149
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,715
Who the fuck asked you?
Peace ass shit boy!

150
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,318
Oh, right. I'm sorry. I forgot
I was dealing with Rambo resurrected.

151
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,118
You can Rambo resurrect my balls, bitch.

152
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,232
<i>You with the pinche puta.</i>

153
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,949
<i>What, you wanna die young, cabrón?
Huh? Huh?</i>

154
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,314
I'll kill you right now.

155
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,469
Crank!

156
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,198
I killed somebody once.

157
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,470
<i>It was easy.
That's why it's so dangerous.</i>

158
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,513
I don't fucking like that guy.

159
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,638
Well, I don't like being out here having
to put up with you, but I deal with it.

160
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,552
So deal with it.

161
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,274
Thanks.

162
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,910
Don't mind Crank.
He's just a cranky motherfucker.

163
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,950
They're so top secret,
they're invisible, huh?

164
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,348
You got that right.

165
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,672
Oh, leg's asleep.

166
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,956
- Dick's asleep!
- You wanna wake it up?

167
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,235
<i>Nah, that's your daddy's job.</i>

168
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,153
Hey, you two, cut the bullshit.
Off-load that crate. Put it in the tent!

169
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,151
Spitter, get me base.

170
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,471
National Guard Yankee Five Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base, over.

171
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,951
National Guard Yankee Five Niner
calling Yuma Flats Base, over.

172
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,674
<i>Nothing, sir.
It's the hills.</i>

173
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,068
Keep trying.

174
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,073
National Guard Yankee Five Niner
to Yuma Flats Base, over.

175
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,109
Hello.

176
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,637
- Private Crackhead.
- Sarge.

177
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,997
See if you can find Colonel Redding. He's
supposed to be the security over here.

178
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,879
See these cables?
They run into that old bunker over there.

179
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,474
Check it out.
Watch your step.

180
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,755
Yes, sir, Sergeant.

181
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,673
Private Mickey Mouse,
see if you can find some gas.

182
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,432
There's got to be some
cans around here somewhere.

183
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,919
Yes, Sergeant.

184
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,119
Napoleon!
Where the fuck are you going?

185
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,589
- I was just going to use the facilities.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

186
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,309
You are in Mountain Assault training.
There are no Port-a-Potties in Kandahar.

187
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,678
You'll take your dumps behind the cactus
with the scorpions. Understand me?

188
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,071
- What do I use for t. p., sir?
- Use your fucking hand.

189
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,914
Yes, Sarge.

190
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,074
Yo!

191
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,558
Colonel Redding?

192
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,554
Shit!

193
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,517
Stupid bats!

194
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,879
No gas, sir, but I found this.

195
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,589
Satellite phone. Must have been
how they contacted base.

196
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,832
- I don't think it's working.
- Damn, somebody's got a temper.

197
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,437
Oh, mine's all buttoned up, Sarge.
Nobody's home.

198
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,790
- Whose radio is that?
- Must be one of theirs.

199
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,157
<i>Wilson. Han.
Are you there?</i>

200
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,675
Hello.

201
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,912
<i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

202
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,310
This is Sergeant Jeffrey Millstone
of the U.S. National Guard.

203
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,357
Who is this,
and what's your position?

204
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,555
<i>I need help.</i>

205
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,159
Are you in distress?

206
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,238
<i>Fuck. Spitter, what's the range
on these things?</i>

207
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,197
Couple miles.
Line of sight.

208
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,634
Sarge!

209
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,639
Looks like a signal mirror.

210
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,389
<i>It's got to be him.</i>

211
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,318
We're on a search and rescue mission.

212
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,153
<i>- That's right we are!
- Shut the fuck up!</i>

213
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,076
I said search and rescue,
not fucking spring break.

214
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,915
I want you back here with weapons
and gear for a climbing assault in five.

215
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,355
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Sarge.

216
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,119
<i>Do you think it's a good idea going up
there without contacting headquarters?</i>

217
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,351
Do you like fucking with me, Napoleon?

218
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,232
I think you do.
You know what?

219
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,868
You're officially in charge
of guarding the latrine...

220
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,758
...not using it, but guarding it.

221
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,718
I want you to stand on one leg and
hold your rifle over your fucking head...

222
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,270
...and make sure that no one
steals or molests that Port-a-Potty.

223
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,238
Or I will have your Gomer Pyle
ass court-martialed immediately.

224
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,153
Do you understand what I am saying
to you? Do you understand me!?

225
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,276
<i>Yeah, I'll go.
I just think that it's a bad idea.</i>

226
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,079
- Go and guard that fucking latrine, now!
- Sir, yes, sir!

227
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,076
- Live ammo or blanks?
- One live mag each weapon. It's heavier.

228
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,028
Flashlights and hydration packs, too. The
more weight, the better for you clowns.

229
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,556
You're halfway through your training and
you look like a bunch of raw recruits.

230
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,597
You're a disgrace
to the U.S. National Guard...

231
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,432
...and wouldn't last five minutes
in combat!

232
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,678
One leg, Gomer Pyle!

233
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,519
The rest of you...

234
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,911
...get your asses up that hill and wipe
those silly smiles off your faces, now!

235
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,389
Let's move!

236
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,675
One leg, Pyle! One leg.

237
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,639
<i>You're so bad.</i>

238
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,109
- Company halt! Johnson!
- Sir?

239
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,269
You stay here.

240
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,637
Spitter's coming with us. Get on the
main radio and try to raise somebody.

241
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,712
If you can get through to a medvac,
the guy'll have a hell of a better chance.

242
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,029
Now move.

243
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,633
Yes, Sarge.

244
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,077
Don't forget to write.

245
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,115
Get going! Turn around!

246
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,395
One leg!

247
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,632
<i>- When I grew up my momma said
- When I grew up my momma said</i>

248
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,597
<i>If I wasn't in the Army then I'd be dead</i>

249
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,990
<i>If I wasn't in the Army then I'd be dead</i>

250
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,355
<i>I told her "Look at me now, Mom"</i>

251
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,272
<i>I told her "Look at me now, Mom</i>

252
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,750
<i>That's what happens
when you miss the prom"</i>

253
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,313
One leg, Gomer Pyle!

254
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,516
Mayday, mayday. This is
the National Guard Yankee Five Niner...

255
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,036
...calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medvac, over.

256
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,229
Hello?

257
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,035
Shit.

258
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,638
Mayday, mayday. This is the
National Guard Yankee Five Niner...

259
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,792
...calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medvac, over.

260
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,913
What the hell are scientists doing
way the hell out here?

261
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,196
There's nothing but rocks
and rattlesnakes.

262
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,158
Army business, dumbass.
And definitely none of your business.

263
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,039
- But, Sarge, I am in the army.
- Which gives you the right...

264
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,034
...to shut the fuck up.
- Okay, I'll just shut the fuck up then.

265
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,912
How many people
are supposed to be here?

266
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,753
I have no idea.
Maybe we can ask him up there.

267
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,115
What are we supposed to do
when we find this dude?

268
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,114
That depends on how bad he is. We wait
for a medvac or hump him down by hand.

269
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,953
I know I'm not supposed to talk,
Sarge, but I hope he...

270
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,753
- Shit, man!
- Help!

271
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,909
I got you!

272
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,036
Come on. Pull him up.
I got you, Mickey!

273
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,189
Oh, shit!

274
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,275
Hello.

275
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,552
- Shit.
- You saved my life, Sarge.

276
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,159
Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.

277
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,157
- How far down does that thing go?
- China?

278
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,798
Could be a hundred feet deep,
a hundred years old.

279
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,156
Just waiting to suck your ass in.

280
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,471
So keep your eyes open.

281
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,154
There's a lot of old mines around here.
How's your ankle, Mickey?

282
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,912
<i>Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Let's go.</i>

283
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,157
<i>- We cannot afford to slow down.
- Hey, come on, Sarge. Let's go.</i>

284
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,359
- Head back to base camp.
- Come on, Sarge.

285
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,557
<i>Mick, back to camp. Now.
That's an order.</i>

286
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,191
<i>What the fuck is everybody looking at?
Let's keep moving.</i>

287
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,269
Screw it.

288
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,958
<i>You're not supposed to do that.</i>

289
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,314
Duty calls.

290
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,360
Mayday, mayday, this is the
National Guard Yankee Five Niner...

291
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,636
...calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medvac, over.

292
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,471
Mayday, mayday, this is the National
Guard Yankee Five Niner...

293
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,519
...calling the Yuma Flats Base
requesting a medvac, over.

294
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,593
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

295
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,115
- What?
- There's a hand in the shitter!

296
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,714
- What?
- Check it out!

297
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,629
Fucking...

298
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,918
There's nobody in there.

299
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,988
Down there.

300
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,910
- Who was that guy?
- Shitman the barbarian, I have no idea!

301
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,798
Help me!

302
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
- Oh, man.
- Oh, God.

303
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,159
I can't tell one rock from another.

304
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,195
It was between those three.

305
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,676
<i>Seems like that's the only way up.
Right there.</i>

306
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,751
- That ain't so bad.
- No, man.

307
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,708
Not so bad at all.
If you're a fucking squirrel.

308
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,391
What's with all these cuts?

309
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,709
I don't know.

310
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,479
Who did this to you?

311
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,869
They're here.

312
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,115
Who's they?

313
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,351
None of the cuts were that deep.

314
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,593
- Massive infection.
- What?

315
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,312
Shit stinks because
it's full of pathogens.

316
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,232
Whoever did this to him,
wanted him to die slowly.

317
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,311
What kind of person
could do that to someone?

318
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,919
I honestly don't know.

319
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,873
Let's go, Delmar.

320
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,433
There you go.

321
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,312
Pick your spots!

322
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,918
Find the creases.

323
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,079
You got it. You got it.

324
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,035
Keep going, soldier.

325
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,998
<i>There you go.
That's what I'm talking about, Delmar!</i>

326
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,312
All right! All right!

327
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,594
All right!

328
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,514
Spider-Man.

329
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,270
You are officially a bad motherfucker.

330
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,718
Stump, you're up next.
The rest of you get your asses ready!

331
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,629
<i>All right, Stump, let's go.
Let's get it going.</i>

332
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,711
<i>Where'd you go from here, Delmar?</i>

333
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,356
<i>Love you, Mommy.</i>

334
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,996
Take your time
but pick your spots, Stump.

335
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,954
- Asshole!
- Easy. Sarge says we're moving out.

336
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,031
Well, make some noise next time
you come up behind me!

337
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,919
Yeah, whatever.
I'm just the messenger.

338
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,473
Chicks, man.

339
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,958
Hello. Hello, over.

340
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,320
Hello! Hello, over.

341
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,039
Can you get through to them?

342
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,234
Radio sucks.

343
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,119
Hello! Sarge? Anybody?

344
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,318
Holy shit!

345
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,838
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

346
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,680
- God.
- Shit!

347
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,353
What are you doing?

348
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,389
Fuck!

349
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,915
- What?
- Where's your rifle?

350
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,998
Oh, God. It's gone.

351
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,673
Oh, God!

352
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,638
<i>- Let's just get up there.
- No, we're not going up that hill.</i>

353
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,155
I'm not hiding down here and waiting
for them to come down.

354
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,478
What? You scared?

355
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,073
<i>It's not about being scared.</i>

356
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,073
It's about not making idiotic
and possibly fatal decisions.

357
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,356
Right, forgot who I was speaking to.

358
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,556
The same genius who got his
whole squad blown to hell.

359
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,395
Didn't you hear what he said?
Someone is here.

360
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,588
You wanna die like him?

361
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,718
<i>Let's just get up with the others.</i>

362
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,955
Hello, Sarge?

363
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,513
Hello, Sarge!

364
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
Hello? Sarge? Anyone?

365
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,317
Can anybody out there read me?

366
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,749
- Napoleon!
- What?

367
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,879
I don't know...

368
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,919
Amber!

369
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,912
Napoleon!

370
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,953
I hit him?

371
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,520
Mickey! Mickey!

372
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,432
Hey, who was that?

373
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,637
Mickey, something's going on.
Oh, God. Are you all right?

374
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,358
Yeah, I just twisted my ankle.

375
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,759
Hold on!

376
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,957
Holy shit! Fuck!

377
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,636
Hold on!
Hold on, I got you.

378
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,836
- Shit!
- Hold on, I got you!

379
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,074
Shoot the fucker! Shoot him!

380
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,154
- Shoot him!
- I can't see in there!

381
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,071
I don't have a shot!

382
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,912
Fucking help me, man!

383
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,719
Goddamn it, I don't...

384
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,319
Fuck! Don't let go!
Don't let go!

385
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,515
Mickey!

386
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,468
Mickey!

387
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,908
Mickey!

388
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,111
Man, this is some bullshit.

389
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,309
What?

390
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,549
Thought I heard something.
A shot.

391
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,359
This is a military base.
People are shooting all over the place.

392
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,034
I think it came from camp. Has anybody
checked in with Amber recently?

393
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,713
Mickey's down there by now.
You know, he's got her in a tent...

394
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,350
...and they're doing a whole other
kind of training. Know what I mean?

395
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,272
- Sarge, up there.
- I see it!

396
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,555
Another one.

397
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,280
You two!
Get your asses up here!

398
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,879
Come on.

399
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,715
Hello!

400
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,869
Hello!

401
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,833
Oh, no.

402
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,837
The red and black high-top Forces.
What? And it's my size too?

403
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,116
What the fuck is it doing way up here?

404
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,874
Now, if we could only find
the other one we'd be in business.

405
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,951
Sarge! Over here!

406
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,034
Sarge!

407
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,549
Fuck is in his head?

408
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,352
- Private Crackhead? Fish it out.
- Shit.

409
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,670
"Dr. Paul Foster,
Department of Defense. "

410
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,869
Looks like we found one of our scientists.

411
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,069
Lock and load.

412
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,559
This isn't supposed to happen
on an army base.

413
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,188
- We're in a U.S. Military facility.
- The size of Rhode Island.

414
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,591
If some asshole wants to go nuts,
this is a damn good place to do it.

415
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,797
Spitter, get Amber on the radio.

416
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,790
Stark nine, stark nine. Amber,
this is Spitter. You read me? Over.

417
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,115
Stark nine, stark nine.
Amber, this is Spitter. Read me? Over.

418
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,039
There's too much interference.

419
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,352
Sarge, we should go back down there.

420
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,272
Amber's fine.
She's got Mick and Napoleon.

421
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,512
<i>- Help me.
- That their radio? Let me have it.</i>

422
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,879
Colonel Redding, is this you?

423
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,319
Hello, can you hear me?

424
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,713
- That wasn't the same voice as before.
- Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.

425
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,030
But if somebody's hurt,
we're gonna help him.

426
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,192
And if somebody is fucking with us,
we're gonna find out who it is.

427
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,351
I've told you before,
this isn't spring break.

428
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,593
One way or the other, lives are at stake.
That's how it is.

429
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,317
Crank, Spitter, you stay with me on lead.
Missy, Stump, Delmar...

430
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,712
...you bring up the rear. Watch our backs.
Stay alert, and stay alive.

431
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,949
Let's move.

432
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,313
You hear something?

433
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,637
I don't know. Maybe a bird?

434
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,954
- Keep your eyes open.
- Okay.

435
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,839
What the fuck was that?

436
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,395
Shit!

437
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,874
What the fu...

438
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,749
No! Sarge!

439
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,429
D!

440
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,113
Spitter! Fuck!

441
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,271
Oh, fuck, man. Sarge!

442
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,953
That was Spit, man.

443
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,831
- Sarge!
- I didn't mean to do that!

444
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,109
Sarge!

445
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,759
You hurt? You hurt?

446
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,876
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Do what?

447
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,109
Sarge!

448
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,275
What do we do?

449
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,078
Go get me the medi-pack.

450
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,674
D! Medi-pack!
Bring it over here!

451
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,516
Fuck, man.

452
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,389
What happened?

453
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,199
I swear, this dude just popped out of
nowhere and he stabbed Spit in the back.

454
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,070
Fuck, man, I didn't mean to. Fuck,
man, is he okay? Is he okay? Fuck!

455
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,514
Sarge?

456
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,392
Sarge? Come on, breathe.
Breathe, Sarge.

457
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,278
Sarge, stay with us.

458
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,668
What do we need?

459
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,149
What do you need?

460
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,234
Crank?!

461
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,153
Missy, what do you need?

462
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,198
Crank?! Crank?!
Tell them, man, tell them.

463
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,679
It was an accident.

464
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,432
It was a fucking accident.

465
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,552
They're fucking with us.

466
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,034
These guys are smart.

467
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,315
Amber?

468
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,515
Where's Mickey?

469
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,717
Watch between the rocks.
Under your feet, too.

470
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,233
That's how they got Mickey?

471
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,356
- That's how they did it.
- God.

472
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,875
What is it?

473
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,272
What do you see, Delmar?

474
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,992
It's nothing.
We're almost there.

475
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,640
All right, guys.
Let's rig a line and get Sarge down.

476
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,392
I'm going down with him.

477
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,471
Sorry, Spit, I don't know how
to rig for a two-man.

478
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,631
- Yeah, me either, man.
- I can do it.

479
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,990
All right.
All right, let's make it happen.

480
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,749
- You need two, right?
- Yeah.

481
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,434
Oh, and a couple of those carabineers.

482
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,039
Prop him up. Prop him up.

483
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,838
You sure you know what you're doing?

484
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,878
- Double bowline. Right knot for the job.
- You sure about that?

485
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,838
- I was an Eagle Scout.
- It better fucking hold.

486
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,638
Come on, Spit, let's do it.

487
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,668
You ready? All right.

488
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,238
I'm sorry, Spitter.

489
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,312
It's the only way. If he's loose,
he'll fall out of his harness.

490
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,789
Okay?

491
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,913
<i>See you down there, cabrón.</i>

492
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,639
Okay, man.

493
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,959
Easy. Go easy.

494
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,912
- Okay.
- You got it, Spitter.

495
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,356
All right, man, plant your feet.
Take it easy.

496
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,036
Right there, Spitter. You got it.
Plant-plant your feet, man.

497
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,112
- You're doing good, Spitter.
- Little more. Little more.

498
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,551
Napoleon, get your thumb out
of your ass and help us out!

499
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,750
You feel comfortable? You looking
good, man. Keep it right there.

500
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,556
- Slow it down a little bit.
- Slow down, I'm about to lose visual.

501
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,232
Keep it slow, Spitter.

502
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,115
Y'all slow down. Slow down.

503
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,475
Spitter! Spitter! Spit!

504
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,800
- What happened?
- Shit.

505
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,155
What happened?
What happened?

506
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,309
He's fucking dead, man.

507
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,313
- What the fuck happened?
- He's fucking dead.

508
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,552
Your fucking knot didn't hold,
you lying faggot!

509
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,388
- The rope must've broke.
- The rope didn't break.

510
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,994
- Exactly.
- It was cut.

511
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,235
Oh, man, we're getting picked off
one by one here.

512
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,958
Oh, you motherfuckers!

513
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,235
You motherfuckers are dead!
You hear me?!

514
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,559
Dead!

515
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,109
Shit.

516
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,193
Where are the ropes?

517
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,873
Who's got the rest of the ropes?

518
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,994
I put them up there.

519
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,789
They're gone.
They're not here.

520
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,397
We can't get down without the ropes.

521
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,510
Who the hell is doing all
of this fucking bullshit to us?

522
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,955
Whoever these fuckers are,
they want us dead.

523
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,908
No, that's where they want us.
Thinking we got no chance.

524
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,914
We're gonna get out of this together.
Let's think about that.

525
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,318
- So how do we get down?
- There's got to be a way.

526
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,675
They got up here.
We'll take the same way down.

527
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,553
Watch your step.
It's a long way down.

528
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,033
Damn!

529
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,959
- You're not gonna like this.
- What?

530
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,437
Fuck, man!

531
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,119
Another dead end!

532
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,398
No way we're getting down
without ropes. I told you!

533
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,232
We go back and find another way.

534
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,989
Oh, shit.

535
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,672
D, why the fuck are we moving
towards the weird noises?

536
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,479
- Just shut the hell up.
- You shut the hell up. This is bullshit.

537
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,549
D!

538
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,875
Shit.

539
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,712
Go ahead and shoot.

540
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,030
- Let's get some first aid.
- Coming up.

541
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,430
Napoleon, let's watch our backs.

542
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,989
Colonel Redding?

543
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,799
Just hang on, sir, okay?
We're gonna get you out of here.

544
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,077
Where's your C. O?
Where's your Commanding Officer?

545
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,229
We lost him.

546
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,033
Better let me see those wounds, sir.

547
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,033
You don't have a fucking clue!
Jesus.

548
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,355
Shit!

549
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,752
Sir, if you know something
we should know, now's the time.

550
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,036
I just needed a little proof.

551
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,276
- Proof of what?
- What's going on here, Colonel?

552
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,440
It's not the fucks in caves...

553
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,638
...halfway around the world
that keep me up at night.

554
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,228
Right here in the middle
of our own goddamn base.

555
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,391
People still living in the mines.

556
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,313
They thought they got rid of them,
but I knew they didn't.

557
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,629
You knew about these fuckers?

558
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,791
One or two more nights...

559
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,350
...I could have had them blown back
to the Stone Age.

560
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,598
Tell us what to do, Colonel.
How do we get out of here?

561
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,274
That's a good fucking question.
Isn't it?

562
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,877
You could...
You could go down through the mines.

563
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,795
Except they'd kill you for sure.

564
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,638
All except the girls, you ladies...

565
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,918
...they'll keep you alive for breeding.
Trying to get their numbers back up.

566
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,274
What?

567
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,030
Yeah, whatever, asshole.
How do we get down this hill?

568
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,789
Simple.

569
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,959
No, no, no!

570
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,517
What the fuck?
What the fuck was that, man?

571
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,315
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

572
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,393
I'm so fucking scared.

573
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,391
We're gonna get through this.

574
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,357
We're gonna make it out of here.
Okay?

575
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,315
You think?

576
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,677
Have to.
I'm the only real family Clyde's got.

577
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,754
Give anything just to smell
his hair again.

578
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,112
You never talk about him.

579
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,429
Work's work.
Family is, I don't know, sacred.

580
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,071
I always tried keeping the two separate.

581
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,151
But I guess that's all bullshit now.

582
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,234
<i>Love you, Mommy.</i>

583
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,913
He's beautiful.

584
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,788
Now!

585
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,714
Yeah!

586
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,519
Bitch!

587
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,874
Is he dead?

588
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,758
Fucking A!

589
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,237
Got him.

590
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,113
You all right?

591
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,269
That's the piece of shit
that jumped me back at camp.

592
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,352
I think he killed Mickey, too.

593
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,400
Damn. He's fucking ugly.

594
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,959
Fucking stinks.

595
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,076
He's fucking big, man.

596
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,755
Still, nothing a little hot lead can't fix.

597
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,151
Hot lead?
Listen to you, man.

598
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,039
Yeah, well, it's just one.
How many are left?

599
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,989
Bring them on, man.

600
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,635
- You guys did good.
- Thanks.

601
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,074
Smells like shit.

602
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,429
Where's Missy?

603
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,349
Hey, Missy?

604
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,431
- Missy?
- Shit!

605
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,914
There!

606
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,275
Watch yourselves.

607
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,989
Missy!

608
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,428
Missy!

609
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,949
Hold on, Delmar.

610
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,351
You heard what that dude said.
We should climb down, man.

611
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,313
What are you talking about?

612
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,153
<i>Talking about you and me.
We don't need ropes.</i>

613
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,357
We can get down freestyle, no sweat,
man. Let's just do it.

614
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,635
- What about the rest of us?
- What about Missy?

615
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,711
We can get down fast and you know it.

616
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,077
The rest of you guys just hang tough
and we're gonna bring back some help.

617
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,389
Fuck that!

618
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,028
We stick together. It's the best way.
We separate...

619
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,316
- We're dead.
- You got that right.

620
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,755
Stump.

621
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,835
I'm gonna take my chances, man.

622
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,158
Stump! Stay with us, man.

623
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,629
Come on.

624
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,075
When I get down,
I'm gonna bring back help.

625
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,429
This is stupid, man.

626
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,239
Crank, that is fucking stupid, man.

627
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,712
I'm going back out.

628
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,074
Shit.

629
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,108
You guys ready for this?

630
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,398
We got your back.

631
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,232
It stinks in here.

632
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,829
You see anything?

633
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,150
There's only one way
they could've gone.

634
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,159
Dead end?

635
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,672
Where the fuck are they?

636
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,075
Guys.

637
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,715
Down here.

638
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,758
I can't see shit.

639
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,834
I'll check it out.

640
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,039
Wait for my signal.

641
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,995
- You good?
- Clear.

642
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,755
Fuck! Fuck!

643
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,199
Fuck.

644
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,553
Oh, shit.

645
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,799
Oh, my God!

646
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,429
We got you.

647
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,074
- Get me out!
- You're good. You're fine. It's all right.

648
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,594
Jesus Christ!

649
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,789
You cool, Napoleon?

650
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,032
Yeah, I think so. Jesus.

651
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,638
Where the hell are we?

652
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,792
Next level down.

653
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,833
All right. Okay.

654
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,589
Fuck!

655
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,595
They're just fucking rocks.

656
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,117
They're only fucking rocks.

657
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,117
I'm not gonna let you bastards get me.
Not me. Not today.

658
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,952
This is not gonna happen.

659
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,359
Hey, guys.

660
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,713
There's a breeze.

661
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,039
Shit.

662
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,155
This is where the fuckers hid
to cut the ropes.

663
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,472
We can't just leave them down there.

664
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,358
There's nothing we can do for them now.

665
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,715
Except find Missy
and get the fuck out of here.

666
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,916
Missy's probably dead, too.

667
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,193
You're not doing anybody
any good talking like that.

668
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,079
Come on.

669
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,159
Delmar!

670
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,639
Delmar!

671
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,711
No, help me! Oh, God!

672
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,030
Oh, no! Oh, no!

673
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,512
Is it a dead end?

674
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,554
No. No, it goes through.

675
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,593
- How deep is it?
- Let's see.

676
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,111
How many do you think there are?

677
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,714
Who knows? Too many.

678
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,437
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving one for myself.

679
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,714
Do you remember what Crank said?
Dead is never better.

680
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,677
We're gonna get out of here.

681
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,749
I just...

682
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,913
- Amber!
- Napoleon!

683
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,515
- Hang on!
- Shit!

684
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,839
Fuck!

685
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,832
What the hell?!

686
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,274
Shit!

687
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,229
You guys all right?

688
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,439
Amber?!

689
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,394
Napoleon?!

690
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,199
Where's my rifle?

691
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,868
You okay?

692
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,196
- Shit.
- Amber!

693
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,069
You guys all right?

694
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,674
Yeah. We're all right.

695
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,708
- We're gonna find a way down.
- No problem.

696
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,313
Hang on.

697
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,519
Shit.

698
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,194
Napoleon.

699
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,272
What are you doing?

700
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,909
Napoleon!

701
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,553
I thought I heard something.

702
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,669
Shit.

703
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,031
I think that's the level they're on.

704
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,679
You think we can climb
down without gear?

705
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:32,197
You see that beam? If we can
make it across, we slide down that.

706
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,998
I think I could make that jump.

707
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,759
What are you doing?

708
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,353
Crank. Crank! Wait!

709
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,998
- Crank!
- Fuck! Shit!

710
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,399
Shit!

711
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,953
Delmar!

712
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,633
Hang on!

713
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,469
Thanks.

714
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,032
Let's keep it moving.

715
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,149
Let's go.

716
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,108
No!

717
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,953
Want.

718
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,831
Mama.

719
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,396
Pretty.

720
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,030
Dirty cunt!

721
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,469
Come here.

722
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,952
Mine!

723
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,911
So sweet.

724
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,198
No. Was her. Papa, no.

725
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,992
You give me baby.

726
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,474
- Shit.
- Goddamn it. Come on.

727
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,232
Motherfucker!

728
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,719
Missy!

729
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,679
Help me!

730
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,756
Somebody help me!

731
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,993
Shit. It's Stump's headband.

732
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,275
What?

733
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,832
Oh, my God. Oh, shit.

734
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,159
Where is he?

735
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,389
There!

736
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,069
There!

737
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,469
Got you.

738
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,029
Enough!

739
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,239
Kill them all.

740
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,632
Napoleon? We got to go.
He's got a gun. Come on.

741
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,514
Napoleon.

742
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,111
The hatch. Get the hatch.
Get the hatch!

743
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,629
Missy?!

744
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,148
Which way?

745
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,519
You safe here.

746
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,679
Safe.

747
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,229
I'm right behind you.
Let's go.

748
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,237
Goddamn.

749
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,871
What the hell happened here?

750
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,193
Come on, bitch!

751
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,513
Yeah, baby! It's all about volume!
Got to have volume!

752
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,669
It's Crank.

753
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,398
- You okay?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

754
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,836
Lone Ranger shoulder wound.
Missed the bone completely.

755
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,115
Damn.

756
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,918
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah.

757
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,393
Who you fucking with, huh?
Who you fucking with?

758
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,030
Crank? Crank?
You got any ammo left?

759
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,073
Fuck.

760
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,989
I'm out, too.

761
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,114
Delmar? Your bayonet.

762
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,674
- Crank! Delmar!
- Shit!

763
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,068
Down here.

764
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,715
Oh, shit!
You guys are alive!

765
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,269
What happened to you?

766
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,874
- Oh, shit.
- Delmar, are you all right?

767
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,517
Be a hell of a lot better
when we get out of here.

768
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,069
- Were you shot?
- I'm fine. It's nothing.

769
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,673
You sure?

770
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,675
Shit.

771
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,990
- What the hell is that?
- He's okay.

772
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,593
Are you out of your goddamn mind?
He's one of them!

773
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,829
No, he just saved our lives.

774
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,389
No fear. You come.

775
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,829
Follow me.

776
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,794
Come.

777
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,428
This way.

778
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,912
- You good?
- I'm all right.

779
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,514
Don't worry. I'm all right.

780
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,669
We got to get him out of here.

781
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,478
Missy's not that far.
You heard her screams.

782
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,870
How're we gonna get her out of here
without any goddamn ammo?

783
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,871
We can fight them with rocks
and rifle butts if we have to.

784
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,918
- Who's Rambo resurrected now?
- I just wanna get everyone out of here.

785
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,719
Yeah? Well, tell that to Mickey,
and Spitter, and Stump!

786
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,633
- Crank! Shut the hell up!
- You trust that guy?

787
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,472
He hid us from them.
He didn't give us up.

788
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,198
We don't have any choice.
We have to trust him.

789
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,396
Bullshit!
God knows where he's taking us.

790
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:16,076
To be honest with you, I'm not sure
God knows anything about this place.

791
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,872
Through here.

792
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,072
Must through here.

793
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,114
Jesus.

794
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,189
Shit.

795
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,115
Holy shit.

796
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,713
Oh, man.

797
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,349
Oh, God.

798
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,555
- Jeez!
- What the fuck?!

799
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,912
- God! Mickey!
- Don't look!

800
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,708
You sick fuck!

801
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,440
You should be shot!
I should kill you!

802
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,272
- Crank!
- What, man?

803
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,079
Why you always try
to shut me down, Delmar, huh?

804
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,753
Don't freak out.

805
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,399
- What the fuck?
- Don't freak out.

806
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,279
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

807
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

808
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,116
What the fuck, what? Delmar!

809
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,349
Delmar.

810
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,115
What the fuck, man?

811
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,998
You were hit twice?

812
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,874
Why didn't you tell me?

813
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,757
Don't do this, man.
Don't do this!

814
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,757
Don't do this.
Don't leave me, man.

815
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,396
Don't fucking leave me!

816
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,594
Fuck!

817
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,116
Get me a medi-pack. Napoleon!

818
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,397
Get me a medi-pack. Come on.

819
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,395
Crank.

820
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,788
I'm not gonna leave him.

821
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,871
I'm not gonna leave him.
You sick fuck!

822
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,111
- You're not gonna have him!
- Okay, okay.

823
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,517
I'm gonna get you out of here.

824
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:11,795
Get us out of here.

825
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,230
Come. Yeah.

826
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,197
I'll get you out of here.

827
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,075
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

828
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,955
I bet this leads outside!
How do I get this fucking door open?

829
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,590
- Come on!
- Hey, would you forget it, Crank?

830
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,678
Would you forget it? It's a blast door.
You're never gonna get it open.

831
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,909
God dammit!

832
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,912
We need to get out of here,
you fucking retard!

833
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,071
- Crank!
- How the fuck do we get out of here?

834
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,229
What about Missy?

835
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,791
Would you get off this shit that she's
alive? Missy is fucking dead! Okay?!

836
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,078
Just like the rest of them.

837
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,118
Just like we're gonna be
if we don't get the fuck out of here!

838
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,713
We are not leaving this place
without her!

839
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,111
Stupid, okay?

840
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,152
How the fuck do we get out
of here, man? Which way is it?!

841
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,593
What's over there?
What's over here?

842
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,955
- I'm going back for her!
- Amber, stay here.

843
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,599
- Guys!
- Amber?

844
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,558
Oh, shit! Guys! Check it out!

845
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,278
Everything we need...

846
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,230
No touch! No touch.

847
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,398
Amber! Please, don't.

848
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:30,995
I'm begging you.

849
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,152
I'd go back for you.

850
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,035
Amber!

851
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,634
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, shit.

852
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,238
Dynamite. Perfect.

853
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,550
My God.
I'm gonna get out of here after all.

854
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,515
Oh, yeah. Delmar?
We're getting out of here, baby.

855
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,559
What the...

856
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,233
Fuck!

857
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,390
Oh, God. Crank!

858
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,554
- You okay?
- Yeah.

859
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,836
Oh, shit. Crank!

860
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,914
Crank?

861
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,829
Crank!

862
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,148
It's Missy!

863
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,514
Let's do it.

864
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,558
Missy's phone.

865
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,757
- What?
- Do you still have Missy's phone?

866
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,553
Wait here.

867
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:01,916
<i>I can't take it anymore. I can't!
I don't wanna be quiet.</i>

868
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:06,790
<i>I want out of here. We're gonna die,
don't you get it? We're gonna die!</i>

869
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,518
<i>Which way to go?</i>

870
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,150
<i>Which way do we go, Napoleon?
Where?</i>

871
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,518
<i>I can't take it anymore, Napoleon.
I can't!</i>

872
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,715
Genius.

873
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,515
<i>We're gonna die, don't you get it?
We're gonna die!</i>

874
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,713
Jesus Christ.

875
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,396
- Amber!
- You okay? Give me this arm.

876
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,348
- Stay with me.
- It's okay. We got you. We got you.

877
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,112
Where's everybody else?

878
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,838
<i>We're gonna die.</i>

879
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,752
<i>Love you, Mommy.</i>

880
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,759
Get me out of here, please!

881
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,318
- Don't let him touch me again.
- Come on, let's go.

882
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,472
Please.
Don't let him touch me.

883
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,472
- Amber.
- Come on.

884
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,198
- We got you.
- This way.

885
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,795
Napoleon!

886
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,315
- I don't hear him anymore.
- What are you doing?

887
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,912
Let's just get out of here!

888
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,593
Please!

889
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,115
We don't have time...

890
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,154
Come here!

891
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,069
- No!
- Die!

892
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,354
Bitch!

893
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,394
Die!

894
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,716
Napoleon, get up!
Get up!

895
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,351
Napoleon, get up!

896
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,674
Die.

897

Amber!

898
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,394
Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.

899

Come on. Come on!

900
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,791
- Get her!
- Missy, let's go! Let's get out of here!

901
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,554
Motherfucker!

902

Missy! Come on! Missy!

903
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,833
Don't let him get his knife!

904
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,151
- Pull!
- Missy!

905
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,710
Get my leg! Oh, my God!

906
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,030
Let go of her!

907
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,758
Missy! Get something!

908
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,719
