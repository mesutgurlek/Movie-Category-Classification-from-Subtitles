1
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:29,729
Oh! No!

2
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:33,765
No, no!

3
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,014
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

4
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,246
Blood! Blood!

5
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,745
<i>Are you stating, Counsel,</i>

6
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:27,374
<i>you're not gonna offer any
contradictory psychiatric testimony?</i>

7
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,315
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

8
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:31,553
On the basis
of this staff report,

9
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:34,215
Norman Bates is judged
restored to sanity

10
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,757
and is ordered released
forthwith.

11
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:37,952
What about his victims?

12
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:42,393
Don't they have any say?
Can you restore them?

13
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,595
Madam, please sit down.

14
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,066
This matter
is being represented

15
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:47,193
by the District Attorney.

16
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,966
Your Honor, my name
is Mrs. Lila Loomis.

17
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,805
I have a petition here
signed by 743 people

18
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,673
against Norman Bates' release,

19
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:57,212
including the relatives

20
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,077
of the seven people
he murdered.

21
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:01,082
Doesn't that give me
the right to speak out?

22
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,277
Has the District Attorney
advised Mrs. Loomis

23
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:04,718
about her rights
in this matter?

24
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:05,776
Yes, Your Honor.

25
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,117
I explained that her petition

26
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,680
had no effect
on these proceedings.

27
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,749
Did you explain to her
that this hearing...

28
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,385
Why are you people
just sitting here?

29
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,987
Don't you realize they're going
to release a homicidal maniac?

30
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,396
I must ask you to sit down
or I'll have the bailiff

31
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:18,729
remove you
from this courtroom.

32
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:20,200
If you've
any further questions,

33
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,294
please discuss them
with the District Attorney

34
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,430
after this hearing.

35
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:24,837
Why bother?

36
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,238
It's all too obvious,

37
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,072
our courts
protect the criminals,

38
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,668
not their victims.

39
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,778
Congratulations, Norman.

40
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,877
Turning now
to calendar number 71143.

41
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,285
Is that all there is
to it?

42
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:42,017
That's all there is
to it. Let's go.

43
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:45,555
Let the record reflect

44
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:47,528
that the defendant
is present with counsel.

45
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,326
Just like I said,
they let him go.

46
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,162
I'll call you later.

47
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:52,599
Are you satisfied,
Doctor?

48
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:54,898
Turning a murderer loose
on an innocent public?

49
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,166
Mrs. Loomis, Norman was
not convicted of murder.

50
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,299
He was found "not guilty"
by reason of insanity.

51
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,433
And since he is
no longer...

52
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,307
That is just
legal hocus-pocus

53
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,539
and when he
murders again,

54
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,844
you will be
directly responsible.

55
00:06:45,555 --> 00:06:46,920
Well, this belongs
to Mr. Toomey

56
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,013
who runs the motel.

57
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,888
Want me to find him?
I'll introduce you.

58
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,984
No, no. It'll... lt'll wait.

59
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:07,402
What's the matter?

60
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,678
Uh, I saw someone.

61
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:11,572
Where?

62
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:13,472
L-ln that window.

63
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,348
They haven't had a tenant
in the house for years.

64
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,046
I guess
I'm just nervous.

65
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,518
Well, that's understandable
under the circumstances.

66
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:24,518
Yeah.

67
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,479
Well, this is it.

68
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,707
Yeah.

69
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,478
You don't have to
stay here, you know.

70
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,645
I could find you
a place in town.

71
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,554
No, no.
L... I want to stay here.

72
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,261
Then as long
as you realize

73
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,763
that the memories are
more likely to reoccur here...

74
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,095
But you know how to handle
that now, don't you?

75
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:07,261
Sure.

76
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,338
You start work at noon today.
Don't forget.

77
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,772
No, I won't.

78
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,805
I don't suppose you will.

79
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:20,676
What's wrong?

80
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,780
Oh, nothing, really.

81
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:25,145
I just wish there hadn't been
all those cutbacks,

82
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,654
there'd be
a trained social worker

83
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,747
looking in on you
from time to time.

84
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:30,382
Well, I have you,
don't I?

85
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,983
Damn right you do.

86
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,824
I had the phone
reconnected.

87
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,659
Any trouble, use it.

88
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:36,989
Okay.

89
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:45,569
Thanks, Doctor,
for everything.

90
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:44,021
Mother?

91
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,327
<i>Norman.</i>

92
00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:01,440
<i>Norman, what did you put
in my tea?</i>

93
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:06,082
<i>I'm gonna get you
for this, Norman.</i>

94
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:09,352
<i>I'm gonna show you
what happens</i>

95
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:13,555
<i>to bad little boys
who poison their mothers.</i>

96
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:18,464
<i>I'm going to kill you!</i>

97
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:08,207
Can I help you?

98
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,650
I'm Norman. Norman Bates.

99
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,347
The new cook's helper.

100
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,252
Oh, yes.
Doctor what's-his-name

101
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:15,517
called about you.
Raymond.

102
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,024
I'm the one
who urged Mr. Statler

103
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,117
to give you the job.

104
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:19,627
I think
it's very Christian

105
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,128
to forgive and forget,
don't you?

106
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,129
I sure do.

107
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:25,099
So do I. Myrna.
This is Norman Bates.

108
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,758
That's Myrna, Norman.

109
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,702
Come on, I'll introduce you
to Mr. Statler.

110
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,137
He's in the back.

111
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,431
Ralph, this is Norman Bates.

112
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,602
You have to tell me what.
Just give me...

113
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:38,545
Ralph, this is Norman Bates,
your new helper.

114
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,344
Hi. Get him an apron,
will you, Mrs. Spool?

115
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,842
Scott, we have to talk
about it sometime.

116
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,477
Step on it, would you, girl?

117
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:47,818
You're being paid to wait on
tables, not gab on the phone.

118
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,915
Look, I'll call you
back later. We'll talk then.

119
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,482
We're getting ready
for rush hour.

120
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,721
He's really very nice
once he catches his breath.

121
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,128
Hey, Queen for a Day,
wanna try being a waitress?

122
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:58,166
Mary, this is Norman.

123
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,395
He's gonna be working
back here.

124
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,493
Hi.

125
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:05,133
Boyfriend troubles,
poor child.

126
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,300
Heart of gold
but head of wood.

127
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,004
Let's get that apron
for you, shall we?

128
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:17,947
Here you go.

129
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,180
Jesus Christ, girl,

130
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,988
what have you broken
this time?

131
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,550
It wasn't her fault,
Mr. Statler.

132
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,392
It was me.
L... l... I did it.

133
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:30,830
Well, let her pick up
and you get back here

134
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,993
before you do
any more damage.

135
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,064
Thanks.

136
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:39,797
Here, Bates.

137
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:51,981
Here, put these up there under the
hot lights and read the orders off.

138
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:54,953
On the wheel. On the wheel.

139
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:56,985
Oh.

140
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:04,232
Uh, two meatloaf sandwiches and
one mashed potato with gravy.

141
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,231
And one baked potato.

142
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,633
Okay, go ahead, go ahead,
do it. See if I care.

143
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,705
No, no, Scott. I didn't
mean it. Listen to me.

144
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,867
Hello?

145
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,369
Hello?

146
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:22,378
Bastard.

147
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,577
You all right?

148
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:26,280
Of course I'm all right.

149
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:27,481
Where you going?
Into town.

150
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,183
Will you
please leave me alone?

151
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:32,523
If you're going into town, you're
heading in the wrong direction.

152
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,160
Look, l... I don't know
what happened,

153
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,228
but, uh, why don't you
let me call you a cab?

154
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,237
Why?

155
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:46,672
Why? So you can
get home safely.

156
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:49,840
I don't have a home.

157
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,437
No home?

158
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,812
I've been living with my
boyfriend for over a year.

159
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:56,818
And all of a sudden,
he tells me we're through.

160
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:59,650
And then I just phoned him to ask
him why and he wouldn't tell me.

161
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:03,123
All he'd say is that I couldn't
come back to our apartment.

162
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,251
Well, what're you...
What... What're you gonna do?

163
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,994
Call a friend in town,
I guess.

164
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,428
See if somebody'll let me
crash with them for the night.

165
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:10,590
What about your parents?

166
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,997
Uh, couldn't you
stay with them?

167
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:13,534
They're in Portland.

168
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,695
And they don't care
what happens to me, anyway.

169
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:20,504
Oh, uh, I own a motel
not too far from here.

170
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,869
And you'd be welcome
to spend the night

171
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,810
in one of the empty rooms
if you'd like.

172
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,075
F-FOC, of course.

173
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,084
What?

174
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,709
Free of charge.

175
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,109
Oh.

176
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:36,520
But no, that's very nice of
you but I don't wanna impose.

177
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:38,583
You wouldn't be imposing.

178
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,987
Co-workers ought to help each
other out, don't you think?

179
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:46,090
You know what, you covered for me
today when I broke that pie plate.

180
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,463
Yeah.

181
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:50,300
I figured you'd get into more
trouble for it than I would.

182
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:51,532
You're not kidding.

183
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:55,304
I've been working there four days and
I've broken a dozen dishes already.

184
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,072
You sure it's all right
if I stay at your motel?

185
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,375
Absolutely.

186
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:03,511
Come on, let's get going.
It looks like rain.

187
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,934
Well, we almost made it.

188
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,337
You didn't get
too wet, did you?

189
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:26,499
No, I'm all right.

190
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:27,507
Oh.

191
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:28,941
Do you own all this?

192
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,980
Oh, yeah.
Well, it isn't much,

193
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:34,344
but I'll get it
fixed up eventually.

194
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,078
Well, let me
get you a room key.

195
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:40,754
Mr. Toomey.

196
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:01,768
Why don't you wait here
while I check the room?

197
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:04,540
Uh, just to make sure
the linen's fresh.

198
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,898
What you thinking about
stealing something?

199
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,758
There's no reason to be scared,
sweetheart. I manage this dump.

200
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,697
What do you want, a room?

201
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,542
Norman's already
getting me one, thank you.

202
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,277
You're with Bates?

203
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:45,114
Well, uh, you must be
Norman Bates.

204
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,155
I'm Warren Toomey.

205
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,687
Mary, why don't you
go up to the house?

206
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,885
The... The front door
is open.

207
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,751
Is something wrong
with the room?

208
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,458
No. Just... Just... Just... Just...
Just go up and wait for me, okay?

209
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,591
Look,
it doesn't matter...

210
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,567
Look, just do
as I say, okay?

211
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,538
She's pretty cute.
Where'd you find her?

212
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,339
What's this stuff?

213
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,377
I'd say it was drugs.

214
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,613
What about
the occupied cabins?

215
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,745
Is that what's going on
in there, too?

216
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:21,016
Yeah.

217
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,318
Boy, this town.

218
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:24,382
If it isn't the parents,
it's the kids.

219
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,451
I caught a couple of them
screwin' in the basement

220
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,120
of your house up there
last week.

221
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:29,664
Of course,
I threw them right out.

222
00:17:29,732 --> 00:17:31,666
Can you believe that?

223
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,601
What kind of a motel
are you running here?

224
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,875
The kind that makes money.

225
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:43,243
People come here to party.

226
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,337
They stay a few hours
and then they leave.

227
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:49,407
What more can you ask from a motel
so far from the beaten track, huh?

228
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,952
You're fired.

229
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,815
Hey, you can't fire me.

230
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,516
I was hired by the hospital.

231
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:58,719
This State has no claim on me
or my property anymore.

232
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:00,091
And neither do you.

233
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,959
I want you
out of here tomorrow.

234
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,488
Yeah, well, why don't you try
putting me out, Mr. Whacko, hmm?

235
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:06,864
I'd like to see that.

236
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,165
I won't have to.
I'll just go to the police.

237
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,638
I'm sure they'd be very
interested in what's going on here,

238
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,504
especially the drugs.

239
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:16,736
Tomorrow, Mr. Toomey.

240
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:20,339
And don't rent out any more
rooms in this motel. No more.

241
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:29,757
At least my customers
have a good time.

242
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,850
What'd yours get,
Bates, huh?

243
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:34,292
Dead, that's what
they got!

244
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,855
Dead! Murdered by you,
you loony!

245
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,097
Hi!

246
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,700
What was all
the yelling about?

247
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:50,836
Oh.

248
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:54,747
My motel manager
and I just had a fight.

249
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,814
Wasn't because of me,
was it?

250
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,012
No.

251
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,821
Why are you sitting
in the dark?

252
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,053
I was just thinking
about Scott.

253
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,096
Maybe if I hadn't
blown up at him so quick,

254
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,391
we would've
worked things out.

255
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,027
Yeah, maybe.
L... I don't know.

256
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:20,468
Is that, uh, better?

257
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,041
Do you think I should call
him and talk to him again?

258
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,512
Oh, sure.

259
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:46,899
Hi, Scott?

260
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:52,367
Are you all right?

261
00:19:52,908 --> 00:19:54,375
What were you talking about?

262
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,876
Listen, I didn't mean it.

263
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,935
Are you still
mad at me?

264
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,339
Yeah, I'm fine.

265
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,114
I'm at this motel.

266
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,751
No, I didn't get wet.

267
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:08,847
I got here just
before the storm started.

268
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,118
Look, I can take care
of myself.

269
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:15,290
No, of course not.

270
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:29,942
Look, I can't talk any longer.
I got to go.

271
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:41,854
Uh, oh.

272
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:43,952
How did it go?

273
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:47,189
Terrible. I found out why he
didn't want me to come home tonight.

274
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:48,559
Oh, well, why?

275
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,892
He's got somebody new.

276
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,728
He's moved her in
already.

277
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,063
Well, that's no good.

278
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,895
Oh, well.

279
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:59,600
Think how it would've been if
I'd married him and then found out

280
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,666
what sort of guy he was.

281
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:03,808
He asked me to, you know?

282
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,109
Sure. L... I mean,
I'm sure he did.

283
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:09,308
Oh, uh, have... have...
have you had dinner yet?

284
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:10,316
No.

285
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:12,046
Well, let... let's have it
together.

286
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,815
I was just about to
sit down.

287
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,016
It's just, uh,
sandwiches and milk,

288
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:18,389
but you're more than welcome to share it.

289
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,552
I really
don't think that...

290
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,119
No, no, no, do it. Do it... Do
it for my sake. Starving yourself

291
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,597
isn't going to make
anything any better, either.

292
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,132
All right.

293
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:29,296
But this is yours.

294
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,568
No, go ahead, you... you
have it. I'll make another.

295
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,473
Do you have a knife?

296
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:39,072
No, I'm afraid I don't.

297
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:42,774
L... I just moved back here
after being many years away.

298
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:46,216
I forgot to bring
any cu-cutlery.

299
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:48,555
That's odd.

300
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:50,147
People usually
leave something,

301
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,420
even if it is only
an old butter knife.

302
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:55,657
Oh, there.

303
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:12,813
Is something wrong, Norman?

304
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,748
Um,

305
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,190
aren't you going to eat?

306
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,493
No. L... l... l... I just
suddenly lost my appetite,

307
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:32,123
but you... you... you
go ahead.

308
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,462
Enjoy it.

309
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:44,702
I guess I'm like you. L... I
suddenly lost my appetite, too.

310
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,942
Oh, w-w-would you like
something else?

311
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,345
There're cookies for dessert.

312
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:51,409
Oh, no, no, th-thank you.

313
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:53,181
Uh, can I use
your phone again?

314
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,381
Sure.

315
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,582
Who you gonna call?

316
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:58,785
Um, I just remembered this
girlfriend I have in town.

317
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,919
L... I mean, she's kind of
a girlfriend, and, uh,

318
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:03,487
maybe she'd let me
spend the night with her.

319
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:06,534
Well, huh, I thought
you were gonna stay here.

320
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,227
There's a spare room
upstairs

321
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,635
and you're
more than welcome to it.

322
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:13,173
Uh, l... I don't think
that's such a good idea.

323
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,401
Why?

324
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:19,404
I don't mean to hurt
your feelings or anything,

325
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,414
but Myrna was talking about
you at the diner today.

326
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,180
Mrs. Spool kept on telling
her to shush but she wouldn't.

327
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:27,221
She said you'd been
locked up.

328
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:33,555
Did she say why?
Well, I'll tell you.

329
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:38,094
When I was 12,
my mother went mad,

330
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,465
so I put some poison
in her tea.

331
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:43,060
You know? Just...

332
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:45,297
I'm all right now.

333
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:47,267
You sure?

334
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,366
Sure.

335
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:51,708
Otherwise they wouldn't have given
me a job in a diner, would they?

336
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,476
I don't know.
It takes a nut to work there.

337
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,216
Oh, boy!

338
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:01,923
Look, I-I-I'm sorry,
but I don't want to...

339
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:05,824
What if I told you
that I needed you to stay?

340
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:08,626
Why would you need me?

341
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,295
Because this is
the first night

342
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,562
I've spent in this house
in years, much less alone.

343
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:16,260
A lot of my troubles

344
00:24:16,404 --> 00:24:18,235
had to do
with this house.

345
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:22,743
So you see, I'm as scared as you
are, just for different reasons.

346
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:25,438
I-I'm sorry,
but l... l...

347
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:26,503
Please.

348
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:31,575
That bad, huh?

349
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,832
No. Not... Not... Not that one.

350
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:50,934
This one over there.

351
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:52,903
What's wrong
with this one?

352
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:56,239
Well, that, uh, used
to belong to my mother.

353
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,440
But she's dead,
isn't she?

354
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:00,140
Yeah.

355
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:03,679
Is this the room where
you had your troubles?

356
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,276
One of them, yeah.

357
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,779
Well, I don't know what
happened to you in the past,

358
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:10,222
but you're never gonna get
over it, not unless you face it.

359
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:23,326
See? No ghosts.

360
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:28,133
No.

361
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,808
I could sleep here.

362
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:33,870
No, I'd, uh...

363
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:35,244
Why not?

364
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,374
I'd just rather
you didn't.

365
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:41,551
What happened in here
that scared you so?

366
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:48,461
Let me show you the room
across the hall, okay?

367
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,173
You'll be, uh,
just fine in here.

368
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:02,641
Well, the, uh...

369
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:04,974
The bathroom?

370
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:06,946
L-ls, uh,
right over there.

371
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,249
Uh, well,

372
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:12,610
I guess it's time to, uh,
to go to sleep.

373
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,747
Okay.

374
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,114
Good night, Mary.

375
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:33,492
About time, girl.

376
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,466
Sorry.

377
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:35,764
Hi.
Hi.

378
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:38,501
I'm sorry I missed you
this morning.

379
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,201
I got up early and went into
town to see my girlfriend.

380
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:44,074
You know, the one
I was telling you about.

381
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:45,968
Guess what?

382
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:47,103
What?

383
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,377
We're going to
room together.

384
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,747
Well, y-y-y-you... you're more than
welcome to stay with me, you know.

385
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:55,255
Thanks, but I'd really
rather live in town.

386
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:57,018
Oh, in town, yeah.

387
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,287
Uh, my... my place is
a lot closer to work.

388
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,363
No, l... I really don't think
that's a good idea.

389
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,524
Okay. Well,
if you change your mind.

390
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,660
Hey, girl, I gave you the
morning off, not the afternoon.

391
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:09,704
Hop to it.

392
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,204
Charming, isn't he?

393
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:15,772
Chop up some more lettuce,
will you, Norman?

394
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:38,230
Hey, Ralph, so, uh, how's
your new helper doing?

395
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,927
Hi, Warren.
Just fine, thanks.

396
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:46,439
Yeah, well, I hope he washes
dishes better than he runs a motel.

397
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:10,095
Hey, can I get a little service
around here or what, huh?

398
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,189
Okay.

399
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:13,166
Hey, cutie! Come here.

400
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:15,560
Oh, hello,
what would you like?

401
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:20,166
I'd like some of what
Norman got last night.

402
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:23,237
Pardon?

403
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:25,370
You heard me, sweetheart.

404
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:28,678
Why don't you look at a
menu and I'll be right back?

405
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,619
What happened between you
and that man last night?

406
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,677
I fired him.

407
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:37,122
Oh, great,
he's on my station.

408
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:39,049
What did he say?

409
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:41,061
Nothing nice and I
think he's been drinking.

410
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:42,926
He sure smells like it.

411
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:44,965
Hey, you do have
other tables, honey,

412
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,263
or do you want me to
wait on those, too?

413
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:49,895
Talk about the customers
being nasty.

414
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:54,533
Excuse me,
do you still work here?

415
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:55,541
Yeah.

416
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,942
Then can I please
have my orders?

417
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:25,665
What was it like?

418
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,467
What's what like?

419
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,305
Screwin' a psycho?

420
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,947
Would you mind
removing your foot?

421
00:30:34,682 --> 00:30:35,910
Next.

422
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,747
Two turkey sandwiches
on whole wheat toast.

423
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:42,380
One BLT, hold the mayo.

424
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:44,925
I'll get the tomatoes,
Mr. Statler.

425
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,922
Hey, I suppose
you didn't spend last night

426
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,591
alone with him
in that house, huh?

427
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,101
You got strange tastes
in men, honey.

428
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:57,770
Just because two people
sleep under the same roof

429
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,966
doesn't necessarily mean
they've made love.

430
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,474
Since when, huh?

431
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:04,569
Or are you the kind that
doesn't, uh, kiss and tell?

432
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:10,147
You really want to know
what Norman's like?

433
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:11,310
Yeah.

434
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,115
Better than
you'll ever be, fat boy.

435
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:22,328
Cut it out, Toomey!

436
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:23,386
Norman?

437
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,295
Are you talkin'
to me, whacko?

438
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,594
Come on.

439
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,932
Come on. Come on! Huh?

440
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:33,396
What's wrong?

441
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,511
Oh. Oh, that's... that's beautiful.
Go on, psycho, pick it up.

442
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:44,347
Come on, pick it up!

443
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,644
What's the matter,
you lose your nerve, huh?

444
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,746
Or do you only
attack women, huh?

445
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,188
Go on, pick it up!

446
00:31:50,258 --> 00:31:51,987
Show us what
you're really like.

447
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,994
Come... Come on, loony.

448
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,497
Oh, look, not only is he
crazy, he's chicken shit, too.

449
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,074
What's the trouble, Warren?

450
00:32:08,142 --> 00:32:10,610
The trouble is
that psycho you hired.

451
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,181
This is the last time
I eat here.

452
00:32:15,383 --> 00:32:17,351
You're sweating all over.

453
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:22,889
Can I get you
something?

454
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:24,185
A glass of water, maybe?

455
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:25,190
No.

456
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:27,090
What the hell did you
do out there?

457
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:28,753
That man, Mr. Toomey,
he was trying...

458
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,025
I'm not talkin'
to you, girl.

459
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,131
Well?

460
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,294
He was bothering Mary, and
then he slipped me a note.

461
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,428
What note?

462
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:38,472
It's there on the wheel.

463
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,577
There's nothing here.

464
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,215
Look, Norman, you're tired.

465
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:56,518
Why don't you take the
rest of the afternoon off?

466
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:58,559
I'm telling you,
it was right there.

467
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:02,291
Sure it was.

468
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,621
Don't humor me.

469
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,696
I'm telling you there
was a note on that wheel

470
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,204
from my dead mother.

471
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:26,117
Okay, everybody,
business as usual.

472
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:46,504
Hi.

473
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:49,372
Is that offer to room
with you still open?

474
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:51,369
Oh, sure.

475
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,674
Great.

476
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:54,438
Well, w-what happened?

477
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:55,708
Oh,

478
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,578
you know my girlfriend,
the one I told you about?

479
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:00,052
Yeah.
Well,

480
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,813
her boyfriend sleeps over
almost every night.

481
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,916
Do you know what it's like trying
to sleep in a one-room apartment

482
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:09,121
when a couple's making love
five feet from you?

483
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:11,526
Noisy?

484
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,362
You're not kidding.

485
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:16,365
Well, I thought you were
wonderful today.

486
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:17,495
Why?

487
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,096
The way you handled
that Toomey guy.

488
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:20,470
What an asshole.

489
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,566
I could've killed him
and you were so cool.

490
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,168
No, I don't kill
people anymore, remember?

491
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:28,346
Oh, here.

492
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,008
What's this?
Fudge.

493
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:34,179
My grandmother sent it to
me. She makes great fudge.

494
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:38,220
Well, thank you.

495
00:34:39,093 --> 00:34:41,891
What about that note?
You figure out who sent it?

496
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:45,162
That was just
a practical joke.

497
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,329
Yeah, I guess so.

498
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:49,197
Oh, oh, oh, l-let me
take that.

499
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,135
No, no, no, that's all right. I can manage.

500
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:52,194
Uh...

501
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,074
Did you... Did you
have dinner yet?

502
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:55,074
Yes.

503
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:58,203
And I'm exhausted. I'm going to
bed right after I take a shower.

504
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,213
If that's all right
with you.

505
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:01,805
Oh, oh, sure.

506
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,872
Hey, wake up!

507
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,431
Hey, you nut guys there?

508
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:49,865
Hey!

509
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:55,313
Psycho!
Hey, hello, psycho!

510
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,647
I just want you to know
I'm moving out! Huh?

511
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:17,997
Hello?

512
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,475
W-What? Who is this?

513
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,141
My mother is dead.

514
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:35,053
Mr. Toomey, if this is you,
you're sicker than I ever was.

515
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:44,925
Bastard.

516
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:45,357
Bill!

517
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,867
Hi, Bill. I wasn't
expecting you till tomorrow.

518
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:58,836
Hi, Norman.

519
00:40:58,906 --> 00:41:00,271
I got a call
from Mr. Statler.

520
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:02,172
He said you quit your job
at the diner.

521
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:05,474
Yeah. Well, I just figured I could
make more money with the motel.

522
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:09,243
You know, once I get... once I
get it back into condition that is.

523
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:11,546
What does Mr. Toomey think
about your plans?

524
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:13,678
Him? You know,
I fired him.

525
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:15,415
Y-Y-You know,
he was turning this place

526
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:18,686
into what I think
they call an "adult motel."

527
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,888
Oh, I see.

528
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,158
Well, there've been an awful lot of
changes in the week you've been back.

529
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,598
Yeah, yeah.

530
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:30,092
Any more notes
or phone calls?

531
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:31,570
Oh, no, no, no.

532
00:41:32,106 --> 00:41:33,232
Who's that?

533
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:34,239
Where?

534
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:36,333
There, in the top window?

535
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:37,844
In the attic?

536
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,880
It looked like a woman.

537
00:41:39,947 --> 00:41:41,881
Oh, oh, oh,
that must've been Mary.

538
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:42,916
Mary, who?

539
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:45,349
Oh, Mary. She works with me
at the diner.

540
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,921
She's been staying here, too.

541
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,245
Hmm?

542
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,815
Oh, it's nothing like that.
We're just, uh,

543
00:41:52,893 --> 00:41:54,690
we're just friends.

544
00:42:43,877 --> 00:42:45,037
Mary.

545
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,485
Hi, Mary. You look great.

546
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,120
Look, this is, uh,
this is Dr. Raymond.

547
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:03,629
He was my psychiatrist
in the institution.

548
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,061
Hello.
Hi.

549
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,968
Well, what do you think?

550
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:10,003
About what?

551
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:12,971
What Norman's doing. Has he
told you his plans for the place?

552
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,507
Some of them.

553
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:17,103
Well, I have to be going
to work.

554
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,042
Can I give you a lift?

555
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:20,978
Go ahead.

556
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,284
See you tonight.

557
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,477
So, what can I do
for you, Doctor?

558
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:54,342
Oh, thank you.

559
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,582
Are you familiar
with the Norman Bates case?

560
00:43:58,652 --> 00:44:00,244
Very. I was deputy here

561
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:03,415
when Sheriff Chambers
arrested him years ago.

562
00:44:03,757 --> 00:44:06,385
I re-read the file when I
found out he'd been released.

563
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,722
So, what's the trouble?

564
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:09,422
Bates dressing up
as his mother again?

565
00:44:09,496 --> 00:44:11,964
No, nothing like that.

566
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:15,132
Although, Norman says that
somebody has been leaving notes

567
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:17,864
and making phone calls
claiming to be his mother.

568
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:20,668
Well, people. So, what do
you want me to do about it?

569
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,038
Put a tap on his phone.

570
00:44:22,109 --> 00:44:23,974
Sorry, Doc,
I can't do that.

571
00:44:24,044 --> 00:44:26,604
This is Fairvale, California,
not Washington, DC.

572
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,741
But I can check around and see who might
hate Norman enough to do something like that.

573
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,044
Anything else?

574
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:33,609
You could keep
an eye on Norman.

575
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:35,245
I have been.

576
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,853
All right, Sheriff,
here's my card,

577
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:42,123
in case you should need me.

578
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:43,686
Oh, there is
one other thing.

579
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,561
Why, of course, what?

580
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:47,463
He's got a girl
living with him.

581
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,466
Uh, Mary Samuels.

582
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,799
She works at the diner.

583
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:53,499
Then I'll check on her, too.

584
00:44:53,574 --> 00:44:54,632
Thank you, Sheriff.

585
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,037
Any time.

586
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:53,443
Slut?

587
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:18,161
Are you sure
this is safe?

588
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:20,138
It always has been.

589
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,339
Come on.

590
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:11,421
Oh, I don't need
any more.

591
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:35,972
What's that?

592
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:37,209
What?

593
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:39,582
That sound
in the next room.

594
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:41,917
You're just stoned.

595
00:50:45,892 --> 00:50:47,189
I'm not.

596
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:03,236
Jesus.

597
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:04,870
What is it?

598
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:05,934
Shh.

599
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:14,050
Let's get out of here.

600
00:51:22,696 --> 00:51:23,685
Shh.

601
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:37,470
Come on, hurry!

602
00:51:39,146 --> 00:51:40,135
Come on!

603
00:51:41,148 --> 00:51:43,013
Look out, behind you!

604
00:52:09,943 --> 00:52:11,467
Norman?

605
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:13,976
Norman?

606
00:52:14,414 --> 00:52:15,642
Norman?

607
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,844
Mary, up here.

608
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:24,824
What are you doing
up here?

609
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,087
L... I was locked in.

610
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:31,627
You couldn't have been.
There's no key in the lock.

611
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,928
Someone unlocked it
while I was asleep.

612
00:52:35,936 --> 00:52:37,062
Who?

613
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:39,772
Whoever's been pretending
to be my mother.

614
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,774
Norman, what are you
talking about?

615
00:52:41,842 --> 00:52:43,207
I saw her in the window.

616
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:44,334
And just look
in the room.

617
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,436
It's all been fixed up
and her stuff's inside.

618
00:52:46,513 --> 00:52:48,242
There's another note, too.

619
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:49,881
I'm going to check
the back stairs,

620
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:51,713
maybe they went down
that way.

621
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,846
Norman?

622
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:56,053
What?

623
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,288
There's no note in there.

624
00:52:59,826 --> 00:53:02,124
What do you mean
it's not there?

625
00:53:05,565 --> 00:53:08,500
No, th-this isn't
how it was.

626
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:11,529
It was all fixed up.

627
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:14,002
It wasn't like this.

628
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,109
The... The note.

629
00:53:21,815 --> 00:53:24,010
This...
The dresses are...

630
00:53:25,085 --> 00:53:26,450
Who's that?

631
00:53:29,155 --> 00:53:31,680
Norman, you better
answer the door.

632
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:33,815
Yeah.

633
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,359
Norman,

634
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:48,074
whatever you do, don't
tell them about the bedroom.

635
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:51,937
Hello, Norman,
Well?

636
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,378
I'm Sheriff Hunt.
How are you?

637
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:55,971
This is Deputy Pool.

638
00:53:56,716 --> 00:53:58,013
Can we come in?

639
00:53:58,084 --> 00:53:59,517
Sure, yes. Yes.

640
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,309
Uh, this is...

641
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:03,083
I know. Mary Samuels.

642
00:54:05,892 --> 00:54:07,587
What can we do for you?

643
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,891
There hasn't been
any trouble, has there?

644
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:11,487
Yes, there has.

645
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,065
What sort?

646
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,801
The old sort.

647
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:18,902
There's a girl sitting down
in my squad car below.

648
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:20,439
Too scared to come
into this house.

649
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,439
Why?

650
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,305
She claims that
she saw her boyfriend

651
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:25,105
murdered in your
fruit cellar today

652
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,669
by a large woman
dressed in black.

653
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:30,512
That's just how
your mother used to look,

654
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:32,244
isn't it, Norman?

655
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,344
Well, what...
what were they doing

656
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:35,752
in the cellar, anyway?

657
00:54:35,822 --> 00:54:37,653
Oh, what kids do today,
I guess.

658
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:39,919
Smoking dope,
messin' around.

659
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,260
Do you know anything
about that, Norman?

660
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,356
No.

661
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:49,695
Do you mind if we look
in the fruit cellar?

662
00:54:51,104 --> 00:54:52,036
No.

663
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:05,813
Looks clean to me.

664
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:07,579
Yeah, doesn't it?

665
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,955
You've been straightening up
down here?

666
00:55:19,032 --> 00:55:20,260
No, sir.

667
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,358
This is the first time
I've been inside this room

668
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:24,164
s-s-since I came home.

669
00:55:27,674 --> 00:55:28,663
Then who did it?

670
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:29,902
I did.

671
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:31,534
Several days ago.

672
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:33,336
Hey, Norman?

673
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,012
I just hate a dirty house,
don't you?

674
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,846
Why is this open?

675
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:44,990
I don't know.

676
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:46,853
You better put a padlock
on it

677
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,917
before someone
robs you blind.

678
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,892
You know why Norman doesn't
come down here, don't you?

679
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,369
No, I don't.

680
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:02,107
He used to keep
his mother's corpse down here.

681
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:04,109
Stole it from the grave.

682
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,269
Talked to himself
in her voice,

683
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:08,814
answering in his own.

684
00:56:09,582 --> 00:56:10,708
What do you think of that?

685
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,046
It's horrible.

686
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:14,115
That's right, it was.

687
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:16,452
Now, let me ask you again.

688
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:19,987
Are you positive
you cleaned up down here?

689
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:22,683
Yes.

690
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:25,993
All right.

691
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,532
Mike?

692
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:29,533
Yeah?

693
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:30,864
Let's go.

694
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:38,200
Are you sure
that neither one of you

695
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:40,940
heard anything this afternoon
between 4:00 and 5:00?

696
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,038
I don't know.
But I was...

697
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:43,480
He was with me
all afternoon.

698
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,575
We were walking
in the fields.

699
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,643
Goodbye.

700
00:56:49,255 --> 00:56:51,416
Nice to see you again,
Norman.

701
00:56:58,631 --> 00:56:59,859
Why did you do that?

702
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:00,957
Do what?

703
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:02,159
Lie to the Sheriff?

704
00:57:02,235 --> 00:57:03,702
You weren't with me
this afternoon.

705
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:04,794
I had to do something.

706
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:06,736
He was going to arrest you.

707
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:10,733
Norman.

708
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,239
It's starting again.

709
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:24,990
Sheriff Hunt?

710
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:25,990
Yes.

711
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:27,651
I-I'm Lila Loomis.

712
00:57:28,094 --> 00:57:29,959
I used to be Lila Crane.

713
00:57:30,763 --> 00:57:33,994
Oh, yes, of course.
What a coincidence.

714
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,396
I was just thinkin'
about you and Sam.

715
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:37,367
How is he?

716
00:57:37,437 --> 00:57:38,995
My husband is dead.

717
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,566
I'm sorry.

718
00:57:41,941 --> 00:57:44,239
Well, what brings you
back to Fairvale

719
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:45,504
after all these years?

720
00:57:45,578 --> 00:57:48,411
Norman Bates.
Where is he?

721
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,113
He's out at his motel,
I suppose.

722
00:57:52,185 --> 00:57:53,777
Why haven't you
arrested him?

723
00:57:53,853 --> 00:57:54,842
What for?

724
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:56,320
For murder.

725
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,983
It's all over town
what he did to that boy.

726
00:57:59,526 --> 00:58:01,858
Mrs. Loomis, I can't arrest
a man without proof.

727
00:58:01,928 --> 00:58:03,862
Especially one
with an alibi.

728
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,295
What alibi?

729
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:08,029
There's a girl staying
out there with him

730
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:09,966
and she says
that he was with her

731
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:11,765
at the time
the murder took place

732
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:13,635
if there was a murder.

733
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:16,766
Oh, well, what do you mean
"if there was a murder"?

734
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,574
Well, what I mean is
that I am not convinced

735
00:58:19,646 --> 00:58:20,943
that anybody was killed.

736
00:58:21,014 --> 00:58:23,482
There's no body.
No corpus delicti.

737
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,542
So let's just wait
and see

738
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:27,552
if the boy
comes home tonight.

739
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,019
Have you dragged
the swamp yet?

740
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,020
What?

741
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,021
The swamp?

742
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,217
That's where he dumped
his victims the last time.

743
00:58:33,293 --> 00:58:34,783
Have you dragged it yet?

744
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:35,919
No, ma'am.

745
00:58:36,362 --> 00:58:38,296
Well, then I suggest
you start,

746
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:39,991
before there
are more murders.

747
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:41,090
Unless, of course,

748
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:43,294
you want it
on your conscience.

749
00:58:48,308 --> 00:58:49,775
What's her problem?

750
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,641
I don't know.

751
00:58:52,712 --> 00:58:54,577
But if Norman Bates
is crazy,

752
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:56,512
there are a whole lot
of people around here

753
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:57,845
runnin' him
a close second.

754
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:03,479
Are you sure
you're all right?

755
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:04,853
Yeah. I'm fine.

756
00:59:05,325 --> 00:59:07,486
What you need is one of
my special Irish coffees.

757
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,653
Is there any brandy
in the house?

758
00:59:10,063 --> 00:59:11,291
I don't know.

759
00:59:11,731 --> 00:59:13,722
My mother
doesn't allow liquor.

760
00:59:14,934 --> 00:59:16,458
Mr. Toomey was a drinker,
wasn't he?

761
00:59:16,536 --> 00:59:18,936
Did he leave a bottle
in the office?

762
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:21,836
I don't know.
I didn't look.

763
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:24,172
I'll be right back.
You rest here.

764
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:50,664
Hello?

765
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:05,949
Why did you lie
to the Sheriff

766
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,919
and say Bates was with you
this afternoon?

767
01:00:07,987 --> 01:00:10,455
Mother. What are you
doing here?

768
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,548
Go back to the hotel
before you ruin everything.

769
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,059
Answer my question?
Why did you alibi Bates?

770
01:00:15,128 --> 01:00:16,390
I didn't alibi him.

771
01:00:16,462 --> 01:00:18,930
Don't lie to me.
I talked to the Sheriff.

772
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,035
Why did you do it?

773
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,932
Because Norman couldn't have
murdered that boy.

774
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:30,202
Why not?

775
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,072
He saw me in the window
like we planned,

776
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,948
then he went in to the room
and saw the stuff.

777
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:42,177
Then when he went
looking for her,

778
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:44,120
I locked the attic door
behind him.

779
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:45,748
He was trapped in there
for hours

780
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:48,623
while I took everything
down the back stairs.

781
01:00:49,495 --> 01:00:52,020
So, you see,
he couldn't have done it.

782
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,859
What difference
does it make?

783
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:58,027
We want him re-committed.
This would have done it.

784
01:00:58,104 --> 01:00:59,969
Mother, he's innocent.

785
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,534
Innocent? He killed
your aunt, didn't he?

786
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:05,873
Not to mention
the six other people.

787
01:01:05,945 --> 01:01:08,778
Mother, that was 22 years ago.

788
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:12,409
Mary, people don't change.

789
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,720
He must have
gotten out somehow.

790
01:01:14,787 --> 01:01:16,414
Mother, I was wrong.

791
01:01:17,123 --> 01:01:18,715
I don't think
he drilled that hole

792
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:19,780
in the bathroom wall.

793
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:21,156
Of course he did.

794
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,784
Mother, listen to me.

795
01:01:23,129 --> 01:01:25,529
I think there's someone else
in the house.

796
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:26,758
Don't be stupid.

797
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,131
It's just Bates
up to his old tricks again.

798
01:01:29,202 --> 01:01:31,864
It can't be Norman.
He isn't like that anymore.

799
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:35,068
Maybe if you knew him now.

800
01:01:35,842 --> 01:01:38,037
It's just that
he's trying so very hard

801
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,409
to do what's right
to keep his sanity.

802
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,970
And that hardly
seems fair for us

803
01:01:42,048 --> 01:01:43,948
to be doing
what we're doing to him.

804
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,141
You're as crazy as he is.

805
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,880
We'll talk later.
Norman needs me.

806
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,881
Norman needs you?

807
01:01:52,091 --> 01:01:54,286
A psychopath needs you?

808
01:01:54,894 --> 01:01:57,590
Look, go back to your hotel.
We'll talk later.

809
01:01:57,997 --> 01:02:00,056
He'll kill you.
You know that, don't you?

810
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,000
He'll murder you just like
he did all the others.

811
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:48,972
Mary!

812
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:54,080
My God, what happened?

813
01:02:54,153 --> 01:02:55,620
I don't know.

814
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:05,363
Jesus. How did that
get in there?

815
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:09,032
After I killed that kid
in the cellar,

816
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,594
I used it
to clean up the mess

817
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:14,129
and then, then I flushed it
down there.

818
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,732
You didn't kill anybody.
You were locked in the attic.

819
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:19,710
It wasn't locked.
You said so yourself.

820
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:21,246
Norman,
stop talking nonsense.

821
01:03:21,314 --> 01:03:23,009
I told you,
you didn't kill anybody.

822
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:25,107
Then how do you
explain this?

823
01:03:25,818 --> 01:03:26,807
Well?

824
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,546
I can't.

825
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,886
Did you clean up the cellar
the way you told the Sheriff?

826
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,127
No.

827
01:03:35,194 --> 01:03:36,354
Somebody did.

828
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:40,296
And with that towel,
after they killed that kid.

829
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:43,135
Norman,
it couldn't have been you.

830
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,000
How can you be so sure?
Even I don't know.

831
01:03:46,172 --> 01:03:47,605
I always used black out
when l...

832
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:48,901
Because you couldn't.

833
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:52,770
You don't have it in you,
not anymore.

834
01:03:56,616 --> 01:03:58,413
Norman, look,
why don't you go downstairs

835
01:03:58,484 --> 01:04:01,544
and make us a drink, okay?
And I'll clean this up.

836
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:41,619
Norman.

837
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:45,786
Yes.

838
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,627
Uh, the tea kettle's boiling.

839
01:04:52,705 --> 01:04:53,694
Oh.

840
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,029
Okay.

841
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:29,958
What happened?

842
01:07:30,029 --> 01:07:32,657
Up there.
I saw someone staring at me.

843
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:35,758
There's no one there now.

844
01:07:35,835 --> 01:07:37,666
Someone was watching me
through that hole.

845
01:07:37,737 --> 01:07:38,999
They're in the house
right now.

846
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:40,231
Where'd you get
that thing?

847
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,432
L... I had it
in my purse.

848
01:07:41,507 --> 01:07:42,906
My mother gave it me
when I was...

849
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,964
Oh.

850
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:46,670
Come on.

851
01:07:46,912 --> 01:07:47,901
Uh...

852
01:07:48,047 --> 01:07:50,675
You take the downstairs,
I'll check up here.

853
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:52,440
Well, shouldn't we
stick together?

854
01:07:52,518 --> 01:07:54,452
Don't worry,
I've got this.

855
01:07:57,423 --> 01:08:00,392
It's because of me, isn't it?
That's why you have it.

856
01:08:00,893 --> 01:08:02,190
Of course not.

857
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,794
Hurry up,
they'll get away.

858
01:08:25,317 --> 01:08:27,547
Mrs. Lila Loomis,
Room 15, please.

859
01:08:30,823 --> 01:08:32,916
You're sure
she hasn't come back?

860
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,419
There'll be no message,
thank you.

861
01:08:37,296 --> 01:08:39,389
Okay, Mother,
where are you?

862
01:09:09,695 --> 01:09:10,923
Norman.

863
01:09:29,982 --> 01:09:31,210
What is it?

864
01:09:35,487 --> 01:09:37,011
It's my mother.

865
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,417
She's downstairs.

866
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:41,991
Did you see her?

867
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:46,860
You're sure you heard her?

868
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:48,690
Come on.

869
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:50,059
No.

870
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:52,560
She'll kill you.

871
01:09:53,138 --> 01:09:54,503
I know she will.

872
01:09:54,974 --> 01:09:56,999
Norman, your mother's dead.

873
01:09:57,343 --> 01:09:59,743
You killed her.
You told me so yourself.

874
01:10:00,012 --> 01:10:01,172
I was wrong.

875
01:10:02,147 --> 01:10:03,375
She survived.

876
01:10:04,183 --> 01:10:05,275
And now,

877
01:10:06,018 --> 01:10:07,576
she's downstairs,

878
01:10:08,387 --> 01:10:09,945
waiting for you.

879
01:10:10,022 --> 01:10:11,785
Norman, it couldn't
be your mother.

880
01:10:11,857 --> 01:10:12,881
No.

881
01:10:13,325 --> 01:10:15,555
No, it... it had to be
someone else.

882
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,597
Whoever it is that's trying
to drive you crazy again.

883
01:10:18,664 --> 01:10:19,653
Yeah?

884
01:10:20,065 --> 01:10:21,054
Yes.

885
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:22,834
So, let's go downstairs
and find...

886
01:10:22,902 --> 01:10:23,926
No!

887
01:10:26,171 --> 01:10:27,832
It's too dangerous.

888
01:10:28,941 --> 01:10:30,636
Let's wait till morning.

889
01:10:31,043 --> 01:10:32,840
What are we gonna do
until then?

890
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:34,470
I'll protect you.

891
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:36,814
You'll be okay.

892
01:10:37,616 --> 01:10:40,107
I'll... I'll be fine right here.

893
01:10:43,956 --> 01:10:45,787
It was always safe here

894
01:10:46,525 --> 01:10:47,753
at night.

895
01:10:50,896 --> 01:10:51,885
Norman, listen...

896
01:10:51,964 --> 01:10:52,988
No!

897
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:55,524
Okay.

898
01:10:56,936 --> 01:10:58,995
We'll spend the night
in here.

899
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,473
You can
use the sleeping bag.

900
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,825
What are you doing, Norman?

901
01:11:56,462 --> 01:11:57,656
Norman, put the knife down.

902
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,493
Nobody's gonna come
in the door.

903
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,497
They're not?

904
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:01,624
No.

905
01:12:03,936 --> 01:12:05,062
Okay.

906
01:12:09,141 --> 01:12:10,130
Mary.

907
01:12:11,176 --> 01:12:12,165
Yes.

908
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:13,609
I'm becoming

909
01:12:14,146 --> 01:12:16,478
confused again, aren't I?

910
01:12:16,982 --> 01:12:18,449
Of course not.

911
01:12:19,018 --> 01:12:21,578
Don't lie to me. Not you.

912
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:33,423
Yes, Norman, you are
becoming confused again.

913
01:12:44,576 --> 01:12:45,565
Just

914
01:12:47,046 --> 01:12:50,675
don't let them take me back
to the institution, all right?

915
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:06,288
Don't worry, Norman.
I won't.

916
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:10,791
You smell good.

917
01:13:11,036 --> 01:13:12,025
I do?

918
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:13,036
Yeah.

919
01:13:13,705 --> 01:13:15,400
What do I smell like?

920
01:13:16,842 --> 01:13:20,278
You smell like, like the
toasted cheese sandwiches...

921
01:13:20,345 --> 01:13:21,369
What?

922
01:13:21,847 --> 01:13:23,280
...that my mother
used to bring me

923
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:25,509
when I was in bed
with a temperature.

924
01:13:26,552 --> 01:13:28,315
She used to do lots
of nice things for me

925
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:29,649
before she went...

926
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:30,813
Before she became...

927
01:13:30,889 --> 01:13:31,878
Shh.

928
01:13:32,558 --> 01:13:34,753
Just remember the good things
she did for you.

929
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,385
Only the good things.

930
01:13:37,429 --> 01:13:39,488
I can't.
They're not there anymore.

931
01:13:39,565 --> 01:13:41,362
Of course they're there.

932
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:44,328
No, the doctors
took them all away.

933
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:47,095
Along with everything else.

934
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,229
Except,

935
01:13:50,876 --> 01:13:52,468
except those sandwiches.

936
01:13:52,544 --> 01:13:53,977
Shh.

937
01:13:57,416 --> 01:13:58,747
Just sleep.

938
01:14:19,771 --> 01:14:20,863
Oh, good morning, Doctor.

939
01:14:20,939 --> 01:14:22,497
Good morning, Norman.

940
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:23,598
I called your office.

941
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:25,472
They said you were on your way
over here.

942
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,772
Where's Mary?

943
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,271
She's gone in to town.

944
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,610
Oh. What for?

945
01:14:31,683 --> 01:14:32,980
I don't know.

946
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,575
She didn't tell me.

947
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,519
Some tea?

948
01:14:36,655 --> 01:14:38,486
Coffee, if you have it.
Thank you.

949
01:14:39,525 --> 01:14:40,514
Sure.

950
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:53,229
Norman.

951
01:14:54,673 --> 01:14:56,698
Do you remember
Lila Loomis?

952
01:14:58,644 --> 01:14:59,633
Yes.

953
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,670
She's staying in town.

954
01:15:02,681 --> 01:15:03,670
She is?

955
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,479
She's Mary's mother.

956
01:15:11,623 --> 01:15:14,524
That's why Mary went in
to town. To see her.

957
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,923
Do you realize
what this means, Norman?

958
01:15:23,402 --> 01:15:24,391
What?

959
01:15:24,803 --> 01:15:27,203
They're the ones
who've been leaving the notes

960
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:29,172
and making
the phone calls.

961
01:15:30,509 --> 01:15:31,567
Why would they do that?

962
01:15:31,643 --> 01:15:33,235
Because they hate you.

963
01:15:34,646 --> 01:15:36,614
Mary, Mary doesn't hate me.

964
01:15:36,682 --> 01:15:38,274
Come on, Norman.

965
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,578
Like mother
like daughter.

966
01:15:39,651 --> 01:15:41,881
You know how Lila Loomis
feels about you.

967
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:44,787
She can't wait see you
re-institutionalized.

968
01:15:45,057 --> 01:15:47,457
That's why all this
is happening to you.

969
01:15:48,026 --> 01:15:49,459
They want to destabilize you,

970
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:51,723
undermine your sense
of reality.

971
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,432
They can't do that.

972
01:15:54,499 --> 01:15:56,831
Good. Glad to hear you
say that.

973
01:15:57,536 --> 01:15:58,525
But...

974
01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:01,735
It isn't them, anyway.

975
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,798
It isn't?
Who is it?

976
01:16:08,247 --> 01:16:09,646
It's my mother.

977
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,713
She's not dead.

978
01:16:17,956 --> 01:16:19,617
How do you know that?

979
01:16:21,693 --> 01:16:23,718
I've seen her,
up in the window.

980
01:16:24,062 --> 01:16:25,586
You saw her, too.

981
01:16:26,798 --> 01:16:28,425
That was Mary Loomis

982
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,958
or Lila Loomis dressed up
to look like your mother.

983
01:16:32,437 --> 01:16:34,462
What about the phone calls?

984
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,197
Mary Loomis again.

985
01:16:37,476 --> 01:16:40,036
But she's been with me
when the phone rang.

986
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,408
Then it was her mother.

987
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:56,125
My mother spoke to me.
Downstairs.

988
01:17:00,932 --> 01:17:02,092
Norman.

989
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,537
Do you remember now our
discussions about your mother?

990
01:17:08,607 --> 01:17:12,099
Once you accepted the fact
that you murdered her,

991
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:14,737
her memory would have
no hold over you.

992
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:24,955
Room 15, please.

993
01:17:26,692 --> 01:17:28,956
I want you
to stop calling Norman.

994
01:17:29,027 --> 01:17:30,119
What are you
doing here?

995
01:17:30,195 --> 01:17:32,254
You heard me.
Stop calling Norman.

996
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:33,389
I haven't called him.

997
01:17:33,465 --> 01:17:35,433
Don't lie to me.
You called him this morning.

998
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,025
For God's sake,
keep your voice down.

999
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,338
All right,
so what if I did call him?

1000
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,373
He's slipping
into insanity again,

1001
01:17:46,445 --> 01:17:48,037
I can hear it in his voice.

1002
01:17:48,113 --> 01:17:50,013
There's nothing anyone
can do about it,

1003
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,106
not even you.

1004
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:53,208
You could stop stuffing
bloody towels down toilets

1005
01:17:53,285 --> 01:17:54,980
and peering through
peepholes in walls.

1006
01:17:55,053 --> 01:17:56,111
That would be a help.
What?

1007
01:17:56,188 --> 01:17:57,416
What are you talking about?

1008
01:17:57,489 --> 01:17:58,979
About what you're doing
to Norman.

1009
01:17:59,057 --> 01:18:00,581
You were in that house
last night.

1010
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:01,648
I was not.

1011
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,718
I came right back here
after I saw you.

1012
01:18:03,795 --> 01:18:04,887
Don't lie to me.

1013
01:18:04,963 --> 01:18:06,157
I'm not lying.

1014
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:07,926
Why weren't you
in your room last night

1015
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:08,988
when I called?

1016
01:18:09,067 --> 01:18:11,331
What, did you have me paged?
I was probably down here.

1017
01:18:11,403 --> 01:18:13,871
Mother, stop lying to me,
please.

1018
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,100
What happened in that house
last night?

1019
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:17,698
Goodbye, Mother.

1020
01:18:20,178 --> 01:18:22,112
He's about to go
over the edge, isn't he?

1021
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:23,579
Listen. Now listen.

1022
01:18:23,648 --> 01:18:25,275
Just dress up
in his mother's clothes

1023
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:27,318
one more time.
That's all it's going to take.

1024
01:18:27,386 --> 01:18:28,853
I'll have the police
and the doctor

1025
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:29,944
before you are in danger.

1026
01:18:30,021 --> 01:18:31,955
Then they'll have to act
on our petition.

1027
01:18:32,023 --> 01:18:33,991
Mother, I signed
all your petitions.

1028
01:18:34,059 --> 01:18:35,583
I've been to
all your meetings,

1029
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,355
done everything
you've asked for years.

1030
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:39,454
But I am not going to
hurt Norman anymore.

1031
01:18:39,531 --> 01:18:40,896
Well, if you won't do it
for me,

1032
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,263
at least do it
for your father.

1033
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:44,529
I'm not living for dead people
anymore, Mother.

1034
01:18:44,603 --> 01:18:46,537
Not for your sister,
or my father,

1035
01:18:46,605 --> 01:18:48,334
not even for you.
I'm going.

1036
01:18:48,407 --> 01:18:50,307
Now, wait a minute.

1037
01:18:50,675 --> 01:18:52,905
Mother, let go,
you're hurting me.

1038
01:18:56,081 --> 01:18:57,105
Mom, don't.

1039
01:18:57,182 --> 01:18:58,206
No.

1040
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,548
Listen to me! If you go near that
house, you're going to be sorry.

1041
01:19:08,026 --> 01:19:09,050
Yeah.

1042
01:19:09,127 --> 01:19:10,924
I don't see
what all the rush is for.

1043
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:12,054
The Sheriff's concerned.

1044
01:19:12,130 --> 01:19:14,598
And he thought we might
bend the rules.

1045
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:15,924
I don't like it.

1046
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:18,834
You're supposed to have
an order from the coroner.

1047
01:19:33,652 --> 01:19:35,517
Now do you believe me?

1048
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,447
Yes. She's dead.

1049
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:43,594
Then she's not coming back
to life again, is she?

1050
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:46,592
Back to life?

1051
01:19:49,868 --> 01:19:50,857
No.

1052
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:56,037
Shall we go?

1053
01:20:14,326 --> 01:20:15,418
Mary.

1054
01:20:15,494 --> 01:20:17,018
Back here.

1055
01:20:24,603 --> 01:20:26,161
I was just about
to have some lunch.

1056
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,227
You want some?

1057
01:20:27,305 --> 01:20:28,294
No.

1058
01:20:29,174 --> 01:20:30,664
Where have you been?

1059
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,676
At the cemetery.

1060
01:20:33,278 --> 01:20:36,008
Dr. Raymond had them open up
my mother's coffin.

1061
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:37,070
Oh.

1062
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:38,571
Yes.

1063
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:40,440
That proves that
she's not the one

1064
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:42,384
who's been
torturing me.

1065
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:45,217
Not unless
she's a ghost.

1066
01:20:45,957 --> 01:20:46,946
No.

1067
01:20:47,893 --> 01:20:49,190
No. He says,

1068
01:20:49,694 --> 01:20:51,787
he says it's you
and your mother.

1069
01:20:52,631 --> 01:20:54,792
He says your last name
is Loomis.

1070
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,867
Is that true, Mary?

1071
01:21:02,674 --> 01:21:04,471
I wonder
who that could be.

1072
01:21:05,176 --> 01:21:06,609
I don't know.

1073
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:09,241
Don't you?

1074
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,645
Hello, Mrs. Loomis?
How are you this...

1075
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:26,025
I'm... I'm sorry, Mother.

1076
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:29,223
I didn't mean to insult you.

1077
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:32,970
Norman, stop it.
This is not your mother.

1078
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:36,907
Hello. Hello, Lila?
Lila, are you there?

1079
01:21:38,777 --> 01:21:40,574
There's no one on the line.

1080
01:21:41,613 --> 01:21:43,410
Hello?

1081
01:21:44,749 --> 01:21:47,445
Yes, Mother, I'm sorry
we were interrupted.

1082
01:21:48,787 --> 01:21:50,379
Norman, there's no one there.

1083
01:21:50,455 --> 01:21:51,683
Yes, Mother.

1084
01:21:59,631 --> 01:22:00,791
Yes, Mother.

1085
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:03,625
<i>Hello?</i>

1086
01:22:03,702 --> 01:22:06,136
Hello, Norman?
This is your mother.

1087
01:22:06,271 --> 01:22:07,363
<i>It doesn't sound like her.</i>

1088
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:09,498
It is, Norman,
and I want you to hang up.

1089
01:22:09,574 --> 01:22:11,769
Do you understand? Hang up.

1090
01:22:14,145 --> 01:22:15,305
All right.

1091
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,341
Do it, Norman, now.

1092
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:19,982
<i>Hang up.</i>

1093
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:39,960
I was so worried.

1094
01:22:41,306 --> 01:22:42,432
About what?

1095
01:22:42,674 --> 01:22:44,938
Well, that all the things
that have been happening to me

1096
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:46,602
were because of you
and your mother.

1097
01:22:46,678 --> 01:22:49,078
When Dr. Raymond showed me
Mrs. Bates' corpse,

1098
01:22:49,147 --> 01:22:51,342
I knew she was dead for sure.

1099
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,544
But now,

1100
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:56,249
now I know it's somebody
completely different.

1101
01:22:56,321 --> 01:22:57,549
Who is it?

1102
01:22:59,257 --> 01:23:00,519
My real mother.

1103
01:23:02,027 --> 01:23:04,188
Who is your real mother,
Norman?

1104
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:07,759
I don't know.

1105
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:09,291
She won't tell me.

1106
01:23:09,367 --> 01:23:10,459
Your mother is dead.

1107
01:23:10,535 --> 01:23:11,900
Mrs. Bates
was your real mother

1108
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:13,369
and she's dead.

1109
01:23:14,272 --> 01:23:16,433
Then who was that
on the phone?

1110
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:19,672
My mother.

1111
01:23:21,813 --> 01:23:24,338
Dr. Raymond was right
about both of us.

1112
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:28,051
Lila and I were trying
to drive you crazy again.

1113
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,586
But then I stopped,
only she won't,

1114
01:23:31,656 --> 01:23:33,851
and she's the one
who's calling.

1115
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:44,492
Well, why did you stop?

1116
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:46,002
It wasn't fair for us
to be doing

1117
01:23:46,071 --> 01:23:48,062
what we were doing to you.

1118
01:23:48,139 --> 01:23:49,834
Is that the only reason?

1119
01:23:50,308 --> 01:23:51,741
What do you mean?

1120
01:23:52,043 --> 01:23:53,567
You know what I mean.

1121
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:13,619
Ma'am?

1122
01:24:14,232 --> 01:24:15,221
Norman?

1123
01:24:15,767 --> 01:24:18,600
The Sheriff would like
to see you out at the swamp.

1124
01:24:41,726 --> 01:24:42,658
Hey, Sam.

1125
01:24:42,727 --> 01:24:43,989
Yeah?

1126
01:24:44,629 --> 01:24:45,994
Scotch it is.

1127
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:48,421
There you go.

1128
01:25:30,108 --> 01:25:32,099
All right.
Spread that line away.

1129
01:25:32,177 --> 01:25:35,305
We're gonna send the divers
down here in a minute.

1130
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:44,946
Hello, Norman.

1131
01:25:45,023 --> 01:25:46,115
Hi, Sheriff.

1132
01:25:46,191 --> 01:25:48,318
What is... What is
going on here?

1133
01:25:48,426 --> 01:25:50,155
Have you
seen this before?

1134
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,556
No. Did you... Did you find it
in the swamp?

1135
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,619
Yes.

1136
01:25:54,699 --> 01:25:56,792
How about any of this stuff?

1137
01:25:58,636 --> 01:26:00,160
This is Mr. Toomey's.

1138
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:01,296
Who?

1139
01:26:02,006 --> 01:26:04,941
Norman's motel manager,
before he fired him, that is.

1140
01:26:05,009 --> 01:26:06,704
Have you seen him since?

1141
01:26:07,045 --> 01:26:09,240
No, I told him
to get packing and he left.

1142
01:26:09,314 --> 01:26:10,906
That's all I know.

1143
01:26:10,982 --> 01:26:11,971
You sure?

1144
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:13,508
Y-Yeah.

1145
01:26:15,019 --> 01:26:17,715
Well, that's about it then.
You can leave.

1146
01:26:19,858 --> 01:26:21,450
Just you, Norman,
not the young lady.

1147
01:26:21,526 --> 01:26:23,050
Okay. But shouldn't I wait?

1148
01:26:23,127 --> 01:26:24,253
Don't worry.

1149
01:26:24,329 --> 01:26:26,490
I'll have her
along presently.

1150
01:26:26,831 --> 01:26:28,822
Oh, forget the marker.
Get on in there.

1151
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:31,232
Sheriff, I've been
wanting talk to you.

1152
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:33,194
Yeah.

1153
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:34,795
Someone has been
phoning Norman

1154
01:26:34,873 --> 01:26:36,306
claiming to be his mother.

1155
01:26:36,374 --> 01:26:39,138
And not the dead Mrs. Bates,
his real mother.

1156
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:40,199
So?

1157
01:26:41,512 --> 01:26:42,604
So I've been wondering

1158
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,080
if it's possible
that he was adopted?

1159
01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:47,907
Not that I've ever heard of,

1160
01:26:47,986 --> 01:26:51,046
and I've lived my entire life
here, Miss Loomis.

1161
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:54,852
How did you find out
who I was?

1162
01:26:54,926 --> 01:26:57,861
We're a tad slow
around here, young lady,

1163
01:26:57,929 --> 01:26:59,362
but not incompetent.

1164
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:00,454
Now,

1165
01:27:00,865 --> 01:27:02,696
I've got a question for you.

1166
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:05,597
Either you or your mother
know anything about this?

1167
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:06,659
No.

1168
01:27:07,205 --> 01:27:09,298
I don't see any point in
either of you stayin' around

1169
01:27:09,374 --> 01:27:11,035
Fairvale any longer, do you?

1170
01:27:11,109 --> 01:27:13,077
Have we broken some law?

1171
01:27:16,547 --> 01:27:18,344
None that are on the books,

1172
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:20,941
but a whole hell
of a lot of them that aren't.

1173
01:27:21,019 --> 01:27:23,886
Like all the ones having to do
with right or wrong.

1174
01:27:24,188 --> 01:27:25,815
I'd say you and your mother
just about

1175
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:28,051
broken every one of those,
wouldn't you?

1176
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,421
I didn't mean to.

1177
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:31,724
Well, that's what
Norman said 20 years ago.

1178
01:27:31,796 --> 01:27:33,320
Only he was crazy.

1179
01:27:33,398 --> 01:27:35,298
Now, what's your excuse?

1180
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:38,825
I guess I don't have one.

1181
01:27:39,203 --> 01:27:41,763
Well, I'll just say goodbye
to you now then.

1182
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,464
I expect it to be
for the last time.

1183
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:44,701
Sheriff.

1184
01:27:44,776 --> 01:27:46,801
I said goodbye,
Miss Loomis.

1185
01:27:46,878 --> 01:27:49,642
Sheriff, there's a car
down here.

1186
01:27:49,714 --> 01:27:50,840
Anybody in it?

1187
01:27:50,915 --> 01:27:52,473
I can't tell.
It's stuck in the mud.

1188
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:55,917
Well, get a winch line down
to it and get it out of there.

1189
01:27:56,154 --> 01:27:58,247
All right,
we found a car.

1190
01:31:08,946 --> 01:31:09,935
Doctor?

1191
01:31:11,082 --> 01:31:13,016
What are you doing here?

1192
01:31:15,419 --> 01:31:19,082
I followed Lila Loomis
from her hotel to your house.

1193
01:31:20,091 --> 01:31:21,558
She came down here.

1194
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:23,149
Oh.

1195
01:31:25,096 --> 01:31:26,563
Where is she?

1196
01:31:27,298 --> 01:31:28,731
I don't know.

1197
01:31:30,801 --> 01:31:32,393
But she was here.

1198
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:37,465
It proves she was the one

1199
01:31:37,542 --> 01:31:39,840
that was dressing up
as your mother.

1200
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,037
How?

1201
01:31:43,047 --> 01:31:44,844
If she wasn't
gonna do it again,

1202
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,941
why would she sneak
into your house?

1203
01:31:47,018 --> 01:31:49,009
But she wasn't the woman
I saw in the window.

1204
01:31:49,086 --> 01:31:50,246
She wasn't?

1205
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:51,388
No.

1206
01:31:51,455 --> 01:31:52,683
Then who was?

1207
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:54,724
That was my mother.

1208
01:31:54,792 --> 01:31:57,158
Norman, your mother's dead.

1209
01:31:58,563 --> 01:32:00,531
Remember the open coffin?

1210
01:32:00,965 --> 01:32:03,229
Mrs. Bates only
took care of me.

1211
01:32:03,301 --> 01:32:06,828
My real mother is somebody
completely different.

1212
01:32:08,973 --> 01:32:10,497
How do you
know this, Norman?

1213
01:32:10,575 --> 01:32:12,702
She told me on the phone.

1214
01:32:15,213 --> 01:32:16,703
Norman, I've already
proved to you

1215
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,476
that Mary and Lila Loomis
were the ones

1216
01:32:18,549 --> 01:32:19,982
who were calling you.

1217
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:21,814
Would you accept the fact

1218
01:32:21,886 --> 01:32:24,855
that you have no other mother
than Mrs. Bates?

1219
01:32:27,225 --> 01:32:28,385
Of course.

1220
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,125
Then that's what I'll do.

1221
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,261
It would be a great load
off my mind.

1222
01:32:42,573 --> 01:32:44,438
Okay, everybody stand back.

1223
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:47,241
That's it.

1224
01:32:48,713 --> 01:32:50,078
Keep it comin'.

1225
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:53,943
Looks like Toomey's car,
doesn't it?

1226
01:32:54,018 --> 01:32:55,918
That's it, a little more.

1227
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:58,387
We'll check inside
before we open the trunk.

1228
01:32:58,456 --> 01:32:59,514
All right.

1229
01:32:59,924 --> 01:33:01,448
That's it.

1230
01:33:01,726 --> 01:33:02,886
Do you recognize it?

1231
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,484
Okay, hold it right there.

1232
01:33:04,562 --> 01:33:05,790
Well?

1233
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:11,062
Sheriff, it's empty.

1234
01:33:12,803 --> 01:33:15,363
Don't you have
some place else to go?

1235
01:33:17,908 --> 01:33:19,603
Open the trunk.

1236
01:33:21,445 --> 01:33:22,844
Watch out,
Mike.

1237
01:33:24,148 --> 01:33:25,479
Oh, Jesus.

1238
01:33:37,595 --> 01:33:39,825
Norman. Norman!

1239
01:33:39,897 --> 01:33:40,795
What is it?

1240
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,127
They found a car
in the swamp.

1241
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:43,723
Who? I don't know who it is.

1242
01:33:43,801 --> 01:33:46,235
They just found a car.
Isn't that enough? For what?

1243
01:33:46,304 --> 01:33:48,238
For them to arrest you!
I'll get your jacket!

1244
01:33:48,306 --> 01:33:49,773
Come on.
We're getting out of here.

1245
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:50,772
How?

1246
01:33:51,842 --> 01:33:54,504
I don't know. We'll hitch
a ride until we get a car.

1247
01:33:54,578 --> 01:33:55,977
Where would we go?

1248
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,275
Somewhere,
anywhere, Norman.

1249
01:33:57,348 --> 01:33:58,781
Please hurry.

1250
01:33:59,016 --> 01:34:00,540
They'd catch us.

1251
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:03,387
You're right.

1252
01:34:03,454 --> 01:34:05,285
So what's the point
of going?

1253
01:34:05,656 --> 01:34:07,521
Because it's my fault.

1254
01:34:08,826 --> 01:34:10,487
If my mother and I
had left you alone,

1255
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:12,119
you would've been fine.

1256
01:34:12,196 --> 01:34:13,254
Nobody'd be dead,

1257
01:34:13,331 --> 01:34:14,889
and I'd just be
a dumb psych student

1258
01:34:14,965 --> 01:34:16,899
with nothing on mind
but having a good time.

1259
01:34:16,967 --> 01:34:18,332
It's not your fault.

1260
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:20,131
Then whose fault is it?

1261
01:34:20,204 --> 01:34:21,136
My mother's.

1262
01:34:21,205 --> 01:34:23,070
She's the one
who's been doing the killing

1263
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:25,335
to protect me.
She told me so herself.

1264
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:26,706
Oh, Norman.

1265
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,637
You're mad,
don't you know that?

1266
01:34:29,714 --> 01:34:31,545
You're mad as a hatter.

1267
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,451
Should I answer it?

1268
01:34:35,519 --> 01:34:36,850
Why bother?

1269
01:34:37,188 --> 01:34:39,247
It's only my mother,
poor thing.

1270
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:40,982
She shouldn't be calling.

1271
01:34:41,058 --> 01:34:43,356
She should be sitting back
and gloating.

1272
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,555
I better answer it.

1273
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:55,663
Hello?

1274
01:34:55,906 --> 01:34:57,430
Norman, this is Dr. Raymond.

1275
01:34:57,508 --> 01:35:00,033
I just found Lila Loomis' car
parked down the road.

1276
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:01,908
I'm calling you
from the motel parlor.

1277
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:03,674
The calls that
you've been receiving

1278
01:35:03,748 --> 01:35:05,113
from your fictitious mother

1279
01:35:05,182 --> 01:35:06,479
have been placed
right here.

1280
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:09,018
Lila Loomis has used
this phone to call your house.

1281
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:10,709
Yes.

1282
01:35:12,323 --> 01:35:13,722
L... I understand.

1283
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:15,114
Mother?

1284
01:35:15,426 --> 01:35:17,860
Norman,
this is Dr. Raymond.

1285
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:22,096
I've been waiting
for your call, Mother.

1286
01:35:25,503 --> 01:35:26,663
Hello. Lila?

1287
01:35:27,371 --> 01:35:28,633
<i>Lila...</i>

1288
01:35:31,575 --> 01:35:32,837
She's hung up.

1289
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:43,680
No, Mother.
Mary's still here with me.

1290
01:35:43,754 --> 01:35:45,085
I like her.

1291
01:35:47,491 --> 01:35:48,480
No.

1292
01:35:48,959 --> 01:35:51,484
No, of course not.
Not as much as you.

1293
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,292
No, I...

1294
01:35:57,601 --> 01:35:59,125
I won't do that.

1295
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,396
You can't make me

1296
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,170
kill her.

1297
01:36:08,145 --> 01:36:10,705
Do I have to, Mother?

1298
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:13,710
But why?

1299
01:36:13,784 --> 01:36:15,581
Why do I
have to kill her?

1300
01:36:50,287 --> 01:36:52,448
Oh, no, Mother, please.

1301
01:36:52,523 --> 01:36:54,150
Please don't make me...

1302
01:36:56,527 --> 01:36:57,494
Oh, Mother,

1303
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,722
How can you even think
such a thing?

1304
01:36:59,797 --> 01:37:01,958
I can never do
anything like that.

1305
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,630
I don't think you understand
about Mary, Mother.

1306
01:37:06,604 --> 01:37:08,572
She's really very kind.

1307
01:37:10,107 --> 01:37:11,267
I trust her.

1308
01:37:11,342 --> 01:37:13,037
She would never do anything
to hurt me.

1309
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:15,374
Norman? Norman.

1310
01:37:17,047 --> 01:37:19,709
Do you recognize me?
It's me, your mother.

1311
01:37:20,551 --> 01:37:21,609
Yes, Mother.

1312
01:37:21,685 --> 01:37:23,619
And since I'm standing here
in front of you,

1313
01:37:23,687 --> 01:37:26,349
I can't very well be
on the phone, can I?

1314
01:37:26,824 --> 01:37:29,725
So hang up the phone,
Norman. Hang up.

1315
01:37:31,028 --> 01:37:32,393
Yes, Mother.

1316
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:35,858
Norman, put the phone down
this instant!

1317
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:46,573
Norman, this is your mother.

1318
01:37:47,945 --> 01:37:49,879
Norman, can you hear me?

1319
01:37:52,716 --> 01:37:53,705
Norman.

1320
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:57,982
Norman, are you there?

1321
01:38:04,662 --> 01:38:07,062
Norman, please say something.

1322
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:13,932
Norman.

1323
01:38:17,408 --> 01:38:18,739
Norman.

1324
01:38:18,842 --> 01:38:19,809
Got you!

1325
01:38:19,877 --> 01:38:21,469
Norman!

1326
01:38:40,698 --> 01:38:42,131
Norman, I...

1327
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:45,597
I didn't mean to do it. L... I...

1328
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:48,733
I thought he was you.

1329
01:38:48,973 --> 01:38:50,497
It's all right, Mother.

1330
01:38:50,574 --> 01:38:52,474
Norman, I'm not your mother.

1331
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:54,507
It's all right.

1332
01:38:54,645 --> 01:38:56,806
Norman, I am not your mother.
I am Mary.

1333
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,313
How many times
have you killed?

1334
01:38:58,382 --> 01:38:59,815
How many times
have I told you...

1335
01:38:59,883 --> 01:39:01,578
Norman, look,
I am Mary.

1336
01:39:01,652 --> 01:39:04,143
They're gonna come for you,
Mother, just like they did before.

1337
01:39:04,221 --> 01:39:05,813
Stay away from me.

1338
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:10,927
And I'll cover up for you.

1339
01:39:10,995 --> 01:39:11,984
Now give me the knife.

1340
01:39:12,062 --> 01:39:13,222
Stay away.

1341
01:39:13,664 --> 01:39:16,258
I always have,
because I'm your dutiful son.

1342
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:17,960
Stay away.

1343
01:39:18,035 --> 01:39:19,662
And you're my loving mother.

1344
01:39:19,737 --> 01:39:21,830
So, please give me the knife.

1345
01:39:24,508 --> 01:39:27,807
It's time to go to the fruit
cellar now, Mother.

1346
01:39:27,878 --> 01:39:29,345
Norman, stay away.

1347
01:39:29,413 --> 01:39:32,576
Mother, I don't want to...

1348
01:39:33,951 --> 01:39:35,043
Norman, now, look.

1349
01:39:36,453 --> 01:39:38,080
I don't want
to hurt you, Mother.

1350
01:39:38,155 --> 01:39:39,452
You're coming.

1351
01:39:42,259 --> 01:39:44,625
In there, Mother, hurry.

1352
01:39:44,695 --> 01:39:46,424
Norman, please stop.

1353
01:39:46,497 --> 01:39:48,465
You... You need help.
You're losing blood.

1354
01:40:05,683 --> 01:40:07,014
You did it.

1355
01:40:09,987 --> 01:40:12,888
They're here.
Let me help you.

1356
01:40:12,956 --> 01:40:14,184
You killed them all.

1357
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:15,418
Freeze!

1358
01:40:23,067 --> 01:40:24,295
The County Sheriff
and the DA

1359
01:40:24,368 --> 01:40:25,665
have come down
from Bakersfield

1360
01:40:25,736 --> 01:40:27,294
to confer with Sheriff Hunt.

1361
01:40:27,371 --> 01:40:28,736
Is that loud enough, guys?

1362
01:40:28,806 --> 01:40:31,468
Yeah, that... that's good.
Move over to your left.

1363
01:40:31,542 --> 01:40:34,170
I'll get the City Hall
in the background.

1364
01:40:34,712 --> 01:40:36,043
Okay, we'll go in

1365
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:38,980
Five, four, three...

1366
01:40:51,929 --> 01:40:53,191
You want to read
through this

1367
01:40:53,263 --> 01:40:55,857
and make sure
it's exactly what you said.

1368
01:40:57,201 --> 01:40:58,828
Yeah, that's...
No, wait a minute.

1369
01:40:58,902 --> 01:40:59,891
She didn't say that.

1370
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:01,369
She said
if she didn't stay away,

1371
01:41:01,438 --> 01:41:02,700
she'd be sorry.
Sorry.

1372
01:41:02,773 --> 01:41:03,797
Not that
she'd kill him?

1373
01:41:03,874 --> 01:41:05,705
Can I get a cup of coffee? In a minute.

1374
01:41:05,776 --> 01:41:07,903
Everybody's getting
coffee around here.

1375
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:12,473
...the suspect,

1376
01:41:12,549 --> 01:41:14,642
uh, wielding a big knife...

1377
01:41:15,152 --> 01:41:17,279
...the victim.
I drew myself...

1378
01:41:19,389 --> 01:41:21,550
So, she and her mother
were trying to put Norman

1379
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:23,058
back in the asylum.

1380
01:41:23,627 --> 01:41:25,754
Well, that much
we know for sure.

1381
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:27,797
Then somethin' went wrong
between them.

1382
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:28,797
What?

1383
01:41:28,866 --> 01:41:30,197
They had a fight.

1384
01:41:30,267 --> 01:41:31,996
She wanted Lila
to leave Norman alone,

1385
01:41:32,069 --> 01:41:33,400
but she wouldn't.

1386
01:41:33,604 --> 01:41:35,629
We have a witness
that heard the whole thing.

1387
01:41:35,706 --> 01:41:38,231
So she murdered
her own mother over Norman?

1388
01:41:38,308 --> 01:41:39,570
Looks like it.

1389
01:41:40,043 --> 01:41:41,635
What about the bodies
in the swamp?

1390
01:41:41,712 --> 01:41:43,373
The boy
and that motel manager?

1391
01:41:43,447 --> 01:41:45,244
Mary and Lila Loomis did it.

1392
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:47,510
They tried to blame
the murders on Norman.

1393
01:41:47,584 --> 01:41:49,745
Or maybe only the daughter
did it.

1394
01:41:50,821 --> 01:41:52,812
She definitely
killed Dr. Raymond.

1395
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:55,151
I'll tell you, If you had seen
Mary Loomis at the end,

1396
01:41:55,225 --> 01:41:56,590
you wouldn't
have questioned it.

1397
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:58,025
She'd gone mad.

1398
01:41:58,095 --> 01:42:00,928
Dressed up in Norman's
mother's clothes and a wig,

1399
01:42:00,998 --> 01:42:02,090
trying to kill Norman,

1400
01:42:02,166 --> 01:42:04,964
and him hardly even able
to defend himself any longer.

1401
01:42:05,035 --> 01:42:06,559
Right till the end,
she kept saying

1402
01:42:06,637 --> 01:42:08,764
Norman was the one
who was crazy.

1403
01:42:08,972 --> 01:42:10,303
It was horrible.

1404
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:20,939
What about it, Norman?

1405
01:42:21,018 --> 01:42:22,485
Are you ready to go home?

1406
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,421
Lt'll all be in my report
tomorrow, gentlemen.

1407
01:42:31,962 --> 01:42:33,896
Uh, let's go out
the back.

1408
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:16,852
Mrs. Spool.

1409
01:45:16,994 --> 01:45:17,983
Hello, Norman.

1410
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:19,153
Come in.

1411
01:45:22,699 --> 01:45:24,758
I was just having
some supper.

1412
01:45:24,835 --> 01:45:26,735
Nothing much,
but would you like

1413
01:45:26,803 --> 01:45:28,998
to share my
toasted cheese sandwich?

1414
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:30,733
Oh, no, thank you.

1415
01:45:35,812 --> 01:45:38,645
It's, uh,
Miss Spool, actually.

1416
01:45:38,715 --> 01:45:39,704
Oh.

1417
01:45:41,818 --> 01:45:43,877
You were expecting me.

1418
01:45:44,121 --> 01:45:46,749
Well, I was...
I was expecting someone.

1419
01:45:46,823 --> 01:45:48,654
I just wasn't sure of when.

1420
01:45:50,193 --> 01:45:51,091
Tea?

1421
01:45:51,161 --> 01:45:52,150
Please.

1422
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:05,699
Milk and sugar?

1423
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:07,266
That would be nice.

1424
01:46:09,079 --> 01:46:10,068
So,

1425
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:12,544
are you really my mother?

1426
01:46:13,717 --> 01:46:16,242
The name Spool doesn't mean
anything to you?

1427
01:46:16,386 --> 01:46:17,648
No. Should it?

1428
01:46:17,821 --> 01:46:19,846
It was Norma Bates'
maiden name.

1429
01:46:20,023 --> 01:46:22,890
The woman you thought
was your mother was my sister.

1430
01:46:24,127 --> 01:46:27,062
I had you when I was
very young out of wedlock.

1431
01:46:28,398 --> 01:46:30,559
I couldn't handle
a brand-new baby,

1432
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:33,364
especially, uh,
being by myself.

1433
01:46:35,472 --> 01:46:36,530
I had some trouble

1434
01:46:36,606 --> 01:46:39,074
and the State put me away
for a while.

1435
01:46:40,377 --> 01:46:42,402
That's when
Norma took you in.

1436
01:46:43,346 --> 01:46:45,507
You were less
than a year old.

1437
01:46:46,383 --> 01:46:48,351
Too young to remember me.

1438
01:46:49,453 --> 01:46:51,580
She never mentioned me,
did she?

1439
01:46:51,755 --> 01:46:54,485
No, she, uh,
she didn't.

1440
01:46:56,326 --> 01:46:57,850
I guess she didn't
want you to know

1441
01:46:57,928 --> 01:47:01,091
that you had a mother
who wasn't quite right.

1442
01:47:04,868 --> 01:47:09,237
But we know all about that,
don't we, Norman?

1443
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:10,495
Mmm-hmm.

1444
01:47:10,874 --> 01:47:13,240
After I got out, you'd already
had your troubles

1445
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:14,777
and been committed.

1446
01:47:15,212 --> 01:47:17,077
I decided to wait for you.

1447
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,373
Then when I saw
what they were trying to do

1448
01:47:19,449 --> 01:47:22,145
to my poor little boy,
I couldn't stand it.

1449
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:24,146
So I followed them,

1450
01:47:25,222 --> 01:47:26,814
and one by one...

1451
01:47:28,358 --> 01:47:29,655
After all,

1452
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:32,958
you're all I have
in this world.

1453
01:47:45,308 --> 01:47:47,674
You're sure you won't
have a sandwich?

1454
01:47:49,179 --> 01:47:50,237
Pardon?

1455
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:38,850
I know how it is, Mother.

1456
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:41,557
You've had a long day.
You must be tired.

1457
01:48:41,965 --> 01:48:45,059
I'll just put you to bed
and tuck you in for the night.

1458
01:48:45,135 --> 01:48:47,467
I'll even say your prayers
for you.

1459
01:48:47,637 --> 01:48:49,161
Would you like that?

1460
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:56,802
<i>I'm not sleepy.</i>

1461
01:48:57,514 --> 01:48:59,505
<i>Put me in my chair.</i>

1462
01:48:59,816 --> 01:49:01,408
Yes, Mother.

1463
01:49:01,484 --> 01:49:04,112
<i>And now,
turn me to the window.</i>

1464
01:49:04,187 --> 01:49:06,678
<i>I want to keep my eyes
on you.</i>

1465
01:49:06,823 --> 01:49:08,688
<i>Make sure
you don't start playing</i>

1466
01:49:08,758 --> 01:49:11,659
<i>with filthy girls again.</i>

1467
01:49:11,728 --> 01:49:12,752
Yes, Mother.

1468
01:49:12,829 --> 01:49:13,887
<i>Good.</i>

1469
01:49:14,931 --> 01:49:17,229
<i>Well, what are you
gawking at?</i>

1470
01:49:17,434 --> 01:49:19,561
<i>Go downstairs
and open the motel.</i>

1471
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:21,831
<i>What do you expect us
to live on, hope?</i>

1472
01:49:21,905 --> 01:49:23,236
No, Mother.

1473
01:49:23,506 --> 01:49:25,133
<i>Remember, Norman,</i>

1474
01:49:25,208 --> 01:49:27,733
<i>I'm the only who loves you.</i>

1475
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:31,406
<i>Only your mother
truly loves you.</i>
