my soul to keep.

NEWSCASTER: Before tonight's murder,
there has been no clue

7
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,837
as to who
this killer might be.

8
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,572
But now the Riverton Ripper
and the knife he uses

9
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,377
have been caught by a
high-definition security camera.

SARAH: Any day, now.
NEWSCASTER: Police say

11
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,015
that the killer is a Caucasian
male in his mid-to-late 30s.

12
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,646
It's too dark to see his face

13
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,885
but the quality of the image has
allowed forensic technicians

14
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,358
to zoom in and
enhance it enough

15
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,054
to make out
the word "Vengeance"

16
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,825
etched on the blade
of the Ripper's weapon.

17

Here's what he had to say.

27
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,881
DR.
BLAKE: The identity of a killer of this sort

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,478
may well not even
be known to himself.

29
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,352
He could be
anywhere and anyone

30

leading a normal life,
so far as he knows,

31
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,517
and never dream
for an instant that,

32
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,393
every so often,
he turns into a monster.

What's with the knife, Abel?

44
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,448
What's with the blood?
It's really crazy stuff.

45

It's not my knife, James!
I don't know what's with it.

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,525
(AS PENNY) I think someone has broken in.

(AS PENNY)
What if it did?

51
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,863

But the second that I went to
call you there was somebody,

and he said
don't call you, or else...

kill Sarah. And Leah.

to take Leah,
and drive to her sister's.

I haven't told her
about this part of my life.

to me you would.

330

Because you
couldn't kill him?

Now we're all going to die,
and it's my fault.

No!
That's bullshit Brandon made up.

333
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,727
If he was so worried about it,
he should have killed it himself.

That puppet was scary.
Thanks.

335
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,270
And the coat was creepy.
You added some moss and grass and shit, right?

336
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,636
Yeah, man,
he lived under the river for like 16 years.

337
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,935
He's primeval, baby!

338
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,737
If he rode in an ambulance
on the way to the hospital,

339
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,072
how did he get the coat
and everything?

00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,111
In my version,
the day after Plenkov supposedly drowned

341
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,476
his house was
burglarized, right?

342
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,950
And he took the boots,
the coat, his whole outfit.

343
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,247
Why would a burglar
just take clothes?

344

A burglar wouldn't, Bug.

if he was still alive!

No, he's dead.

349
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,423
No. Not necessarily.
They never found his body.

350
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,398
And nobody really knew him
or his wife very well.

They were new to Riverton.
Yeah.

352
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,965
And, Plenkov could look completely
different after 16 years!

353
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,735
Like, cosmetic surgery,
hair transplants, Weight Watchers.

354
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,273
And he could have
changed his name.

Listen, Bug.

he won't come after me.

The California Condors

420
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,750
are magnificent birds.

421
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:43,948
They can fly 15,000 feet high,
cruise at 55 miles per hour

and cover 150 miles
in a single day.

00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,228
Alex Dunkelman, eight.
I need it done this morning.

480
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,364
Alex gets an eight?

481
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,337
You have a problem
with that?

482
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,242
No, it's just that it's pretty
high on Fang's punitive scale.

483
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,372
Usually, giving an eight
to the son of a felon

484
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,082
comes with a bonus, is all.

485
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,675
Don't say something
stupid, Brandon.

486
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,776
Nothing big.

487
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,953
A blowjob would do.

488
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,391
How about I have my dog bite it
off and bury it in my backyard?

489
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,219
How big is your backyard?

490
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,654
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Good morning, Riverton.

491
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,792
It's hour 7
of Ripper Day 16.

492
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,631
And we're talking
with Betty O'Neil,

493
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,764
mother of Riverton star quarterback,
Brandon O'Neil

494
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,207
and head of the group,
Citizens for a Saner Riverton.

495
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,307
Mrs. O'Neil,
why ban Ripper Day?

496
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,644
It's just kids
having fun, isn't it?

497
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,479
BETTY: No, it's not
kids having fun.

498
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,779
It's kids having nightmares,

499
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,320
seeing the Ripper
everywhere. Kids...

500
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,480
(SCREAMING)

501
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,923
Jumpy this morning, aren't we?
Where is the sock puppet?

502
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,385
Where did you come from?

503
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,485
Your window, where else?

504
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,359
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Is Brandon damaged, do you think?

505
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,125
BETTY:
Of course Brandon isn't...

506
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,257
What the fuck is that?

507
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,425
Sock puppet.

508
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,162
On steroids?

509
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,067
Kind of.
Kind of?

510
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,867
Only you wear it this time.

511
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,999
What? Excuse me?

512
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,407
BUG: Like Jay said,
"Shock and awe."

513
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,879
Thought Edgar
was a home crow.

514
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,175
Raven.

515
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,446
He's a guard.
He watches over you, you know?

516
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,886
You're still spooked
by last night, right?

517
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,685
We were all watching the river
and he came from the woods.

518
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,816
That's scary.

519
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,089
Now, that's Jay's whole thing.
Never do what they expect.

520
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,930
And now we got Edgar up there
to keep him away. So...

521
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,934
You can have him
if you want, after tonight.

522
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,097
Edgar.
Seriously?

523
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,036
Yeah. It's your birthday.

524
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,165
Well, thanks.

525
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,675
I should get
you a present.

526
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,372
How about a weekend in Las
Vegas with Brittany Cunningham?

527
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,107
Brittany doesn't
know I'm alive.

528
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,774
She's gonna,
after two days and two nights

529
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,410
of star-studded shows
and high-stakes gambling.

530
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,885
Oh, yeah.

531
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,479
Or I could just
help you with that.

532
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,121
Yeah, that's just as good.

533
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,251
It's heavy.

534
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,760
It's all the fluids.

535
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,023
Fluids?

536
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,531
PENELOPE: The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

537
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,658
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

538
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,760
He restoreth my soul.

539
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,965
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

540
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,565
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

541
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,143
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

542
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,848
Surely goodness and
mercy will follow me

543
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,044
through all the
days of my life,

544
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,112
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

545
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,350
Amen.

546
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,590
I know you're there, Lord.

BUG: Hello?
MAY: You like it?

551
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,842
Yeah, it's great.
Thanks, Mom.

552
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,711
I scotch-taped
your number to it.

553
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,617
And mine, and 9-1-1.
Happy birthday, Bug. I love you.

554
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,249
Love you, too.

555
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,420
How do...
Do I close it?

556
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,364
Hit the red button.
Boom, done.

557
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:03,859
Small!

558
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,061
That bad?

559
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,467
No, that's good.

561
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:08,965
Uh-oh.

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,200
Get, Dunkelman.

563
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,333
ALEX: Catch you
later, Jerome.

564
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,899
What did I do now?
See you, Jerome.

565
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,206
It's what you're
not going to do,

566
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,106
which is hang
out with them.

567
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,273
Why not?

568
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,883
It's bad luck,
is "why not."

569
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:21,211
Especially
on Ripper Day.

570
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,312
You should totally come some year, Fang.
It was wild!

571
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,323
Like, Brandon set Bug up
to fight the monster,

572
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,450
which was huge, by the way.

573
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,018
And Bug,
he was so scared.

574
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:34,190
Brandon didn't set
Bug up. I did.

575
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,497
Do you know how to
steam open an envelope

576
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,796
so it doesn't show?

577
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,097
Put it in the freezer
for an hour.

578

It opens itself and
reseals perfectly.

This is to Bug.

580

Oh, really?

00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,340
Hold up, boys.
What do you got there?

She's hot
for you, too.

600
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,953
You should go over
there and talk to her.

Excuse me,

602

Maria told me you know
all about baseball.

Mmm-hmm.
Uh-oh.

stay away from

Not as good as your mother
felt last night, though.

Do not bring the wrath
of Jehovah down upon you.

in the nostrils of an angry God.

What men will do
to you in prison

is nothing compared to what

On beds of fire.
Through all eternity.

I'm going to get you
for this, Penelope.

00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,953
If you do, God will get you, Brandon,
and it won't be pretty.

630
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,755
When you least
expect it, Dunkelman.

I don't feel like a man.

656

No man does.
That's why you got to fake it.

657
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,816
Fake being a man
to be a man?

658

That's the way it works.
So, you can't run.

659
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,988
You have to face
your fear like a man.

Even though I'm not a man?

661

Because you're not a man.

Listen, the better you fake it,
the better man you are.

Well, fake it good.

got, Brandon?

His body, more

He can weigh as
much as 350 parrots.

713
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,128
As for soaring,

714
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,460
he can glide
effortlessly for days

715
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,966
until he finds his food,
which is carrion.

716
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:15,199

It's like Brandon said,

962
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,696
the way the cookie crumbles.

963
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,795
For us.

964

Just for today.

You're a condor.
You eat death for breakfast, remember that.

I don't blame you.

You should
get out more, Bug.

Shop. It's what I do
when I'm scared.

973

You're scared?

974
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,202
Angry, is what
I meant to say.

she knew you were moonlighting.

Yeah, well,
nobody's looking.

981

But somebody's
listening, Sasquatch.

982

Think about it.

983
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,862
I tell Chandelle,
she tells Fang.

984
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,295
We all know how Fang doesn't
like you off your little leash.

985
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,696
She'll mark you.
Put you in the river with concrete flippers.

986

That's actually just
peachy, you know.

987
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,668
I'll let Ripper get you two.

988

You know, Bug,
a lot of people have seen him already today.

they would have
a picture of Brandon there.

You don't know fear, Bug.

He has serious issues.

1114

And today
he terrorized a classroom

1115
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,655
with this monstrous bird
that he built.

1116

One,

1490
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:48,407
if he survived 16 years ago,
then he'll come back as Abel Plenkov.

Dad.

Option two?

1493
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,023
Option two is he did die

1494
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,329
and his soul

1495
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:07,058
went into one of the seven kids
who were born the night he died.

So, you or me.

That's option two.

1506

(EXHALING) Well,

ended up in the river, no biggie.

He patched himself up
with stuff from the ambulance.

Survives on acorns
and crawfish for 16 years.

1512
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,698
So he just crawled
out of the river

01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,300

to take his revenge.

I passed out on the roof,

Was that you?

Him and me. Yeah, it was.
He was kicking my ass, too.

I tried calling the cops

and then I heard him
coming for me,

so I ducked
for the closet.

I saw Paterson
pulling up outside.

1673
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:39,405
I ran. I hid in the woods.

1674

Then I heard gunshots,
so I came back.

1675
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:42,966
I was afraid he shot
you or something.

Where is he, anyway?

1677

You went to get me
a glass of water

1685
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,924
and now your mom, Paterson,
and Jerome are dead?

Penelope is dead, Bug.

She brought me Ripper's knife,
and she made me take it.

01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:27,445
Then I heard
something downstairs

1692

and I went to come check on you,
and you were gone.

01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,661
Paterson wasn't after you.
He was after me.

1694
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:39,566
He thought that I killed Brittany and my Mom.

It was the Ripper.

1696
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:44,500
And where is the Ripper now?

1697
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,265
I guess he got away
out my window.

1698
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,866
Or went out Leah's.
Hers is open, too.

1699
01:30:50,511 --> 01:30:52,445
And he tried to stab me
to death with his...

1700
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:53,637
Stab you with what?

1701
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:56,111

I thought you had his knife.

1702
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:57,876
I did, but...

1703
01:30:58,186 --> 01:30:59,847
Did you kill them, Bug?

1704
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,380
What?

1705
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:02,614
No, l...

01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:04,649

you something.

Your father

1713

was first diagnosed with
schizophrenia when he was 16.

Just like you are now.

1715

What are you saying?

1716

Maybe all this stuff
you've been describing

what I think.

So, if you're not innocent anymore,
that's okay.

are with me now.

Oh, and Brittany

you would've had time to stab him,
and go downstairs and kill Paterson.

You might have

Fuck.
BUG: But if you'd heard Jerome upstairs,

1760
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:25,360
you would've had to get up
there before he called the cops.

1761
01:33:27,368 --> 01:33:30,269
I could've killed you
off earlier, remember?

1762

many Law and Order reruns.

Besides,
I'm a little guy.

1764
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:39,077
You could beat me up
in, like, 10 seconds.

1765

Unless you had
the bad soul in you.

and all your friends, except me,
have been murdered.

If there's a bad soul
here, you have it.

1773
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,965
And you got it
from your father.

Maybe you have
been in institutions.

Maybe you have killed people,
just in your last life.

1776
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,700
But you're too stupid
and blind to see that.

1777
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:12,469
Maybe they'll find
your Ripper costume

1778
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:15,379
buried along with
your stupid condor outfit.

1779
01:34:15,449 --> 01:34:17,747
And they will come
for you with torches.

What?

1781
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:23,750
I didn't bury any Ripper costume with my condor.

You and the other

1787

and then ran away
like cowards.

Jumped into the first babies
you could hide in.

1789
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:45,972
So I saved you for last.

1790
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:47,305
And I'll kill you now,

1791
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:48,905
or you can say
yes to a deal.

1792
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:50,177
What deal?

1793
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:53,147
Same one I offered your father,
16 years ago today.

1794
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:56,485
Say yes, and you live. Say no,
and I'll cut your throat.

Say yes to what?

To my happy ending
of Riverton's fairytale.

1797
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:02,155
There was no Ripper.

1798
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:03,628
Just one of the
Riverton Seven

1799
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:06,130
that was a little crazy,
dressed up like the Ripper,

1800
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:09,031
killed your mom, and Paterson,
and four of his birth-mates

1801
01:35:09,103 --> 01:35:10,730
before we finally
stopped him.

1802
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:11,965
One of the Riverton Seven?

1803
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,439
The one of the seven
with the bad soul.

1804
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:16,906
The Ripper's soul.
BUG: Jerome?

1805

Great twist, huh?
Everybody will think you were the killer

1806
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:23,783
but it turns out the attack came
from a totally unexpected direction.

1807
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,508
You'd lay all this
on Jerome?

1808
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:27,679
He won't mind.
He's dead.

1809

forge a new beginning.

And then I'll say
