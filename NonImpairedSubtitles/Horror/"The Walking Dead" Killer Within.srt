The Walking Dead...

00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:05,279
They found Wells. They got him.
They found him.

3
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:06,478
I found you too!

4
00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:09,429
I don't trust him.

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,102
Have you ever trusted anybody?

6
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:12,620
He'd be dead if it
weren't for you.

7
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:15,363
I thought maybe you were coming
out here to talk about us.

8
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,503
You've seen my brother?

9
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:18,361
Not for a long time.

10
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:19,923
Makes two of us.

11
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:21,313
So, what's your real name?

12
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,552
I never tell.

13
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:24,386
<i>You're just gonna</i>
<i>leave us in here?</i>

14
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:26,715
From now on this part of
the prison is yours.

15
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:28,740
Consider yourselves
the lucky ones.

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,531
Okay, let's get
the other car in.

22
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:46,603
- We'll park 'em in the west entry of the
yard. - Good, our vehicles camped out

23
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:48,437
there look like a giant
"vacancy" sign.

24
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,739
Rick: After that, we need
to load up these corpses

25
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,441
so we can burn 'em.

26
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,710
T-Dog:
Gonna be a long day.

27
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,812
Where's Glenn and Maggie?
We could use some help.

28
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,047
Up in the guard tower.

29
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:02,317
Guard tower?

30
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:04,819
They were just
up there last night.

31
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,488
Glenn!
Maggie!

32
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:12,326
( door clicks )

33
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,863
Hey, what's up, guys?

34
00:03:15,864 --> 00:03:17,364
( laughs )

35
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,567
- You coming?
- What?

36
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:23,403
( all chuckle )
Daryl: You comin'?

37
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,708
Daryl: Come on, we
could use a hand.

38
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,544
Yeah, we'll be right down.

39
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,815
Sickos.

40
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,276
Hey, Rick.

41
00:03:51,477 --> 00:03:52,733
Come with me.

42
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,939
Rick:
<i>That's close enough.</i>

43
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,632
- We had an agreement.
- Please, mister. We know that.

44
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:07,253
We made a deal.

45
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:09,277
But you've gotta understand

46
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,248
we can't live in that place
another minute.

47
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,485
You follow me?
All the bodies--

48
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,620
people we knew.

49
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:21,091
- Blood, brains everywhere. There's ghosts.
- Why don't you move the bodies out?

50
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:24,193
- T-Dog: You should be burning them.
- Axel: We tried.

51
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:28,931
- We did. - The fence is down on
the far side of the prison.

52
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:32,244
Every time we drag a body out,
those things just line up.

53
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,070
So hump in a body and
just running back inside.

54
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:37,640
<i>Look, we had nothing to do
with Thomas and Andrew.</i>

55
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:38,975
Nothing.

56
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:42,043
You trying to prove a point?
You proved it, bro.

57
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:45,017
We'll do whatever it takes
to be part of your group.

58
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:46,809
Just, please, please.

59
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,551
Don't make us
live in that place.

60
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:52,821
Our deal is not negotiable.

61
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:56,456
You either live in your
cell block, or you leave.

62
00:04:56,457 --> 00:05:01,862
( sighs ) I told you this
was a waste of time.

63
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:04,698
They ain't no different than the
pricks who shot up our boys.

64
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,734
You know how many
friends' corpses

65
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,969
we had to drag out this week?

66
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,204
Just threw 'em out, like.

67
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:14,106
Humph.
These were good guys.

68
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:18,711
Good guys who had our backs against
the really bad dudes in the joint,

69
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:22,314
like Thomas and Andrew.

70
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:26,118
We've all made mistakes
to get in here, chief.

71
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,654
And I'm not gonna
pretend to be a saint,

72
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:31,590
but believe me...

73
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:32,991
we've paid our due--

74
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:35,594
enough that we would
rather hit that road

75
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:38,035
than to go back
into that shithole.

76
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,381
C'mon, dude.

77
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,980
Rick:
<i>Are you serious?</i>

78
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,816
You want them living
in a cell next to you?

79
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,419
They'll just be waiting for a
chance to grab our weapons.

80
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,688
You want to go back to
sleeping with one eye open?

81
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,823
I never stopped.

82
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,192
Bring them into the fold.

83
00:06:09,193 --> 00:06:11,561
If we send them off packing, we might
as well execute them ourselves.

84
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:14,297
I don't know.
Axel seems a little unstable.

85
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:15,698
Carol: <i>After all
we've been through?</i>

86
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,600
We fought so hard for all this,

87
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,134
what if they decide to take it?

88
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,011
It's just been us for so long.

89
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,838
They're strangers.
I don't--

90
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,373
It feels weird all of a sudden to
have these other people around.

91
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:28,843
You brought <i>us</i> in.

92
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:30,778
Yeah, but you turned up with
a shot boy in your arms.

93
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,516
- Didn't give us a choice.
- They can't even kill walkers.

94
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:36,718
They're convicts, bottom line.

95
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,354
Those two might actually have less
blood on their hands than we do.

96
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,288
I get guys like this.

97
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,390
Hell, I grew up with them.

98
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:47,060
They're degenerates,
but they ain't psychos.

99
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,363
I could have been with them just as
easy as I am out here with you, guys.

100
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:52,600
- So are you with me?
- Hell, no.

101
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:54,602
Let 'em take their
chances out on the road

102
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:57,203
- just like we did.
- What I'm saying, Daryl--

103
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:59,380
When I was a rookie,
I arrested this kid.

104
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:03,552
19 years old.
Wanted for stabbing his girlfriend.

105
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,911
The kid blubbered like a baby

106
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:08,648
during the interrogation,
during the trial--

107
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:10,850
suckered the jury.

108
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,620
He was acquitted due to insufficient
evidence, and in 2 weeks later...

109
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:17,289
shot another girl.

110
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:20,892
We've been through too much.

111
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:24,563
Our deal with them stands.

112
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:34,205
( truck engine revving,
<i>faint digging )</i>

113

114
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:31,226
Pretty amazing.

115
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:36,459
If we had more ammo we could
cut down a whole pack of biters.

116
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:42,102
I hear you and Andrea
are leaving today.

117
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:43,937
That's a shame.

118
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:46,941
We could use
a soldier like you.

119
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:50,909
You seem like you're
holding your own.

120
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:55,448
Even the National Guard
was overrun.

121
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,251
No amount of training can prepare
you for the world today.

122
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:05,757
You'd think one soldier
would drive away--

123
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,826
especially against
something so slow.

124
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:12,564
Those men were heroes.

125
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,634
Not the kind to leave
anyone behind.

126
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:21,172
If only we'd
gotten there sooner...

127
00:09:22,173 --> 00:09:25,208
and you were with us.

128
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,781
Lots of bullet holes.

129
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:35,018
You think biters figured
out how to use weapons?

130
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:41,591
They must have encountered
bandits weeks ago.

131
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:45,861
It's ugly out there,
but then...

132
00:09:45,862 --> 00:09:47,887
you know that
better than anyone.

133
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,759
It's too bad what
happened to Wells.

134
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:55,003
It is.

135
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,539
Dr. Stevens
couldn't revive him.

136
00:09:58,574 --> 00:10:00,742
Merle put a bullet
in his brain.

137
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:02,344
No funeral?

138
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,145
We cremated him, quietly.

139
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,283
These people
have been through so much,

140
00:10:08,284 --> 00:10:11,385
I figured, thank God,
at least no one knew him.

141
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,858
Thank God.

142

to the upper yard...

144
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:30,770
Point them facing out.

145
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:34,233
They'll be out of the way but ready
to go if we ever need to bail.

146
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,910
We'll get the prisoners.

147
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:41,314
A week's worth of
supplies for the road.

148
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:43,515
It might not last a week.

149
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,384
It's their choice.

150
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:48,654
- Did they really have one?
- Hey, hey.

151
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,689
Whose blood would you
rather have on your hands--

152
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,560
Maggie's, Glenn's, or theirs?

153
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:57,395
Neither.
<i>( car engine starts )</i>

Twin cylinder.
Is that a Triumph?

00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,506
Don't even look at it.

156
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:12,443
Didn't want it bored out?
( motor revs )

157
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:16,613
Sounds like it could use a tune-up.
I'm pretty handy with the grind.

158
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:21,752
Heads are leakin'.
I know my bikes!

159
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:23,854
Man, will you just stop?

00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:26,390
Have some balls.

161
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:28,203
Just sayin'.

162
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:37,900
<i>( creaking )</i>

163
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:48,276
All right.

164
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:59,020
Just take your time.

165
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:02,656
Daddy, don't push yourself.

166
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:06,059
( chuckles ) What else
am I going to do?

167
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,797
I can't stand looking up at the
bottom of that bunk...

168
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:11,465
Whoa.

169
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,503
( tapping )

170
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:22,910
You know?

171
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,988
I can go pretty steady.

172
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,516
That's a good start.

173
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,151
Want to take a rest?

174
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:37,111
Rest? ( chuckles )
Let's go for a little stroll.

175
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,461
If we leave soon,

176
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,796
we'll got a few hours
on the road before dusk.

177
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,731
Where are we heading?

178
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,378
I'm thinking the coast.

179
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:51,168
We have the water completely
on one side,

180
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,136
maybe we find a boat.

181
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:56,006
Best thing we can do
is find an island.

182
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,375
And if the coast isn't safe?

183
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:00,079
Keep moving.

184
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,549
Then what do we do?
Just grow old,

185
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,586
live off the sea by ourselves?

186
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:12,221
I'd rather take my chances
out there than stay here.

187
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:15,725
Because your gut tells you there's
something off about this place--

188
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:17,727
About the Governor?

189
00:13:19,162 --> 00:13:22,063
It's kept us alive this long.

190
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:24,733
That's true.

191
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,611
There's enough food in there
to last you guys a week.

192
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:38,379
Cut you loose when we get back.

193
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,247
Thank you, bro.

194
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:43,514
Sit tight.

195
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,891
Oscar:
"Thank you, bro"?

196
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:58,865
( engine starts )

197
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,669
- Glenn: Should I take her out?
- Rick: No.

198
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,839
If that armory hadn't been picked
clean, we could spare the ammo.

199
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,565
I'll start making runs.
The sooner the better.

200
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,001
We'll throw as much wood
as we can in the dog run.

201
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:12,144
Won't the fire
attract more walkers?

202
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:13,345
Maybe we should bury them.

203
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:15,080
We're behind the fence.

204
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:17,182
It's worth the one-time risk to
get rid of the bodies for good.

205
00:14:17,183 --> 00:14:20,352
I don't want to be planting
crops in walker-rotted soil.

206
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,401
I got you here if you need it.

207
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:39,503
Just take your time
on these steps.

208
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,738
Carl:
Ooh, ooh.

209
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,980
Hershel: You cleared
all those bodies out?

210
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:52,716
It's starting to look like a place
we could really live in.

211
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:53,951
Hey, you watch your step.

212
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:55,251
Last thing we need
is you falling.

213
00:14:58,354 --> 00:15:00,990
Looky here.

214
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,528
He is one tough son of a bitch.

215
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:09,164
( chuckles )

216
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:10,900
- All right, Hershel!
- Shh!

217
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:12,501
Keep your cheers down.

218
00:15:12,502 --> 00:15:13,684
( growling )

219
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,579
Oh, man. Can't we just
have one good day?

220
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:21,943
You're doing great, Daddy.

221
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,646
Ready to race, Hershel?

222
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,781
Give me another day.

223
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:32,620
I'll take you on.
<i>( Carl chuckles )</i>

224
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:36,790
Grab the rest of the bodies...
( chuckles )

225
00:16:03,683 --> 00:16:06,284
( growling )
Walkers! Look out!

226
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:12,422
No!

227
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:16,027
( walkers snarling )

228
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:18,996
<i>( gunfire )</i>

229
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:21,231
Rick:
Get out!

230
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,772
Get out of there!

231
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:24,973
No!

232
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,070
Lori!

233
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:30,439
( growling )

234
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:44,219
( yells ) Carl!
Come in here!

235
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,444
Daddy, behind you!

236
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:51,883
Come on!

237
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:00,001
The lock--
hurry up!

238
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,635
The lock!

239
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:03,671
Keys!

240
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,874
That gate is open!

241
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,780
Lori! Here!

242
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:24,624
Come on!

243
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,736
( snarling ) This way!

244
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:47,411
Get out of my way!

245
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,116
Daryl:
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

246
00:18:03,228 --> 00:18:05,195
Axel: Hey, bro, what about us?

247
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:06,496
( growls )

248
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:08,732
( screams )

249
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:11,091
No!

250
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:17,674
Hurry!

251
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:28,636
[ both laugh ] I circled where you can find
that farm I was staying at with Daryl.

252
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:34,209
Ah, you were right off Route 9

253
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,147
right before it becomes
Dahlonega Highway.

254
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,115
And you're saying that the farm

255
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,615
is only about a day's
walk from there?

256
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:43,717
Give or take.

257
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:45,652
This is where
we looked for Sophia.

258
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:48,322
Even made it up around here.

259
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:54,228
How come we never hooked up?

260
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:58,031
You called me a whore...

261
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:59,698
and a rugmuncher.

262
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:02,668
( chuckles ) Got a way
with words, don't I?

263
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:05,371
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

264
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,674
Why are you doing this?

265
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:14,846
I'd want the same thing if
it was my family out there.

266
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:19,351
- Sure you don't wanna come with me?
- Mmm.

267
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:21,920
You ain't curious
about the old gang?

268
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,391
Oh...!

269
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:29,393
Oh yeah, you really was
cut loose, weren't you?

270
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:33,097
I'm sure they came back.
I didn't stick around to find out.

271
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:36,267
Ain't that a big ol' pig sack?

272
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:40,571
We got something
in common, blondie.

273
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,374
We got left behind
by the same people...

274
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,042
and saved by another.

275
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,814
Have you ever thought
about leaving this place?

276
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,017
( sighs )

277
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,852
Never had a reason to.

278
00:19:56,854 --> 00:19:59,422
So the Governor is a good man?

279
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:03,325
Let me just
put it this way--

280
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:06,061
I wasn't in the best
of shape when he found me.

281
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:08,830
He should have
just kept on going.

282
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:13,302
Yeah, he's a good man.

283
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:22,343
Let's go.
Pull it!

284
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,312
( snarling )

285
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:27,748
- What the hell happened?
- Beth: The gate was open!

286
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,317
Where's Lori, Carl--
everyone else?

287
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:31,719
Maggie led Lori and
Carl into C block.

288
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,321
- Beth: And T was bit!
- Anyone else?

289
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:34,788
- Beth: <i>I couldn't tell.</i>
<i>- Stay put.</i>

290
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:42,696
( gurgles )

291
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,031
Those chains didn't
break on their own.

292
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:46,066
Someone took an ax
or cutters to 'em.

<i>( walkers growling )</i>

294

Oh-- you gotta be

Back up!

302
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,862
How the hell could
this be happening?

303
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:22,199
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
It has to be the backup generators.

304
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,701
Well, how do you turn those on?

305
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:26,403
There's three that's connected
to a diesel tank, okay?

306
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:28,520
<i>Each one controls a certain
part of the prison.</i>

307
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,001
The hatch shut them all off
when the prison was overrun.

308
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,342
Can someone open up the
main gates electronically

309
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:34,612
- with full power?
- I only went in a few days.

310
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:36,447
I guess it might be possible.

311
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:39,248
- Come with us!
- Glenn: Let's go!

312
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,587
There's a set of double doors

313
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:44,881
that will lead to a corridor

314
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,431
that will get you back
to our cell block.

315
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,900
- No, you should stop.
- I'm getting you there!

316
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:50,826
- Stop!
- T-Dog: Why? Sit here and wait to die?

317
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:53,462
I'll do what I have to.
You're not becoming one of those things.

318
00:21:53,463 --> 00:21:57,165
- I can't ask that.
- It's the pact, remember?

319
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,267
This is God's plan.

320
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:01,435
He'll take care of me.

Shoot him!
We can take back this prison.

What you waiting for?
Do it!

490
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,908
It's our house.
Shoot him!

Mom, look at me, look at me.
Keep your eyes open.

497
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:48,143
We have to get you back to Dad.

498
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:49,878
I'm not gonna make it.

499
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,314
Lori, with all this blood, I don't
even think you're fully dilated yet.

500
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:54,149
No amount of pushing
is gonna help.

501
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:58,753
I know what it means, and
I'm not losing my baby.

502
00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:00,288
You've gotta cut me open.

503
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:05,360
- No. I can't.
- <i>You don't have a choice.</i>

504
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:07,595
- I'll go for help.
- No!

505
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:11,696
Look, Carol is the one
that practiced that.

506
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,534
Dad only taught me the steps, Lori.
If I--

507
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:16,370
- Please. - <i>I have no anesthetic,</i>

You won't survive.

510
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:25,379
My baby has to survive.
Please.

511
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,681
My baby...

I thought we had an agreement.

516
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,776
We can always leave tomorrow
or the following day.

517
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,577
The following day?

518
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:49,479
We don't want to walk into trouble
that we can't get out of.

519
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,850
- Tell me about it.
- Michonne, it is just a day or two.

520
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:56,419
I heard you the first time.

<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

522

Lori: You see my old
C-section scar?

523
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,865
- I can't.
- You can.

524
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:11,968
You have to.

525
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:14,237
Carl?

526
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,739
Baby, I don't want you
to be scared, okay?

527
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,374
<i>This is what I want.</i>
<i>This is right.</i>

528
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:22,477
Now you-- you take care of
your daddy for me, all right?

529
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:24,980
And your little brother
or sister, you take care--

530
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:26,314
You don't have to do this.

531
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:28,416
You're gonna be fine.

532
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,952
You are gonna beat this world.
I know you will.

533
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:33,054
You are smart,
and you are strong,

534
00:35:33,055 --> 00:35:36,924
and you are so brave,
and I love you.

535

I love you too.

536
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:43,530
You gotta do
what's right, baby.

537
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:49,236
You promise me, you'll
always do what's right.

538
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:51,771
It's so easy to do the
wrong thing in this world.

539
00:35:54,775 --> 00:35:57,110
So don't--

540
00:35:57,111 --> 00:36:00,892
so if it feels wrong,
don't do it, all right?

541
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:03,000
If it feels easy don't do it.

542
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,384
Don't let the world spoil you.

543
00:36:07,854 --> 00:36:10,122
You're so good.

544

You're my sweet boy.

Okay.
