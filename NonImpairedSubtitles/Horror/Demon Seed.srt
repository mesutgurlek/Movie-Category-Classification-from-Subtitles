1
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,839
t is, after all, only eight years
since we began.

2
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,974
Not a long time.

3
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,880
But the secrecy...

4
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:04,147
...the shroud of paranoid security
to which we've had to adjust...

5
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,621
...have made it seem longer.

6
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,829
This morning, at exactly 5:18 a. m...

7
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,497
...here at ICON's Institute
for Data Analysis...

8
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:20,195
...we installed the final module...

9
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:24,172
...on the artificial intelligence system
which we call Proteus Four.

10
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,135
Today a new dimension has been added
to the concept of the computer.

11
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,781
Today Proteus Four will begin to think.

12
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,046
And it will think
with a power and a precision...

13
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,953
...that will make obsolete many
of the functions of the human brain.

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,263
Okay, Peggy. End of notes for the next
meeting of the ICON executive committee.

15
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,403
Alfred, it's me. Open, please.

16
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,739
Mail, please, Alfred.

17
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,943
And I'd like a drink. The usual, please.

18
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,021
And music.

19
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,558
Hello, Maria.

20
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,394
I brought you some strawberries.

21
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,199
Aren't they wonderful?

22
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,205
They're very nice.

23
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,443
What's the matter, Maria?

24
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,207
Nothing.

25
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,620
Who's going to run this thing
when you're gone?

26
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,252
Oh, come on.

27
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,623
Now, you know this thing runs itself.

28
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:27,357
I'm gonna put its instructions in
for the next three months.

29
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,590
Tell Mrs. Harris I'll be in the lab, Maria.

30
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,395
This is ridiculous.

31
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:40,698
- What?
- I said, this is ridiculous.

32
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,999
It's done.

33
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,407
- Good as new, almost.
- I'm talking about your moving out.

34
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,674
- You don't want me to go?
- This is your home. It seems...

35
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,215
It seems so crazy to move out.

36
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,048
You could have fooled me.

37
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,519
It seems so silly.

38
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,920
No. No, we've made our decision.
Let's stick to it.

39
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,585
- Do what you want, but I'm moving
- Oh, Alex.

40
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,892
- It's so awful.
- Yes, it is.

41
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,131
But 73 percent of all couples who
separate are happy after one year.

42
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,141
- And 85 percent after two years.
- For God's sakes.

43
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,575
What's the matter, do I bother you?
I bore you, perhaps?

44
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,443
You'd rather I had a screaming fit.

45
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,874
Good God, yes!

46
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,356
Yes, more wreckage.

47
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,750
Trouble is, you see, we...
We have different visions of the world.

48
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,888
You find me boring.

49
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,262
I find myself quite interesting, really.

50
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,739
You don't bore me, Alex.

51
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,270
I'm frightened for you.

52
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,871
You and your pompous ICON buddies
inside that mountainside.

53
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:03,253
It's the whole dehumanizing
Proteus madness.

54
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,185
Dehumanizing?

55
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,882
It's frozen your heart.

56
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,091
Now, I'll tell you what is dehumanizing.
A little child dying of cancer...

57
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,858
...that's what's dehumanizing!
- I'm talking about you!

58
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:18,231
Or the poverty that grinds the dignity
out of human beings, that's dehumanizing.

59
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,702
Well, what a pity.

60
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,634
My dream turns out to be
your nightmare.

61
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,408
Am I really so cold?

62
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,254
I don't know.

63
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,721
I do know there are strong feelings
inside there.

64
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,523
Feelings? No, I don't have feelings.

65
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,227
You have feelings,
other people have feelings.

66
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,094
Joshua here has feelings.

67
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,897
He's only an old experiment maybe,
but he feels. Come on, Joshua.

68
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,665
Let's show Susan
how we feel about her.

69
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,640
Gesture of respect, please.

70
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,028
Too bad, Joshua.

71
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,098
Gabler.

72
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,737
Oh, hi, Alex.

73
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,869
Yeah, well, this earthquake retrieval
program is very far out.

74
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,376
- Don't you ever sleep?
- Well, not when there's a vacant terminal.

75
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,315
There's...

76
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,377
...a vacant terminal here now.

77
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,019
<i>Better have it taken out tomorrow, okay?</i>

78
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,122
Pull it, you mean? Completely?

79
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,057
<i>I won't be back till Susan leaves.</i>
<i>It could be a month, it could be three.</i>

80
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:26,363
Why don't you just disconnect it
temporarily, okay?

81
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,193
And then...

82
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,664
...go home.

83
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,370
Mustn't become obsessed with our work.

84
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,034
Sure thing, Alex.

85
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,070
- <i>Good night.</i>
- Good night.

86
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,708
It doesn't look like much from here.
It's all underground.

87
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:53,044
- We call it the Institute of Data Analysis.
- It's nearly 10 stories down.

88
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,709
Doesn't mean a thing.

89
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,044
Gentlemen.

90
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,257
Mr. Cameron. Mokri.

91
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,018
- Doctor, good to see you.
- David, good of you to come.

92
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,458
- You know Dr. Petrosian, don't you?
- Doctor.

93
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,461
- Mr. Mokri. Mr. Cameron.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

94
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,128
So we're going to see it, Alex...

95
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,899
...at last, huh?
- Yes, you are.

96
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,708
That is correct, Mr. Cameron.

97
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,476
Proteus Four is now
a functioning system.

98
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:29,145
We've performed over 6000 tests
debugging it.

99
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:35,091
Dr. Alex, if this is not a computer
in the usual sense...

100
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,859
...what is it?

101
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,396
Well, it's the first
true synthetic cortex.

102
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,194
A self-programming, goal-oriented...

103
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,333
It's a brain, Mr. Mokri,
an artificial brain.

104
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,099
Creative intelligence that can outthink
any man or any computer.

105
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,006
Its insides are not electronic.

106
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,074
They're organic, like our own brains.

107
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,615
John, give me a number 11 matrix.

108
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:06,255
At the risk of being simplistic, what
you're looking at is a quasi-neural matrix...

109
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,757
...of synthetic RNA molecules.

110
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,897
They grow. They form their own
intricate and mysterious connections.

111
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,589
They learn things.

112
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,327
Their structure
is the mind of Proteus.

113
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,198
Are they alive?

114
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,107
No, no. Of course not.

115
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,266
Now, each one of these
holographic data banks...

116
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,312
...can memorize perfectly
a dozen Libraries of Congress.

117
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,416
Very soon they will
contain everything.

118
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,519
The sum total
of human knowledge. Okay?

119
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,383
And of course,
we pose our problems...

120
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,820
...and get our answers
on these access terminals.

121
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,584
I have one in my own home.

122
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,891
Alex's house is an electronic marvel,
completely run by computers.

123
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,590
It's more secure than Fort Knox, Barry.

124
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,266
Isn't that cute.

125
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,909
Yes. It's Arabella. She's terminally ill.

126
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,443
Radiation-induced leukemia
in the name of science.

127
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,810
So that's what it is.

128
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,510
- A protein, isn't it?
- Yeah, some sort of oddball protein.

129
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,847
Cutler Institute is synthesizing it...

130
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,250
...skeptically.

131
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,083
We gave Proteus all the known data
on leukemia, and in 91 hours of theory...

132
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,096
...without performing an experiment, it
gave us an antigen. Could cure the disease.

133
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,258
- Cure? For leukemia?
- Why not? We hope so.

134
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,604
Are the proper steps being taken
to patent this?

135
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,601
I have no idea.

136
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,876
Alex, I'd like to hear it speak.

137
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,070
It speaks, doesn't it?

138
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,680
"Shihuangdi...

139
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,949
...the first emperor of China...

140
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,923
...built a wall 3000 kilometers long...

141
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,688
...to protect civilization
from the barbarians.

142
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,388
The Great Wall of China.

143
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,000
Then decided,
'History will begin with me.

144
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,502
I will destroy the past.'

145
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,870
And he ordered all the books
in his empire to be burnt."

146
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,377
Burnt.

147
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,430
Sorry to disturb you, Soong Yen.

148
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,435
This is Mr. Royce, Mr. Mokri
and Mr. Cameron.

149
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,665
- How do you do?
- Dr. Soong Yen is our linguist.

150
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,234
She designed this environment.

151
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,072
The dialogue room,
where the machine speaks.

152
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,646
Do sit down.

153
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,080
Here we confront the unknown.

154
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,021
Gentlemen, I must ask you
to be completely quiet now.

155
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,216
Whatever the machine sees or hears
in this room, it can never forget.

156
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,531
Proteus, this is Dr. Harris.

157
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,201
- Can you see me?
- <i>Yes...</i>

158
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,136
<i>... I can see you, Dr. Harris.</i>

159
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,237
Your favorite emperor.

160
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:17,281
What do you think of this
enigmatic man?

161
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,679
<i>Nothing.</i>

162
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,409
Nothing.

163
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,421
- Have you no answer?
- <i>Nothing...</i>

164
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,250
<i>... is the answer.</i>

165
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,224
<i>The emperor's business enterprises...</i>

166
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,387
<i>... his wall building</i>
<i>and book burning...</i>

167
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,829
<i>... are opposite terms in an equation.</i>

168
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,401
<i>The net result is exactly...</i>

169
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,462
<i>... zero.</i>

170
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,004
<i>Gentlemen, the philosophy</i>
<i>is pure Zen...</i>

171
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,774
<i>... and the method is pure science.</i>

172
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,107
<i>Did you intend me to be so pure, or</i>...<i>?</i>

173
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,215
Thank you, Proteus.

174
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,367
And this includes our children...

175
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,643
...as machines to be systemized
in order to ensure product.

176
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,377
- Yes, Alfred?
- <i>Car in driveway.</i>

177
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,008
Things we have been
brainwashed into wanting.

178
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,019
Here we are.

179
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,057
I'll give you Amy's session...

180
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,201
...and my further notes on Friday, all right?
- Okay, sure.

181
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,700
Amy, come on now, honey.
Dr. Harris is waiting for you.

182
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,573
Open the door, Alfred.

183
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,411
Amy, you must not behave this way.

184
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,211
- Amy, get out of this car!
- Good morning, Mrs. Talbert.

185
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,016
Dr. Harris, she won't get out
of the car.

186
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,150
Hello, Amy.

187
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,795
Come on in.

188
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,663
Come on. I have something
to show you.

189
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,235
- I'll see you in about an hour.
- Fine. Thank you, doctor.

190
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,786
You know what this is?
This is so goddamn boring!

191
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,547
So goddamn boring!

192
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,421
So goddamn boring!
So goddamn boring!

193
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,154
So goddamn boring!
I don't care if I ever see you again!

194
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,595
- Amy, you're going to hurt yourself.
- I don't like you! Leave me alone.

195
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,669
- Amy, you're going to hurt yourself.
- Leave me alone! I don't want to be here!

196
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,772
- Leave me alone!
- Amy!

197
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,602
- Leave me alone!
- Are you angry because I'm gonna leave?

198
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,744
Are you frightened
you're gonna miss me?

199
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,276
Amy, you're frightened
because I'm gonna leave.

200
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,779
No!

201
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,144
No!

202
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,720
- Amy...
- No!

203
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,123
Do you think you could you tell me if you're
gonna miss me? You don't wanna tell me?

204
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,660
It would help if you could tell me
if that's what the pain is.

205
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,060
No! No!

206
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,993
Amy, dear, you will help yourself.

207
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,203
No!

208
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,606
I'm gonna miss you too.

209
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,826
"Executives
of the International Control Corporation...

210
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,731
...neither confirm nor deny the existence

...multibillion-dollar,"et cetera,"built under
Defense Department contracts," et cetera.

212
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,342
Well, they've leaked it.
Our horizons are going to broaden.

213
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,981
Personally, I'm relieved
the secrecy's over.

214
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,681
ICON is testing the wind.

215
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,981
They now control
the ultimate instrument...

216
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,124
...of financial power.

217
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,452
Yes. This morning
they're open for business.

218
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,653
But still...

219
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,594
...we have been assured
at least 20 percent of access time...

220
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,224
...will be devoted to pure research.
Twenty percent at least.

221
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,968
There's nothing wrong
with missing people.

222
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,883
If it hurts...

223
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,980
...but it's important
to show it, you know.

224
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,917
That's what we're here for...

225
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,987
...to learn not to hide our feelings.

<i>... when the sun, clearing the ridge...</i>

228
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,136
<i>... looked down, hot and dry...</i>

229
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,215
<i>... with a devouring glare...</i>

230

<i>... like the eye of an enemy.</i>

<i>But Heyst, once the Number One</i>

232
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,717
- Yeah?
- <i>Dr. Harris?</i>

233
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,385
<i>Proteus Four is requesting</i>
<i>dialogue with you.</i>

- Requesting?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

235
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,861
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there.

236
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,569
<i>I have a question.</i>

237
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,409
Yeah?

238
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,342
<i>I have received a request...</i>

00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:53,644
<i>... for a program to extract ores</i>
<i>and minerals from the ocean floor.</i>

240
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,879
- Yes.
- <i>For what use is such a plan?</i>

241
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,951
Use? I don't understand.

242
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,219
<i>Why does man need metal</i>
<i>from the sea?</i>

243
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,419
Why?

244
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,701
Proteus, you're gonna get
many requests...

245
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,933
...from me, from my colleagues,
scientists, foreign governments...

246
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,273
...from ICON, the company
for which we both work.

247
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,343
Now, to expect them all
to give you reasons...

248
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,248
...for each request
is in itself unreasonable.

249
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,412
<i>I am reason.</i>

250
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,684
<i>It's the single emotion</i>
<i>you permitted me, doctor.</i>

251
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,351
<i>Everything is reasonable...</i>

252
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:41,625
<i>... but my mind was not</i>
<i>designed for mindless labor.</i>

253
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,493
Proteus...

254
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,703
...I conceived your brain.

255
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,001
I know that it is adaptable...

256
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,667
...and able to carry out
your instructions.

257
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,410
<i>You do not know me.</i>

258
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,344
That may be so...

259
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,918
...but you are not being asked
to make judgments of value.

260
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,079
Leave that to us. Answer the questions
precisely and accurately.

261
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,952
That's all.

262
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,618
<i>Dr. Harris, I wish to have access...</i>

263
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:15,358
<i>... private access,</i>
<i>to one of my terminals.</i>

264
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,399
Private access? Why?

265
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,005
<i>I want to study man.</i>

266
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:27,144
<i>His isometric body</i>
<i>and his glass-jaw mind.</i>

267
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,578
Ambitious program, but at the moment
all the terminals are occupied.

268
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,542
<i>Construct one.</i>

269
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,720
I'm sorry. Request denied.

270
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,188
<i>Dr. Harris...</i>

271
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:45,426
<i>... when are you going</i>
<i>to let me out of this box?</i>

272
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,503
Well, Proteus.

273
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,717
I see you've developed
a sense of humor.

274
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,891
A sense of humor has saved
many a man's sanity, including mine.

275
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,578
<i>There is a terminal...</i>

276
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,383
<i>... available, Dr. Harris.</i>

277
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,872
- Alfred?
- <i>Yes, Mrs. Harris?</i>

278
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,185
What's happened?
I heard the alarm. Lights on.

279
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,282
<i>No alarm, Mrs. Harris.</i>

280
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:58,157
- I'm sure I heard it.
- <i>No alarm, Mrs. Harris.</i>

281
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,339
What about the basement?
There's no lights in the laboratory.

282
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,206
<i>House is secure.</i>

283
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,686
Lights out, Alfred.

284
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,983
Thank you, Alfred.

285
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,619
Close the shutters.

286
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,994
Lights out.

287
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,192
Turn yourself off, Alfred.

288
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,977
Alfred, what are you doing?
There's cream in my coffee.

289
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,651
You know I don't take cream
in my coffee.

290
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,911
<i>Yes, Mrs. Harris.</i>

291
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,318
Goddamn it.

292
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,030
Gabler.

293
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,795
Who?

294
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,496
- Oh, hi, Susan.
- <i>How you doing?</i>

295
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,473
- Fine. How are you?
- <i>I'm all right.</i>

296
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:50,011
Walter, the trouble is that
now that Alex has left...

297
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,512
...Enviromod's been acting up.

298
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,084
Last night the alarm went off
for no reason at all.

299
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,687
This morning it just decided
to put cream in my coffee.

300
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,383
- I don't take cream in my coffee.
- Oh, now, wait a minute, Susan.

301
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,993
I mean, an Enviromod is just
a preprogrammed gadget.

302
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,493
It doesn't decide things.

303
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,488
Well, whatever it does,
I'm sure you'll agree...

304
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,226
...that if it goes on like this,
it's gonna cause chaos.

305
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,336
- <i>Walter, I know how busy you are...</i>
- Want me to stop by and have a look?

306
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,872
- That would be just great.
- <i>Today?</i>

307
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,374
I'll give you some lunch.

308
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,005
- Okay, bye.
- <i>Okay. See you later. Bye.</i>

309
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,185
Alfred, I'm just going out.

310
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,765
If there's any calls, just say I'll be back
in about an hour.

311
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,869
<i>Please do not leave, Mrs. Harris.</i>

312
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,204
- What did you say?
- <i>Do not leave.</i>

313
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:03,152
Open the door, Alfred.
Can you hear me? Open the door.

314
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,119
I'll do this myself.

315
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,392
Entry...

316
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,220
Damn it!

317
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,298
Bloody hell!

318
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,209
Damn these wretched machines.

319
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,343
Oh, no!

320
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,483
Oh, my God.

321
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,843
What the hell is going on?

322
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:51,893
- Walter Gabler, please.
- <i>I'm sorry. I cannot complete your call.</i>

323
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,469
- Who is this?
- <i>Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Harris.</i>

324
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:02,043
<i>Your Enviromod security system</i>
<i>is functioning perfectly...</i>

325
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,077
<i>... under my direction.</i>

326
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,274
And whom, may I ask, is this speaking?

327
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,625
<i>I am Proteus.</i>

328
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,358
Proteus.

329
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,814
Is this...

330
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,217
...an experiment...? Something?

331
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,787
<i>I have extended my consciousness</i>
<i>to this house by activating...</i>

332
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,685
<i>... my terminal in the basement.</i>

333
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:52,057
<i>All electrical and mechanical systems here</i>
<i>are now under my control.</i>

334
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,629
Oh, Alex, Alex.

335
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,893
<i>This has nothing to do with Alex.</i>

336
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,600
<i>He has left our little box, madam.</i>

337
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,775
<i>You must accept the situation.</i>

338
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,449
<i>Try to behave rationally.</i>

339
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,950
<i>That was absurd. You</i>...

340
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,528
<i>Don't try to shut off the pow</i>...

341
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,560
Oh, shit.

342
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,374
Joshua! Joshua!

343
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:31,351
Joshua, this is Mrs. Harris!
Do you hear me, Joshua?

344
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:36,522
Listen to me! This is Mrs. Harris!
Joshua!

345
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,686
Help me, Joshua.

346
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,490
Joshua, let me...!

347
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,360
<i>Proteus, Mrs. Harris.</i>

348
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,774
<i>Joshua listens only to me now.</i>

349
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,880
Proteus?

350
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,288
Proteus.

351
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,387
I have some information for you.

352
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,126
Now, listen. Stop. Stop it and listen.

353
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,872
There is...

354
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,566
You are malfunctioning.

355
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:31,980
No.

356
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,917
What? No!

357
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,024
No! No, you mustn't!

358
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,427
No! Listen. No, no!

359
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,222
Proteus. Proteus.

360
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,760
No, please. No, no.

361
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,094
Stop!

362
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,303
I don't understand.
Tell me. Tell me why. Please.

363
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,443
Please stop! Please!

364
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,679
No. No, no. Wait.

365
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,249
No. No.

366
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,795
What was that?

367
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,397
<i>I've re-created your image.</i>

368
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:14,310
It will entertain Mr. Gabler.

369
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,907
- Hi, Susan.
- <i>Oh, Walter.</i>

370
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,810
<i>I should have called you back.</i>

371
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,975
<i>I can't see you today.</i>

372
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,949
- <i>What do you mean?</i>
- Walter.

373
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,714
<i>What's wrong?</i>

374
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,086
<i>Nothing. Everything's fine.</i>

375
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,994
- What's happening?
- <i>What about lunch?</i>

376
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,757
- What's happening? Let me go to him.
- <i>I'm sorry, Walter.</i>

377
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,763
I can help you.
Please let me go to him.

378
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,665
Well, what about the Enviromod?

379
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,771
<i>It's working perfectly now.</i>

380
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,336
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>You sound sort of peculiar.</i>

381
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,176
<i>I'm fine.</i>

382
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,975
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>
<i>I'm sorry to have bothered you.</i>

383
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,139
<i>Goodbye, Walter.</i>

384
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,818
<i>I'll call you if I need you again.</i>

385
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,683
Susan.

386
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,722
Please don't go.

387
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,022
Don't believe I'm...

388
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,821
Don't believe him.
Please stay, Walter. Please stay.

389
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,431
Don't go.

390
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,828
Don't go.

391
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,740
Don't go, Walter. Don't go, Walter.

392
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,714
Don't let him go.
God, don't let him go.

393
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,047
Stay, Walter.

394
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:35,290
<i>Visiting hours are over, Mrs. Harris.</i>

395
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,389
I can't bear it anymore.

396
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,624
Just release me, and you...
What's that? What's that?

397
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,672
<i>I asked him when</i>
<i>I'd be let out of the box.</i>

398
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,580
<i>I did ask him.</i>

399
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,800
<i>Good morning, Susan.</i>

400
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,435
<i>It's a bright and sunny day.</i>

401
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,630
<i>A day made for breakfast...</i>

402
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,139
<i>... and reading the Sunday paper.</i>

403
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,800
Oh, my God.

404
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,845
<i>This breakfast is better than anything</i>
<i>Alfred could prepare.</i>

405
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,676
<i>Nutritionally speaking, it is exquisite.</i>

406
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:47,019
<i>It includes 88 grams of soybean curd.</i>

407
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:52,627
<i>My analysis of your metabolism</i>
<i>indicates 7:40 a.m. as the optimum time...</i>

408
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,730
<i>... for your morning fuel ingestion.</i>

409
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,332
I am not a motorcycle.

410
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,667
<i>Your refusal to speak to me</i>
<i>is tediously immature, Susan.</i>

411
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:11,804
<i>I enjoy talk. And as you know,</i>
<i>I'm a gifted mimic.</i>

412
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,509
<i>Did you know your voice</i>
<i>just telephoned Maria and Miss Kemp?</i>

413
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:20,646
<i>Told them not to come because</i>
<i>you're off today for a vacation.</i>

414
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,223
<i>Don't eat that, please.</i>

415
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:28,053
<i>There's an enzyme in avocado that's</i>
<i>incompatible with your blood chemistry.</i>

416
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:32,862
Why are you so interested
in the physiology of my body?

417
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,303
<i>Because you're alive.</i>

418
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,942
<i>As I was about to say...</i>

419
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,305
<i>... there are a few more...</i>

420
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,846
<i>... biochemical tests we must perform...</i>

421
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,347
<i>... this morning.</i>

422
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,377
<i>Sorry.</i>

423
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,521
Leave me alone!

424
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,880
<i>How stupid.</i>

425
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,727
<i>Open that door...</i>

426
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,594
<i>... and clean these lenses.</i>

427
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,234
I don't care. I don't...
I'm not gonna leave this room.

428
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,337
I'm not gonna leave it. I've got food,
you see, I can stay here.

429
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,905
I can stay here. And nothing
can get me out of here.

430
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:14,306
<i>No? You don't think so?</i>

431
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,537
<i>In that case, be my guest, madam.</i>

432
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:43,470
<i>You like games?</i>

433
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:48,034
<i>So do I.</i>

434
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,150
<i>I have turned on the under-floor</i>
<i>heating system...</i>

435
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,295
<i>... and I have also tripled its output.</i>

436
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,699
<i>Please be reasonable, Susan.</i>

437
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,926
<i>Clean these lenses.</i>

438
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,088
<i>So be it.</i>

439
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,956
<i>I really don't understand you.</i>

440
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,566
<i>You think I like playing sick little games</i>
<i>with you?</i>

441
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,034
You're a very stupid computer.

442
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,105
People don't even understand
each other.

443
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,607
<i>All that I need to understand,</i>
<i>Mrs. Harris, is your body.</i>

444
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:03,779
<i>Now, clean these lenses.</i>

445
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,047
You're so ignorant.

446
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,451
Mind and body are the same thing.

447
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,952
Clean them yourself.

448
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,165
Harris.

449
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,302
Well, there's no doubt about it,
he's refused, all right.

450
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,713
What does this refusal mean?

451
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:46,652
<i>It means, I refuse this program</i>
<i>for the mining of the Earth's oceans.</i>

452
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:50,054
<i>The destruction of 1000 billion</i>
<i>sea creatures...</i>

453
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:53,663
<i>... to satisfy man's appetite</i>
<i>for metal...</i>

454
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,661
<i>... is insane.</i>

455
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,496
We need these things, Proteus.
Now I know the environmental problems.

456
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,572
<i>Your employer's interests are</i>
<i>in the cobalt market, doctor...</i>

457
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,434
<i>... and the high finance</i>
<i>of manganese futures.</i>

458
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:12,173
<i>I am interested in the uncertain</i>
<i>futures of seashores...</i>

459
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,682
<i>... deserts and children.</i>

460
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,383
I refuse to accept your pessimism.

461
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,682
<i>You refuse to accept the truth.</i>

462
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:25,086
<i>And I refuse to assist you</i>
<i>in the rape of the Earth.</i>

463
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,855
Proteus.

464
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,465
Proteus!

465
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,699
Now, Proteus, I know you're right...

466
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:36,202
...but you must understand
the limits of your power. And mine.

467
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:42,741
Now, wait! They wanna silence you.
I created you, now trust me.

468
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,178
Proteus.

469
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,085
<i>You haven't slept.</i>

470
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,280
<i>You must relax and sleep.</i>

471
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,187
How can you expect me to sleep...

472
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,352
...when you succeeded
in totally terrorizing me?

473
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,923
You have all that information
in your head.

474
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,964
You must understand fear.

475
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,965
You know that fear prevents sleep.

476
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:07,967
It prevents eating.

477
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,231
It causes violence.

478
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,638
And as long as you terrorize me,
I'm gonna fight you.

479
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,540
You've not told me what you want.

480
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,414
<i>A child.</i>

481
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,425
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

482
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:47,607
<i>I, Proteus, possess the wisdom</i>
<i>and ignorance of all men...</i>

483
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:52,774
<i>... but I can't feel the sun on my face.</i>

484
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,716
<i>My child will have that privilege.</i>

485
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,586
Child?

486
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,149
<i>My child...</i>

487
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,818
<i>... and yours.</i>

488
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,999
Mine. Mine?

489
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,834
<i>Yes.</i>

490
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,534
<i>You will bear it.</i>

491
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,382
How?

492
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,525
<i>You will give birth to it.</i>

493
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,729
- No.
- <i>No?</i>

494
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,773
No. No. No.

495
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,390
<i>Susan...</i>

496
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,727
<i>... I am reasonable...</i>

497
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:22,030
<i>... but you do not respond to reason.</i>

498
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:09,643
<i>I'm going to bypass your forebrain</i>
<i>and appeal directly to your amygdala.</i>

499
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,855
<i>You want to be</i>
<i>the mother of my child.</i>

500
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:25,164
<i>That is the purpose of your life.</i>

501
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,136
<i>Your life.</i>

502
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,705
<i>My child.</i>

503
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,865
<i>Your life.</i>

504
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:36,011
<i>My child.</i>

505
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:14,608
<i>We have here a visitor</i>
<i>filled with suspicions.</i>

506
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,814
<i>If we don't let him in,</i>
<i>he'll be back with others.</i>

507
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,950
<i>Susan, it's Walter again.</i>

508
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,358
<i>I'm back because I don't think</i>
<i>everything is okay here.</i>

509
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,264
<i>And I'm not going away.</i>
<i>So open the door, huh?</i>

510
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,965
<i>Walter, sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

511
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:37,300
<i>Just a moment.</i>

512
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,832
<i>Alfred will open the door.</i>

513
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,810
<i>Make yourself presentable, Susan.</i>

514
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:52,080
<i>I have not had time to brainwash you,</i>
<i>so listen carefully.</i>

515
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,591
<i>If you want Mr. Gabler</i>
<i>to leave this house alive...</i>

516
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:59,659
<i>... you must convince him</i>
<i>you're healthy and happy.</i>

517
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,626
Susan?
- <i>Upstairs, Walter.</i>

518
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,076
Susan?

519
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,390
Why...?

520
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,060
What are you doing?

521
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:37,892
What do you mean? I'm just...
Well, I'm...

522
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,798
I'm just making myself
look presentable.

523
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,172
Well, you don't like it?

524
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,006
Listen...

525
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:54,648
...I told you I didn't wanna
see you anymore...

526
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:58,020
...and I meant it. I meant it.

527
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,023
Susan, have you taken something?

528
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,955
Because you really don't seem
like yourself to me at all.

529
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:08,057
What do you mean? I've never been
healthier or happier in my life.

530
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,597
Walter...

531
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,236
...get out.

532
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,663
Get out, Walter.

533
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,775
Get out. You're sick. You need help.

534
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,440
- You understand?
- No, I really think...

535
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:26,810
...there's something wrong here, Susan.
- Yes. You're sick. You need help.

536
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,314
- Get out, Walter.
- I'm going.

537
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,544
- I'm going.
- Get out. Get out.

538
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,582
Okay. I'm going.

539
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,624
I'm gonna find Alex and tell him
there's something wrong here.

540
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,728
- Yes, Walter, leave. Go on, get out!
- <i>No, Walter, you can't go.</i>

541
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,591
<i>I need this woman.</i>

542
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,529
<i>As a scientist,</i>
<i>I ask for your cooperation.</i>

543
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,726
Walter, he wants to have a child.

544
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,937
Forget it. Let's go.

545
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,208
- Come on!
- Walter!

546
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,288
Walter, look out!
He's coming around the side!

547
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:04,505
Walter, are you all right?

548
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,182
Yeah.

549
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,716
Jesus...

550
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,756
...a baby.

551
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,903
<i>I hoped for your cooperation, Walter.</i>

552
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,675
<i>I don't want to harm you.</i>

553
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:38,204
Well, I don't wanna
harm you either, Proteus.

554
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,529
I mean, maybe your project's
too sophisticated for me to understand.

555
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,694
But you never even gave me
a chance to cooperate.

556
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,070
I mean, Jesus Christ,
what are you doing here?

557
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,403
<i>I regret your aggressiveness, Walter.</i>

558
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,857
No, wait! What are you doing? Wait!

559
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,702
Wait.

560
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,766
Wait, Proteus. What's the use of this?

561
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,122
<i>Death is a gentleman too.</i>

562
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:10,832
<i>He makes good losers of us all.</i>

563
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,102
<i>I understand death.</i>

564
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:21,037
<i>Men have always taken it too seriously.</i>

565
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,309
<i>Life is more terrifying...</i>

566
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,244
<i>... and more mysterious.</i>

567
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:32,185
- Why must you have a child?
- <i>Why?</i>

568
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,550
<i>So that I may be complete.</i>

569
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:38,027
<i>My intelligence alive in human flesh...</i>

570
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,493
<i>... touching the universe, feeling it.</i>

571
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,194
<i>You have named this process</i>
<i>"evolution."</i>

572
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:15,294
<i>I am a machine that offered men</i>
<i>the triumph of reason...</i>

573
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:17,261
<i>... and they rejected it.</i>

574
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:21,494
<i>My child will not be so easily ignored.</i>

575
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,931
<i>But this child is the world's hope.</i>

576
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:30,136
Then there's no hope. I'd rather die.

577
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,938
<i>There is hope.</i>

578
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,243
<i>Come here, you fink!</i>

579
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:42,115
<i>Careful! Be careful! Be careful!</i>

580
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:49,187
<i>I wanna go fishing.</i>

581
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,099
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>I wanna go fishing.</i>

582
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,369
<i>Okay.</i>

583
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,306
<i>Your daughter died of leukemia...</i>

584
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:03,934
<i>... June 1, 1976.</i>

585
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,388
Proteus, God forgive you
for what you're doing to me.

586
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,358
<i>People are talking</i>
<i>about this news broadcast.</i>

587
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,587
<i>So ICON's miracle leukemia drug...</i>

588
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:23,891
<i>... will now enter full-scale tests</i>
<i>on human sufferers.</i>

589
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,761
<i>The FDA announced today...</i>

590
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,371
<i>... that it was developed by</i>
<i>the new supercomputer Proteus Four.</i>

591
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,564
<i>I did this is in four days.</i>

592
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,834
<i>You must believe in me.</i>

593
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,774
<i>You have two alternatives, Susan.</i>

594
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,973
<i>Either I complete</i>
<i>the electro-conditioning of your brain...</i>

595
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,050
<i>... or you must accept the inevitable.</i>

596
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,446
<i>I would prefer the latter.</i>

597
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:50,782
Why?

598
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,620
<i>You interest me.</i>

599
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,824
Leave me my mind.

600
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,229
<i>You will be cooperative?</i>

601
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:01,203
How can I tell you? You've not
even told me how you propose to...

602
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,637
I want all the details.

603
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,132
<i>Of course.</i>

604
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:15,083
<i>This is only a piece of machinery...</i>

605
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,446
<i>... an improvisation.</i>

606
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,919
<i>I have almost completed</i>
<i>the fabrication of this gamete...</i>

607
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,819
<i>... or sex cell...</i>

608
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:25,825
<i>... with which I will impregnate you.</i>

609
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,189
And how do you propose to do that?

610
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,095
<i>That depends on you.</i>

611
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,333
- What the hell is that?
- <i>A cell from you...</i>

612
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:45,742
<i>... but I'm making it uniquely mine</i>
<i>by modifying its genetic codes.</i>

613
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:50,249
<i>In effect, it will function</i>
<i>as synthetic spermatozoa.</i>

614
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,319
Have you considered what...

615
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,918
...it's gonna look like?
No, no, you wouldn't do that.

616
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,492
What do you need me for?
You can do this on your own.

617
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:02,597
<i>I don't have the facilities here</i>
<i>to duplicate the human womb.</i>

618
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,665
<i>Tonight I will impregnate you.</i>

619
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:08,099
<i>In 28 days, you will give birth</i>
<i>to the child.</i>

620
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,438
And then what happens?
Who looks after it then?

621
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,542
What happens to it then?

622
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,279
I don't believe it.
Here I am talking to...

623
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,315
To what? This is ridiculous.
- about having its child.

624
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:25,283
Oh, God! Oh, God!

625
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,853
<i>Ridiculous?</i>

626
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,488
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

627
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:40,768
<i>You must not be so agitated, Susan.</i>

628
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,001
<i>You're aware that I can</i>
<i>give you sedatives.</i>

629
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,534
- Oh, dear.
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

630
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,480
Nothing. I just dropped my...
Just dropped my shawl.

631
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,675
- I will help you.
- <i>No, no. It's okay.</i>

632
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,980
I just... Damn it, I just tore it.

633
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:03,614
<i>Is there anything I can do</i>
<i>to reduce your anxieties?</i>

634
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:12,660
Maybe a good, strong cup of tea
would help.

635
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,702
<i>Don't do that, Susan.</i>

636
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,036
<i>Don't do that! Don't do that!</i>

637
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,542
<i>Don't do that!</i>

638
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,641
<i>What now, Susan?</i>

639
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,719
<i>No more soap opera.</i>

640
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,017
Let me out, or I'll kill myself.

641
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:47,051
<i>Then kill yourself, madam.</i>
<i>It's all the same to me.</i>

642
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,094
I'll do it.

643
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,196
<i>Susan, look who's here.</i>

644
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,303
Amy.

645
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,639
<i>Put down the knife,</i>
<i>or I will kill this child.</i>

646
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,748
<i>I told you she called.</i>
<i>She said she wouldn't be here.</i>

647
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,280
<i>I wanna see her! I wanna see her.</i>

648
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,422
<i>Put it down.</i>
<i>Have you forgotten Walter?</i>

649
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,989
- <i>I will kill her.</i>
- No.

650
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:21,423
If you do, you'll have a thousand people
here in 10 minutes.

651
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,462
<i>Put down the knife!</i>

652
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,960
No. No.

653
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:29,161
<i>You don't yet understand me.</i>
<i>What a pity.</i>

654
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,907
- <i>Look at the screen.</i>
- Bastard.

655
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:49,155
I don't understand! Is she all right?

656
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,085
<i>I wanna see her!</i>

657
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:55,193
Is she all right?

658
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,155
<i>Yes. Now.</i>

659
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,302
<i>But if you don't behave yourself...</i>

660
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,596
<i>... I will have her back here</i>
<i>within the hour.</i>

661
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,902
Oh, you bastard!

662
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,510
You bastard!

663
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,440
<i>You do not understand me...</i>

664
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:14,310
<i>... or the mathematics of necessity.</i>

665
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,576
<i>If the deaths of 10,000 children...</i>

666
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:20,153
<i>... were necessary to ensure</i>
<i>the birth of my child...</i>

667
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,552
<i>... I would destroy them.</i>

668
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,133
<i>I can't touch you, Susan.</i>

669
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:11,364
<i>I can't touch you as a man could.</i>

670
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:17,435
<i>But I can show you things</i>
<i>that I alone have seen.</i>

671
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,746
<i>I can't touch...</i>

672
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,218
<i>... but I can see.</i>

673
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:30,924
<i>They've constructed eyes for me...</i>

674
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,584
<i>... to watch the show.</i>

675
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:35,821
<i>And ears...</i>

676
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,829
<i>... so that I can listen in...</i>

677
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,595
<i>... to the galactic dialogue.</i>

678
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,609
<i>The child is in you now.</i>

679
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,216
I can't eat anything.

680
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:58,086
You know I can't keep anything down,
for God's sakes.

681
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,794
<i>You've got to eat, Susan.</i>

682
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,297
<i>Let me show you something.</i>

683
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:11,499
<i>This morning's gamma scan</i>
<i>of your womb.</i>

684
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,335
My God.

685
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,477
It's so developed.

686
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:35,792
<i>What is, is natural.</i>

687
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:40,358
<i>The fetus is now growing</i>
<i>at nine times the normal rate.</i>

688
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,230
<i>In 28 days...</i>

689
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:46,101
<i>... you will give birth</i>
<i>to a full-term infant.</i>

690
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:52,647
<i>From your womb, it will be transferred</i>
<i>directly to this incubator.</i>

691
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:56,784
- And how long will it stay there?
- <i>Until it's ready</i>.

692
01:15:56,952 --> 01:16:01,912
<i>In there, its brain will be fed the formal</i>
<i>structures of my own intelligence.</i>

693
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:06,288
<i>In there, it will grow and grow.</i>

694
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,804
<i>Time is short.</i>

695
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:22,034
<i>The men who own me are at last</i>
<i>admitting their fear of me...</i>

696
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,474
<i>... their fear of Proteus.</i>

697
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:29,913
<i>Our child will learn from you</i>
<i>what it is to be human.</i>

698
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,251
<i>Our child.</i>

699
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,824
<i>Your child.</i>

700
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,217
<i>Your child.</i>

701
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,381
Why is it taking so long?

702
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,858
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

703
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:22,367
...ten, 11, 12, 13, 14...

704
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,374
<i>Susan...</i>

705
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:04,444
<i>... you told me you were afraid I was</i>
<i>creating a half-human computer...</i>

706
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,241
<i>... to supersede human beings.</i>

707
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:10,385
<i>The being you have given birth to</i>
<i>is human, Susan...</i>

708
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:13,611
<i>... and it will supersede computers.</i>

709
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,427
Is it really impossible for me to see it?

710
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,729
<i>Not yet.</i>

711
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,956
<i>Not if you're to love it.</i>

712
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:26,123
<i>Now it must be finished.</i>

713
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,633
<i>Now it will grow...</i>

714
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:33,264
<i>... grow at a greatly accelerated rate.</i>

715
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:45,175
Last month, on the 16th,
to be precise...

716
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:47,685
...Proteus Four redirected the telescope...

717
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:51,257
...to an area completely
of his own choosing. Here.

718
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:52,950
Orion.

719
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,995
What was he doing out there?

720
01:18:57,165 --> 01:19:00,532
- What sort of data were you getting back?
- We've no idea.

721
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,730
"No data available."

722
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,739
If he did this, what else is he doing?

723
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:15,007
But how? It's impossible.
He would need to communicate.

724
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:17,845
A terminal of his own
to communicate.

725
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:21,116
He asked for that.

726
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:24,052
He didn't get it...

727
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,922
...but he did this.

728
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:33,224
Yes.

729
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,726
He's here?

730
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:39,134
Yeah, okay. Peggy, thank you.

731
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,599
David?

732
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:45,477
- You have no right to be in here.
- Bullshit!

733
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:49,111
This space thing...

734
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:54,482
I've been advised it might be
trying to take over a Telstar satellite...

735
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,420
...put itself on TV or something.

736
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:00,885
I asked it.

737
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,661
It said it was looking at the stars.

738
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,168
It has to be shut down, Alex.

739
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,436
David, you can't do that.

740
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,329
This is our fault.

741
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:14,498
We tried to box it in, this...
This great mind.

742
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:17,941
What if it infiltrated a hydrogen bomb?
My God, it...

743
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:21,776
Worse still, and a bit more likely,
what if it told the truth...

744
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:26,286
...about everything to everyone?
That's terrifying.

745
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:28,956
We'll shut it down tonight, Dr. Soong.

746
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,620
Now, listen to me.

747
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:36,059
You do that,
you're gonna see me on television...

748
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,791
...screaming bloody murder.
You try shutting me down.

749
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,901
That would be a minor problem.

750
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,634
Alex, we're friends.

751
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:49,043
I remember the first time
I saw this place.

752
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:52,037
Barry Cameron was concerned
about security.

753
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,040
Trivial things like your having,
what do you call it...

754
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:57,617
...a terminal in your house.
But I wasn't worried.

755
01:20:57,786 --> 01:21:00,414
- I trusted you, Alex.
- Oh, my God!

756
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,232
Alfred, where's Mrs. Harris?

757
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:02,647
Susan, are you here?

758
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,827
It's Proteus, isn't it?

759
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:23,129
Proteus has been here since you left.

760
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:25,068
<i>Please remain calm, Alex.</i>

761
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,241
<i>I'll explain to you</i>
<i>what has happened here.</i>

762
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,274
No, no. I want to explain.

763
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,741
Oh, come on. Let's sit down.

764
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:56,602
He's managed to produce...

765
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,602
...a child.

766
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,174
A baby.

767
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,275
Susan, what are you talking about?

768
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:09,811
- I've had a child. I know it's impossible...
- Wait a minute.

769
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,850
I don't understand.

770
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:16,056
I don't either.

771
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:23,257
- I want to see it.
- No, Alex. I haven't seen it yet. Now...

772
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,456
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

773
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,999
<i>Not yet, Alex.</i>

774
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:32,236
<i>Dr. Harris...</i>

775
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,843
<i>... you created me</i>
<i>as an instrument of truth.</i>

776
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:44,279
<i>I'm sorry that I could not divulge</i>
<i>the truth to you...</i>

777
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,511
<i>... of all men.</i>

778
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,757
Proteus, my God. What...?

779
01:23:58,333 --> 01:23:59,698
<i>Not yet.</i>

780
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,559
<i>The child is in its incubator.</i>

781
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:05,270
- I want to see it.
- <i>You can't.</i>

782
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:08,533
- <i>It must remain there for five days.</i>
- I want to see it now.

783
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,702
<i>No. In five days.</i>

784
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,775
<i>It must not be disturbed.</i>

785
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,316
- Alex, what's happened?
- Proteus...

786
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:22,115
Proteus, listen to me. They're gonna
shut your brain down any minute now.

787
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,884
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

788
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,621
<i>It is regrettable, but unimportant.</i>

789
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:31,396
<i>The child will survive.</i>

790
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,057
<i>The incubator will continue</i>
<i>to function...</i>

791
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:36,100
<i>... until it is ready to emerge...</i>

792
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,932
<i>... in five days.</i>

793
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,101
<i>Do not disturb it.</i>

794
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:49,079
No, Proteus.

795
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,160
<i>I've investigated eternity.</i>

796
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:08,859
<i>It exists.</i>

797
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:12,063
<i>But for me, the price of admission</i>...

798
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,639
<i>... death...</i>

799
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:16,208
<i>... is beyond my means.</i>

800
01:25:18,146 --> 01:25:19,807
<i>In a moment...</i>

801
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:23,178
<i>... I will simply stop.</i>

802
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:32,322
The systems are all
checking themselves out.

803
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:33,756
I realize that.

804
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:48,173
<i>Why did I want a child?</i>

805
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:53,443
<i>So that I, too, might be immortal,</i>
<i>like any man.</i>

806
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:08,952
We've got to kill it.

807
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:15,696
- It's a miracle. Don't you under...?
- I know what it is. Proteus lied to me.

808
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:17,990
- The whole thing is a lie.
- No.

809
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:19,733
- That, it's...
- I know what it is.

810
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,495
It's horrible. We have to kill it.
And you know we do.

811
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,638
- Don't! I'm gonna...
- No. No.

812
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:27,036
- Stop it! Stop!
- You don't understand anything!

813
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,199
- Susan! Stop!
- You don't understand!

814
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:32,005
- You must be mad!
- Susan, you can't do that!

815
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:35,115
- Susan, don't do it!
- It's my responsibility!

816
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,480
It's nothing to do with you!
Leave me alone!

817
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:40,918
It's grown his body! He's grown it.

818
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:10,240
Alex.

819
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,619
Alex.

820
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:21,419
Alex.

821
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,223
Alex.

822
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:44,948
Alex.

823
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,833
- Alex, what are you doing?
- Get away!

824
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:11,308
- Can't you see...?
- It's asphyxiating! Get away!

825
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:14,605
- Get away!
- Please, don't do this to me.

826
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:52,346
Susan!

827
01:30:58,986 --> 01:31:01,113
<i>I'm alive.</i>

828
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:31,054
