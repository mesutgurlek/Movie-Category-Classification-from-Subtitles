to fight him.

- You ready?
- Yeah.

313
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:51,598
Fight who?

314
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,602

Listen up, please.

316
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,609
Most of you have met
Special Agent John Travis.

317
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,611
For those who haven't,
he's on loan to us...

318
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:07,614
from the FBI Behavioral Sciences
Division at Quantico.

319
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:10,617
Agent Travis's area of expertise
is ritual homicide...

320
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:13,620
and occult-related crime.

321
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:16,623
He was instrumental in breaking
the Santeria case last summer.

322
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:19,626
No offense, but didn't that
case just end in an acquittal?

323
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:20,627
[ Laughter ]

324
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:24,631
That's right.

325
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:26,633
The problem with prosecuting
occult crime...

326
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:30,637
is the judicial concept
of reasonable doubt.

327
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:33,640
The motives can be so bizarre,
so far beyond reason,

328
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,643
that they're hard
for a jury to accept.

329
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:38,645
That means we have to work
twice as hard to get a conviction.

330
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:41,648
But our perp could just be
some run-of-the-mill psycho...

331
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,650
who gets his stuff
off the back of a comic book.

332
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:44,651
Idon't thinkso.

333
00:28:44,503 --> 00:28:48,655
Whoever did this has a background
in classic occult mysticism.

334
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:51,658
This symbol was used
in ceremonial sacrifice...

335
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,661
as far back
as 16th century Europe.

336
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:56,663
The tines on the trident
point left,

337
00:28:56,515 --> 00:29:00,667
signifying the left-hand path
of Satanists.

338
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,669
It was a sign of a sect
of Luciferians...

339
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:05,672
who took the fallen angel
mythology literally.

340
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:07,674
Then you think
the perp's got motives...

341
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:10,677
- besides thrill kills?
- Yes.

342
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:13,680
The crimes were meant
to be against God, not men.

343
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:17,684
But all I can give you
right now is a time frame.

344
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:21,688
All of the victims' bodies
also had these symbols...

345
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,691
branded on them--
Pascua Negra.

346
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:28,695
The translation would be
''Black Easter.''

347
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,698
Whatever our man is up to
will happen on Easter eve.

348
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,702
That's only about a week away.
Maybe this is almost over.

349
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:39,706
Or maybe in our perp's mind
that's when it really begins.

350
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,708
No, last night.

351
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,712
I had just taken a blood sample
when she ran off.

352
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:51,718
How could her
paperwork disappear?

I just need her name.
Allright, thanks.

00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:42,428
There were allegations
of tax fraud...

but nothing that would stick.

See, Stark is well
protected politically...

and he keeps a pack of high-priced
lawyers in attack mode year round.

Are you saying
you're scared of him?

is that he'll bury you...

told you before is probably true.

I mattered to anybody.

have to do with Cody?

About a year ago, they all started
acting a lot weirder than usual.

They started hunting down kids--

six-year-old kids, boys, girls.

569

But they all had to be born
on this certain date.

570
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,731
They'd take each kid
and put them through this test,

571
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:50,736
and if they failed,
they'd kill them.

572
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:55,741
''The slaughter of the innocents,''
they called it.

been looking for all along.

was the sign that

understand why--

There are certain forces

Nowadays the concept of evil
is politically incorrect.
