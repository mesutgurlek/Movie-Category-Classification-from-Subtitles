Hi, I'm Peter Toland.
Welcome to<i> Toland's World.</i>

42
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,200
This week we're in Elderberry Vale in
Nottinghamshire, a thriving stretch

43
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,100
of classic English countryside.

44
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,000
Home to literally thousands
of indigenous plants and animals

45
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,600
including a 400-year-old
badger sett,

46
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,800
which has crisscrossed this hill
for untold generations.

47
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,600
But in the last two years,
the badgers have disappeared because
a shadow has fallen across this hill,

48
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,700
a shadow in the form of this.

49
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,600
Are you gonna pan off me? Hello? Are you
gonna pan to the power station or--? Man:
Yeah, okay, cut. Sorry, Peter. We gotta cut.

50
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,100
Peter: No, no, don't cut. Do not cut.
<i>- </i>Peter: What's happening? <i>- </i>Man:
Sorry. We lost focus

51
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,000

Yeah? We lost focus? - Or you lost focus?
<i>- </i>I could do with another crack

52
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,800
- at that, Peter, sorry.
- Could you? Another crack. Well,
what's going on? You lost focus.

53
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,300
That's the whole point. That's your job,
isn't it, Brian? Brian:
We just didn't realize you were going

54
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,800
to move around so much.

55
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,700
Of course I move around. That's my style.
There were some quite large movements.

56
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,200
We could whack down a sausage for you,
Peter, if that's-- I don't want a
sausage. Yeah? Shove it up your ass.

57
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:20,000

Dom, let me explain how this works, okay?
- Man: It's John. - Whatever your name is,

- So should we cut now and go again-- - No.

60
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,900
I say cut, that's how it works
on the show. Okay?

61
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,900
I call cut and until then,
we keep filming.

62

that's how we roll. All right?

I swear to you.

Look, he knows you worked with
Attenborough, right? So he just feels
a bit threatened. John: Ah, right.

John: Yeah, cheers. So does he think

69
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,000
he should have won them or... Man:
He's been nominated three times,
and now he think Attenborough's rigging it.

Big fun. Fun times. Clue me in. Let's have a
laugh. Peter, the badgers are still here.

77
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,200
The badgers are... No, the badgers are dead
because of the toxins from the power
station. That's what the episode is about.

78
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,000

what? - We should carry on
filming. - Who are you anyway?

79

You waltz in here at the last
minute, calling the shots. John:
I didn't waltz in anywhere.

80
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,600
I don't want to hear any more from you, okay?
- But listen, Peter. - Can you hear me?

81
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,900
- I mean, is this for real? - Of course it's
real. And it's gonna get more real because
someone's gonna get punched in a minute.

not wanna hear one more word from you.

Granddad? You are my fucking problem!

<i> A roller-coaster has a minimum
rider height of four feet tall.</i>

<i>Johnny is three feet six inches tall

True or false. Jackie can ride
the roller-coaster.

<i> She's taller than Jimmy?</i>

Both: Shorter than Jimmy.
Taller than Johnny.

Okay, so all these have
to be true-false, right?

377

Woman:<i> This question reads
"true-false."</i>

or "trick question"
or something like that?

- Man:<i> Well, you don't know...</i>
<i>You don't know how much taller.</i>

an inch, it could be two feet.</i>

That's all right. - Man: So, yeah.

My final answer is the question
is unanswerable.

Woman: Excellent, that is correct.
Congratulations, that was a perfect score.

now, I'd love to talk to you

night. I just got stuck with these people,
it was... It's okay. So how was the meeting?

396
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:02,500
Good. No, it was really good. Not
everything is nailed down, but I pretty
much think we've got a done deal, so...

397
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,000
That's great, congratulations.

So are you coming home today?
I miss you.

Let me talk to my husband.

It's your wife.

All right.

449
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,100
Basically, why we're shooting
your audition today

450
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,100
is to show the producers what
you're comfortable doing,

451
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,300
what you're able to do,
and willing to do.

452

It's really like
an attitude thing.

453
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,000
If I told you to suck my dick,

454
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,200
would you do as you're told?

455
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,100
Or would there
be some sort of an issue?

456
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,000
Open your mouth for me please?

457
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,100
Good.

458
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,400
(gagging)

459
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,300
You a little whore?

460
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,200
Say it.

461
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,700
You know, a lot of girls would
kill for this opportunity.

462
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,000
So you gotta stand above
the competition.

463
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Wow. Phew,
those are some eyes!

464
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,000
Are you blind?

465
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,000
We're gonna have to get some, uh,
sunglasses for her on the day of the shoot.

466
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:59,300
We are gonna need to see your body.
Unfortunately, producers are kind
of picky about that kind of thing.

467
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:03,400
So if you could just take off that
retarded dress that you're wearing.

468
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,800
Faster, please.

469
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,400
We do not have all day, do we?

470
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,600
(laughs)

471
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:27,600
Yeah. Those are okay.
I give 'em a C-minus.

472
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,600
Wait!
What the fuck is that?

473
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,400
Oh, that's a dick.

474
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:42,000
- Man: Oh, gross! - A dick?
Come on, you guys! How many fucking
times is this gonna happen

475
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
before somebody starts fucking
screening the girls?

476
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,400
(distorted voice) Not a dick.

477
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,900
I like dicks.

478

not gorgeous, right? - Woman:<i> Yeah!</i>

495

Woman:<i> What'd you guys
do last night?</i>

500
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:37,100
We literally took a walk,

01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:44,200
Woman:<i> Uh-huh, on your boys' trip?
It's okay, you can tell me.</i> Okay,
three beers. But really, that was it.

Honestly, um, you know,

503
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,200
it's just, we're just keeping it super
low-key. Woman:<i> Right. Oh, is that Dylan?</i>

Introduce you to some of our new friends,
like this sweet little peach. Mm...

513
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:49,200

The midwife said chewing on
portlock root will slow down the
baby until I can get her from town.

Woman: Oh, Ti, please don't leave!
- I don't want to be alone! - You'll be fine.
There's years enough root in that jar,

612
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:05,500
and she's not even a half a day out. Woman:
Come back, Ti! I don't wanna be alone again!

Baby: Mom, why don't you go out
and catch the rabbit

629
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,700
instead of waiting for it to get trapped?
I can't be running around looking for
rabbit with you inside of me.

630
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:25,600
Baby: You should let me come out
then. Why do you want to come out?

631
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,900
Don't you like spending
time with your mom?

632
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,200
Baby: No, it's not that.

633
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:37,200
Well, it sounds to me like you wanna
leave your mom - in this place all by
herself. - Baby: That's not what I meant.

634
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:40,200
Don't know what I'd do
if you left me here all alone.

635
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:45,100
Baby: I'm sorry, Mama,
I'm just sick of eating the same
things all the time, is all.

636
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,100
Well, you can come out
when your dad gets back.

637
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:53,300
And if you're a boy, he can take you out when
he goes hunting. Baby: I hope I'm a boy.

638
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:59,000
Well, he'll be back any day now,
we'll find out then. But for now,
you're just a little baby.

Where is it?

642
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:19,100
There was a piece left,
I know there was some left.

Mama. You gotta let me come out now.

You promised,
you said you won't leave!

647
01:46:33,700 --> 01:46:39,500
Baby: But I'm too big and it's
hurting me. Don't you leave me!

I'm here, just calm down.

652
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,300
(sobbing) You can't leave.

653

Baby: Don't worry, Mama,
I'm not leaving.

654
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:11,100
I don't wanna be alone again.

655
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:17,900
Baby: I won't leave you,
Mama, I just need more room,
okay? - (cracking) - (sighs)

656
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,300
Baby: Don't worry,
I can fix this, Mama.

657
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,900
Just stay calm.

658
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,200

Now there's room for both of us.

- Do I really look
that different?

01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,900
- Where have you been?
- Don't start.

665
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,200
I waited as long as I could,
but it didn't sit right.

666
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I had to cut it out myself.

667
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:08,800
Then we'll just
have to try again.

668

I don't know if I can.

Of course you can.
