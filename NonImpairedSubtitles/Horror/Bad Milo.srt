Mr. and Mrs. hayslip,
take a look.

00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,123
What is it?

16
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,459
- It's definitely something
the doctor should look at.

17
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,494
He'll be with you in a moment.

18
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,362

Familial adenomatous polypsis.

22
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,777
- It's a polyp.

- Oh, it sounds really bad.
That sounds bad.

24

- Ok.
- Yeah.

You need a little trooper
in your pooper.

27
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,386
You don't need 'em there.

28
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,588
- Is it serious?

29
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,657
- It's, it's not that bad.
It's not that serious.

This though,
this is a weird shape.

This is concerning me a little,
but not overly.

Look, in the end,

33
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,933
this lump in your colon

34
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:59,271
is most likely due to psm
which is poor stress management.

35
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,406
Look, how long have you had
stomach issues?

36

the bathroom a lot.

Not, I mean not, not a lot.

39
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,382
I'm in the bathroom
a decent amount of time,

40

but not like, it's not extreme.

- Hour. Hour and a half.
- Yeah. About 90 minutes.

42
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:19,691
- That's not, that's...
Hugely concerning.

43
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,593
- Over the course of the day.
Not...

44
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,895
- Ok. Good thing is,
we can do something about this.

45
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,898
It's an endoscopic polypectomy.

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,667
Basically, we insert a camera,

into the anus.

- Ok.
- Right?

00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,939
There's an electrified
wire loop at the end of it,

54
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,250
you don't have to describe it
anymore.

55
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,986
- Do you have a family history
of g.I. Problems?

56
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,355
- Uh, well, you know, my mom
would gladly tell you

that she's um, you know,
regular like clockwork.

- One of those.
What about your father?

- Uh, well, we don't speak.

I haven't spoken to him
in sometime. So...

Look, I think what you're going
to need

62
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,402
is some coping mechanisms,

63
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,671
so I can give you the name
of some professionals

64
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:06,872
that can help you out.

- Are you talking about
a therapist?

Oh, I'm not,
I'm not a therapy guy.

We'll do it.

on your way out.

Talk to Nancy about scheduling
a follow-up.

Until then, you take it down.

No stress. Keep it quiet.

I don't know the first thing
about humans.

we put our own skin in the game.

you're a team player.

that I don't...

I don't-- I've never fired
anybody before in my life.

You think these toilets
are still functional?

that you guys are having

I can help you with that.

doing the stimulating?

to do with it.

But why do you keep it inside?
It's better to tell her.
