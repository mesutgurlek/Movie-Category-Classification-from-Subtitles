00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,286
DEMONS 2

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,648
THE NIGHTMARE RETURNS

3
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,010
<i>A tragic and mysterious prophecy</i>

4
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,846
<i>had warned that demons
would arrive on Earth.</i>

5
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,491
<i>Some time ago,
it looked likely it would come true,</i>

6
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,010
<i>when people in a cinema
turned into blood-thirsty monsters</i>

7
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,163
<i>and brought disease and death
wherever they went.</i>

8
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,847
<i>Even those
who did not believe the prophecy</i>

9
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,049
<i>knew demons did exist.</i>

10
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,490
Yes, all right.
I'll send her upstairs. Thanks, sir.

11
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,689
You may go upstairs, flat 706.
Seventh floor.

12
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,843
I know where it is.

13
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,884
- Good morning, Miss Allen.
- Hello, George.

14
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,729
- What are you doing?
- You'll break it!

15
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,844
- Let me work!
- Come on!

16
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,486
I am terrified of lifts.

17
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,608
Are you having fun?

18
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,923
It's not my fault
if the electrics are useless.

19
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,446
Come on, we'll get stuck!

20
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,807
Calm down, honey.

21
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,042
There you go!
What did I say?

22
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,409
Stop it right now!
This is a quiet block. Out!

23
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,449
Hello, darling.

24
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,130
What are you doing?

25
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,283
I'm giving our son some oxygen.

26
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,647
There's a gym on the first floor.

27
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,248
Why don't you work out there, rather
than spend all your time here, alone?

28
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,967
Good, keep going.

29
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,006
Don't get slack, Greta!

30
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,731
Push with those legs!

31
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,327
Is there nothing else to drink?

32
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,483
- Ask Sally.
- Where is she?

33
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,767
You look gorgeous, Sally.

34
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,003
I don't.
My hair looks terrible.

35
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,523
And can't you see,
this dress is really horrendous.

36
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,042
Look at me! I'm wearing a bin bag!

37
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,885
Are you blind or what?
It looks like I have no shoulders.

38
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,281
I knew it!

39
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,649
- What do I do now?
- We're here for you, not the dress.

40
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,326
Wait, let me try this one on.

41
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,243
Is this better?

42
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,766
No, of course not!
It's so ugly!

43
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,607
<i>a horrible death.
A wall surrounded the city.</i>

44
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,208
<i>Only reckless people
would dare violate that.</i>

45
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,963
<i>- Are you not cold?
- I'll make you warm.</i>

46
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,931
<i>Don't panic, Carol.
You're just excited, that's all.</i>

47
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,642
Do you mind if we leave the TV on
while we do it?

48
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,725
Not at all. However you like.

49
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,648
<i>cemeteries will be their cathedrals
and cities will be your graves.</i>

50
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,328
<i>That's what the prophecy said.
And it came true.</i>

51
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,601
<i>They brought blood, terror and death
wherever they went.</i>

52
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,004
<i>In the end, man managed
to overcome the evil forces</i>

53
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,687
<i>and those moments of blinding terror
fell into the past,</i>

54
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,048
<i>even though the place
that witnessed that massacre</i>

55
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,488
<i>was still shrouded
in a mysterious and sinister air.</i>

56
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,327
- Ingrid? Eat something.
- I'm not hungry, Mummy.

57
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,010
Can we change the channel?

58
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,367
You can't possibly like this rubbish.

59
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,125
No, please, don't change it.

60
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,601
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

61
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,644
<i>- Be careful. It's slippery.
- Stop moaning.</i>

62
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,243
<i>- Wait for me!
- Be very careful.</i>

63
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,324
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

64
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,524
<i>- Now, come on.
- Wait!</i>

65
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,645
<i>Faster!</i>

66
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,927
<i>They check every two hours.</i>

67
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,129
<i>Faster! This stuff is heavy.</i>

68
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,043
<i>We're almost there.</i>

69
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,680
<i>Hey, look. The wall.</i>

70
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,482
<i>What happened to those
trapped on the other side?</i>

71
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,769
<i>The demons took them.</i>

72
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,730
<i>And they became demons
themselves.</i>

73
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,882
<i>Nobody survived.</i>

74
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,529
<i>Come on, guys.
Glory awaits behind this wall.</i>

75
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,171
<i>Hold this.
Pass me the rope.</i>

76
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,562
<i>Move aside!</i>

77
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,325
<i>Come on, climb up.</i>

78
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,369
<i>Help her out!</i>

79
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,329
<i>You come up last.</i>

80
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,644
Hello?
No, Daddy isn't home right now.

81
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,288
Mummy is out too.
I'm on my own.

82
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,970
Bye.

83
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,448
- Is this the prohibited area?
- Yes.

84
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,603
- I don't feel like it.
- Let's go back.

85
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,286
What are you so scared of?
Let's go.

86
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,569
- Stay close to me.
- Yes.

87
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,086
It's pointless.

88
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,640
I'll never be ready
for the test tomorrow.

89
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,530
Come on, stop it!

90
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,604
No way.

91
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,163
Tell me the Lorentz formula
on molecular cohesion

92
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,720
influenced by
the moment of gravity.

93
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,684
X to the 1 = X-VT...

94
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,967
bracket gamma...

95
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,928
T to the 1 = T - (vx/02)

96
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,928
where gamma equals one fraction
square root of 1 - V to the second.

97
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,684
Was that correct?

98
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,240
See? You know it.

99
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,847
I'll have forgotten it all
by tomorrow.

100
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,481
I already passed physics,
with flying colours.

101
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,528
Had you been working
for ten hours beforehand?

102
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,171
No, but I was three months pregnant.

103
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,005
You're right. I'm sorry.

104
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,529
Tell me the law of mass variation.

105
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,201
What did I tell you?

106
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,202
It's so much fun!

107
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,043
What a mess.
It looks <i>as</i> if they crushed everything.

108
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,680
- What were those pipes for?
- I don't know.

109
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,727
And this green mud?

110
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,406
It's probably what's left
of the decontaminants.

111
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,764
Wait! I've found something.

112
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,087
No! Don't touch it.

113
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,205
- What is it?
- My God!

114
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,966
- This is it.
- Bob, stay still and I'll take a photo.

115
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,245
This is a demon's nail.

116
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,402
- Our first trophy.
- Yes.

117
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,769
- How much is it worth?
- It's priceless. You know why?

118
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,208
Because the demons
spread their disease with their nails.

119
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,843
Sally! The phone is ringing!

120
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,728
Hello? Who is it?

121
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,770
Speak louder, I can't hear you.

122
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,730
Fine, we'll be waiting for you.

123
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,166
- Who was that?
- Jacob.

124
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,370
Jacob? And you told him
to come to my house?

125
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,240
- I thought...
- Are you insane?

126
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,688
I don't want him here
or I'll kick you all out!

127
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,651
Go away!
I don't want to see you here!

128
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,448
It's always the same with her.

129
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,525
Go down and stop him.
Make up some excuse.

130
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,921
Just don't let him come up.

131
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,846
- What did Jacob do?
- I'll explain later.

132
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,562
Let's get out of here!

133
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,728
Is anybody there?

134
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,321
Is anybody there?

135
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,202
Devil, finally!

136
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,011
You really scared me.

137
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,441
- Can you see anything, Bob?
- No, nothing much.

138
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,127
- What happened?
- I hurt myself.

139
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,806
Let me see.
It's just a scratch.

140
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,327
What was that?

141
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,565
Hey! It still works!

142
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,243
Guys! Come here!

143
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,291
Look what I've found.

144
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,008
- It's terrifying.
- It's a demon.

145
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,245
What did I tell you?

146
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,130
I knew we'd find one.

147
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,807
And so we did.
Pamela, take some pictures.

148
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,565
It's incredible!

149
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,884
- Look at his teeth.
- Hold on.

150
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,607
Look at me.

151
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,242
- Come a little closer.
- Is that better?

152
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,961
- Come on!
- Am I all right here?

153
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,083
A bit closer still.

154
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,206
I'm sorry, hold on.
Say, "Cheese."

155
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,609
The flash doesn't work.

156
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,684
- The flash doesn't work.
- Sally!

157
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,720
<i>How weird.
I don't understand.</i>

158
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,444
<i>- Bob...
- Let me have a look.</i>

159
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,131
It seems all right to me.
Let's try again.

160
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,922
No, it's stuck. Damn!

161
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,047
Let me try.

162
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,524
- Guys! He's alive!
- He's alive!

163
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,208
Let's run!

164
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,166
Run, run!

165
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,768
<i>Blood called for blood.</i>

166
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,083
<i>And what seemed to be sleeping</i>

167
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,801
<i>was now awake again,
and as evil as ever.</i>

168
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,123
<i>Another chilling prophecy
was about to come true.</i>

169
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,040
<i>The wind of death
will sweep the Earth</i>

170
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,967
<i>and continents will drift
in an ocean of blood.</i>

171
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,167
No, it's impossible!
This can't be happening!

172
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,851
It's not possible! No!

173
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,641
Help me! Open the door!

174
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,326
Help me!

175
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,283
Open the door!

176
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,727
What's wrong with it?

177
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,041
Can you hear me?
Let me out!

178
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,126
What's wrong with you now?

179
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,329
I'm such an idiot, getting scared!

180
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,966
- Switch the lights off.
- Where is Sally?

181
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,008
Sally!

182
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,329
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

183
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,325
<i>Happy birthday, dear Sally</i>

184
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,041
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

185
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,761
Not exactly peaceful, eh?

186
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,809
Why am I eating in the street
so that Sally can have the house?

187
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,690
Try to understand,
it's her birthday after all.

188
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,889
Let's just hope
they don't trash the place.

189
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,241
You can't stand them, can you?

190
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,363
Do you want anything else?
Aren't you hungry?

191
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,681
- No.
- I am.

192
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,930
Listen to that commotion at Sally's.

193
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,600
- I wonder if they've cut the cake.
- Were you thinking of the cake?

194
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,081
Your cravings again...

195
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,289
- I'll go upstairs to ask.
- No, I will.

196
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,761
Surely you don't want
to starve our son?

197
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,085
It's me, Hannah. Open the door!

198
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,407
- I'll go down to the bakery.
- You're adorable.

199
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,768
Get me something with lots of cream
and strawberries.

200
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,162
- How many cakes do you want?
- You decide.

201
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,243
- Thank you, darling.
- My pleasure.

202
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,361
- Call me.
- Will do.

203
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,808
Come on, more energy!

204
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,603
- Hello.
- Hi. Are you done <i>as</i> well?

205
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,445
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

206
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,530
What happened?

207
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,081
Devil, be quiet.
The light will come back on soon.

208
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,531
What's happening?
Where is he?

209
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,727
Why are you driving so fast?

210
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,724
Are you scared?
Don't be.

211
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,121
I've never had an accident
in my life.

212
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,726
Are you scared?

213
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,121
Speed up, Jacob, come on!

214
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,931
Yes, otherwise
by the time we get there...

215
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,567
they'll have finished Sally's cake!

216
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,482
Frank? Can you hear me?

217
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,684
I knew this would happen!

218
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,728
Don't panic.

219
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,721
I shouldn't have taken the lift.

220
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,407
- Don't panic, please.
- I can't breathe.

221
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,211
What can we do now?
How do we get out?

222
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,568
- Calm down, please.
- Do something!

223
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,562
I can't calm down!

224
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,611
It's dark everywhere.

225
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,843
Who's there?

226
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,361
Hello? ls anybody there?

227
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,011
Who's that?

228
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,686
It's me, Mr Haller.

229
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,564
What happened to you?

230
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,041
Something's dripping
from the ceiling.

231
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,003
- It burns.
- Christ!

232
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,642
Devil!
What's up with you? Come here.

233
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,762
We might <i>as</i> well stop training, guys.

234
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,571
I don't know
when the lights will be back on.

235
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,087
- See you tomorrow.
- All right. Bye.

236
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,446
Hey, Muller!
Did you hear me?

237
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,409
You too, guys.

238
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,290
- I'm staying.
- Do <i>as</i> you please.

239
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,169
Out, come on.

240
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,288
Nothing is working.

241
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,001
The lifts and doors are stuck.
Everything works on power here.

242
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,731
No one can get in or out!

243
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,246
I don't know what happened!

244
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,011
Hello? Hello? Damn!

245
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,845
Hello? For Christ's sake!

246
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,887
Best to turn the TV off.

247
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,806
Otherwise, when the power
comes back it'll blow.

248
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,683
The air con is off, but we can't open
the windows. This stupid block!

249
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,082
Double glazing
is bulletproof, apparently.

250
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,486
I'm sweating already.

251
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,404
What about you? Devil?

252
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,402
Devil!

253
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,282
What's that?

254
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,205
You didn't lick that, did you?

255
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,088
What's happening to you, Devil?

256
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,491
Oh my God!

257
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,567
What's happening?

258
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,169
This is horrifying!

259
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,451
Help me! Help!

260
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,167
Help! Let me out!

261
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,481
- Is anybody there?
- Calm down!

262
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,643
They can't hear us.

263
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,882
I need air. Do something!

264
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,122
- Please, do something!
- Calm down!

265
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,728
- Stop it now!
- Do something!

266
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,327
Help! Open the door!

267
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,842
- Help us please!
- Stop! We're down here!

268
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,290
We're down here, please!

269
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,762
I'm going crazy!
What's happened to them?

270
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,922
She's home alone.

271
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,808
She's alone!

272
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,320
Frank? Frank, answer me!

273
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,164
Damn it!

274
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,561
Nothing is working any more.

275
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,368
Listen to me, baby.

276
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,125
This is not the right time to be born.

277
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,724
Let's try to relax, OK?

278
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,206
What's happening?

279
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,810
Let's get out!

280
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,520
Run! Run!

281
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,202
Stay back!

282
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,727
Stay back, I said!

283
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,047
Come on, all together!

284
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,131
- Pick up!
- We're trapped!

285
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,010
- The phone is dead!
- What shall we do now?

286
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,367
I don't want to become like them!

287
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,922
- We can't get out!
- Yes, we can.

288
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,446
That door leads down to the garage.

289
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,443
They're here!

290
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,689
Put the lights on!
Try to open the garage door!

291
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,089
It's stuck!

292
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,083
Run inside, come on!

293
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,489
I doubt this will be enough.

294
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,449
- Stacey!
- I'm here!

295
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,251
Get me something to block this door!

296
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,563
- I'll get the axe.
- What should I do with it?

297
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,770
- Read the instructions.
- Should I pull this?

298
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,446
You're all muscle and no brains!

299
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,691
It's pointless,
the door is remote-controlled.

300
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,366
- Is it in the car?
- Yes! I'll go and get it.

301
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,048
Get something flammable!

302
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,844
Take the car seats out!

303
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,243
Quick!

304
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,729
Quick! Let's try to stop them with fire!

305
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,286
It isn't working!

306
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,283
We'll never get out of here!

307
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,922
Did you hear that?
There's somebody out there.

308
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,241
It's best if we don't know.

309
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,047
Mummy!

310
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,402
Open the door! Open the door!

311
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,409
Something must have happened.
David's not picking up.

312
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,086
- Don't panic.
- We shouldn't have left him alone.

313
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,562
Let's get in the car,
we'll be home in ten minutes.

314
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,881
- We're in the lift!
- Help!

315
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,485
- Help!
- We're in here!

316
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:53,168
- We're stuck!
- Hey! Help us!

317
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,643
Come on, push it open.

318
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,123
- Come on, stronger.
- Keep going.

319
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,524
More car seats!

320
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,001
Be quick!

321
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,481
We need more seats!

322
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,121
Someone out there
must be able to see

323
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,521
that something is going on in here.

324
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,241
- Then they'll raise the alarm.
- I hope they do it soon.

325
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,210
Please, slow down.
I can't take it.

326
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,329
I told you, relax.

327
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,401
Put the fire out, or we'll all die!

328
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,803
Darling, don't panic.
We've left David on his own before.

329
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,930
We shouldn't have gone out tonight.
I knew it.

330
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,048
What's so different about tonight?

331
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,921
I don't know, but when I kissed him
earlier, I saw something in his eyes.

332
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,561
- He's probably just sleeping.
- I'm worried.

333
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,686
They're coming down the other stairs!

334
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,806
It's us, don't shoot.
Don't shoot!

335
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,521
Come on, go somewhere safer.
Follow me.

336
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,804
Block that exit, quick!

337
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,565
Move those cars!

338
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,007
Push them against the door!

339
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,081
Come on, quick!

340
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,007
This is pointless,
they can get in anyway.

341
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,368
Shut up! Shut up!

342
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:26,565
We need to get ready
to use anything we can <i>as</i> a weapon.

343
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,361
Chains, monkey wrenches,
jacks, iron bars!

344
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,843
Let's build some barricades and
stay close. Together we can do it!

345
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,764
Come on, move!

346
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,411
There's no time to waste!

347
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,289
Let's try and force that door open.

348
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,682
Maybe we can take it off its hinges.

349
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,411
Don't move for any reason!
Stay together!

350
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,768
Use iron bars, anything you can find.

351
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,129
We need to get this door open.

352
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,885
Ulla, let's try to get out of here.

353
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,769
Ulla? What's wrong?

354
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,006
I'm sick. I feel cold.
Please, don't leave me here alone.

355
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,484
Careful!

356
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,968
Come out slowly.

357
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,647
Are you hurt?

358
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,649
I need to see David! My son!

359
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,123
- Here, quick!
- Christ!

360
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,802
Who's there?

361
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,648
<i>Please let me in, it's David.</i>

362
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,008
<i>My parents are out and I'm scared.</i>

363
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,481
<i>Please, let me in.</i>

364
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,121
<i>Help! Help!</i>

365
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,444
Give me one of those.

366
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,843
Quick with those bottles.

367
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,049
- We'll never get that door open.
- For Christ's sake!

368
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,726
We're all going to die!

369
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,564
Calm down now!

370
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,251
I'm scared too, but we're still alive
and we need to stay alive.

371
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,810
Mummy!

372
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,563
She's becoming one of them.

373
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,688
Help me, please!

374
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,649
Stay away!

375
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,566
Help me!

376
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,688
Come with me.

377
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,608
I'm so sorry.

378
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:34,090
George! George!
Where are you going? Wait!

379
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:36,970
Don't leave me here alone!
Help me up.

380
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,089
- Hannah!
- George!

381
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,605
They're coming!

382
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,765
Enough cars! Come away now!

383
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,208
They're coming!

384
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,888
Let's hide behind the cars!

385
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,611
Be ready to defend yourselves.

386
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,608
- Don't look.
- Daddy, I'm scared.

387
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:21,685
I'm here with you.
Nobody will hurt you.

388
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,965
Defend yourselves!

389
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,002
Daddy! Daddy!

390
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,645
- George, take me away!
- Let's go up on the roof.

391
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:22,651
They're coming up. Stay here.
I'll come back for you.

392
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,371
- What are you going to do?
- I must stop them

393
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,364
- or they'll catch up with us.
- George, don't!

394
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,250
Don't worry, I'm not leaving you.

395
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:34,242
Hannah!

396
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,811
I'm here!

397
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,491
We scared her,
we were hiding in here.

398
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:03,126
- What's wrong?
- The baby just moved.

399
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,125
But it's different this time.
The pain was stronger.

400
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,049
We're almost on the roof.
Be strong.

401
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,967
Come on!

402
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,371
Come here, darling.
Help me out.

403
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,681
- Are you ready?
- We'll never make it, George.

404
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,287
Sure we will. Just like we did
last summer, on holiday.

405
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,488
It's the same thing.

406
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,127
Hold on tight.

407
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:02,720
- Hannah!
- I can't take it any longer!

408
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,604
Let's go.
There's a staircase there.

409
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,449
Let's go in.

410
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,931
There's nobody here.

411
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,368
Of course, they all escaped.

412
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,363
Those demons got in here too.

413
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,723
I don't think so.
The power is working.

414
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,681
Come with me. Don't worry.

415
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:08,286
They were only in our block
and we got out.

416
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,761
How can you be sure?

417
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,289
Where are we?

418
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,207
That's a camera.

419
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,286
Seats...

420
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,284
Those weird things
look like parts of a set.

421
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:31,370
And... the lights, the structure...

422
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:35,081
It's a TV studio.

423
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,084
They can't have been in here.

424
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,764
Everything is in order.
We're safe here.

425
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,042
That camera is on.

426
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,566
That one up there is filming us.

427
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,565
Hannah...
Are they getting stronger?

428
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,961
He's about to come out, I can tell.

429
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,769
Oh, God! It's terrible!

430
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:15,641
- Please help me!
- But how...?

431
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,962
- Is it OK?
- It's a boy.

432
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,006
And he's beautiful. Look at him.

433
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,651
He is beautiful.

434
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,326
Cover him up, he's cold.

435
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,282
George!

436
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,924
She can't see.

437
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,128
She's blind.

438
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,208
It's over.

439
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,727
Yes, it is.

440
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,848
- I love you, Hannah.
- I love you too.
