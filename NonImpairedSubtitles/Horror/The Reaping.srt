1
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,157
CONCEPCIÓN, CHILE

2
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,132
- No, thanks, buddy.
- Americans?

3
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,234
Yes.

4
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:58,553
They're out of it.
It could be something in the air.

5
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:01,053
- Maybe now's a good time.
- Yeah.

6
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:25,808
Father Bonilla...

7
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:30,450
I am blind... help bring light to my eyes.

8
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,110
The guy has been dead 40 years.

9
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:37,422
A month ago,
the earthquake broke open his tomb.

10
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:58,975
No. Don't put that in her mouth.
You'll only make her more sick.

11
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:01,473
Tell her.

12
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:04,142
There is no cure here.

13
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:08,916
Your girl will not get well this way.

14
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,020
Only the Devil...

15
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,890
...would try and stop God's miracle.

16
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:15,723
What did she say?

17
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,729
She thinks you're the devil.

18
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:25,497
Tell her I don't believe in him either.

19
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,513
Ben, check this out.

20
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,816
What do you think's under here?

21
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,126
What is that?

22
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:41,678
Yeah, well...

23
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:43,978
All right.

24
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,622
Katherine.

25
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,853
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:28,252
- Hey.
- It's okay.

27
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,228
Hey, hey, hey.

28
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,597
Hey. Hey. Relax.
Hey. Buddy, buddy, relax.

29
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,738
Hey. All right. All right, relax.

30
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,842
Deep well injection.

31
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:46,744
That's what it's called when a factory
drops hazardous waste down a dry oil well.

32
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,215
This kind of illegal
underground disposal...

33
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:54,482
...has been common practice
in Third World countries for years.

34
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,956
In this case, ethanol and methanol...

35
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:02,723
...mixed with the aromatic compound
DMSO and benzene...

36
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,730
...seeped out after an earthquake...

37
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,268
...running off into the sewer system
below the monastery...

38
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:12,965
...the fumes of which has the dual effect
of preserving human tissue...

39
00:08:13,142 --> 00:08:18,102
...and, if inhaled,
creating intense hallucinatory effects.

40
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:24,083
Throw in a population economically deprived
enough to believe in almost anything...

41
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:30,356
...and you've got yourself a miracle.

42
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:35,564
A miracle created by a greedy,
cost-cutting corporation.

43
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:37,824
Instead of providing cures
for the faithful...

44
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,697
...it provided them
with lungfuls of toxic waste.

45
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:47,902
This puts me at 48 miraculous
occurrences I've investigated...

46
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:51,808
...with 48 scientific explanations.

47
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:56,213
I'm sorry to say, the only miracle
is that people keep believing.

48
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:58,546
Have a great weekend.

49
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,814
- Go, Tigers.
- They need a miracle.

50
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:06,187
LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY

51
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:15,802
Professor, don't you have a TA
to help you carry that stuff?

52
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,533
I did, but once he got his master's,
they gave him an office next to mine.

53
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,074
Sounds like a bright guy.

54
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:25,044
And forgetful. My class was looking
forward to their guest speaker.

55
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:27,148
Sorry about that. I had a thing.

56
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,544
What was her name?

57
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,311
Her name was Theresa
and we met in church.

58
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:37,522
For old time's sake.

59
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:38,887
Professor Winter's office.

60
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,657
Father Costigan.

61
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,026
- Yeah, hold on.
- No. No.

62
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,235
Michael. It's been a long time.

63
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,274
It's nice to hear your voice.

64
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:56,934
What's going on?

65
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:00,674
<i>I know how hard it is for you
to talk to me.</i>

66
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,950
To remember.

67
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,747
I want you to know that
that's why I stopped calling.

68
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,418
I thought you stopped calling me
because you hate what I've become.

69
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:14,062
<i>I could never hate you.</i>

70
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,790
Katherine, you're going to think
I'm crazy.

71
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,696
I have all these photos of you in Africa...

72
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:21,963
<i>...but...</i>

73
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,834
<i>But what?</i>

74
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:28,306
In every photo I have of you,
your face is burnt.

75
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:30,445
It happened in front of my eyes.

76
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:32,979
Wait. What happened?

77
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,516
I think God has sent me a message.

78
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,677
He wants me to warn you.

79
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:42,483
If God was gonna send me a warning,
he should have done it a long time ago.

80
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:46,788
I understand why you stopped believing.

81
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:50,056
You've lost so much.

82
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,895
But, listen, Katherine,
the burns in the photos...

83
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,561
Put together, they formed a pattern.

84
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,763
<i>- A pattern.
- Yes.</i>

85
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,137
An ancient symbol.
I believe you're in danger.

86
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,473
I am not in any danger and I'm
really sorry, but I have to go now.

87
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:09,141
They formed the shape of a sickle.
An upside-down sickle.

88
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:12,287
- I'm sorry, I can't do this. I have to go.
- Please, wait.

89
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,719
<i>- Bye, Michael.
- Don't hang up.</i>

90
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,308
Katherine, why don't you go find Sarah?

91
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,099
Katherine, this is Doug Blackwell.

92
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,264
- Professor.
- Hi.

93
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,070
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- No.

94
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,304
Doug has a problem
you might help with.

95
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,244
- Could Doug explain on the way to class?
- Sure.

96
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,909
- Thank you.
- All right, buddy.

97
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,850
You've got three bike paths
and a quad to make your case.

98
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,011
Well, I'll try.

99
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,853
I'm from a place called Haven. A few miles
past Fausse Pointe in the bayou?

100
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:26,085
Sounds nice.

101
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:29,891
Yeah. Up until three days ago, yeah.

102
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:32,898
Some of the fellas were out fishing
on the river.

103
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,595
Water kind of went red on them.
Dark red.

104
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:38,706
- Like blood.
- That's what it looked like.

105
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:40,739
Still does, in fact.

106
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,140
And nobody knows what's causing it?

107
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,246
They put me in charge of finding out.

108
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:48,713
I teach science and math,
grade three through 12.

109
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,579
Kind of makes me the town brainiac.

110
00:12:50,753 --> 00:12:53,688
Well, when I'm called in,
there's usually a religious angle.

111
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,881
Well, that's why I'm here.

112
00:12:56,058 --> 00:13:01,360
Some of the folks in town are worried
that this is a sort of plague.

113
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,122
As in Old Testament plague?

114
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,597
As in God, Moses, the whole deal.

115
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:08,134
They think there might be
more plagues on the way.

116
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,397
Heard a lot of Exodus
the last couple of days.

117
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,973
I could give 100 reasons
why your river's turned red.

118
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:14,404
Great. All I need is one.

119
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:18,536
Call TV stations. They'll round up 10
scientists begging to solve your problem.

120
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,012
No. Thank you.

121
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:23,242
Our town's the best secret
in the Bible belt.

122
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:25,410
I'm not interested
in becoming a punch line.

123
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:29,115
- I'm sorry. I wish that I could help...
- Professor.

124
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,282
They're blaming it on a little girl.

125
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,293
She found her brother dead on the river
the day it turned red.

126
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:36,624
Have they considered
the thing in the river?

127
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,199
They think she killed him.

128
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,563
They think she turned
the water into blood.

129
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,804
Girl's only 12 years old, Miss Winter.

130
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:17,861
Morning.

131
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:21,505
Did you sleep last night?

132
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,577
Yeah. Where are we?

133
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:25,839
Far enough that all I'm getting is this guy.

134
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:30,076
<i>Jesus is the food on your table
and the gas in your car.</i>

135
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:34,985
<i>He is the beer in your bottle
and the bullets in your gun.</i>

136
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:38,684
- You gonna be all right with this?
- I grew up in a place like this.

137
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:41,329
Every bump in the night's
a devil at the door.

138
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:46,628
Turn on the light, speak in a soft voice,
and they'll come right around.

139
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,567
Yeah, I meant because of the girl.

140
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:51,797
I'll be fine.

141
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:55,943
Thanks for asking, though.

142
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:00,806
Hi.

143
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,744
Yeah. Still no service?

144
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:12,721
All he wrote down
was 17 miles to the turnoff.

145
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,561
I'd rather talk to you anyway, over.

146
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:21,431
Well, ain't that sweet?

147
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,771
Copy.

148
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:59,473
Well, we're deep in it now.

149
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,936
I think it's kind of cute.

150
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:07,441
Sort of.

151
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,984
Hi. You must be the folks
from the college.

152
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:17,421
I'm Isabelle. They told me y'all would
start showing up right on about now.

153
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:21,256
All right, well, come on, then.
Let's park this thing out of the sun.

154
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,061
I kind of have the catbird seat
from over there inside the store.

155
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,140
- Thanks for meeting us.
- Don't thank me.

156
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:35,799
You are doing us a big old favor.

157
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:38,446
I tell you, this town
ain't seen nothing like this.

158
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:40,275
The McConnell boy, then the river.

159
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,477
Well, we all swim in it. Hank.

160
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:47,781
Look, he's my eldest.
That's him over there with his daddy.

161
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:48,945
Hey, baby.

162
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:50,455
- Hey, how you doing?
- Fine.

163
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:55,427
He just bought himself a Ski-Doo.
Hadn't even got it wet yet.

164
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,700
- How y'all doing?
- Good.

165
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,474
Don't y'all just love that sound?

166
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:11,135
- What is that it's made of?
- Fulgurite.

167
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:15,274
It's what happens to sand
when lightning strikes the ground.

168
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,112
You all must get a lot of lightning.

169
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,719
Most in three parishes.

170
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,582
We've been selling chimes all over.

171
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:23,020
Soon there'll be a piece
of Haven everywhere.

172
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:25,183
You know, we're even thinking website.

173
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,052
Hey, Janet. How you holding up?

174
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,219
Hey, pud.

175
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,662
Hey, little man.

176
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,995
Church is this way. Come on.

177
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,959
See you.

178
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,904
We were only a week apart.
It's number two for the both of us.

179
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,633
Know what you're having?

180
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,209
Heck, doesn't matter to me.

181
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:45,369
- Morning.
- Morning.

182
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:47,014
You got kids?

183
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,417
No, I don't.

184
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,315
They must be upstairs.

185
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,477
They?

186
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:58,251
The town council. Doug, the mayor, and
whoever else ain't doing their real job.

187
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,224
Boys sure do love to act important.

188
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:02,158
We certainly do, ma'am.

189
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,323
- Can't have a field trip in a damn gym.
- Then we'll postpone.

190
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,729
Gonna get real suspicious...

191
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:10,099
They'll get suspicious if every kid
comes down with a staph infection.

192
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,261
Oh, hi.

193
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,429
- Mayor Brooks.
- Hi.

194
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:15,372
These are the folks
I was telling you about.

195
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,104
I'm hoping Katherine here
can help us with our problem.

196
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,214
I understand you're not
a Bible reader.

197
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:22,944
Well, I've read it.

198
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,816
Just don't put much stock in it.

199
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,285
Yeah.

200
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,517
Some folks just don't
wanna go to heaven.

201
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,428
Maybe it's time to look at your river.

202
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,268
It ain't getting any better.

203
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,227
When did the fish start?

204
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,430
This morning.
Bubbled up like farts in a bathtub.

205
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,074
How far does it go?

206
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,268
That way, up to the channel.
And then down this way...

207
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:25,140
...almost half a mile to the dam.

208
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:27,475
- That could be your problem.
- How do you mean?

209
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,641
A dam gives pollutants
a place to build up.

210
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:33,879
Longer they're there,
the more toxic they get.

211
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,456
Is it blood?

212
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:48,928
You know, I wish I could tell you.

213
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:52,029
Never seen that before.

214
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,607
- Black's not even on the chart.
- Bad phenolphthalein?

215
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,506
- I hope not. It's the only we've got.
- Get more samples.

216
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,943
We'll overnight to the lab.
I'll get the waders.

217
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:46,287
Can't take it in any further. Too shallow.

218
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:50,797
Okay. We'll walk.

219
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,468
You gonna be all right
if I leave you alone?

220
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,130
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm loving life right now.

221
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,437
Katherine?

222
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:16,577
Easy there. You all right?

223
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:19,675
I'm fine. I just hit my head.

224
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:22,782
I saw a girl.

225
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:24,043
- What? Blond?
- Yeah.

226
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,380
Kind of thin?

227
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,582
It's not how I figured
on you two meeting.

228
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,057
That's the girl everyone's worried about?

229
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:35,196
Loren McConnell.

230
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:40,130
We're not far from where her brother,
Brody, died.

231
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:42,795
They live out here?

232
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:46,668
And that's pretty much
how the rest of the town likes it.

233
00:23:47,609 --> 00:23:52,012
- What's everyone have against these people?
- A single mom letting her kids run wild?

234
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,082
- Doesn't exactly fit the town's
self-image. - Where's the father?

235
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:59,709
Brody's dad drove his truck
off the causeway.

236
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,753
Loren's father was a traveling preacher.

237
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,448
Really? Covered wagon or a tent?

238
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:07,993
No, I think it was a Pontiac.

239
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:11,098
He only stayed around long enough
to leave her mom in a fix.

240
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:13,700
Folks been looking at her cross-eyed
ever since.

241
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,838
I haven't been out this way in a while.

242
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:20,031
- Nobody has.
- What did this place used to be?

243
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,733
A haven. About a hundred years ago.

244
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:28,881
Until three hurricanes in three years
pretty much wiped it off the map.

245
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:32,215
They buried all their dead
in that mausoleum.

246
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:37,723
- Then they started over on higher ground.
- Thought you said no one came here.

247
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,131
Katherine?

248
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:01,002
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah...</i>

249
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,144
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm close. Be right there.</i>

250
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:38,946
I know I tend to jump to conclusions
on these things...

251
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,446
- Don't say it.
- Lf this town is thinking plagues...

252
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:44,779
...they got one closer.
- Don't you think it's early to go biblical?

253
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:47,683
Seeing I was waist-high in blood,
dodging dead frogs, no.

254
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,984
They died because the pH level
of the water was off the charts.

255
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,928
- We're gonna need to see the body.
- I'll call, see if I can arrange it.

256
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:58,224
Is there any way
I can overnight these samples?

257
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,598
Sure. We got a post office in town.
I'll point it out on the way to my place.

258
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:03,760
Your place?

259
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:05,667
Well, I hope you don't mind...

260
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,571
...but we don't have a motel here,
but I got two extra rooms all ready to go.

261
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:12,235
- I wasn't sure if you two were...
- No, we're not.

262
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:14,314
No accounting for taste.

263
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:16,541
- So that's okay?
- It's fine.

264
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:19,983
You wanna ride with me?
I can clean off the seat.

265
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:21,247
Sure.

266
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:25,189
Hey, Katherine, if you need me to
disappear so you can get acquainted...

267
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,954
...I can find a Stuckey's...
- Get those samples in...

268
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:29,562
...before it's too late.

269
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,291
- Your hair looks nice.
- Shut it.

270
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,935
What do you think?

271
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,912
It's probably Pfiesteria.

272
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:50,179
- Excuse me?
- Oh, it's a micro-organism...

273
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:52,912
...which gets lethal
under the right conditions.

274
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,956
Toxins bloom. Fish die.
Your river turns red.

275
00:27:58,026 --> 00:27:59,789
Right.

276
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,131
You meant the scenery.

277
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:08,331
No, that's good. Very efficient.

278
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:12,735
I have a tendency to miss the forest for...

279
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:15,034
Literally.

280
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:22,740
It's beautiful.

281
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,509
From a ways off, maybe.

282
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:27,655
I've been trying to restore it
since my granddad gave it to me.

283
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:29,414
You must have been a good grandson.

284
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:31,456
Well, he didn't have a lot of choice.

285
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:35,357
I come from a long line of only children.

286
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,834
- I got it.
- Thanks.

287
00:28:43,271 --> 00:28:45,501
This is a pretty big job for just one guy.

288
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:49,040
Yes, it is. Kind of.

289
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,005
I got it.

290
00:29:14,602 --> 00:29:16,570
Katherine?

291
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:20,033
I got a bed set up in here.

292
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,472
- Thank you.
- It's not much.

293
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:25,135
No, it's great. Thanks.

294
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:28,510
And I got a couch in the other room.
I thought Ben could use it.

295
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:32,016
I hope he doesn't mind.

296
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:37,954
You folks really like these things. These.

297
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:45,164
Damn.

298
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,823
What?

299
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,798
My bracelet.

300
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,234
I must've lost it at the swamp.

301
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:54,170
Was it valuable?

302
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:55,536
Only to me, I guess.

303
00:29:57,412 --> 00:30:02,543
- It might be a little hard to find in the dark.
- It's okay, really. I'll live.

304
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:09,687
Maybe I'll look in the truck.

305
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:12,122
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

306
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:20,298
Well, I hope you like fish.

307
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:25,772
Well, where exactly
did you get the fish?

308
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:28,774
Grocery store. Seafood section.

309
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:31,241
- Great.
- Oh, well, then, grill on.

310
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:35,280
- Oh, shit. I forgot the Tabasco.
- I'll get it. Ben needs a refill anyway.

311
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:39,080
Cupboard above the sink.

312
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,280
So I guess it's safe to say
you're a church-going man.

313
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:45,893
Oh, yeah. Ten years, every Sunday.

314
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,224
How's that fit with disproving miracles?

315
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:53,094
You know, it's easy to lose faith.

316
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:57,133
Look at Katherine. If an ordained minister
can turn her back on God...

317
00:30:57,305 --> 00:31:00,240
...then what hope is there
for the rest of us, right?

318
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:03,002
Plus, I think people
need to believe in miracles.

319
00:31:03,177 --> 00:31:04,644
Find any real ones yet?

320
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:09,215
Yeah. Yeah.
Two semi-automatics, at 10 feet.

321
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:13,150
Punctured my liver, my kidneys, both arms.
Shattered my hip.

322
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:15,846
18th Street, when I was young,
doing dumb stuff.

323
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:20,889
Hell, I was still hooked to the IV
when they rolled me into court.

324
00:31:21,062 --> 00:31:22,654
Yeah, I knew I was supposed to die.

325
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,991
I guess Katherine doesn't have
the same tattoos.

326
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:29,125
No, I keep telling her to get
a question mark right here, but no.

327
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,240
- Weren't you getting me a beer?
- Guess you didn't pray hard enough.

328
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:40,312
Well, the first wave's done.
I hope everybody's hungry.

329
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,882
Amen to that because I'm starving.

330
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:55,825
Hey.

331
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,761
Yeah, sure. I'll ask.

332
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:02,761
We'll be right over.

333
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:04,905
That was Cade.

334
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:07,598
Jim Wakeman says his cattle
are acting strange.

335
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:10,335
- Well, did he call the vet?
- Can't until tomorrow.

336
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,570
Is their place close to the river?

337
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:14,305
About half a mile.

338
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:18,145
- Might be worth a look.
- Yeah. I'll go get the stuff.

339
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,088
I don't know.
I mean, the maggots and the flies.

340
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:22,847
Where did they come from so fast?

341
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,857
Katherine, do you still think this is?
What do you call it?

342
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,588
Pfiesteria. It makes the most sense.

343
00:32:29,764 --> 00:32:32,995
- Are we here yet?
- Yeah, farm's just up here.

344
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,800
- How many head of cattle do they...?
- Oh, God.

345
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:46,708
What the fuck was that?

346
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,518
Doug?

347
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,696
Shit.

348
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:43,836
Shit.

349
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:53,608
Goddamn bull tore right through
my holding pen.

350
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:59,276
- Nearly gutted my boy before I got him clear.
- When did the cows start getting sick?

351
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:03,823
At milking this morning
some didn't wanna give.

352
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:06,824
Now most of them can't even stand.

353
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,827
Seems like they're shriveling up.

354
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:14,331
Have you changed their food?
Give them any new supplements, hormones?

355
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:16,493
Ain't nothing like that.

356
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:18,263
All my cattle's corn- and hay-fed.

357
00:34:18,439 --> 00:34:21,636
What about pesticides?
Could they have gotten into another field?

358
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,299
I did a line walk.

359
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,843
Fences are all good.

360
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:27,606
Anyhow, there ain't any
growing farms around here.

361
00:34:27,782 --> 00:34:29,044
Cows drink up to...

362
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:32,549
...12 gallons of water a day.

363
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,416
If whatever's contaminating the river
got into the water...

364
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,959
My animals get their water from a well.
Same as we do.

365
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:48,665
We're gonna go in.

366
00:34:58,446 --> 00:35:03,247
This is getting a little hard
to ignore, Katherine.

367
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:08,712
We're four for four, chapter and
the verse. And I mean actual verse.

368
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,190
- Blood, frogs, flies, dead livestock.
- These cows aren't dead.

369
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:17,453
No, not yet. But from where I'm standing,
it looks pretty damn serious.

370
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,999
God sent the plagues as warnings
to the Pharaoh to let his people go.

371
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:22,932
What is he supposed to be saying here?

372
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:24,765
Yeah, well, maybe it's not from him.

373
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,999
The Pharaoh's sorcerers used magic
to match God, plague for plague.

374
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:31,475
- Evil against good.
- Who is responsible? Satan?

375
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,271
I didn't say that.

376
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:39,078
I don't know, but what I do know
is that we are witnessing biblical events.

377
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,618
All right.

378
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:42,153
- You wanna talk plagues?
- Yeah.

379
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:44,223
- Let's talk plagues.
- Okay.

380
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,793
In 1400 B.C., a group of nervous Egyptians
saw the Nile turn red.

381
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:49,224
Oh, God. Come on.

382
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,525
But what they thought was blood
was actually an algae bloom...

383
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,568
...which killed the fish, which prior to
that had been living off the eggs of frogs.

384
00:35:56,737 --> 00:36:00,002
Those uneaten eggs turned into
record numbers of baby frogs...

385
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:02,802
...who subsequently fled to land and died.
- Right.

386
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:05,878
Their little rotting frog bodies
attracted lice and flies.

387
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:10,609
The lice carried the bluetongue virus,
which killed 70 percent of Egypt's livestock.

388
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:15,347
The flies carried glanders, a bacterial
infection which in humans causes boils.

389
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:18,583
After, the Nile River Valley
was hit with a three-day sandstorm...

390
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,852
...otherwise known
as the plague of darkness.

391
00:36:21,028 --> 00:36:23,496
- Katherine.
- During the sandstorm, heat can combine...

392
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:27,532
...with an approaching cold front to create
not only hail, but electrical storms...

393
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:31,001
...which would have looked to the
Egyptians like fire from the sky.

394
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,608
The wind would've blown the Ethiopian
locust population off course...

395
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,402
...and right into downtown Cairo.

396
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:38,442
Hail is wet, locusts leave droppings...

397
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,979
...spread both on grain,
and you've got mycotoxins.

398
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:44,515
Dinnertime in Egypt meant
the first-born got the biggest portion...

399
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:47,552
...which meant he ate the most toxins,
so he died.

400
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:50,520
Ten plagues. Ten scientific explanations.

401
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,454
Gotta wash up.

402
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:19,842
Late night, huh?

403
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:22,216
Can't sleep.

404
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,551
I bet.

405
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:30,489
Are those your cows?
The ones out there?

406
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,656
Of course.

407
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,761
Who's that with them?

408
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:38,200
Girl from before.

409
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:40,431
Before?

410
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,133
When she made the cows lie down.

411
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,871
Did you see her?

412
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,817
Hey, you know,
that's a really pretty picture.

413
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,954
Do you think maybe I could have it?

414
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:57,113
Okay. I'm drawing a fire truck now.

415
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,555
Thank you.

416
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:11,227
I let you handle things when
the McConnell boy died. Didn't I, Cade?

417
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:13,600
- Yeah.
- And, Doug...

418
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:16,334
When that river turned to blood
where Loren found him...

419
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,705
...I let you handle it, didn't I?
- You did.

420
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,508
No one's done a damn thing.

421
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:23,741
Now this town's living in fear
waiting for the next plague to come.

422
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:26,978
If you're doing your job,
why am I looking at a man's livelihood...

423
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:31,181
...lying dead on the ground not two miles
from where the McConnells live?

424
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:35,523
Now, do I have to bring
this family in myself?

425
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:40,333
How did Brody McConnell die, sheriff?

426
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:43,095
- I don't know.
- What do you know?

427
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,966
Well, I got the call about 2.

428
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,041
The girl found Brody by the river
and he wasn't moving.

429
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,678
Which is where and how he was
when I got there.

430
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:54,144
And there wasn't a mark on him.

431
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:57,443
Somebody just snuck up
and stole the life right out of him.

432
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,210
That doesn't mean Loren did it.

433
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:02,652
Loren, her mother...

434
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:04,791
...or one of their degenerate friends.

435
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,553
There's something unnatural.
I want it stopped. Hear me?

436
00:39:07,728 --> 00:39:10,788
Stopped before God ups and makes
an example out of this whole town.

437
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:13,092
What do you mean by "unnatural"?

438
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:17,966
It was Wake's wife what saw it.

439
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,799
Last Christmas...

440
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:26,441
...Brynn and some of the other ladies
brought cookies out to the McConnells.

441
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,481
Community outreach or something.

442
00:39:30,317 --> 00:39:34,720
Brynn said when she got there, there
was a bunch of motorcycles out front.

443
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:36,618
Then she heard some singing.

444
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,691
More like chanting.

445
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:41,020
Then she stuck her head in the window.

446
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:45,029
She saw something big
butchered in the sink.

447
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,797
It wasn't dead yet.

448
00:39:50,237 --> 00:39:51,568
You didn't think to tell me?

449
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:53,866
It's a rumor.

450
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,941
The worst kind.

451
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:05,344
Brynn don't got the imagination
for it not to be true.

452
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:43,723
Father?

453
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:46,720
Are you all right?

454
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,855
Yes. Thank you, Sister. I'm fine.

455
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:28,635
Come here.

456
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:41,314
There you go.

457
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:52,045
Katherine.

458
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,076
Doug?

459
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:06,085
Hello?

460
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:13,259
Doug?

461
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,181
She seems like a good person.

462
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:49,385
Katherine.

463
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:55,062
The power is out.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

464
00:45:55,235 --> 00:45:57,726
It's probably the breaker. I'll flip it.

465
00:45:57,905 --> 00:46:00,931
It's okay, really.

466
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:02,302
Take your time.

467
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:04,239
At least let me buy you a drink.

468
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:11,049
What is it?

469
00:46:11,218 --> 00:46:12,879
It's local.

470
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:15,954
Some folks think it tastes like bourbon.

471
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,526
Have they ever had bourbon?

472
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:25,560
Yeah.

473
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:29,235
Sam used to clean
her paintbrushes with it.

474
00:46:29,903 --> 00:46:33,532
- How long were you married?
- Seven years.

475
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:35,706
Six of them cancer-free.

476
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:42,371
We wanted a big family and were
trying for our first kid, you know?

477
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,948
She started feeling sick.

478
00:46:44,117 --> 00:46:47,712
Went to the doctor thinking we were
having a boy and came out...

479
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:53,950
I'm sorry.

480
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,732
Still hear her in the kitchen sometimes.

481
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:10,098
- That goes away after a while.
- I'm not sure I want it to.

482
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:14,308
When did you?

483
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:19,612
Five years ago. David and Sarah.

484
00:47:25,158 --> 00:47:27,456
So how'd you pick the Sudan?

485
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:31,496
I had a friend, Michael Costigan,
a priest who ran a camp there.

486
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:33,155
He asked me to come.

487
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:36,769
David, my husband, didn't wanna go,
not with Sarah being so young...

488
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,134
...but I was the one with a calling.

489
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:44,971
I'd just been ordained
and I knew what was best.

490
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:48,876
- You were doing a good thing.
- So I thought.

491
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:53,418
We showed up with our crate of Bibles
and our clean T-shirts...

492
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:57,148
...and our very good intentions.

493
00:47:57,324 --> 00:48:02,455
And then it didn't rain a drop
for a full year.

494
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:08,624
The crops died, the animals died,
the people died.

495
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,201
And they blamed us.

496
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:15,273
My family was murdered
as a sacrifice to God.

497
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:28,010
The first night I stopped praying
was the first night I slept.

498
00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:40,895
I have a lot of work tomorrow.

499
00:50:03,831 --> 00:50:05,765
Loren.

500
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:14,640
Wait.

501
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,187
Katherine, why don't you see
if you can find Sarah?

502
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:52,977
Haman.

503
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:55,171
Sacrificing that animal
won't help your crop.

504
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:10,255
- Hey. I'm so lucky.
- How come?

505
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,558
Because, silly, God gave me you.

506
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:54,899
He's right behind you.

507
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:07,085
Katherine. Katherine, wake up.
Katherine, Katherine, Katherine.

508
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:09,121
Katherine, Katherine.

509
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:12,922
It's Ben, it's Ben, it's Ben.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

510
00:52:16,196 --> 00:52:17,322
I saw her.

511
00:52:17,864 --> 00:52:18,956
Sarah?

512
00:52:22,302 --> 00:52:23,667
Yeah.

513
00:52:23,837 --> 00:52:25,930
Hey, if you wanna get out of here,
we're gone.

514
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,865
I'm fine. I just...

515
00:52:29,977 --> 00:52:31,968
I just thought I was...

516
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:34,238
...through with some of this stuff.

517
00:52:34,414 --> 00:52:38,111
Come here, Katherine. Come here.

518
00:52:40,988 --> 00:52:42,387
It's all right.

519
00:52:45,025 --> 00:52:47,687
I'm sorry...

520
00:52:47,861 --> 00:52:49,692
...about before, in the pasture.
- No.

521
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:52,764
You know...

522
00:52:52,933 --> 00:52:57,597
...God protects his children
even if they don't know it yet.

523
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:01,696
Get some sleep.

524
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:22,310
Caught me snooping.

525
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:25,287
Yeah. Kind of hard to snoop
in your own house.

526
00:54:25,459 --> 00:54:26,448
What is that?

527
00:54:26,626 --> 00:54:30,653
That is a healthy bovine cell.
Strong walls. Good color.

528
00:54:30,831 --> 00:54:32,458
And then...

529
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:36,264
...comes Pfiesteria.
- And that's from the Wakemans' cattle?

530
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:39,428
Nope. That's just it.

531
00:54:39,606 --> 00:54:40,937
But this...

532
00:54:42,142 --> 00:54:44,406
- This is.
- Well, that looks fine to me.

533
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:46,873
Yeah, it is.

534
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:49,607
Biologically, there's nothing wrong
with those cows...

535
00:54:49,783 --> 00:54:52,809
...or the flies, or the frogs, or the fish.

536
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:56,683
Sheriff said pretty much the same thing
about Brody McConnell.

537
00:54:56,857 --> 00:54:58,757
- There been an autopsy?
- Not yet.

538
00:54:58,925 --> 00:55:02,588
- We've been told to wait on the coroner.
- Yeah, well, maybe we shouldn't.

539
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,391
- I'll get Katherine.
- No. She left this morning.

540
00:55:05,565 --> 00:55:08,659
- She went to the McConnells' house.
- You let her go alone?

541
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:12,134
I don't let her do anything.
I'm lucky I get the computer.

542
00:55:58,318 --> 00:55:59,580
Mrs. McConnell?

543
00:55:59,753 --> 00:56:01,516
Loren?

544
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:04,953
Hello? Anyone home?

545
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:30,775
Hello?

546
00:57:52,465 --> 00:57:54,433
Loren.

547
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:56,193
You scared me.

548
00:57:56,670 --> 00:58:00,037
Remember me, from the woods?

549
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:01,935
My name's Katherine.

550
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:06,200
Is your mother here?

551
00:58:12,085 --> 00:58:14,315
You found it.

552
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:17,256
It's okay.

553
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:18,413
Really.

554
00:58:18,591 --> 00:58:22,687
It was my daughter's.
But you can have it.

555
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,966
Hey, Loren. How old are you?

556
00:58:35,442 --> 00:58:37,706
Let's get you cleaned up.

557
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:40,175
It's okay. Come on.

558
00:58:59,332 --> 00:59:02,460
That's your body's way
of telling you that...

559
00:59:03,203 --> 00:59:07,071
Well, that you're becoming a woman.

560
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:14,207
Yeah, it kind of freaked me out too.

561
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:32,059
Hey, Loren...

562
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:37,269
...do you know what's wrong
with the river?

563
00:59:37,437 --> 00:59:38,563
Loren!

564
01:00:22,315 --> 01:00:24,249
Loren?

565
01:01:12,699 --> 01:01:15,497
You here for my girl?

566
01:01:16,569 --> 01:01:19,970
Are you going to kill...

567
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:21,367
...my baby girl?

568
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:25,643
What? No.

569
01:01:26,846 --> 01:01:27,835
Why not?

570
01:01:32,685 --> 01:01:34,380
I'm only trying to help her.

571
01:01:34,554 --> 01:01:37,546
She don't need any help.

572
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:40,920
Don't you get that?

573
01:01:46,032 --> 01:01:48,626
What? Mrs. McConnell.

574
01:01:49,202 --> 01:01:51,500
What happened to your son?

575
01:01:53,106 --> 01:01:56,564
How did he die?

576
01:01:56,743 --> 01:01:59,678
He didn't know any better.

577
01:02:01,214 --> 01:02:03,375
I couldn't get there in time.

578
01:02:04,817 --> 01:02:07,786
Brody was so fast...

579
01:02:18,331 --> 01:02:20,060
- You see?
- I was just trying...

580
01:02:20,233 --> 01:02:23,430
Get out. Just get out.

581
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:35,880
Wait.

582
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:37,605
Doug?

583
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:21,585
There, there, now. It's gonna
be all right. It'll grow back.

584
01:03:21,761 --> 01:03:25,754
Doug. The whole time you been here,
have we ever had a lice outbreak?

585
01:03:25,932 --> 01:03:27,297
Not as far as I can remember.

586
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:31,563
Don't you think it's getting kind of old to
keep chalking everything up to coincidence?

587
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:36,698
And you. We were told we were gonna get
some definite answers out of you by now.

588
01:03:36,876 --> 01:03:39,436
Trying to work it out.
Trying to tie this to one source.

589
01:03:39,612 --> 01:03:40,601
Let me save some time.

590
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,544
She's 5 foot tall, blond,
and she lives out in the swamp...

591
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:45,843
...with them devil worshippers.
- Yes, she is.

592
01:03:46,019 --> 01:03:48,817
- That's right. You tell them.
- Messing this town up.

593
01:03:48,988 --> 01:03:51,957
- Let's go see the McConnell boy?
- Yeah.

594
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:53,990
Later.

595
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,684
- What?
- It's okay.

596
01:03:55,862 --> 01:03:57,329
Hey.

597
01:03:57,497 --> 01:03:59,965
Where exactly is lice on the list?

598
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:01,225
Five.

599
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:41,668
<i>Katherine, you copy?</i>

600
01:04:41,841 --> 01:04:44,366
- Hey. Are you there?
- You find the girl?

601
01:04:44,544 --> 01:04:46,808
I found her.

602
01:04:46,979 --> 01:04:49,311
<i>And?</i>

603
01:04:49,482 --> 01:04:51,916
<i>Where are you?</i>

604
01:04:52,085 --> 01:04:54,417
We're about to meet her brother.

605
01:04:59,425 --> 01:05:02,258
Katherine, you are gonna wanna see this.

606
01:05:09,902 --> 01:05:12,598
You shouldn't have gone out there alone.
You all right?

607
01:05:13,873 --> 01:05:15,465
I don't know.

608
01:05:15,641 --> 01:05:17,233
Listen.

609
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:20,436
I know logically and rationally
you and I agree.

610
01:05:20,613 --> 01:05:22,808
- Okay.
- But there's things going on now.

611
01:05:22,982 --> 01:05:25,109
Things in there.

612
01:05:25,718 --> 01:05:27,276
You just better prepare yourself.

613
01:05:33,626 --> 01:05:35,116
This is Brody McConnell?

614
01:05:36,629 --> 01:05:40,588
Funeral home backs up Cade. Three
days ago he was in perfect condition.

615
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:43,634
- Cause of death unknown.
- Yeah, and it's gonna stay that way.

616
01:05:43,803 --> 01:05:46,328
I mean, we're already
in the dry stages of decomp here.

617
01:05:46,506 --> 01:05:50,966
You don't see this on a body until they're
like one or two years in the grave.

618
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:57,006
What the hell is that?

619
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:05,981
- Call the FBI. Shut them down.
- No. We're past the police here.

620
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:09,560
- This is a cult, plain and simple.
- Well, what about the plagues?

621
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:13,062
They killed one child. Do we wanna
stand around while they kill another?

622
01:06:13,232 --> 01:06:15,291
- Sheriff, we need to talk.
- We sure do.

623
01:06:15,468 --> 01:06:16,696
- This just came.
- I need...

624
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:19,167
Just read it.

625
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,229
What is it?

626
01:06:22,408 --> 01:06:23,773
It's a lab result.

627
01:06:23,943 --> 01:06:27,003
Yeah, from the water samples we sent in.

628
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:41,488
It's human blood.

629
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:43,686
The whole damn river.

630
01:06:43,863 --> 01:06:45,694
That's a two-mile stretch of river.

631
01:06:45,865 --> 01:06:49,494
That's damn near 2,
300,000 bodies' worth of blood.

632
01:06:49,669 --> 01:06:52,832
- Could these reports be wrong?
- No.

633
01:06:53,005 --> 01:06:54,404
I need to make a call.

634
01:06:56,876 --> 01:06:57,865
Hello?

635
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:02,605
Where you headed, Cade?

636
01:07:02,782 --> 01:07:05,615
- The McConnells'. Where do you think?
- We need to evacuate.

637
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:07,719
Loren McConnell isn't going anywhere.

638
01:07:07,887 --> 01:07:09,286
These people are in danger.

639
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:18,221
- Only the mayor can authorize evacuation.
- Where is he?

640
01:07:18,397 --> 01:07:21,560
I need to know what to do
before this little girl is murdered.

641
01:07:21,734 --> 01:07:25,864
<i>The symbol you're seeing is part
of a prophecy that predates Christ...</i>

642
01:07:26,038 --> 01:07:28,529
...which tells of an ancient satanic sect.

643
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:33,975
Their first-born are branded and left
unharmed to carry on the genetic line.

644
01:07:34,146 --> 01:07:37,115
<i>But all of the second-born thereafter
are to be sacrificed.</i>

645
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:43,051
- Sacrificed to please Satan?
- It happens when the child reaches puberty.

646
01:07:43,222 --> 01:07:45,156
Puberty? But that can't be right.

647
01:07:45,324 --> 01:07:49,124
This little girl, Loren, she's a second-born,
and if she is a part of this cult...

648
01:07:49,295 --> 01:07:51,160
...why hasn't she been sacrificed yet?

649
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,094
Wait. Yes, it says here:

650
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:58,328
"For all their sacrifice,
they shall reap a perfect child...

651
01:07:58,504 --> 01:08:02,270
<i>...a second-born,
who upon coming into adulthood...</i>

652
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:05,308
...shall be reborn with the eyes of Satan. "

653
01:08:05,478 --> 01:08:08,606
So you're saying this girl is the one
they've been trying to create?

654
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:11,750
Yes. A child in Satan's image.

655
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:14,011
But what does this
have to do with plagues?

656
01:08:14,186 --> 01:08:17,053
<i>Lucifer has often turned God's
weapons against the righteous.</i>

657
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:18,622
He's protecting the girl.

658
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:21,492
If you'd seen this girl,
you couldn't be...

659
01:08:21,661 --> 01:08:25,995
I understand your compassion.
But this girl...

660
01:08:26,165 --> 01:08:28,827
You've already seen the evil
she's capable of.

661
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:32,835
<i>You're in great danger, Katherine.
Everyone is.</i>

662
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:34,996
This girl could be the beginning.

663
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:39,368
<i>Haven could be the start of it all.</i>

664
01:08:39,545 --> 01:08:41,445
Hello?

665
01:08:54,327 --> 01:08:55,316
Brooks?

666
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:04,902
And there shall be boils breaking forth
upon man and upon beast.

667
01:09:12,278 --> 01:09:14,143
<i>"At the height of their power...</i>

668
01:09:14,313 --> 01:09:17,680
...God shall send forth an angel
to destroy them. "

669
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:19,408
Perhaps this angel is you.

670
01:09:19,585 --> 01:09:21,883
<i>- I don't think so, Michael.
- You don't understand.</i>

671
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:26,423
"Angel" can sometimes be a metaphor
for people of the cloth, the ordained.

672
01:09:26,592 --> 01:09:30,892
The cult will be powerless against you.
You could stop them.

673
01:09:31,063 --> 01:09:35,864
No. It's a convoluted, contradictory,
nonsensical legend. It's not a prophecy.

674
01:09:36,035 --> 01:09:39,664
You're telling me to join a bloodthirsty
crowd and lynch a 12-year-old girl.

675
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,397
What if God has chosen you...

676
01:09:41,574 --> 01:09:44,873
...and the girl is in fact a channel
for the Fallen One?

677
01:09:45,044 --> 01:09:48,013
<i>- You must destroy her.
- Lf you're wrong, an innocent child dies.</i>

678
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,581
And if I'm right, many more will die.
The symbol is your proof.

679
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:55,414
<i>Branded on their first-born,
protecting their places of worship...</i>

680
01:09:55,588 --> 01:09:57,556
...marked on their sacrificial chambers.

681
01:09:57,723 --> 01:10:01,625
You've seen it. Open the door, Katherine,
and you'll believe it.

682
01:10:01,794 --> 01:10:03,386
You'll know.

683
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:09,624
You've gotta destroy her, Katherine!

684
01:10:13,272 --> 01:10:15,399
Michael. Michael?

685
01:10:21,414 --> 01:10:22,779
Help!

686
01:10:38,531 --> 01:10:41,989
Help! Help!

687
01:10:42,168 --> 01:10:44,363
Help!

688
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:51,132
Guns can't solve this, Gordon.

689
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:52,641
Is that right?

690
01:10:52,812 --> 01:10:54,143
Don't forget the shells.

691
01:10:54,313 --> 01:10:56,747
- I'm not going without.
- Shouldn't be going at all.

692
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:59,316
- Let me tell you...
- Just leave him out of this.

693
01:10:59,485 --> 01:11:02,454
- The car's gone and so is Katherine.
- Shit.

694
01:11:03,622 --> 01:11:06,591
You're gonna do this?
You really think you can kill that girl?

695
01:11:06,759 --> 01:11:09,284
I'm gonna do what needs to be done.

696
01:11:09,462 --> 01:11:12,488
Gordon, you watch him out there,
all right?

697
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:01,228
Loren?

698
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,445
Where's your daughter?

699
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:14,316
- I didn't understand what would happen.
- Tell me where she is.

700
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:18,220
She's gone over.

701
01:13:20,059 --> 01:13:21,583
What?

702
01:13:22,228 --> 01:13:24,822
He controls her now.

703
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:29,634
Whatever he wants...

704
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:34,070
...she does.

705
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:39,276
My part's done.

706
01:13:45,417 --> 01:13:46,406
No.

707
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:49,911
- I failed.
- I failed too.

708
01:13:59,465 --> 01:14:00,454
No.

709
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:08,906
I imagine there's...

710
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:10,200
...something after.

711
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:16,503
Wait.

712
01:15:20,446 --> 01:15:22,073
<i>Katherine? Do you copy?</i>

713
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:24,081
Katherine.

714
01:15:24,249 --> 01:15:25,477
Nothing.

715
01:17:20,966 --> 01:17:23,332
What are we gonna do, Dad?

716
01:17:26,004 --> 01:17:28,973
We're gonna do
what we come out here to do, boy.

717
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:31,234
Gordon.

718
01:18:00,172 --> 01:18:01,161
Katherine!

719
01:18:02,374 --> 01:18:06,834
Katherine! Get inside! Get inside!

720
01:18:11,884 --> 01:18:14,682
Dad!

721
01:18:18,323 --> 01:18:19,915
Doug!

722
01:19:46,845 --> 01:19:48,005
Ben?

723
01:19:49,715 --> 01:19:51,046
Katherine.

724
01:19:51,216 --> 01:19:54,481
<i>Are you okay? Where are you?</i>

725
01:19:54,653 --> 01:19:56,883
I'm in some sort of a crypt.

726
01:19:57,055 --> 01:19:59,819
By the ruins? Where's Doug?

727
01:20:00,525 --> 01:20:01,890
He's still out there.

728
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,995
I'm so sorry. I was so wrong.

729
01:20:05,163 --> 01:20:07,563
Katherine, look, forget about it.

730
01:20:07,733 --> 01:20:11,191
Let's just get out of here
before the final three plagues.

731
01:20:40,165 --> 01:20:41,154
<i>Ben?</i>

732
01:20:43,235 --> 01:20:46,830
Katherine. There are bodies of children
hanging down here.

733
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:56,206
Wait a second.

734
01:20:57,582 --> 01:21:02,451
They're all children. They're all children.

735
01:21:03,922 --> 01:21:08,723
Get out of there now. Meet me at
the truck. And please be careful.

736
01:21:49,401 --> 01:21:51,369
<i>Katherine.</i>

737
01:21:52,237 --> 01:21:53,670
Ben.

738
01:21:53,839 --> 01:21:56,740
<i>She's outside. I'm trapped.</i>

739
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:05,607
Okay. Okay. I gotta find...

740
01:22:05,784 --> 01:22:07,274
I gotta find another way out.

741
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,517
Ben?

742
01:22:22,701 --> 01:22:24,635
Ben?

743
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:27,365
No, no, no. No.

744
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:29,764
Ben?

745
01:22:43,288 --> 01:22:46,951
It's me. I didn't mean to scare you.

746
01:22:52,297 --> 01:22:53,525
I saw her out there.

747
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,991
I had to hide in the swamp.

748
01:22:59,137 --> 01:23:00,695
What are we gonna do, huh?

749
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:06,001
You stay here.

750
01:23:06,178 --> 01:23:08,942
She trusts me.

751
01:23:09,114 --> 01:23:11,548
I have to end this.

752
01:25:03,862 --> 01:25:05,830
Hi.

753
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:14,166
I used to have a little girl
who looked just like you.

754
01:25:14,539 --> 01:25:18,635
I wanna take you away from here. Okay?

755
01:25:25,317 --> 01:25:26,375
Just be still.

756
01:25:31,623 --> 01:25:32,988
I'm so lucky.

757
01:25:34,025 --> 01:25:35,492
Why?

758
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:37,025
Because, silly...

759
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:38,355
God gave me you.

760
01:25:39,998 --> 01:25:41,295
God gave me you.

761
01:25:43,368 --> 01:25:46,166
How do I know?

762
01:25:46,338 --> 01:25:48,533
How do we know what's real?

763
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:55,644
Faith.

764
01:25:56,414 --> 01:25:58,041
Mama, stop!

765
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:02,547
Hold still.

766
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,022
Brody, go!

767
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,825
Loren!

768
01:27:01,079 --> 01:27:03,047
<i>"At the height of their power...</i>

769
01:27:03,214 --> 01:27:08,311
<i>...God shall send forth an angel
to destroy them. "</i>

770
01:27:26,171 --> 01:27:28,901
She's tricked you, hasn't she?

771
01:27:29,074 --> 01:27:32,532
She's perverting your faith
through lies now.

772
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:35,838
That's how Satan works, you know?

773
01:27:36,014 --> 01:27:37,311
Now, please, you kill her.

774
01:27:37,482 --> 01:27:41,316
I'm a first-born.
And you know what plague comes next.

775
01:27:41,486 --> 01:27:46,287
<i>Their first-born are branded and left
unharmed to carry on the genetic line.</i>

776
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:49,655
I come from a long line of only children.

777
01:27:51,029 --> 01:27:53,691
- It's number two for both of us.
- Know what you're having?

778
01:27:53,865 --> 01:27:55,423
Heck, doesn't matter to me.

779
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,933
Are you gonna kill my baby girl?

780
01:27:59,104 --> 01:28:00,366
<i>No.</i>

781
01:28:00,538 --> 01:28:02,005
Why not?

782
01:28:02,707 --> 01:28:05,540
Katherine, please kill her
before it's too late.

783
01:28:10,815 --> 01:28:12,646
You do it.

784
01:28:16,621 --> 01:28:18,020
You can't do it, can you?

785
01:28:18,189 --> 01:28:20,282
Because you already tried
and she survived.

786
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:21,447
No, that's not true.

787
01:28:21,626 --> 01:28:24,527
You deceived me so I would murder her.

788
01:28:27,165 --> 01:28:29,565
This innocent child.

789
01:28:29,734 --> 01:28:31,361
She's not innocent, Katherine.

790
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:34,797
Look what she's done already.

791
01:28:34,973 --> 01:28:36,804
You're seeing with your own eyes.

792
01:28:39,077 --> 01:28:40,908
You killed Ben...

793
01:28:43,581 --> 01:28:46,482
...so I would blame her.

794
01:28:48,386 --> 01:28:49,978
<i>She's outside.</i>

795
01:28:50,155 --> 01:28:54,023
Okay. Okay. I gotta find...

796
01:28:54,192 --> 01:28:57,650
I gotta find another way out of here.

797
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,489
Come on.

798
01:29:15,813 --> 01:29:18,373
The whole of Haven
used to pray to God on this spot.

799
01:29:19,551 --> 01:29:23,510
You know how he answered their prayers?
With floods and devastation.

800
01:29:23,688 --> 01:29:27,180
He abandoned them,
so they abandoned God.

801
01:29:27,358 --> 01:29:32,022
My family introduced them
to the true Lord.

802
01:29:32,197 --> 01:29:35,132
A powerful Lord,
who hears his people's prayers.

803
01:29:36,935 --> 01:29:42,032
You were ordained and you turned
your back on God just like we did.

804
01:29:42,207 --> 01:29:43,367
That's why we chose you.

805
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:46,908
Only a servant of God can kill his angel.

806
01:29:47,712 --> 01:29:51,910
You remember what your God
did to you in the Sudan?

807
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:55,246
What about your daughter, huh?

808
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,684
Now that...

809
01:29:59,224 --> 01:30:00,953
...that is your God.

810
01:30:03,595 --> 01:30:05,722
Katherine.

811
01:30:07,665 --> 01:30:09,895
That's not God.

812
01:30:10,068 --> 01:30:12,195
God didn't kill my family.

813
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:16,568
A weak, godless man
filled with fear and hatred...

814
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:18,800
...a man like you.

815
01:30:18,977 --> 01:30:22,504
There's still that last plague, Doug.

816
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,147
The death of the first-born.

817
01:30:28,086 --> 01:30:31,852
And you come from a long line
of only children.

818
01:30:34,025 --> 01:30:35,151
You all do.

819
01:30:44,669 --> 01:30:46,227
No!

820
01:30:57,282 --> 01:31:00,513
- Now you tell her to stop or you die too.
- Loren.

821
01:31:02,553 --> 01:31:06,751
Don't be scared. It's God's will.

822
01:32:33,911 --> 01:32:37,472
It's okay. It's all right. Don't be scared.

823
01:32:37,648 --> 01:32:38,706
It's okay.

824
01:32:40,752 --> 01:32:44,244
Everything's gonna be okay. I promise.

825
01:32:45,289 --> 01:32:47,484
It's just the two of us now.

826
01:32:47,658 --> 01:32:50,320
And we're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

827
01:32:53,131 --> 01:32:55,599
What about the boy?

828
01:32:56,968 --> 01:32:58,458
What boy?

829
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:02,403
The boy inside you. Your baby.

830
01:33:02,573 --> 01:33:04,302
I can hear him.

831
01:33:04,475 --> 01:33:07,672
We'll have to take care of him too.

832
01:33:11,082 --> 01:33:15,348
<i>"For all their sacrifice,
they shall reap a perfect child... "</i>

833
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,919
Let me buy you a drink.

834
01:33:17,088 --> 01:33:20,683
<i>"... a second-born,
who upon coming into adulthood...</i>

835
01:33:20,858 --> 01:33:24,555
<i>...shall be reborn with the eyes of Satan. "</i>
