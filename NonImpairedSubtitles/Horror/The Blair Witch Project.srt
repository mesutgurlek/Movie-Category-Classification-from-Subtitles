1
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:33,790
In October of 1994,
three student filmmakers...

2
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:37,294
...disappeared in the woods near
Burkittsville, Maryland,...

3
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:39,254
...while shooting a documentary.

4
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:41,965
A year later
their footage was found.

5
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,806
- It's already recording...
- Okay.

6
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:51,892
This is my home...

7
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:54,936
- You look blurry. I'll zoom out.
- Okay.

8
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:56,730
Good morning.

9
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:58,565
- Got it ?
- Okay, I got it.

10
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:00,150
This is my home,...

11
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,737
...which I am leaving for the weekend...

12
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:06,615
...to investigate the Blair Witch.

13
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,868
Essential reading: "How to Stay
Alive in the Woods",...

14
00:01:10,077 --> 00:01:11,703
...'cause you never know what's
gonna happen.

15
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,538
And this is an important book...

16
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:17,042
...because it has the article about what
happened at Coffin Rock.

17
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:17,959
It looks pretty old...

18
00:01:18,126 --> 00:01:20,420
It's totally old.
And this is my field notebook.

19
00:01:20,587 --> 00:01:23,215
It's Mr. Punctuality.

20
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,468
How are you this morning ?

21
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:27,552
Tired.

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,221
So I got the CP up.

23
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:30,097
Good.

24
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:33,892
That's what we're shooting on.

25
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:36,395
No one knows I took it,
but I got it.

26
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:39,106
Come into the house. Come on.

27
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:42,109
I can see you.

28
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:45,988
We're not gonna bump into shit,
I'm going backwards now.

29
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:48,115
We mustn't fuck up the cameras.

30
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,075
So where's Mikey ?

31
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,035
- We have to go get him.
- Okay.

32
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:53,161
At 8:30.

33
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,204
Okay.

34
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:57,165
We're already behind schedule, but
it's important to have juice.

35
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,166
That's cool.

36
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,960
I guess you're Mike !

37
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:03,630
Wait. Stop.

38
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,720
Don't we get to meet your Mama ?

39
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:15,684
See you later, Mom !

40
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:18,395
How are you, Mike ?

41
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:19,730
I'm tired but I'm fine.

42
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:22,399
I'm real excited about this.
Thank you for the opportunity.

43
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:25,277
I'm very glad. Thanks for
getting the equipment together.

44
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:27,654
We've got enough
battery power to...

45
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,282
..fuel a small country for a month.

46
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:33,869
We've got rice, fruit punch...

47
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:36,246
Oatmeal Raisin, baby.

48
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,457
The ultimate campfood.

49
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,210
Feel how soft.

50
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:48,634
- Marshmallows...
- Hey, you weasel. Out of my cart !

51
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:55,599
Do you believe in ghosts ?

52
00:02:55,932 --> 00:02:57,976
Ever heard of the Blair Witch ?

53
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:04,650
Sounds familiar.
My sister went to Blair High School.

54
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:09,154
The woods around Halloween
are creepy.

55
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:12,824
- Can you tell me a little more ?
- I don't wanna go cheesy.

56
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,994
I want to present
this straightforward.

57
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:18,372
The legend is unsettling.

58
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,165
Wanna get the...

59
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,418
...ceremonial first slate ?

60
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,962
Absolutely.

61
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:31,301
The first slate for our
first shot.

62
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:35,597
Should we get our fingers open
and bleed on it ?

63
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,432
A little blood-letting ?

64
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,017
No, we'll save that for later.

65
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:41,019
Kiss the slate.

66
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,855
It's the first slate.

67
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,899
Marked by my lipstick.

68
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,694
Mikey, kiss it, good luck.

69
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,904
- There we go.
- Oh, he licked it. Bless him.

70
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,990
Don't eat it. We're gonna need it.

71
00:03:53,657 --> 00:03:56,827
This is Burkittsville,
formerly Blair.

72
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:00,288
A small quiet Maryland town.

73
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:03,375
Like a small, quiet town anywhere.

74
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:08,130
Some 20 families laid roots here
over 200 years ago.

75
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,800
Many remain, either on this hill...

76
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,136
...or in the town below.

77
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:18,932
An unusually high number of
children are buried here...

78
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,643
...most of whom passed
in the 1 940's.

79
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:26,606
Yet no one here recalls anything
unusual about this time,...

80
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,734
...not to us, anyway.

81
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,028
Yet legend tells
A different story,...

82
00:04:31,278 --> 00:04:33,572
...whose evidence is all around us.

83
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:35,907
Etched in stone.

84
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:46,293
We have shot the first scene,
the cemetery scene.

85
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,337
The opening is shot.

86
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:52,299
We're doing a documentary
about the Blair Witch.

87
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:57,262
- Have you heard of the Witch ?
- That's an old, old story.

88
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:58,639
As I remember,...

89
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:01,933
...Mr. Parr was an old hermit,...

90
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:06,146
...and he lived up on a mountain.
He'd been there,...

91
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:07,689
...for a long, long, time.

92
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:10,067
- You heard of the Blair Witch ?
- Several times.

93
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:12,527
What was the first incident ?

94
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:16,365
I've heard stories about it
from people and neighbors,

95
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:19,743
I also saw a documentary on the
television...

96
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:23,246
...about her and legends
of Maryland,...

97
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:27,084
...my grandmother told us the story
to make us go to bed early.

98
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,671
They say if you stay up after dark
or walk around the house...

99
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,381
...the Blair witch will get you.

100
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:36,885
In the fall or winter of 1 940,...

101
00:05:37,094 --> 00:05:40,180
...some young kids
started disappearing.

102
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,099
Nobody knew...

103
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,018
...why they were disappearing.

104
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:50,440
- A kind of an omen, isn't it ?
- The creepiest story about her...

105
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,402
...was that two men out hunting...

106
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:57,197
...camped near the cabin
she's supposed to haunt...

107
00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:58,115
No. No.

108
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,534
...and they just disappeared
forever.

109
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:04,287
I'm just telling a scary story,
but it's not true.

110
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:05,330
It's not true.

111
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:08,834
One day, old Mr. Parr
came into the market...

112
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:11,294
...and said "I'm finally finished".

113
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:12,462
And what did he mean by that ?

114
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,297
Nobody knew at first...

115
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,466
But the police finally...

116
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,218
went up the mountain...

117
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:23,181
...and found the bodies of seven
kids in his house.

118
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,977
He would take the kids down
to the basement in twos...

119
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:29,438
...and he'd make one
face the corner...

120
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,232
...and he'd kill the other one...

121
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,819
...then he'd kill the one in
the corner too.

122
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:37,779
Those were the seven kids
that were missing

123
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:40,949
They brought the kids out of
the woods one at a time...

124
00:06:41,116 --> 00:06:44,369
...it was terrible, it upset
the whole community.

125
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,455
He said he couldn't take
the eyes watching him...

126
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:50,542
...that's why he made them
face the corner like that.

127
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,586
All my life I've believed...

128
00:06:52,753 --> 00:06:55,464
...in witches and ghosts and
that kind of stuff

129
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,466
Do you believe there are some
in this area ?

130
00:06:57,674 --> 00:06:58,342
Oh, definitely.

131
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,510
- Do you believe in witchcraft ?
- No.

132
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,680
- Are you religious ?
- Yep.

133
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:04,806
Alrighty.

134
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:09,144
Creepy stuff, but I think
something's happening with her.

135
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,688
And do you think she could
still be up there now ?

136
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:13,649
- I don't go up there.
- You don't ?

137
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:15,192
I believe enough not to go.

138
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:18,737
They say the woods are haunted
and stuff like that.

139
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:20,697
What ? How are they haunted ?

140
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:24,993
Well there's not many people
who say that it's haunted...

141
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,537
...but there was this old woman,
Mary Brown, who...

142
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:28,747
Mary Brown ?

143
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:31,041
Yeah, and she was kind of crazy.

144
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,126
How was she seen by the community ?

145
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:33,960
Crazy.

146
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:38,215
There's the American flag,
it's Mary's house.

147
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,050
I'm gonna bring her out.

148
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,386
You look for the best light, okay ?

149
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:43,178
Okay.

150
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:48,558
This is Mary's gate.

151
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,312
I'm not even sure how to open it.

152
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,400
And something interesting
happened to you once...

153
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:58,694
You met the Blair witch ?

154
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:00,320
Yes.

155
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:01,738
That is really...

156
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:04,449
...kind of a scary story.

157
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,785
To make ends meet...

158
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,578
...my Dad and I

159
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,039
...used to fish at Tappy's Creek.

160
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:14,251
In Burkittsville.

161
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:17,671
I was laying on the leaves...

162
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,383
...watching my pole, and
looking at the sky...

163
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,846
...and suddenly I felt
something near me...

164
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:28,140
...an eerie feeling...

165
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,851
...It was a woman...

166
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,729
...only on her
arms and hands...

167
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,772
...and everything...

168
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,524
...she had hair...

169
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:40,610
...dark, almost black hair...

170
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,779
...like a horse...

171
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,407
...like a fur, horse fur.

172
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:46,950
Then on her arm...

173
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,077
...she had a shawl...

174
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,913
And she scared you,
or threatened you ?

175
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:56,168
She didn't say anything,
she just stared...

176
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:58,253
...and then she opened her shawl...

177
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:00,047
What was under there ?

178
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:03,216
She had hair on her
body like a horse.

179
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:04,676
Hairy from head to toe ?

180
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:07,262
Yeah. And her legs...

181
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:10,599
- How about her face ?
- You could see she was a female.

182
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:13,685
She was just strange looking.

183
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:16,897
Thank God she's
not in the film business.

184
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:20,275
She thinks she is.
She also says she's a ballerina.

185
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:21,568
Get out.

186
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,570
And she says she's a historian...

187
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:24,571
I heard that.

188
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,032
...and that she's a scientist
at the Department of Energy.

189
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,410
I fucked up on Mary
with the depth of field.

190
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,372
You measured it in meters ?
We're not in Europe.

191
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,999
The fucking lens
has meters on it.

192
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:38,627
It also has our system.

193
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:42,130
Nah, it has meters. Look.

194
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,093
But it's an American camera.

195
00:09:46,301 --> 00:09:47,636
All those are meters.

196
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:49,638
What about the brown ones ?

197
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:50,889
They're feet.

198
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:52,849
The brown ones are on there, right ?

199
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:55,686
Yeah, but the white
ones are obvious.

200
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:59,648
- Didn't you use this camera before ?
- Yeah. Once before.

201
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,817
How was today, guys ?

202
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,736
I learned a lot, man.

203
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,697
About Mary Brown ?

204
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:09,533
No, I learned a lot about...

205
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,368
1 6 mill ?

206
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,329
...about shooting, just
shooting documentaries.

207
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,416
- We kicked some ass today.
- Cheers.

208
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,959
Very good day.

209
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:19,835
Excellent day.

210
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,294
Very good first day.

211
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:25,007
Let's do an equipment check,
after I call my mom.

212
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:28,302
- I got a bag of Utz and a beer.
- We don't need that on film.

213
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:30,429
So I guess you're covered then.

214
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:34,224
Could you run it a little
to check it's okay ?

215
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:35,600
Sure.

216
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:39,646
I just want to check it's loaded
properly so we can shoot...

217
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,692
Okay, that's good, that's good.

218
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:46,028
That's good, thank you.

219
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,281
Let's relax, because we've got
a long day tomorrow.

220
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,742
Today's been easy.

221
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,578
We're gonna have to do a lot
of hiking, carry a lot of weight.

222
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,204
We're preparing.

223
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,624
Shut up, smartass.
Pour me a shot, please.

224
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,462
- I'm freaking out.
- You can't, you're the director.

225
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,507
I fucking have to do this now,
okay ? Do we have any weed ?

226
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,968
Here I go.

227
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:12,471
Drink ! Drink !

228
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,267
I hate fucking scotch.

229
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:25,233
There's my friend Josh.

230
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:26,943
How are you ?

231
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,028
I'm hurtin'.

232
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:30,113
I'm not ready for that thing yet.

233
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:31,990
I know you don't like it.

234
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,411
Hello. Welcome to day two.

235
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:38,914
The trail is along here.

236
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:41,625
It should be pretty obvious.

237
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:45,003
You guys heard of
the Blair witch ?

238
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:48,048
I heard the myth. I don't
really believe much in it.

239
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,174
The myth ?

240
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:51,009
That's all I think it is.

241
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:52,302
What'd you say, sir ?

242
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,846
- I said damn fool kids never learn.
- Shut up.

243
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:56,598
Damn fool kids never learn ?

244
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:57,516
That's what I said.

245
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,017
Why do you say that ?

246
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,520
First of all, can I
have your permission...

247
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:04,481
...to use your image on a
video documentary ?

248
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,858
I don't care about that, but...

249
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,860
You have to say yes or no, sir,

250
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:10,404
- Watch it.
- I'm sorry.

251
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,321
Yeah, sure, okay.

252
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:15,200
Some girl, in the late 1 800's...

253
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,995
...Robin Weaver, I
believe her name was,...

254
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:22,165
...supposedly wandered
off into the woods.

255
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,502
No "supposedly" about it.
She wandered off !

256
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,629
- Okay, wandered off.
- And got lost.

257
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:28,922
She got lost.

258
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,133
Wasn't no "supposedly".

259
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,385
Three days later...

260
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:36,847
...she appears back on her
grandmother's porch.

261
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:40,684
And everybody's mystified.

262
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,603
- She was babbling something...
- Her story.

263
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:46,023
Babbling something about...

264
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:48,817
...an old woman whose feet
never touched the ground.

265
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:54,364
I saw.. just by that
tree up the creek...

266
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,867
...about a hundred yards,

267
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,330
I saw a white misty thing.
Can't tell you what it was.

268
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:04,708
Like grey vapor rising
out of the trees.

269
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,335
Right out of the water.

270
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:07,461
Right out of the water ?

271
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:10,047
Up the side of the trees,
Then it disappeared.

272
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:11,715
You're full of it.

273
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,009
I'm not. And I wasn't
drinking that day, either.

274
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:15,052
Sure you weren't.

275
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,220
How is that related to the
story of Coffin Rock ?

276
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,973
It all ties in to the
story of Coffin Rock.

277
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,807
How's that ?

278
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:25,312
Anybody round here...

279
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,523
...knows that the old woman has
haunted this area for years.

280
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,150
That's bullshit.

281
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,905
These woods are thick.

282
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,782
You excited ?

283
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:38,742
You got it.

284
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:42,412
I hope he's not shooting a
whole shitload of stock.

285
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,937
I could help, but I'd
rather record.

286
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:07,896
Okay.

287
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:10,941
Packs on, we're ready to go.

288
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,985
We gotta go up to the shack ?

289
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:13,944
Yeah.

290
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:23,203
My God, this is a very heavy pack.

291
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:28,709
Off to Coffin Rock.

292
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,836
I know exactly where we are now.

293
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,046
Mikey, give me the video camera.

294
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,465
I wanna get her going across, man.

295
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:41,263
I see a dirty behind.

296
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,435
Good jump.

297
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,269
Thank you.

298
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,146
There it is. See ?

299
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:52,566
That's Coffin Rock.

300
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:59,614
"They went into the woods
ready to find death...

301
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,825
...but what they found
was inhumane...

302
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,911
...at the site called Coffin Rock.

303
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:07,706
...up on the rock, the torture...

304
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:11,251
...suffered by these five
brave men was obvious...

305
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:15,422
...they were tied up, one man's
hands tied to the next man's feet...

306
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,591
...forming a solid
human structure...

307
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:20,719
...blood indicated that
it had happened...

308
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,639
...while they were
alive and resisting...

309
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,309
...their intestines had been
crudely torn out...

310
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:31,563
...and on each of their faces there
was indecipherable writing...

311
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,857
...cut into their flesh
with precision...

312
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,818
...the men, shocked by
what had happened...

313
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:38,820
...went to find the sheriff...

314
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,366
...without sketching the writing
or touching the bodies...

315
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,576
...they returned to see
vultures at the rock.

316
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:48,705
But the bodies had been
removed by persons unknown...

317
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,875
...the stench of death
was still thick...

318
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,504
...but the bodies had been
taken in a matter of hours..."

319
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:00,175
That happened here
at Coffin Rock.

320
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:05,681
Let's rush, because I want
to camp, and it's 4:52.

321
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,809
It's late. We're gonna be
losing light soon.

322
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:13,689
But I can use the shot
without me in it...

323
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:18,068
...because I recorded sound
while reading the whole thing,...

324
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,821
...so I'm sure I can edit
it together somehow.

325
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:26,576
It's starting to rain.

326
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:28,286
Did you rent this thing ?

327
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:32,207
Yeah. I don't have a
tent for three people.

328
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:33,792
Just wondering...

329
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,086
I don't usually travel with two men.

330
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:40,090
It is pouring with rain.
Can't even light a fire.

331
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:42,551
Show us what the stick is for.

332
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:47,597
Look. We've got our
very own leaning post.

333
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:50,934
If it smells of farts
too much in the night...

334
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,603
Okay, so I can't have a
cigarette in the tent,...

335
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,023
...but he can fart as
much as he wants ?

336
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:59,901
No, I never gave Mike
a fart allowance.

337
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,321
You heard noises last night ?

338
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:04,990
- I did.
- Problem is, I sleep like a log.

339
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,617
There were two separate noises...

340
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:10,746
...coming from two
areas over here...

341
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,457
...one of them could
have been an owl...

342
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,876
...but the other was a cackling.

343
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,295
No way.

344
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,088
It was a cackling, man.

345
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,716
If I heard a cackling,
I would've shit myself.

346
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,135
Where did we start yesterday ?

347
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:26,928
Off the map.

348
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,516
I knew where we were going.
There was some confusion, but today..

349
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,060
Wait,...say that again.

350
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:35,479
I said I knew where
we were going.

351
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:38,690
Wait,...was that a
full of shit statement ?

352
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:39,524
No, it wasn't.

353
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,693
- So that wasn't bullshit ?
- I knew where we were going.

354
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,071
You got us lost, man.

355
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,114
For a very short period of time.

356
00:17:46,657 --> 00:17:48,283
Just don't get us lost today.

357
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,117
Yeah, seriously.

358
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:51,119
No. These places are
very well documented.

359
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:53,372
You happy with the documentary ?

360
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:54,539
Yes, I am.

361
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,418
I'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey.

362
00:17:58,627 --> 00:17:59,711
"Our Little Mikey ?"

363
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,296
Our Little Mikey...

364
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,259
...a very spirited young man.

365
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,471
What do you think about the
witch ? You think she exists ?

366
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:11,473
I don't know.

367
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:16,436
Heather, I really hope
you find us a trail.

368
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,606
There's a trail up on
this hill. Don't worry.

369
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,860
We like shortcuts, don't we ?

370
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:28,323
We like level shortcuts.

371
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:31,034
Not mountain shortcuts.

372
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,829
It's the first time we've
seen Mike's chest.

373
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:36,289
It's really hard to film on video.

374
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,334
He has really sporadic hair
patterns on his chest.

375
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,419
Like symbols.

376
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:43,130
It's like blank...hairy..

377
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:45,215
...blank...hairy.

378
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,341
You should see my ass.

379
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,385
Look, here's fucking Uruguay.

380
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:51,722
- And there's Paraguay.
- Yeah.

381
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,390
I think I see Bolivia.

382
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:57,352
What killed this
mouse ? Witchcraft ?

383
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,064
How 'bout God ?

384
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,900
Is that the Blair Witch ?

385
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:08,697
No. I think it's Heather,
taking a piss.

386
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:12,909
You know, I
really have to go.

387
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:15,620
Ohhh...go !

388
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:20,250
We're near the cemetery
trail. It should only be...

389
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,336
- What ?
- Says who ?

390
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:23,545
Says me, of course.

391
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:28,300
We should be there
in about ninety minutes.

392
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,887
You guys cool with that ?

393
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:33,388
What ?

394
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:34,640
Ninety minutes ?

395
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:37,476
- If you know where we're going.
- Sure.

396
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:39,645
Josh wants to look at the map now.

397
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:41,730
Though I know
where we're going.

398
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:44,232
If you'd known where
we were, we wouldn't be...

399
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:45,525
We're in the middle
of the fucking woods.

400
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,278
- How could you possibly know ?
- Because some is offtrail.

401
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:51,114
What, somebody told you
there's a cemetery back there ?

402
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,784
If we're lost, admit that, because...

403
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:55,202
...I know we're not lost.

404
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,704
You knew that yesterday, too,
and twice again today.

405
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:00,874
Bullshit ! We have
not been lost today.

406
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,043
Not once.

407
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,252
Okay, this is where we were.

408
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:07,005
You said that it was
two miles away.

409
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,132
Then it's two hours away,
three hours away...

410
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,885
- Okay, just chill !
- Maybe it's four hours away.

411
00:20:12,052 --> 00:20:14,888
- You agreed to do this project.
- I agreed to a scouted-out project.

412
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:17,891
- Not to wander round the woods.
- I told you that...

413
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,477
...getting to the locations
wasn't gonna be easy.

414
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:22,521
Mike, Mike...Okay, guys !

415
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,898
Please, you're being a smart-ass.

416
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,358
We're looking at the map...

417
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:29,111
...we'll find this the best we can.

418
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:33,115
This is where we were. We're
going more or less this way.

419
00:20:33,907 --> 00:20:36,576
Okay, what do you say ? Where
do you think we're going ?

420
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:38,537
To tell you the truth...

421
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,627
...this is Greek
to me. It's useless.

422
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:46,628
Exactly.

423
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,422
So I'm putting my trust in you...

424
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:51,550
...that you know where it is.

425
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,302
Good.

426
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,097
Though I gotta tell you,
I don't fully trust you...

427
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,224
...and I...

428
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:00,934
What ?

429
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,104
I don't know why you tape
every conversation, man.

430
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,355
Well, we're making a documentary.

431
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:08,692
Not about us getting lost,
it's about a witch !

432
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,445
I have a camera.

433
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,991
We'll all look back on this
and laugh, believe me.

434
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,493
Baby steps, man, baby steps.

435
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:21,955
Just breathe and don't look down.
No, you gotta look down.

436
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:23,540
Are you gonna have to crawl ?

437
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:24,291
I'm gonna crawl.

438
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,042
Cool.

439
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,795
Think how cool the fucking
cemetery is gonna be.

440
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:33,759
Think of the joy of being
in a really good film.

441
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:34,801
Okay, shut the fuck up.

442
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:36,219
Okay, I'm quiet.

443
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:37,554
Shit. How am I gonna do this ?

444
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,890
Okay...Mikey ?

445
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:40,682
Yeah.

446
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:44,645
Dude, don't come across
with the DAT on your belly.

447
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:45,771
No way, man.

448
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,230
There's no chance.

449
00:21:47,689 --> 00:21:49,483
How do we get it
across ?

450
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,567
It's really fucking hard.

451
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:51,985
How we gonna get
it across ?

452
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:55,489
The moss this morning was easy.
This stuff's slippery as shit.

453
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:58,116
Well, how do we get
the DAT across ?

454
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,704
I don't know. Let
me put my pack down...

455
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:04,623
I'll just go back and forth, man.

456
00:22:04,831 --> 00:22:06,875
Can you do it that way ?

457
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,543
It's the only thing I can do.

458
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:10,170
Okay, we'll do it like that.

459
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:11,463
Oh, Christ !

460
00:22:11,672 --> 00:22:13,548
Oh, what'd you drop ?

461
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,552
Nothing.
The tree just broke.

462
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:18,845
Oh, fuck.

463
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:21,098
We're very, very close now.

464
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:25,268
You guys excited ?

465
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,439
Okay.

466
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:31,483
What's this ?

467
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,743
What's this ? Dude, guys.

468
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:45,998
Remember what Mary
Brown said the other day ?

469
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:50,460
What story from the
Bible was she telling us ?

470
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,963
Fuck, I wasn't listening, I
thought she was crazy.

471
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,383
It was Esau, something about a
pile of rocks.

472
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:59,720
She was talking
about her rocks, man.

473
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,097
Well, what about
the rocks ?

474
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,350
Anybody remember ?

475
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:10,022
To live your life.

476
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,650
Looks like an Indian
burial ground, man.

477
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,861
I don't know if this counts,
three...

478
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:18,864
...four...

479
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:22,326
...five...

480
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,411
...six...

481
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,788
...seven.

482
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,749
Years ago witches
were roasted...

483
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:31,001
...just like my Vienna sausage.

484
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:34,504
Flames are licking you
like the Devil, Josh.

485
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:38,133
Sit back and hear a tale,
a tale of a fateful trip...

486
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:40,636
...that started on
this desert isle...

487
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:42,721
...aboard this tiny ship...

488
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,015
Yeah, but this ship
has a good captain...

489
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:47,559
...not a beer-guzzling
guy in a blue shirt.

490
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,394
He wasn't beer-guzzling.

491
00:23:49,936 --> 00:23:51,980
They had no beer on
the island, man.

492
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:55,150
If they had beer, they'd
have had big-ass orgies.

493
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,738
You're like the Captain,
and Mike's your Gilligan.

494
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,782
- No offense.
- That's all right.

495
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,408
It was a compliment...

496
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:06,495
...Gilligan was a funny guy...

497
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:08,914
...the Captain was fat, though.

498
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,375
Well okay, let's call
it a thin Captain.

499
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,126
It's not Captain...

500
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:15,796
It's the Skipper.

501
00:24:17,506 --> 00:24:18,674
No more Captain.

502
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,303
Here we are back at
the rock again...

503
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,180
...the cemetery deal.

504
00:24:26,974 --> 00:24:29,101
I just wanna be careful
not to get in the shot.

505
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:39,361
It certainly is odd.

506
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:48,787
Please tell me you didn't
just knock that over.

507
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:50,580
I didn't just knock that over.

508
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,835
That's not very nice.
Let me put it back.

509
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:04,886
You can't be too careful.

510
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:06,680
What'd you think ?

511
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:10,976
It was the same, only darker.

512
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:13,228
Yeah, pretty much.

513
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,024
All right. Bag it up.

514
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,817
Hello ?

515
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,987
Shit, no light.

516
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,329
We were sleeping.

517
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:31,455
Do you want this ?

518
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:34,458
Put it by the tent door.

519
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,598
Listen.

520
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:52,225
Hello ?

521
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:54,936
Hello !

522
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:06,198
It's all around us.
Fucking weird.

523
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,742
Michael, aren't you
coming down ?

524
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:10,243
I ain't going down there.

525
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,703
Why not ?

526
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:13,622
- Because I don't hear shit.
- You're fucking scared.

527
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:14,956
Because I don't
hear anything !

528
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,376
You cannot deny hearing it.

529
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:20,295
Get your ass out ! Come on !

530
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:24,716
This rain fucking blows, man.

531
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,927
I know. It's raining heavily.

532
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:31,056
Thanks mom for giving me
rain gear for my birthday.

533
00:26:31,306 --> 00:26:32,891
God bless her.

534
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:35,102
What do you think it
was last night ?

535
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:37,980
Personally ?

536
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:38,689
Yeah.

537
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:41,066
Someone fucking
with your head.

538
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:43,068
But nobody knows
we're here.

539
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:45,737
Yeah, but...you ever see
"Deliverance" ?

540
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:49,741
Well, whatever it was,
I just wanted to...

541
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,119
You were freaking out.
You bugged me out.

542
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,330
I was. I woke up suddenly
and shit's going down...

543
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,124
...and all I can think is
"I want it all...

544
00:26:57,332 --> 00:27:00,043
I want it on sound,
I want it on sixteen.

545
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,963
If we see anything,
I want it on sixteen."

546
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,508
Sounded to me like a lot
of people running around...

547
00:27:06,717 --> 00:27:08,677
...maybe they were locals
or whatever.

548
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,804
I don't know what
the hell they wanted.

549
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:15,058
We're deep in the woods, and
if people want to mess with us...

550
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:17,269
...then there's something
wrong with them...

551
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:18,895
...and I'm not gonna
get into that.

552
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:20,230
And if it wasn't people ?

553
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,316
Well, I'm not gonna
get into that, either !

554
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,901
Fuck, man..

555
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:28,697
..it's been a very long day...

556
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,700
...a very wet, very long day.

557
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:38,123
Nobody's speaking to me
right now.

558
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,335
Dude, I don't remember
any of this.

559
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,378
What ?

560
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:46,298
I don't remember any
of this coming from the car.

561
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:50,302
We have to go a different
route to get back...

562
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:52,596
...because we went
around in a curve.

563
00:27:55,057 --> 00:27:57,267
Two more hours max, guys.

564
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:03,273
If we came by a short cut, why
are we going back a different way ?

565
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,110
Because we have to go round...

566
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:10,197
It was the most direct way to
hit our two locations.

567
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,366
And this is the quickest
way back to the car.

568
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:13,492
Seriously ?

569
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,118
Yes. Seriously.

570
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:18,163
- You know exactly what's going on ?
- Yes. Let's just keep going.

571
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:19,456
All right.

572
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,626
Five minutes and we
do a map check.

573
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:24,169
All right.

574
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,757
We just did a map check,
and we're still on track.

575
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:31,093
That's not what I said.

576
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:34,221
We're all right. Come on,
just keep going.

577
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,935
Well the compass says...

578
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,396
...we go straight ahead,
that way.

579
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:45,232
We're in the middle of nowhere.

580
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:48,151
We've been in the middle
of nowhere for two days.

581
00:28:48,318 --> 00:28:50,028
Just like the car.

582
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,864
Look at this shit, man !
This is nothing.

583
00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:56,284
Let's just keep
going, all right ?

584
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:00,747
I think we should camp.

585
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:01,999
Get the fuck out of here !

586
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,251
Why ? 'Cause you don't know
where we are ?

587
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:06,461
No, because we're still
A little way from the car...

588
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,005
...and it's gonna be dark soon.

589
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:12,759
- Look, I'm not sure...
- We don't camp. Stop the camera...

590
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:14,011
...and get us home.

591
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:17,597
Turn the camera off and give
me the fucking map.

592
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,266
Turn it off and get us home.

593
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:22,602
No, I'm filming. I want
to mark this occasion.

594
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:23,812
Give me the map.

595
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:26,940
The map is in my
pocket. Wait a second.

596
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,358
God damn !

597
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:32,154
If we keep our heads
together, we'll be just fine.

598
00:29:32,321 --> 00:29:33,822
Fucking bullshit !

599
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,073
Mike, chill.

600
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:36,825
Just relax, Mike.

601
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,119
Don't fucking tell
me to relax !

602
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,748
Let's just sit down,
and check the map...

603
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,958
Yes. Let's do that, please.

604
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:47,669
Are you happy ?

605
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,212
I'm not happy, no.

606
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:53,008
But the car isn't far. But we
can't find it in the dark.

607
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,969
Are you absolutely sure ?

608
00:29:56,178 --> 00:30:00,015
Yes. I'm so sorry. We can still
get the DAT back tomorrow.

609
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,391
We have to...

610
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,936
We will get the
DAT back on time.

611
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:06,563
And the camera.

612
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:08,190
We'll get it all
back tomorrow.

613
00:30:08,357 --> 00:30:10,734
I start work tomorrow at nine.

614
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:11,943
I know.

615
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,154
It's fine. Let's go to sleep.

616
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:16,448
Let's just fucking camp, okay ?

617
00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:19,034
I wanna tape it from
inside the tent.

618
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:27,793
Whatever it is, it sounds the
same as last night.

619
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:38,053
Where's my boots ? Fuck, it's cold...

620
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:43,934
Hello ?

621
00:30:47,938 --> 00:30:50,774
Shit, it's fucking freezing...

622
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:52,985
...there.

623
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:55,112
What ?

624
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,405
I hear it.

625
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,448
I don't hear shit.

626
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:00,909
You hear that ?

627
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,083
Shit...

628
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:19,553
Hello ?

629
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,585
I think it's just a deer.

630
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:55,172
- Could be deer, I guess.
- It's just a deer.

631
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:56,965
I don't think so, man.

632
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,260
Sounds just like last night.
It's all around us.

633
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:01,720
It's gotta be just a deer.

634
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:03,305
It was a deer, man.

635
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:05,891
It wasn't like last night.

636
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,065
You say something ?

637
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,818
Yes ! Fucking listen ! Let's
get it on DAT...be quiet...

638
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:18,445
Okay, it's on.

639
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:24,951
Jesus Christ ! What the
fuck was that ?

640
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,044
It's not scared by our yelling.

641
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:40,801
Sounds like footsteps.

642
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:43,053
I know ! It's a fucking person !

643
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:47,891
I don't see shit on video.
We'll just use DAT, right ?

644
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,934
But I'm staying out.

645
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,477
You stay out here with me.

646
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:51,728
I am. I am.

647
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:55,983
What time is it ? Anywhere
near morning ?

648
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:57,609
Let me see...

649
00:32:57,818 --> 00:33:00,362
Tell me it's five
O'clock or something.

650
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:02,614
Three.

651
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:03,615
Fuck !

652
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:08,286
Bullshit. This is
fucking crazy.

653
00:33:10,163 --> 00:33:12,708
I'm sorry, Mike. We should
be home already.

654
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,960
This has got nothing to do...

655
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:17,838
...with what we're here for.

656
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:19,923
This is just it's bullshit.

657
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:23,844
Woke up this morning,
two seconds ago...

658
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:27,180
...and there are piles of
rocks outside our tent.

659
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:32,811
There are three, actually.

660
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,441
Are you positive those
weren't there last night ?

661
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,527
I am fucking positive
they weren't here !

662
00:33:40,777 --> 00:33:43,155
How could we have
just camped...

663
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:46,658
...between three piles of rocks
just by coincidence ?

664
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:49,077
You don't think this is strange ?

665
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:53,165
It is fucking weird, but
I really don't care...

666
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:55,917
...because all I want to do
is get to the goddam car.

667
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:59,212
Whatever it is,
man, right now...

668
00:33:59,588 --> 00:34:01,381
...we have to get back to the car.

669
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,468
They obviously don't want us
Here, so let's get out.

670
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:07,137
We have to get the DAT back.

671
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,723
- That's what I mean.
- Okay, let's go.

672
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,809
Let's pack our shit up
and just walk.

673
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,227
Can we just walk ?

674
00:34:14,436 --> 00:34:15,354
Yes, we're out of here.

675
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:16,396
Okay, cool.

676
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:19,524
But we're leaving just
when it's all happening.

677
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:23,779
Put the fucking camera down.
Let's pack up the tent.

678
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:26,156
- Let's get out of the woods.
- Okay, hang on.

679
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:27,783
Come on !

680
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:30,952
No, I'm not scared !
I'm just tired and hungry...

681
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,289
I'm just fucking done, man.

682
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:35,415
All right.

683
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,628
Did you take it ?

684
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:42,798
No, I didn't take the fucking map.

685
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:48,053
I'm not playing head games.

686
00:34:48,345 --> 00:34:50,389
You're the one playing
head games.

687
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:52,015
But I'm not.

688
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:57,771
I don't have it. We have to go.
I'm serious, I don't have it.

689
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,981
Are you fucking serious ?

690
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,191
Fucking serious. I don't have it.

691
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:04,486
Heather, that is not so cool, man.

692
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:06,405
I know it's not cool !

693
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:09,408
It's the fucking least
responsible thing...

694
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:12,035
...you could have done, man.

695
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:13,954
I know that.

696
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,874
You really don't have it ?

697
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,420
One of you must have the map.

698
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:24,006
No, I don't have the map.
We gave it back to you...

699
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:26,258
...after map check yesterday.

700
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,386
I always keep it in the
same place...

701
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,555
...and if it's not there,
one of you must have it.

702
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:35,017
I did not get the goddam map
out of your fucking pants, man.

703
00:35:35,392 --> 00:35:37,269
Well, I don't have it !

704
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:38,770
Look, why would I take it ?

705
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,315
I just wanna get out
of here, man.

706
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:42,482
Me too.

707
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:43,525
Let's go !

708
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:47,112
No, you wanna stay and
film rocks, look around...

709
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:47,946
Let's go !

710
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,324
..you wanna film this and that...
Which way ?

711
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,158
That way.

712
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,160
We're in the
middle of the woods !

713
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:55,620
We can walk any way !

714
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:59,082
This way ! Because we've
been going this way all day.

715
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,085
We're going this way !
We gotta find something !

716
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:04,296
I gave you back the map !

717
00:36:04,504 --> 00:36:05,172
I gave you the map.

718
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,591
I gave you back the map !

719
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:11,011
- Let's just go.
- We can move as fast as we want...

720
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:14,014
...but there's no point if we have
no idea where we're going.

721
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,516
We're following the creek.
Mike seems happy with that.

722
00:36:16,683 --> 00:36:17,934
Would you guys stop it ?

723
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,944
We are fucked, we are done...

724
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,530
...we are dead, we are fucked.

725
00:36:34,368 --> 00:36:38,497
I'm staying here. When you
find someone...

726
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:41,958
...tell them I'm under the
tree with the vine.

727
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,669
All blame aside...

728
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,256
...this is really fucked up.

729
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:50,801
I know.

730
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:53,720
We really need to work together.

731
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:56,056
- I realize that.
- Exactly. Exactly.

732
00:36:56,264 --> 00:36:59,434
So we accept the fact that my
camera's not gonna be back...

733
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:00,852
...or your DAT.

734
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:03,689
No blame from now
on about that shit.

735
00:37:04,064 --> 00:37:04,898
Look, seriously...

736
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:08,360
...this area's not that fucking big.

737
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:12,406
Exactly. It's very hard to get
lost in America these days...

738
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:15,617
...and even harder to stay lost.

739
00:37:15,951 --> 00:37:16,702
What ?

740
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:20,038
Well, we're doin' a pretty good
job of being lost.

741
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:24,042
If you're not home today,
and I'm not home today...

742
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:25,877
...people are gonna notice...

743
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,922
...My girlfriend's definitely
gonna notice...

744
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:32,175
...and she'll notice that
I haven't called.

745
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:37,139
...that I didn't get back and
I didn't call...

746
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:39,016
...so if by tonight we
haven't found shit...

747
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:41,893
...someone's gonna be looking for us.

748
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,978
Oh, no !

749
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:44,938
Not down here, go another way...

750
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:47,274
...I just got my whole shit wet.

751
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:53,780
Shit. Well, let's try it this way.

752
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,450
No, not this way...

753
00:37:57,617 --> 00:37:59,745
...better try the other way.

754
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,167
- If we didn't have these packs...
- I don't mean to laugh...

755
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:07,461
Your feet are wet !

756
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:09,338
Is Michael laughing ?

757
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:14,676
Shut up and cross the stream.

758
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,595
He's laughing...

759
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,723
...that's the first time
you've laughed in days.

760
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:27,189
I'm happy you
find it amusing...

761
00:38:27,397 --> 00:38:29,691
...that I'll be uncomfortable
for the rest of the day.

762
00:38:30,484 --> 00:38:32,611
Dude, uncomfort does not even...

763
00:38:33,737 --> 00:38:34,905
Can we keep going, please ?

764
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,407
No, we're gonna chill out !

765
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,245
- Didn't you want to get to the car ?
- Oh boy ! !

766
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:44,289
Okay, come on...let's get up here.

767
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:45,540
Oh shit.

768
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:49,294
You weren't lying to me about
the map, were you ?

769
00:38:49,503 --> 00:38:53,340
'Cause to me it seems like you're
having a little too much fun.

770
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,384
- Oh, Heather..
- We're going a little stir crazy.

771
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:58,720
Heather ! If you make me
yell at this point...

772
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,764
...don't make me
yell at you, man.

773
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:04,518
Seriously, if you got the map, I
just wanna know you have it !

774
00:39:05,352 --> 00:39:08,105
That would make me happy,
just to know you have it.

775
00:39:09,356 --> 00:39:13,276
If I knew that, and I could see
it, I'd feel much better.

776
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:19,324
We're just trying to
be cool with you.

777
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:22,911
So I get laughed at 'cause
my shoes got wet.

778
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,496
It's fucking hilarious.

779
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:30,585
All our shoes are wet...

780
00:39:30,752 --> 00:39:33,213
...we were laughing
at the situation.

781
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:34,131
Fine.

782
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,299
We're fucking hungry
and fucking tired...

783
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:39,261
-...what the hell else can we do ?
- You know what ?

784
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:41,888
I'm sorry, it's fucked up...

785
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:47,894
...but I kicked that map into the
creek yesterday.

786
00:39:48,395 --> 00:39:52,065
It was useless and I kicked it
into the creek !

787
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,988
I fucking hope he's kidding.

788
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:00,324
Mike ?

789
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,535
I really fucking hope he's kidding.

790
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,747
Mike, are you fucking kidding ?

791
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:08,623
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

792
00:40:08,832 --> 00:40:12,252
You're kidding me. You have
gotta be fucking kidding me !

793
00:40:12,753 --> 00:40:14,379
- You think it's a game ?
- Get off me !

794
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,590
What the fuck ?
Are you out of your mind ?

795
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:19,176
No, I'm not. That map
wasn't doing shit !

796
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:22,638
Not for you, but I knew what
the fuck the map said ! !

797
00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:23,680
I'm sorry !

798
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,682
You're a fucking asshole !

799
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:26,767
I'm sorry.

800
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:28,310
You're a fucking asshole !

801
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:30,812
That map was useless !

802
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:33,815
If we get hurt or die here,
it's your fucking fault !

803
00:40:34,066 --> 00:40:36,360
You understand ?

804
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:41,323
How could you be
such an asshole ?

805
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:45,952
- What were you thinking ?
- You are fucking me up here !

806
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:49,122
I am not ! That map
was useless !

807
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:51,416
It was useless to you !

808
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,836
Okay...

809
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:57,422
I didn't bring you out
here for this, man.

810
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:01,134
Sorry about the map, man.
What can I say ?

811
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:05,347
- The map wasn't doing shit.
- Just don't say sorry.

812
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,057
It wasn't worth
shit to you.

813
00:41:07,224 --> 00:41:10,185
I knew exactly where
we were !

814
00:41:10,352 --> 00:41:13,230
Listen ! Yesterday I asked you what
fucking river we were on...

815
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,690
Shut up or else.

816
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:16,441
Turn the fucking camera off !

817
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:17,693
Give me the compass...

818
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:21,446
...you have betrayed us...

819
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:24,908
...way fucking beyond.
Give me the compass.

820
00:41:25,534 --> 00:41:27,494
So have you for not getting
us out of the woods.

821
00:41:27,661 --> 00:41:28,912
Yeah, thanks.

822
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,290
Can I have the fucking compass ?

823
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:36,753
No. I bought the compass.
If you wanted one...

824
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,463
...you should've
bought your own.

825
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:40,465
You and he both fucked us up.

826
00:41:40,757 --> 00:41:42,384
Why can't you admit that...

827
00:41:42,718 --> 00:41:45,012
-...you fucked up from the start.
- Let's just walk south.

828
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,388
Because I haven't !

829
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:48,307
Why are we stopped ?

830
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,855
Why are we stopped ?

831
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:58,984
Just don't.

832
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:02,321
I'm just asking
Why we stopped.

833
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:06,908
Weren't we going south ?

834
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:08,994
We all seemed very
Happy with that.

835
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,663
Why don't we carry on like that ?

836
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:22,007
What ?

837
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:24,343
There's all sorts of
Stuff down here !

838
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:25,802
What kind of stuff ?

839
00:42:26,303 --> 00:42:27,679
Voodoo shit !

840
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:30,766
What ?

841
00:42:30,974 --> 00:42:33,977
- Hanging all over the place !
- No way...

842
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:37,105
It's all over.

843
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:38,190
Holy shit...

844
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:42,819
Come up quick ! I need the CP !

845
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,738
There's all sorts
Here, man !

846
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:48,075
This is fucking crazy shit.

847
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,080
Please, I gotta film this !

848
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,498
Take the fucking camera.

849
00:42:58,502 --> 00:42:59,503
What the fuck is this ?

850
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,962
I have no idea.

851
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:47,509
Jesus Christ, that's fucking creepy.

852
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,599
This is no redneck.
No redneck is this creative.

853
00:43:56,852 --> 00:43:57,936
Can we go now ?

854
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,521
Yeah, please.

855
00:44:00,314 --> 00:44:02,774
Okay, I got everything on video.

856
00:44:02,983 --> 00:44:05,736
Oh, Jesus Christ, I didn't
Even see these !

857
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:09,197
Okay, Heather, you got
Enough, man. Let's go.

858
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:12,951
- That's enough ! Stop taping !
- That's enough !

859
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:15,996
- Okay, we're going right now.
- Let's go !

860
00:44:16,246 --> 00:44:19,916
Okay, we're out of here.
I'm leaving.

861
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:22,544
Come on, turn it off !

862
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:25,881
Help !

863
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:29,885
Please help us !

864
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:34,514
We won't get out of here like that.

865
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:35,724
Fuck !

866
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:37,768
Fuck !

867
00:44:38,518 --> 00:44:41,938
I think I can say
that we're now lost.

868
00:44:42,898 --> 00:44:44,441
I don't know what to do.

869
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:48,028
We should all get
Inside the tent.

870
00:44:48,362 --> 00:44:49,279
All right.

871
00:44:49,571 --> 00:44:51,531
Let's not light a fire tonight.

872
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,241
Yeah, that's my thinking.

873
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,620
- That's a good idea.
- We didn't light one the first night.

874
00:44:56,828 --> 00:44:57,663
And nothing happened.

875
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:00,832
We light fires, and they know.
No one was following us.

876
00:45:01,249 --> 00:45:02,668
We should turn that light off, too.

877
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:03,960
All right.

878
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,922
Seriously, anything
could attract them.

879
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:09,800
Let's just go to sleep.

880
00:45:24,106 --> 00:45:25,357
Oh God.

881
00:45:29,987 --> 00:45:31,321
Put this out.

882
00:45:53,844 --> 00:45:57,014
Jesus Christ, little kids. Oh, God !

883
00:45:57,306 --> 00:45:58,724
I'm gonna put my jeans on.

884
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,768
Take the video camera.
No, the DAT.

885
00:46:02,436 --> 00:46:04,396
I'm gonna get this on video.

886
00:46:04,604 --> 00:46:06,231
Oh, dear God, dear God !

887
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:20,662
Go, fucking go !

888
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:22,622
Oh God !

889
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:25,083
Oh God !

890
00:46:27,502 --> 00:46:28,503
Hurry up !

891
00:46:28,712 --> 00:46:31,590
I'm coming ! My boots aren't laced !

892
00:46:32,716 --> 00:46:34,676
Oh my God, what the fuck is that ?

893
00:46:35,636 --> 00:46:37,262
What the fuck is that ?

894
00:46:44,728 --> 00:46:45,812
Oh, shit !

895
00:46:53,362 --> 00:46:55,656
Mike, where are you, man ?

896
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:06,708
Turn the lights off...

897
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:09,711
...turn that light off.
turn it off, Josh.

898
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:15,676
All lights off,
all lights off.

899
00:47:23,058 --> 00:47:24,309
I'm soaking.

900
00:47:24,393 --> 00:47:25,560
That's okay.

901
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,396
What was that ?

902
00:47:28,271 --> 00:47:30,399
What the fuck is going on ?

903
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,699
You hear that baby screaming ?

904
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:41,451
Shut the fuck up. There's
no fucking baby.

905
00:47:41,702 --> 00:47:44,621
- Yes there was.
- There was no fucking baby.

906
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:50,460
I haven't heard anything
since we ran away...

907
00:47:53,296 --> 00:47:54,756
Oh my God, it's cold.

908
00:47:56,008 --> 00:47:57,801
We should be quiet, okay ?

909
00:48:07,394 --> 00:48:10,022
I don't hear anything anymore.
Let's go back.

910
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:14,943
How long have we been here ?

911
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:16,862
I don't know, man, an hour...?

912
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:21,158
The sun's up. We're okay now.

913
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:25,370
Let's just get back,
pack up, and go.

914
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:26,788
Okay.

915
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:31,335
What the fuck, man ?

916
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,462
Where's my pack ?

917
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:35,505
Right there. Where's mine ?

918
00:48:36,006 --> 00:48:37,632
What the fuck, man ?

919
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,100
Why're they fucking
with us like this ?

920
00:48:48,018 --> 00:48:49,561
They just opened it up.

921
00:48:49,936 --> 00:48:51,730
They spilled all my water !

922
00:48:52,064 --> 00:48:53,607
Looks like slime, man.

923
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:55,651
It's just water, man.

924
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:58,695
It is slime. What the fuck is it ?

925
00:48:59,112 --> 00:49:00,572
Let's get out of here.

926
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:02,199
- Heather, turn that thing off !
- Let's go.

927
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:03,241
Okay.

928
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,410
I'm not interested
anymore ! Let's go !

929
00:49:05,702 --> 00:49:06,536
I know.

930
00:49:06,703 --> 00:49:07,954
So turn it off.

931
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:11,083
Relax. Have we got everything here ?

932
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:14,211
- Like I give a shit.
- Whose bag was opened ?

933
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:15,587
It was mine !

934
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,175
Why you ?

935
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,511
Are you not scared enough yet ?

936
00:49:22,678 --> 00:49:23,428
But why you ?

937
00:49:23,971 --> 00:49:25,764
Put it down. This is not funny.

938
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:28,433
Am I laughing at all ?

939
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:31,895
No, but you're still doing
your documentary thing, man !

940
00:49:32,104 --> 00:49:33,522
Still your fucking documentary !

941
00:49:33,772 --> 00:49:36,525
- Don't touch it !
- Then turn the goddam thing off !

942
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:39,403
If you bite me again,
I'll throw you in river.

943
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:42,906
- Don't touch my camera.
- Turn it off !

944
00:49:43,198 --> 00:49:44,032
I'm sorry.

945
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:45,701
I didn't mean it, okay ?

946
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:46,785
You all right ?

947
00:49:46,952 --> 00:49:48,578
Yeah. I wanna go home...

948
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:50,664
...but I wanna get
what we can.

949
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:52,290
What the fuck.. ?

950
00:49:54,584 --> 00:49:56,003
Is this possible ?

951
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,547
All right.

952
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:00,590
Here I go.

953
00:50:00,882 --> 00:50:03,260
I hate crossing streams on logs.

954
00:50:04,011 --> 00:50:05,637
If I never cross another stream...

955
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:08,640
...on a log, I'll die happy.

956
00:50:11,018 --> 00:50:14,104
I see why you like the
video camera so much.

957
00:50:15,397 --> 00:50:16,481
You do ?

958
00:50:16,732 --> 00:50:18,525
It's not quite reality.

959
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,196
Reality says we gotta move.

960
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:27,576
But it's a totally filtered
reality, man.

961
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,622
As if everything's
not quite the way it is.

962
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:37,461
Just leave him alone awhile

963
00:50:37,711 --> 00:50:38,795
We need to go.

964
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:40,422
Leave him for five minutes.

965
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,217
Leave him alone. Five minutes.

966
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:46,136
Come on, he's lost it.

967
00:50:47,387 --> 00:50:49,765
I know, but we've all
nearly lost it.

968
00:50:49,973 --> 00:50:52,976
I know, but we got
to look after each other.

969
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,270
And we're not looking after him...

970
00:50:55,437 --> 00:50:57,481
...if we film him
while he's crying.

971
00:50:57,689 --> 00:50:58,440
I know.

972
00:50:58,607 --> 00:50:59,983
I know you know.

973
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:02,653
Let's try and keep our wits.

974
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:04,196
But we have to go.

975
00:51:04,363 --> 00:51:06,740
Sure. Believe me, I know.

976
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:08,617
It's hard to stay calm.

977
00:51:08,784 --> 00:51:10,911
- We need to get out.
- I know.

978
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,579
You're not telling me
anything new,

979
00:51:13,372 --> 00:51:15,415
Just let him calm down.

980
00:51:15,624 --> 00:51:17,000
Anybody got a cigarette ?

981
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:18,001
No, man.

982
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,544
No, there's none left.

983
00:51:20,379 --> 00:51:22,339
Nobody has any cigarettes ?

984
00:51:22,506 --> 00:51:23,590
We're out.

985
00:51:26,635 --> 00:51:28,428
Why the fuck...

986
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,431
...was this blue jelly
shit on my shit ?

987
00:51:31,682 --> 00:51:32,766
Let's go.

988
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:34,643
Let's go.

989
00:51:35,352 --> 00:51:37,896
If we keep going south,
we'll get out.

990
00:51:39,022 --> 00:51:40,023
Please...

991
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:44,152
I don't wanna camp
another fucking night.

992
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:46,738
Josh, none of us do.

993
00:51:46,947 --> 00:51:47,864
I know you don't.

994
00:51:48,073 --> 00:51:51,326
Whoever it is, is gonna come
back, and that's a fact.

995
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:52,703
It's not a fact.

996
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:55,872
It came three nights running,
and it's worse every night.

997
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:58,667
Just what I need to
hear right now.

998
00:51:58,834 --> 00:52:02,337
I'm just trying to
rationally say that...

999
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:07,050
...with our walking speed,
they might just go on forever..

1000
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:11,305
Not possible in this country.

1001
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:12,931
Why not ?

1002
00:52:13,098 --> 00:52:16,768
Because we've destroyed most
of our woods in America.

1003
00:52:16,935 --> 00:52:20,272
- Let's just keep going.
- America, America...

1004
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:24,067
...God shed your grace on thee...

1005
00:52:27,154 --> 00:52:31,158
...Once so proudly we hailed...

1006
00:52:32,075 --> 00:52:35,412
...at twilight's last gleaming...

1007
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:39,458
That's the tree we crossed.

1008
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:41,710
That tree is down. Same one.

1009
00:52:44,379 --> 00:52:45,839
Oh God !

1010
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:47,424
Oh no...

1011
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:50,302
You got to be kidding,
this is a joke !

1012
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:53,930
It's not funny !

1013
00:52:54,556 --> 00:52:58,060
Mike, please stop...
please stop...

1014
00:53:02,022 --> 00:53:03,482
Oh no !

1015
00:53:04,232 --> 00:53:06,193
No, Mike, it's not the same log !

1016
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:10,906
- Same log !
- Look, it's not !

1017
00:53:11,073 --> 00:53:12,949
Yes it is ! Open your eyes !

1018
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,160
It's not the same log...

1019
00:53:33,512 --> 00:53:35,055
It's the same log.

1020
00:53:35,764 --> 00:53:38,225
Fuck you, God ! !

1021
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:40,852
It's the same log.

1022
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:50,821
Okay, it's okay.

1023
00:53:56,493 --> 00:53:58,704
Where do you wanna camp ?

1024
00:53:58,954 --> 00:54:01,581
Going south didn't work.
Tomorrow we go east.

1025
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,834
I don't know what to say, Josh.

1026
00:54:05,043 --> 00:54:07,587
How the fuck did we wind
up in the same place ?

1027
00:54:07,796 --> 00:54:11,842
We walked south
all fucking day !

1028
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:14,094
I don't know how we
ended up here !

1029
00:54:20,976 --> 00:54:23,353
Do you expect me to do,
or say something ?

1030
00:54:32,612 --> 00:54:34,031
What do you wanna do ?

1031
00:54:40,412 --> 00:54:41,663
Josh ?

1032
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,545
I wanna make movies, Heather.

1033
00:54:51,256 --> 00:54:52,966
Isn't that why we came ?

1034
00:54:55,135 --> 00:54:56,928
Let's make some movies.

1035
00:54:57,262 --> 00:54:58,722
Fuck you.

1036
00:55:01,475 --> 00:55:02,976
Fuck you.

1037
00:55:03,143 --> 00:55:05,270
Let's not fight, please ?

1038
00:55:06,438 --> 00:55:09,191
...I can't take it.
I can't fight.

1039
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:13,236
We're screwed, and that's it.
Please stop fighting.

1040
00:55:14,279 --> 00:55:15,906
I'll do the first watch.

1041
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:19,660
I got first watch.

1042
00:55:27,834 --> 00:55:29,711
It's not the time or place, guys.

1043
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,713
We have things to prepare for.

1044
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,590
Okay, here's your motivation...

1045
00:55:33,882 --> 00:55:37,135
...you're lost, you're angry and
no one's here to help you...

1046
00:55:37,427 --> 00:55:40,764
...there's a fucking witch who
keeps leaving shit around...

1047
00:55:40,931 --> 00:55:42,391
...no one can help you...

1048
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:45,060
...she left little trinkets, and
you fucking took one...

1049
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:47,854
...she's chasing us. And
no one can help you !

1050
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:49,815
We walked fifteen hours today...

1051
00:55:49,982 --> 00:55:52,192
...and we ended up in the same place !

1052
00:55:52,401 --> 00:55:55,821
There's no one to help you !
That's your motivation !

1053
00:55:59,783 --> 00:56:01,159
Please stop.

1054
00:56:01,326 --> 00:56:04,746
Josh, quit it. She's had enough.

1055
00:56:05,706 --> 00:56:07,916
You got her back. Good one.

1056
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:10,627
No, she's still making movies !

1057
00:56:10,836 --> 00:56:12,796
- Please stop.
- Still making movies.

1058
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:15,882
It's all I have left, okay ?
Just please stop.

1059
00:56:18,427 --> 00:56:21,138
Please stop yelling at me.

1060
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:28,937
I'm fucking tired of
crying all day.

1061
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:32,858
We gotta think like human beings.
We got things to do.

1062
00:56:33,066 --> 00:56:35,694
We've gotta do shifts.
We got lots to do.

1063
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:44,202
You gonna write us a
happy ending, Heather ?

1064
00:56:53,253 --> 00:56:54,880
Come on, turn it off.

1065
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,799
You're getting like she was.

1066
00:57:03,263 --> 00:57:06,850
I don't know how you can
sew at this point, man,

1067
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:08,894
Well, I'm cold.

1068
00:57:09,478 --> 00:57:11,438
- I know.
- I hear you.

1069
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,107
The smallest comforts
we can get are good.

1070
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:16,943
Doesn't it seem absurd,
though, at this point ?

1071
00:57:17,152 --> 00:57:18,236
Yes, it does.

1072
00:57:18,403 --> 00:57:20,697
Lots of things seem absurd.

1073
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:24,493
Like sleeping where we were
last night is freaking...

1074
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,870
It's just fucking me up, period.

1075
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:31,083
Really fucking me up, man.

1076
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:38,131
- I'm sorry, man.
- Me too. It's all right.

1077
00:57:38,423 --> 00:57:39,966
I'm sorry, Heather.

1078
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:41,718
It's all right.

1079
00:57:42,177 --> 00:57:44,304
Who wants a cheeseburger ?

1080
00:57:44,972 --> 00:57:46,306
I do, I do...

1081
00:57:47,224 --> 00:57:49,601
I got a cheeseburger in my pocket.

1082
00:57:49,851 --> 00:57:53,355
Do you ? Can I have a
light to cut this ?

1083
00:57:54,106 --> 00:57:55,649
Know what I'd fucking love ?

1084
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:56,984
What ?

1085
00:57:57,192 --> 00:57:58,527
Mashed potatoes.

1086
00:57:59,736 --> 00:58:00,904
Me too.

1087
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:06,034
My mom's mashed potatoes.

1088
00:58:10,247 --> 00:58:12,624
You'll have them again very soon.

1089
00:58:14,126 --> 00:58:17,295
Mashed potatoes
and a piece of ass.

1090
00:58:19,006 --> 00:58:20,090
Josh ?

1091
00:58:23,927 --> 00:58:26,555
Fuck, we never go out of earshot !

1092
00:58:27,806 --> 00:58:29,599
Come on, calm down.

1093
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:32,519
How can I ?

1094
00:58:42,154 --> 00:58:43,655
He's probably at the river.

1095
00:58:43,822 --> 00:58:46,199
If he was there,
he could hear me.

1096
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:52,789
Wait for him to respond.

1097
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,584
Remember what he said yesterday ?

1098
00:58:55,959 --> 00:58:57,044
What ?

1099
00:58:58,754 --> 00:59:02,007
About the shit on his bag.

1100
00:59:06,094 --> 00:59:09,848
Let's go. We've gotta find
him. Come on.

1101
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,894
If we can't even find the car,
how are we gonna find Josh ?

1102
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:15,103
Come on.

1103
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:16,980
No, I'm fine.

1104
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:19,941
Come on, come on, relax.

1105
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:22,694
All right, let's take
Down the tent...

1106
00:59:23,236 --> 00:59:24,613
...and when he's back, we'll go.

1107
00:59:24,946 --> 00:59:26,740
I'm losing my mind, Mike.

1108
00:59:27,282 --> 00:59:28,617
Josh hasn't come back.

1109
00:59:28,784 --> 00:59:29,534
Heather ?

1110
00:59:30,535 --> 00:59:32,079
I'm here, Mike.

1111
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:38,126
I don't know if Josh ran off.

1112
00:59:39,628 --> 00:59:41,129
All his shit's here.

1113
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,341
I've got the camera...

1114
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:47,970
...I don't know how I'm
gonna hike with the camera.

1115
00:59:48,637 --> 00:59:50,597
Sure you wanna take it ?

1116
00:59:50,764 --> 00:59:51,932
We have to take the camera.

1117
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:55,727
How do you feel about east ?

1118
00:59:57,729 --> 00:59:59,314
How do you feel ?

1119
01:00:01,525 --> 01:00:03,318
Well, south didn't work.

1120
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:08,865
Which witch was worse, the one
from the east or from the south ?

1121
01:00:10,826 --> 01:00:13,453
The witch of the
west was the bad one.

1122
01:00:13,996 --> 01:00:15,247
Let's go east.

1123
01:00:18,959 --> 01:00:20,210
What the hell is that ?

1124
01:00:21,753 --> 01:00:22,671
Josh ?

1125
01:00:27,968 --> 01:00:29,678
We'll have to put up the tent.

1126
01:00:41,857 --> 01:00:43,650
I'd like a meatball.

1127
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:45,319
Just one meatball ?

1128
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:47,654
And a big glass of red wine.

1129
01:00:47,821 --> 01:00:50,907
Yeah, I would like a whole
fucking bottle of Bordeaux.

1130
01:00:51,283 --> 01:00:52,868
And a pack of smokes.

1131
01:00:53,076 --> 01:00:56,830
That'd be good.
and a long, hot bath.

1132
01:00:56,997 --> 01:00:58,498
And a big pumpkin pie.

1133
01:00:58,707 --> 01:01:00,500
A pumpkin pie with ice cream ?

1134
01:01:02,169 --> 01:01:04,212
Warm with milky ice cream ?

1135
01:01:04,421 --> 01:01:05,672
Yeah, sounds good.

1136
01:01:06,131 --> 01:01:08,508
What do you like
to do on a Sunday ?

1137
01:01:10,844 --> 01:01:13,722
I used to like to drive to the
woods and go hiking.

1138
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:19,353
But I think that might change now.

1139
01:01:20,062 --> 01:01:21,688
I think you could scratch that.

1140
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:37,829
Should we open the door ?

1141
01:01:39,164 --> 01:01:40,707
Is it a trick ?

1142
01:01:50,384 --> 01:01:51,385
Josh !

1143
01:01:53,261 --> 01:01:54,346
Josh !

1144
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:08,276
Where's it coming from ?

1145
01:02:22,624 --> 01:02:25,585
Josh, where are you ?
Tell me where you are !

1146
01:02:29,381 --> 01:02:32,342
Oh my God, no.

1147
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,851
Do you think that's them again ?

1148
01:02:47,816 --> 01:02:48,817
Is it over here ?

1149
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:50,736
No, it's over here.

1150
01:03:01,413 --> 01:03:02,664
We'll look for him.

1151
01:03:15,719 --> 01:03:19,056
I don't know if it's really him.

1152
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:33,570
I don't even know where to look.

1153
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:40,952
Tell me where you are, Josh !

1154
01:03:44,164 --> 01:03:44,998
Mike ?

1155
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:47,376
- What ?
- Please don't fall asleep.

1156
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:49,002
I can't fall asleep.

1157
01:03:52,881 --> 01:03:56,301
Whatever it is, it
knows Josh has gone.

1158
01:04:01,848 --> 01:04:04,810
If that was Josh, he would've
said where he was.

1159
01:04:09,147 --> 01:04:11,608
Whatever it was, it
sounded like Josh.

1160
01:04:13,777 --> 01:04:14,695
See ?

1161
01:04:15,821 --> 01:04:18,615
I just want to show you
that Mike's here.

1162
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,659
There. He's sleeping.

1163
01:04:28,709 --> 01:04:29,876
Oh, shit.

1164
01:04:33,714 --> 01:04:35,132
What the hell is that ?

1165
01:04:38,844 --> 01:04:40,304
- Mike.
- What ?

1166
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,890
There's something out here.

1167
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,567
Okay,

1168
01:04:54,943 --> 01:04:57,237
I'm gonna move it
from in front of the tent.

1169
01:04:57,487 --> 01:04:59,364
- Get rid of it.
- Okay.

1170
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:04,786
I'm taking it away
from the tent.

1171
01:05:05,746 --> 01:05:07,873
I'm just throwing it.

1172
01:05:13,587 --> 01:05:16,340
We'll just keep walking, okay.

1173
01:05:16,548 --> 01:05:17,632
Okay.

1174
01:05:21,511 --> 01:05:25,515
I found some cigarettes
at the bottom of my pack...

1175
01:05:25,682 --> 01:05:28,352
...so if we're smoking,
we're still alive.

1176
01:06:18,819 --> 01:06:20,362
It's all full of blood.

1177
01:07:00,485 --> 01:07:03,989
Shit, shit, shit !

1178
01:07:10,329 --> 01:07:11,663
Oh my God !

1179
01:07:25,385 --> 01:07:26,720
Okay, see...?

1180
01:07:28,138 --> 01:07:29,056
Yeah ?

1181
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:31,767
What are you doing ?

1182
01:07:31,975 --> 01:07:34,019
Just washing my hands !

1183
01:07:34,311 --> 01:07:34,978
What ?

1184
01:07:35,145 --> 01:07:36,688
Just washing my hands !

1185
01:07:37,648 --> 01:07:38,649
I'm fine.

1186
01:07:39,399 --> 01:07:40,942
I'm gonna put my gloves on.

1187
01:07:50,702 --> 01:07:51,703
You all right ?

1188
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:55,707
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1189
01:07:59,252 --> 01:08:00,337
You need help ?

1190
01:08:00,504 --> 01:08:02,631
No, I don't need any help.

1191
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,925
I'm okay.

1192
01:08:05,092 --> 01:08:05,759
What happened ?

1193
01:08:05,926 --> 01:08:09,262
Nothing. I'm just very
hungry and very tired...

1194
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:11,974
...and very scared, and I just
wanna go home, okay ?

1195
01:08:12,182 --> 01:08:12,933
Okay.

1196
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,060
But I'm fine, and we're okay.

1197
01:08:22,317 --> 01:08:24,528
Ow ! My hair's caught.

1198
01:08:27,322 --> 01:08:30,075
Thank you, thank you.

1199
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:35,747
Okay, okay.

1200
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:22,002
Two thousand one
hundred thirty games...

1201
01:09:22,753 --> 01:09:25,297
...one more season and
Cal Ripken is king !

1202
01:09:30,218 --> 01:09:31,845
And I won't see it...

1203
01:09:32,971 --> 01:09:35,098
...because I'll be in the woods.

1204
01:09:50,405 --> 01:09:53,742
Tell me you're not
eating a dry leaf.

1205
01:10:04,878 --> 01:10:06,505
I just want to apologize...

1206
01:10:08,131 --> 01:10:09,841
...to Mike's mom...

1207
01:10:10,926 --> 01:10:12,636
...and Josh's mom...

1208
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,305
...and my mom...

1209
01:10:18,392 --> 01:10:20,769
...and I'm sorry to everyone...

1210
01:10:23,146 --> 01:10:25,107
...I was very nave.

1211
01:10:29,528 --> 01:10:33,281
I am so, so, sorry...

1212
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:36,243
...for everything that's happened...

1213
01:10:37,786 --> 01:10:40,455
...because in spite of
what Mike says now...

1214
01:10:40,622 --> 01:10:41,873
...it was my fault...

1215
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,293
...because it was my project...

1216
01:10:46,336 --> 01:10:47,963
...and I insisted...

1217
01:10:49,673 --> 01:10:51,466
...insisted on everything.

1218
01:10:52,426 --> 01:10:55,220
I insisted we weren't lost...

1219
01:10:56,555 --> 01:10:59,349
...I insisted we keep going...

1220
01:11:00,058 --> 01:11:02,728
...I insisted we walk south.

1221
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:07,065
Everything had
to be my way.

1222
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:09,609
And this is how we've ended up.

1223
01:11:10,902 --> 01:11:14,072
And it's all because of me
that we're here now...

1224
01:11:14,406 --> 01:11:16,783
...hungry and cold...

1225
01:11:19,077 --> 01:11:20,787
...and hunted.

1226
01:11:25,959 --> 01:11:27,669
I love you, mom...

1227
01:11:28,837 --> 01:11:30,088
...dad...

1228
01:11:32,924 --> 01:11:34,801
...I am so sorry.

1229
01:11:40,932 --> 01:11:42,517
...what was that ?

1230
01:11:55,322 --> 01:11:57,616
I'm scared to close my eyes...

1231
01:11:58,533 --> 01:12:00,494
...and scared to open them.

1232
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:09,127
Oh God...

1233
01:12:09,795 --> 01:12:11,588
...we're gonna die here.

1234
01:12:15,968 --> 01:12:18,261
- You got it ?
- You ready ?

1235
01:12:20,097 --> 01:12:21,723
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1236
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:34,361
You ready ?

1237
01:12:34,528 --> 01:12:36,488
Here, take this light.

1238
01:12:38,448 --> 01:12:41,159
That can't be him.

1239
01:13:21,408 --> 01:13:23,785
Holy shit, it's a house.

1240
01:13:25,746 --> 01:13:28,915
- Watch your step.
- Holy shit, Holy shit...

1241
01:13:50,062 --> 01:13:50,896
Josh ?

1242
01:14:05,243 --> 01:14:08,080
Mike. Mike.

1243
01:14:09,665 --> 01:14:10,666
Come on.

1244
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,377
Mike, where the fuck are you ?

1245
01:14:13,585 --> 01:14:15,545
Come on, I'm in the house !

1246
01:14:16,046 --> 01:14:18,590
Mike, don't go in there, please !

1247
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:40,946
Mike, please !
Mike, where are you ?

1248
01:14:41,154 --> 01:14:42,239
I'm right here !

1249
01:14:49,413 --> 01:14:50,580
Where is he ?

1250
01:14:50,872 --> 01:14:52,666
Mike, please don't.

1251
01:15:01,842 --> 01:15:03,176
Is he in here ?

1252
01:15:03,343 --> 01:15:04,261
No.

1253
01:15:18,775 --> 01:15:20,027
Oh, Jesus.

1254
01:15:20,277 --> 01:15:21,445
Where is he ?

1255
01:15:22,863 --> 01:15:24,489
Are you gonna go upstairs ?

1256
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:28,577
I hear him. I hear him.

1257
01:15:29,077 --> 01:15:30,954
I hear you. Josh !

1258
01:15:39,379 --> 01:15:41,089
I'm going upstairs.

1259
01:15:44,593 --> 01:15:47,763
Oh, God, oh.

1260
01:15:52,601 --> 01:15:53,518
Hear that ?

1261
01:15:55,604 --> 01:15:56,688
Where is he ?

1262
01:15:57,105 --> 01:15:58,732
Where are you ?

1263
01:16:00,984 --> 01:16:02,152
Come on !

1264
01:16:06,448 --> 01:16:07,949
I'm getting downstairs.

1265
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:11,745
Come on, I hear him, downstairs !

1266
01:16:12,996 --> 01:16:13,664
Mike !

1267
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,748
Come on !

1268
01:16:14,998 --> 01:16:15,666
Mike !

1269
01:16:15,832 --> 01:16:16,667
Josh !

1270
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:18,126
Wait !

1271
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:26,635
Josh, is that you down there ?

1272
01:17:25,193 --> 00:00:01,800
