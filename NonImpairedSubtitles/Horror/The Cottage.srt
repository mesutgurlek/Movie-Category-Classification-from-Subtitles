1
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,140
We're going to go to hell for this.

2
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,058
Shut up.

3
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,730
It's freezing in here.

4
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:25,315
Jump up and down a bit.

5
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:28,318
You know how
temperature-sensitive I am, David.

6
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:37,913
In actual driven miles,

7
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:40,332
I think this is the furthest away
I've been from Rebecca

8
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,542
since we got married.

9
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm sure she'll survive.

10
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,173
Well, I don't feel comfortable
lying to her like this.

11
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:49,092
I know you're used to a...

12
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,187
I know you're used
to a world of deception.

13
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:03,025
Our relationship
relies on a bond of trust.

14
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:08,113
Do you want some tea?

15
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:10,366
Yes, please.

16
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,204
Can you get the milk from the car?

17
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:16,915
How many sugars?

18
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,668
Shows how often you've made me tea.

19
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,670
Give it a rest.
You're doing my head in.

20
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,006
I'm just pointing out facts, David.

21
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:26,676
Just get the milk from the car, please.

22
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:53,374
Christ, what are you doing
frightening me?

23
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:55,626
Aren't you forgetting something?

24
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:57,670
Oh, yeah.
Well, I'm not used to this, am I?

25
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,382
How many times
do I have to fucking tell you?

26
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:36,131
She all right?

27
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:38,299
Still unconscious.

28
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:39,968
That's chloroform for you.

29
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:42,889
It's freezing out there,
so if I may make a suggestion,

30
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,641
I think we should bring her in
so she doesn't die of pneumonia.

31
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,019
Look, Peter, we've just got here.
I am very tired.

32
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,939
We are not in Iceland,
and she is not going to die of...

33
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,692
What have you put that back on for?

34
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,318
Because I'm cold.

35
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:56,654
I don't want to talk to your eyes.
Take it off.

36
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:58,489
You're not the boss of me.

37
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:01,243
Where the fuck are you, please?

38
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:28,356
Get rid of it.

39
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:30,150
What?

40
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,697
Oh, shit, yeah.
You don't like moths, do you?

41
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:37,158
Get rid of it now,
or I'm bloody going.

42
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:45,459
I didn't say kill it.

43
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,379
What do you want me
to do with it, adopt it?

44
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,091
I think I'd like to ring Rebecca now.
It's a good time.

45
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,509
Because you've seen a moth?

46
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,761
No, we like to let
each other know we're okay.

47
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:57,056
That's what you do
in a serious relationship.

48
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:58,391
No, it's called reporting in.

49
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:01,311
That's what you do
when you're under a very fat thumb.

50
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:04,147
I'm not under a thumb.
It's not fat, either.

51
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:07,276
The reason why I'm ringing her now
is she'll be putting Amy to bed

52
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:09,111
and it'll go to the answering machine.

53
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,823
I don't want her asking questions.
I don't like lying.

54
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:12,949
Don't be all day.

55
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,035
I don't remember putting
a time limit on your calls.

56
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,244
This is my fucking phone.

57
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:18,872
- You always were selfish.
- Where's your phone?

58
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,457
- In my car.
- Why?

59
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:23,170
Because it's my work phone.
It's in my work car.

60
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,422
Did you forget your phone?

61
00:07:27,423 --> 00:07:29,300
- My work phone.
- Idiot.

62
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,469
What did you call me?

63
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:33,014
Idiot. You are a bald idiot.

64
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:36,809
Well, I'd rather be slightly thinning
than a friendless mockney-phile.

65
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,479
I cannot wait
till I never have to see your...

66
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,817
Hi, darling,
I'm just calling to check in.

67
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,527
Everything's okay my end...

68
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:47,280
apart from being really cold.

69
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,158
Anyway, I'll try you again later on.

70
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,453
Give baby Amy a kiss for me.
Love you lots.

71
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,794
Yes, I blew her a kiss.

72
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,964
So?

73
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:13,685
Listen, if she's asleep,
I suggest we be as quiet as possible

74
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:15,687
so we keep her that way.

75
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:23,446
Can I hold the legs?

76
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:41,175
Come on.

77
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:48,933
I really don't like it out here, David.

78
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:51,061
Hurry up and get inside, then.

79
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:00,780
Wait, wait, I have to have a rest.

80
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,783
Come on, we're only
three steps from the top.

81
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,868
I'm not as strong as you, David.

82
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,078
Okay, go on.

83
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,214
Fuck.

84
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:18,842
I'll see if the keys are downstairs.

85
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,639
Don't drop her.

86
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:55,884
Get your hands off me!

87
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:58,345
Fucking bastard!

88
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:12,195
Get off,
you fucking pervert!

89
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,834
You fucking cunt!

90
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,508
You only had to hold her up.
What the fuck were you doing?!

91
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,886
I think she's broken my nose.

92
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:36,889
Yeah, that is well and truly busted.

93
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,058
What the hell am I going to do?
It really hurts!

94
00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:41,311
You should have been
concentrating, then.

95
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:44,398
I bet... I bet you
were looking at her tits.

96
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:47,943
I was not!
She head-butted me repeatedly!

97
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:50,656
I've never been head-butted
by anyone before in my life!

98
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:51,990
Well, you have now.

99
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,035
Please help me,
I'm in a lot of pain!

100
00:10:57,412 --> 00:10:59,873
Whenever I'm with you,
I always end up getting hurt,

101
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:01,251
every time, guaranteed.

102
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:02,919
Don't blame me.
I wasn't with you.

103
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,797
That's what you said about
the greenhouse.

104
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:11,178
That was 20 fucking years ago.

105
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:16,309
Right, I'm gonna knock this
back into place.

106
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,602
How? I don't want you to.

107
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:21,148
- Shut up and hold still.
- Wait, wait, wait, do it slowly!

108
00:11:40,796 --> 00:11:43,257
Nice hair, Andrew.
Just had it done?

109
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,967
Nice hair, Andrew.

110
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,242
Andrew.

111
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:46,370
Dad asked to see me.

112
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,831
Nice haircut, Andrew.

113
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:51,376
A lot of work's gone into that.

114
00:12:51,793 --> 00:12:54,588
Keep him out there
till we get the call.

115
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:03,473
God.

116
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:05,850
Okay, time for work.

117
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,644
I need you to stop whining
and sort yourself out.

118
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:09,729
Why?

119
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,733
Because you are going
to have to speak to her.

120
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:14,235
- To who?
- To fucking...

121
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,779
the woman upstairs.

122
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,531
Why?

123
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:22,494
I told you, she knows me.
She comes in the club all the time.

124
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:23,787
That's why it has to be you.

125
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:25,706
Oh, yes, okay.
What do you want me to say?

126
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,834
Well, you have to say
a lot of things but...

127
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,169
but more importantly,
you have to sound like someone

128
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:32,172
who is gonna kill her
if she fucks about.

129
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:35,008
- I'm not gonna kill her.
- I never said you had to, did I?

130
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:37,511
You just have to sound like
someone who would if they had to.

131
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,221
Well, what do you
want me to say, then?

132
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,390
You have to tell her

133
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,517
that if you get any more
trouble out of her,

134
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,728
you're gonna break
her fucking fingers.

135
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:47,689
I can say that easily.
Why are you making a big deal of it?

136
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:50,318
Because you couldn't scare
a child in the dark.

137
00:13:50,318 --> 00:13:54,573
You have to say it right.
You have to... like you're fucking hard.

138
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:55,782
Okay, let's go.

139
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:57,492
But no, no, no.

140
00:13:57,951 --> 00:14:00,036
Say it to me first.

141
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:01,915
Why?

142
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:04,417
Just... do it, come on.

143
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:05,751
Okay, fine.

144
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:09,923
Any more trouble from you, miss,
and I'll break your fingers.

145
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:13,719
Right, say it again, harder.

146
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,765
Any more trouble from you, miss,
and I'll break your fingers.

147
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:20,018
- That was rubbish.
- Well, how should I say it...?

148
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:22,104
Any more trouble from you,
you fucking bitch,

149
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:24,439
and I'll break your fucking fingers!

150
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:32,991
Like that.

151
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:37,996
Fine. I now understand.

152
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:41,125
Any more shit from you,
and I'll break your bloody fingers!

153
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,836
Yeah, that was...
that was better.

154
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:45,130
Yeah, finally.
Thank you. Anything else?

155
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,092
Yeah, yeah...
we have to let her speak to her dad,

156
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:51,471
and then you're gonna
take the phone off her

157
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:52,972
and tell him we want the money.

158
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:54,307
- A hundred thousand?
- Yep.

159
00:14:54,307 --> 00:14:56,851
- I remember that bit.
- I thought you might.

160
00:14:57,894 --> 00:14:59,396
Now, this bit's very specific,

161
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:02,275
so I want you to read
this bit of paper to her.

162
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:04,276
Okay.

163
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:07,446
No, no, no, no. Read it now,
once, so that you know it.

164
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,210
- Got it?
- Badly written.

165
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,255
- Without commenting on it.
- Of course.

166
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,759
Okay, I've read it.

167
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,012
Let's make some tea.

168
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:52,415
You fucking bastards!

169
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:55,084
Get my hands free,
and I'll cut and kill you!

170
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:03,218
Listen, if we have to go through this
every time I want to speak to you,

171
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:07,348
then David here will have to use
his knife to teach you a lesson.

172
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:10,978
So will you be quiet now?

173
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,153
I want to pour this
into your mouth for you.

174
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:29,247
There's no sugar in this.

175
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,211
Oh, sorry.

176
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:36,297
I broke your nose, didn't I?

177
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,008
What... what do you mean?

178
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:44,098
I mean, pussy,
that I broke your fucking nose

179
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:46,809
with me hands
tied behind me back,

180
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:51,607
so what does that make you
apart from a little pussy?

181
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:53,317
You didn't break it.

182
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:55,736
I think I fucking did.

183
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,911
Now, look, you are our hostage.

184
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:05,957
If you don't give us a hard time,
you will be fine and looked after.

185
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:09,543
<i>However, if you cross us,
I will break your fingers.</i>

186
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:14,133
I'm gonna be speaking to your father,
so will you please be quiet?

187
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:18,303
Can I speak to Arnie, please?

188
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,972
This is you, okay.

189
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,100
No, it doesn't matter who I am.

190
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,560
Yes, I'm with her...

191
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,604
No, you can speak to her
in a second.

192
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:28,022
No, the amount is 100,000!

193
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:31,319
We would like you to put the money
in a bag and give it to your son.

194
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,239
He is to drive alone
to Fleet services on the M3

195
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:35,907
and wait next to the men's toilets.

196
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:37,910
Make sure you
don't send no one else.

197
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,246
Terrible double negative.
Doesn't make sense.

198
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,790
If anything goes wrong
or someone is with him,

199
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,708
your stepdaughter is a dead girl.

200
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,128
You've got two hours.

201
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,215
Yeah, you can, yeah.

202
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:54,679
Yeah, I'm all right.

203
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,806
From the house.

204
00:17:56,806 --> 00:18:00,018
No, they seem like
a bunch of fucking morons.

205
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,312
One of them's called David.

206
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:05,065
And they're a pair of hopeless cunts...

207
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:06,400
Right, you bastard,

208
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,904
we will hurt her if you
don't give us what you want!

209
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,782
<i>What we want!</i>

210
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,579
Big mistake.

211
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:23,962
No one has ever hit me
in the whole of my fucking life.

212
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:27,424
You don't know
who my father is, do you?

213
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:30,928
Do you know what he'll do
to you and David here

214
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:33,639
when he finds out who you are?

215
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:36,435
Every member
of your queer-boy family

216
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:40,147
will be in wheelchairs
for the rest of their fucking lives

217
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:41,857
because they'll have no knees left

218
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,069
because me dad
will cut them out with an axe!

219
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,446
Then they'll get you,
and then they'll kill you,

220
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:49,407
and they'll kill
your family and friends!

221
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:58,167
You're a fucking moron.

222
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,420
Why? I said what you
wanted me to, didn't I?

223
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,799
Because, moron, the reason
I got you to talk in the first place

224
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,509
was because I didn't want
anyone to know

225
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:07,094
it was me who
was keeping her hostage!

226
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:09,806
Now, that plan falls to shit
if you start using my name!

227
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:11,767
- Did I use your name?
- You fucking did.

228
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:15,270
Sorry. It's hard to concentrate when
you're having your life threatened!

229
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,188
It was the first fucking thing you said!

230
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,901
You're never satisfied, are you?
You turn up out of the blue,

231
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:22,820
begging for my help
in something completely illegal.

232
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,158
You're not doing this out of charity,
you self-righteous fuck!

233
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:28,118
I want that house,
and I want you out of it!

234
00:19:28,118 --> 00:19:31,914
I will take Mum's house,
and I will make you fucking eat it!

235
00:19:32,456 --> 00:19:34,918
What the hell's going on?
David, it's dark.

236
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:37,545
Fucking relax.
The meter's run out.

237
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:39,422
I've only just put money in.

238
00:19:39,422 --> 00:19:42,719
This is ridiculous.
What kind of a place still has a meter?

239
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:49,225
Right.

240
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,937
Let's see how long this lasts.

241
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,783
In you go, Andrew.

242
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:04,826
Seems like some idiots
have made the mistake

243
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,288
of kidnapping your stepsister.

244
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:12,085
Son... I've got a job for you.

245
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,991
He's leaving now.

246
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:47,750
Hello.

247
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,085
David.

248
00:20:49,085 --> 00:20:52,965
Yes. I'm very near.

249
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,510
Yes, I've got the bag next to me.

250
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:59,180
Hang on.

251
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:03,810
Look, David, I think this phone's
gonna die on me any second.

252
00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:06,814
Oh, no.

253
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:56,162
I am fucking rich!

254
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,292
I didn't know you had a brother.

255
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:02,919
Nobody does.
That's why I used him.

256
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,004
- Hello.
- Hello.

257
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:05,339
I brought these to celebrate.

258
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:06,965
Peter, brother dearest, this is it.

259
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:09,384
I earn 50,000 pounds,
and Mum's house is all yours.

260
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:11,387
God, you made it work!
You bloody did it!

261
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:12,472
We did it.

262
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:13,848
50,000 pounds. I'll be free.

263
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:15,767
I'll never have to live
in East Sheen again.

264
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,185
I'll have my own independence.

265
00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:18,311
What's it look like?

266
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:20,690
I don't know.
I didn't look inside.

267
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,899
What?

268
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:23,985
I didn't check it.

269
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:35,914
No!

270
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:39,420
Maybe that fuck face
look in the bag.

271
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:48,721
Probably should have checked it.

272
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:50,307
Yes, you fucking should.

273
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:52,392
What does this mean, David?

274
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:56,813
It means that the money
isn't in the fucking bag,

275
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:59,400
is it, Andrew?

276
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:03,488
It means that your dad
probably has a good fucking idea

277
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:06,408
<i>that you are involved.</i>

278
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:09,703
Sorry. What shall we do?

279
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,166
Were you followed?

280
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:14,959
By a car?

281
00:23:15,668 --> 00:23:17,628
I don't think so.

282
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,551
This changes everything.

283
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,512
I still want the house.
That's the deal.

284
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:27,891
<i>That happens when I get the money.
That's the deal.</i>

285
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:29,058
I knew it, backstabber!

286
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:30,811
The minute you asked me
to get involved,

287
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:33,105
I should have handcuffed
myself to the house!

288
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,398
I said when I get the money

289
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:36,067
you could have
my half of the house.

290
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,985
I never mentioned a bag of tissues!

291
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:40,322
This Arnie knows.
He could have thugs at my house!

292
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,324
He doesn't even care,
he doesn't even know.

293
00:23:42,324 --> 00:23:44,201
He doesn't even know
who the fuck you are!

294
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:46,161
The only person he knows
is involved is him!

295
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:47,955
You told me this would be simple.

296
00:23:47,955 --> 00:23:50,124
I can't believe I listened
to you again, again!

297
00:23:50,124 --> 00:23:53,462
Just give me two minutes!
It's only just happened.

298
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:56,089
I'll make it work, Peter.

299
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,340
I'll believe it when I see it.

300
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,842
I'm going outside for a cigarette,

301
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:01,429
and after that I might just
bloody well go home!

302
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:20,993
David?

303
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,081
Have you got a bottle opener?

304
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,751
You'd better disappear
from my presence

305
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:31,963
or I'm likely to hurt you.

306
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:35,759
I'm going to take a look at Tracey.

307
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,012
I don't care.

308
00:24:38,387 --> 00:24:40,557
Just let me alone.

309
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,569
I take it while you
were being a fucking idiot

310
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:51,778
you remembered a mask?

311
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:55,573
Yes, I got one on the way here.

312
00:24:55,573 --> 00:24:57,909
Great, now get out.

313
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:08,547
David?

314
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,552
I've picked up the wrong kind.

315
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:19,058
Get out of my fucking sight now.

316
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,520
Sorry.

317
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,531
There's some bald fuck outside.

318
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,492
Some bald fuck here.

319
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:36,245
You recognize his ass?

320
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:39,332
Never see this mother before.

321
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:42,294
Okay.

322
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:45,672
Tracey is alive.

323
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,590
You go and see who in there.

324
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,969
Arnie want to know right now.

325
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:53,139
I cut them the fuck up.

326
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:56,017
Go and look in the house!

327
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:59,062
Then you can cut this fool.

328
00:26:01,357 --> 00:26:04,109
We don't need his ass no more.

329
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:10,242
You see this cleaver?

330
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:12,035
No, please, no!

331
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:13,078
When I get back,

332
00:26:13,078 --> 00:26:16,958
me, you go play big time, baby.

333
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,751
Real nice.

334
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,004
No, no!

335
00:26:35,604 --> 00:26:36,688
What's that? A boat?

336
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:39,401
No, it's a lemon tree.

337
00:26:40,777 --> 00:26:42,529
It's mine.

338
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:46,617
I'm getting on it, and I am
fucking off away from all of this.

339
00:26:46,617 --> 00:26:48,911
A hoodlum running away
from his underworld pals

340
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,705
to get on a boat
and lead a simple life.

341
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:51,956
How bloody original.

342
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:54,083
Well, you want me gone, don't you,

343
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:57,754
so you can live happily ever after
with that fat pig of a wife of yours?

344
00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:59,465
At least I have a wife, David.

345
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:01,133
So you agree she's a fat pig?

346
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:02,259
No, I bloody don't!

347
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,804
Unlike you, I like the stability
of having a partner.

348
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:07,098
A controller, just like Mum.

349
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:09,893
I couldn't help it
if Mum loved me more.

350
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:11,144
I know you hate me for that.

351
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:13,147
Couldn't really give a shit
who she loved.

352
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:15,149
She still gave me half the house.

353
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:16,984
Charity was always her weak spot.

354
00:27:16,984 --> 00:27:19,237
Just stop talking
for two seconds, will you?

355
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,614
Don't worry, I will.

356
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:22,783
Nothing more to say.

357
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,827
I'm smoking too much
because of you!

358
00:27:58,364 --> 00:28:01,368
I can see you.

359
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:37,617
Peter, I need
your bank account number.

360
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:38,702
Why?

361
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:41,038
We're going to have to get
him to do a bank transfer.

362
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:43,875
- Why can't we use your account?
- I don't have one, do I?

363
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:45,251
I only use cash.

364
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:46,795
I don't have one either.

365
00:28:46,795 --> 00:28:48,046
Why don't you have one?

366
00:28:48,046 --> 00:28:50,049
Me and Rebecca
share a joint account.

367
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:52,218
You've got a bank card.
What's the number on it?

368
00:28:52,218 --> 00:28:54,637
I don't know the number.
Rebecca looks after the card.

369
00:28:54,637 --> 00:28:56,472
God, I should've known.

370
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:58,975
Andrew, tell me,
have you got a bank account?

371
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:01,228
- Yes.
- Fantastic. What's the number?

372
00:29:01,228 --> 00:29:02,938
I don't know.

373
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:06,567
What are we gonna do
if we don't have an account?

374
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,238
I've got an account we can use.

375
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:10,989
Oh, great. Whose?

376
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:12,324
Mum's.

377
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:14,534
What?! That is supposed
to be shut down!

378
00:29:14,534 --> 00:29:16,704
Well, I didn't get round to it.
And a good job, too.

379
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:19,291
You fucker, you're dragging
Mum into criminal activity.

380
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,501
I won't allow it!
It's a simple as that!

381
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:25,255
It's either that
or no money and no house.

382
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:27,341
You're blackmailing me
and dirtying Mum.

383
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:29,844
What if they trace the details
back to Mum's account?

384
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:32,847
Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
'Cause she's dead.

385
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:36,434
You bastard, David!

386
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:44,652
Peter, I didn't mean
to say that... really.

387
00:29:46,195 --> 00:29:49,534
Look, if we don't get the money,

388
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:52,328
then all this
will have been for nothing.

389
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:58,293
That boat is my dream,
and Mum's house is yours.

390
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:00,296
We're both risking a lot here.

391
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:02,047
And I am.

392
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:05,384
You are a pain in the ass
who fucks up everything he touches.

393
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:11,308
Okay, David, but then I want
that account closed.

394
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:12,392
It will be.

395
00:30:12,392 --> 00:30:14,477
I haven't got the account number.
Have you?

396
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:15,646
It's at home.

397
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:18,357
I'll have to wake Rebecca,
she won't like that.

398
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,573
Thank you.

399
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,356
Hello. Hiya.

400
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:56,901
Was she asleep?

401
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:01,823
Sorry.

402
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,909
Are you stressed?

403
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:05,911
Yeah, sorry.

404
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,038
I know, sorry.

405
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:10,375
This is gonna sound
like a strange request.

406
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,128
I need you to get the Mum folder.

407
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,507
I just... I need the details
so I can close it down.

408
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:22,055
No, don't say that.
He just... he just forgot, that's all.

409
00:31:22,055 --> 00:31:24,641
No, I'm not.
I'm not sticking up for him.

410
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:28,646
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

411
00:31:28,646 --> 00:31:30,857
Can I... can I have it, though, please?

412
00:31:30,857 --> 00:31:32,859
Thank you.

413
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:39,450
You fucking cunts!

414
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:43,662
Get me out of this
fucking smelly fucking room now!

415
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:46,082
You fucking bastards!

416
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,586
Take me out of this room, you slags!

417
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:53,590
I've had nothing to eat!
I am not a fucking animal!

418
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,842
Andrew.

419
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:59,514
I knew it was you, you smelly fuck.
You are fucking dead!

420
00:31:59,514 --> 00:32:02,517
David, I've dropped the phone
in some water downstairs!

421
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:04,561
I've seen your face, dead cunt.

422
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:06,772
You're dead,
you're all dead!

423
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:10,902
Ugly, David,
and fat fucking Andrew!

424
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,054
I must be the biggest idiot
out of all of us

425
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,057
for getting involved with you
and for getting you involved.

426
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,643
What are we gonna do?

427
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:43,272
Let me see the phone.

428
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:48,654
It's broken.

429
00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:50,489
I can fucking see that!

430
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:52,825
I'm sorry, it was the pond.

431
00:32:58,038 --> 00:32:59,916
How's your phone?

432
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:06,923
It's run out of battery.

433
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,429
- Okay, have you got a charger?
- Yes.

434
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:12,514
Great. Where is it?

435
00:33:12,514 --> 00:33:14,015
In the club.

436
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:15,808
What the fuck is it doing there?!

437
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:17,310
It's plugged in the wall.

438
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,189
It was a rhetorical question!

439
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:28,949
I'm gonna have to go up
to that village, use a payphone.

440
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:30,701
Won't he recognize your voice?

441
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,036
She knows now, doesn't she?

442
00:33:32,036 --> 00:33:33,954
So none of that means
anything anymore.

443
00:33:33,954 --> 00:33:35,707
I'm not the only one
that makes mistakes.

444
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:36,874
You think you're perfect!

445
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:41,505
Shut up, Peter!
For once in your life, shut up!

446
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:44,550
And take some
fucking responsibility!

447
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:55,062
I take it that that is right?

448
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:10,830
Fucking hell!

449
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:28,309
You blocked me in, you cunt!

450
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,243
What the fuck?

451
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:45,786
What are you doing?

452
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:48,205
What the fuck you doing?

453
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:51,793
Hello, you mother, Arnie.

454
00:34:52,836 --> 00:34:53,962
How many?

455
00:34:53,962 --> 00:34:57,967
Andrew, that guy David,
and some bald mother.

456
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:00,428
What do you want us to do?

457
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:03,514
Okay, I send you details now.

458
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:05,851
Muk Li, get rid of this fuck.

459
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:07,185
What did you say?

460
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:10,815
Arnie coming now,
and he very pissed man.

461
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:16,988
Okay, dumb fuck, we go now.

462
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:19,700
No, please! Please, no!

463
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:23,621
No! Please!

464
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,423
Arnie.

465
00:36:09,423 --> 00:36:11,383
Yes, it's me.

466
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:13,261
Yeah, thanks for that.

467
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:16,389
You never know
when you'll need a tissue.

468
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:21,896
I'll check the account in the morning,
and I'll call you back.

469
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,065
What?

470
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,786
Fuck.

471
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:52,680
What the fuck are you all staring at?

472
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:54,975
Stranger, eh?

473
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:59,480
I've seen a few flash cars
driving through here tonight.

474
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,526
You're up at
the Barnaby cottage, in't ya?

475
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:05,028
What the fuck's
it got to do with you?

476
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,947
You make sure you lock your doors.

477
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:11,452
Strangers don't fare well
in these parts.

478
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:13,162
What?

479
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:16,415
Thorn! Thorn.

480
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,630
You just don't go wandering.

481
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:24,425
That's my advice to you, my lad.

482
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,343
Thanks, great.

483
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,422
Muk Li.

484
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:38,301
You finished?

485
00:38:56,738 --> 00:38:59,284
What the fuck?

486
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:24,395
Shit!

487
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,230
Peter!

488
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,441
Peter!

489
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:43,667
Wake up, you fat fuck.
Where's that bitch and my brother?

490
00:39:58,851 --> 00:40:02,062
I've been gone for less than an hour.
What the fuck's been going on?

491
00:40:02,062 --> 00:40:03,981
Stop squeezing, I can't think.

492
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:07,068
You're not capable of thinking,
you're a fucking idiot.

493
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:10,864
- What happened?
- Ow.

494
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:14,076
Okay, wait.

495
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:15,536
Where's Peter?

496
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:17,956
That's the point. He and your sister
have gone missing.

497
00:40:17,956 --> 00:40:20,041
She was hitting me.

498
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,211
I'm going to hit you in a minute.

499
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,339
Wait. I remember.

500
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,007
<i>Wee were sat at the table</i>

501
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,260
<i>when she started to bang
on the ceiling,</i>

502
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,848
<i>so we both went upstairs
to see what she wanted.</i>

503
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,933
<i>She wanted to use the toilet.</i>

504
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,519
<i>I said it was a bad idea,</i>

505
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,398
<i>but he said we should allow it.</i>

506
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:43,067
<i>I told him we couldn't trust her,</i>

507
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:46,947
<i>so we went in with her.</i>

508
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:51,744
<i>After she'd done a urine,
she said she wanted to wipe herself,</i>

509
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:56,875
<i>and unless we wanted to do it for her,
we'd have to untie her.</i>

510
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,419
<i>Well, I didn't fancy it,</i>

511
00:40:58,419 --> 00:41:00,963
<i>and I don't think
your brother did either.</i>

512
00:41:01,755 --> 00:41:03,758
<i>So we untied her.</i>

513
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:07,386
<i>But that's
when he started to freak out.</i>

514
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:12,685
<i>I don't know why.
There was something in the room.</i>

515
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:14,812
<i>- Weas it a moth?
- Yeah.</i>

516
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:18,775
<i>Well, while we were distracted,
she lunged at me,</i>

517
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:21,278
<i>and I fell out with the door.</i>

518
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,238
<i>It hurt.</i>

519
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:26,157
<i>She was furious.</i>

520
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,746
<i>She grabbed Peter.</i>

521
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,922
<i>And then she came over
and hit me.</i>

522
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:42,468
He's on his own with her.

523
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:46,681
He better be all right
for your fucking sake.

524
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:50,269
I ca... what else can go wrong?

525
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:53,648
Help me!

526
00:41:53,648 --> 00:41:56,317
What the fuck?

527
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,206
Steven?

528
00:42:09,332 --> 00:42:10,751
Do you know him?

529
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:13,420
Yes, I saw him this morning.

530
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,213
He cuts my hair.

531
00:42:16,298 --> 00:42:18,552
What the fuck's he doing here?

532
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:24,474
Wait. You didn't tell him
about this, did you?

533
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:26,392
No.

534
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:30,273
Oh, yes.
No, I did.

535
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:33,401
You really are fucking unbelievable.

536
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:37,072
Who brought you here?

537
00:42:37,072 --> 00:42:41,785
Chinese... Korean?

538
00:42:42,286 --> 00:42:44,414
- Muk Li and Chun Yo.
- Oh, no.

539
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:46,457
Fuck.

540
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:48,961
Where are they?

541
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:50,420
Did you see a bald bloke?

542
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,964
No.

543
00:42:51,964 --> 00:42:54,216
Don't go out there.

544
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:59,222
You'll... die.

545
00:43:15,782 --> 00:43:19,079
Oh, my God.
They've cut him open.

546
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:21,915
Is he dead?

547
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:23,499
What do you think?

548
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:29,048
Well, if they can do that to him,
they can do that to us.

549
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,592
Okay.

550
00:43:35,263 --> 00:43:37,808
That's for everything
you've ever done.

551
00:43:39,852 --> 00:43:42,313
All right, you got here
an hour and a half ago,

552
00:43:42,313 --> 00:43:45,316
which means that, as Arnie
probably knows where we are,

553
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:46,692
he's less than an hour away.

554
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:48,653
Okay, get your ass in gear.

555
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,073
We're gonna find my brother,
grab your sister,

556
00:43:51,073 --> 00:43:53,450
then we're fucking off
back to the city.

557
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,077
Where's my knife?

558
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:03,086
My face!
You've broken my jaw, I know it.

559
00:44:03,086 --> 00:44:05,255
Shut your fucking mouth
and keep walking.

560
00:44:05,255 --> 00:44:07,801
I've got a family. What are you
going to do to me?

561
00:44:07,801 --> 00:44:09,594
I can't understand what you're saying.

562
00:44:09,594 --> 00:44:11,554
Why did you bring me?

563
00:44:11,554 --> 00:44:14,307
Because I couldn't move
me fat cunt of a stepbrother,

564
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:15,893
and when I finally see me father,

565
00:44:15,893 --> 00:44:19,313
he is gonna want to talk to someone,
and that will be you.

566
00:44:19,313 --> 00:44:21,983
Why are we walking in the woods?
I hate woods.

567
00:44:21,983 --> 00:44:24,778
There could be wolves out here.
Have you thought about that?

568
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:28,073
It's so cold. I'm really
temperature-sensitive, you know?

569
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:29,575
What?

570
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:33,913
Tem-pera-ture sen-si-tive.

571
00:44:33,913 --> 00:44:36,415
You had better hope
that we find a phone soon,

572
00:44:36,415 --> 00:44:39,753
or I am gonna stick this knife
in your balls.

573
00:44:39,753 --> 00:44:43,132
Now, keep close to me,
and get a fucking move on.

574
00:44:45,426 --> 00:44:47,721
That's my brother's knife.

575
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:06,367
"Keep off land!"

576
00:45:06,367 --> 00:45:09,120
Obviously
some thick cunt lives here.

577
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,210
I can't climb up with this.

578
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,923
Stop staring at it
and get the fuck over it!

579
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:24,137
We shouldn't even be here.
It says, "Keep off land. "

580
00:45:24,137 --> 00:45:26,597
There's a dead animal.

581
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:40,656
We're going into the woods.

582
00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:46,272
Is anyone there?

583
00:46:46,272 --> 00:46:47,357
What?

584
00:46:47,357 --> 00:46:49,526
Is anyone in the house?

585
00:46:51,027 --> 00:46:52,612
Hello?

586
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:02,207
Right, fuckhead,
if you whinge, cry,

587
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:04,417
or do anything to let the owners
of this house know

588
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:06,711
that I'm gonna kill you,
I'll kill you. Got it?

589
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:08,172
This wasn't even my plan...

590
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,717
A nod of the fucking head'll do.

591
00:47:49,385 --> 00:47:50,970
Hello?

592
00:48:20,588 --> 00:48:23,090
Fucking rubbish!

593
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:46,325
What the fuck are all these?

594
00:49:01,968 --> 00:49:06,139
This isn't normal.

595
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:15,775
Where you going?

596
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,987
I'm going upstairs
to see if there's a phone.

597
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,030
Well, I might run away.

598
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,698
You might run away?

599
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,878
God, I can't take this anymore!

600
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:37,258
I can talk.
I can talk again!

601
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,347
Fucking run now, you cunt!

602
00:50:13,758 --> 00:50:16,510
Definitely won't be able to go
home again.

603
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,097
I should have checked
that bag for the money.

604
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:21,684
Damn it, I would have seen
those tissues...

605
00:50:21,684 --> 00:50:23,185
Andrew, shut up a minute.

606
00:50:23,185 --> 00:50:24,270
What?

607
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,522
Do you know
what Muk Li San looks like?

608
00:50:26,522 --> 00:50:28,316
Yes.

609
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,073
Shit.

610
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,451
Yes, that's him.
What's happened?

611
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,830
He's had his throat cut.

612
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,582
Maybe it was Chun Yo Fu.
They're always arguing.

613
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:45,251
You don't get your throat slit
over an argument.

614
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,631
Something's not right.

615
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:14,395
Oh, my God!

616
00:53:50,588 --> 00:53:52,340
Help! Come down!

617
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,550
Quick, come down!

618
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,970
Fucking idiot.

619
00:54:00,182 --> 00:54:02,684
What the fuck is the matter with you?

620
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:05,980
Why are there peas
all over the floor?

621
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,568
I heard something
underneath that trapdoor.

622
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:10,652
What?

623
00:54:10,652 --> 00:54:13,113
There, there, underneath.

624
00:54:35,096 --> 00:54:37,433
There, there it is.

625
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,604
No, no, no. Don't open it,
don't open it! We'll be killed!

626
00:54:41,604 --> 00:54:44,190
We're in a creepy house
in the middle of nowhere.

627
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,025
There's a trapdoor in the kitchen

628
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:48,279
with a weird noise
coming from underneath.

629
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:52,241
What the fuck do you think
is gonna be down there?

630
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:12,181
See, nothing.

631
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:15,559
It was probably a fucking rat,
which is why only you heard it.

632
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:18,855
Now stop causing
a fucking problem, or I'll tear...

633
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:23,485
What? What?

634
00:55:24,235 --> 00:55:26,739
Why are there hands in the freezer?

635
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:39,921
I think we should go now.

636
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:41,547
Yeah.

637
00:58:20,186 --> 00:58:21,812
Wait!

638
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:27,611
Don't you leave me.
Don't you fucking leave me.

639
00:58:28,278 --> 00:58:30,697
Peter, I'm sorry.

640
00:58:30,697 --> 00:58:33,701
And I won't tell me dad.
I promise you'll be okay.

641
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:35,661
Why should I believe you?

642
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:40,041
Because I'm begging you.
Please, I don't wanna die.

643
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:41,961
Oh, what am I doing?

644
00:58:41,961 --> 00:58:45,214
All you've done is hurt me
or be rude to me.

645
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:46,257
I must be an idiot.

646
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:48,510
Just hurry up
and get me out of here.

647
00:58:49,553 --> 00:58:51,054
He's right bloody there.

648
00:58:51,054 --> 00:58:53,265
Hurry up!
Get a move on!

649
00:58:54,808 --> 00:58:59,064
You fucking bastard!
Get back here now!

650
00:58:59,105 --> 00:59:01,608
Get back here,
you fucking pussy!

651
00:59:01,608 --> 00:59:04,569
Coward! Chickenshit!

652
00:59:11,118 --> 00:59:14,080
What are you looking at,
you ugly fuck?

653
00:59:28,138 --> 00:59:30,558
Please don't say anything.

654
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,952
This is the worst night in my life.

655
00:59:48,954 --> 00:59:49,996
Not only have I met you,

656
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:52,123
I've stumbled
into the only house in the country

657
00:59:52,123 --> 00:59:53,666
with someone worse than you.

658
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:55,127
Shut up, for fuck's sake!

659
00:59:55,127 --> 00:59:57,213
I saved you.

660
00:59:57,255 --> 00:59:59,507
Well, that's your fault, pussy.

661
00:59:59,507 --> 01:00:02,885
Please, Peter, please.
I need you.

662
01:00:02,885 --> 01:00:04,638
Mug!

663
01:00:04,638 --> 01:00:07,308
I knew it. I'm so gullible.

664
01:00:07,308 --> 01:00:10,644
I should have left you.
I'd be miles away by now.

665
01:00:12,605 --> 01:00:14,732
What do you want me to do
with this?

666
01:00:14,983 --> 01:00:16,902
We've gotta kill him.

667
01:00:17,194 --> 01:00:18,654
No, I will not.

668
01:00:18,654 --> 01:00:20,365
Yes, you fucking will.

669
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:22,783
When he wakes up,
he's not gonna be very happy.

670
01:00:22,783 --> 01:00:25,578
We've got to kill him now,
before he comes round.

671
01:00:25,578 --> 01:00:27,539
I can't, I don't know what to do.

672
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:30,501
Just stick it in him,
you fucking weed!

673
01:00:53,986 --> 01:00:55,070
Where?

674
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,490
In his head.

675
01:01:00,493 --> 01:01:02,871
Today!

676
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:07,918
Give me the fucking thing.

677
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:10,171
If you're too much of a wet shit,
I'll do it meself.

678
01:01:10,171 --> 01:01:12,298
Stop calling me names.
I'm not like you.

679
01:01:12,298 --> 01:01:14,091
I know that, little boy!

680
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:16,386
I'm not a little boy.
I'm probably twice your age.

681
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:18,764
Just because I can't murder or kill...

682
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:43,459
Go on! Fucking do it,
you ugly prick!

683
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:45,670
Cut the cunt's head off!
Come on!

684
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:48,172
Fucking do it!
What are you waiting for?

685
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:49,715
You're a fucking man, aren't you?

686
01:01:49,715 --> 01:01:53,220
Or are you just a fucking woman
like all the fucking others?

687
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,304
Come on.

688
01:01:54,304 --> 01:01:55,681
I haven't got all day to wait

689
01:01:55,681 --> 01:01:59,184
for some ugly prick
to kill some scraggy cunt.

690
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:55,399
They've been over this fence.

691
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:57,111
How do you know that?

692
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:00,698
Because that whale
and baby are his family.

693
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:03,909
Let's go.

694
01:04:17,843 --> 01:04:20,136
Can't we stop a moment?
I'm really tired.

695
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:22,723
- No, we can't.
- I'm not used to walking.

696
01:04:22,723 --> 01:04:24,016
I don't care.

697
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:25,768
Should we be
on the lookout for traps?

698
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:26,811
Why?

699
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:30,399
Because we're near a farm.
Don't they always use traps?

700
01:04:34,611 --> 01:04:37,156
- David!
- Shut up!

701
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,247
Okay.

702
01:05:01,642 --> 01:05:04,437
- Who do you think lives here?
- Old MacDonald.

703
01:05:04,437 --> 01:05:06,732
- Who's that?
- Shut up.

704
01:05:06,732 --> 01:05:09,025
Keep your eyes peeled
and be careful.

705
01:05:11,612 --> 01:05:14,949
Do you think we should look inside,
see if they're in the house?

706
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:18,953
Yeah.

707
01:05:20,164 --> 01:05:23,125
What the fuck?

708
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:29,758
What is that?

709
01:05:29,758 --> 01:05:33,928
If I'm not mistaken,
it's a piece of my brother's shoe.

710
01:05:36,014 --> 01:05:39,102
And foot.
Oh, fuck me!

711
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,728
What?

712
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,022
They've cut off his feet.

713
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:47,611
Who's doing this?

714
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,697
Have they got Tracey?

715
01:05:51,699 --> 01:05:56,955
Right, fuck the plan!
Fuck the money!

716
01:05:57,164 --> 01:05:59,082
I need to find my brother.

717
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,419
What was that?

718
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:04,547
That door over there.

719
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:08,218
Don't be long.

720
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:23,485
Peter?

721
01:06:28,616 --> 01:06:30,201
Peter?

722
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:27,225
"The children have found
a young man tied up in the barn.

723
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:30,019
"He had no face.

724
01:07:30,603 --> 01:07:35,401
"I think he's going to hurt us.
We will try to flee tonight.

725
01:07:35,568 --> 01:07:38,070
Must stop.
He is coming. "

726
01:07:42,909 --> 01:07:45,704
What the hell is this place?

727
01:08:23,288 --> 01:08:24,915
Tracey?

728
01:08:24,999 --> 01:08:27,001
Tracey?

729
01:08:30,129 --> 01:08:32,423
David. Dav...

730
01:08:33,007 --> 01:08:34,592
David.

731
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:43,436
David, somebody's cut off
Tracey's head.

732
01:08:43,436 --> 01:08:45,981
I know, I'm looking at it.

733
01:08:46,314 --> 01:08:48,609
Should we get out of here now?

734
01:08:48,734 --> 01:08:50,944
I'm not leaving without Peter.

735
01:08:51,653 --> 01:08:53,530
I've found a coat.

736
01:08:59,704 --> 01:09:02,165
I think there's a light in here.

737
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:26,277
Jesus! Mother of fuck!

738
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:52,889
Well, Peter's not here,
so he may still be alive.

739
01:09:54,725 --> 01:09:56,603
That one moved.

740
01:09:57,479 --> 01:09:58,897
Which one?

741
01:09:58,897 --> 01:10:01,107
The ugly one.

742
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,750
What the fuck are you?

743
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:50,372
Oh, God!

744
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:52,750
David!

745
01:12:10,797 --> 01:12:13,507
Hello? No.

746
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:16,679
Dad? Is that you?

747
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:19,974
Oh, please come quick.
We're on a farm.

748
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:23,185
Tracey's dead,
and there's a madman after me.

749
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,546
Peter?

750
01:12:46,546 --> 01:12:48,381
David!

751
01:12:48,381 --> 01:12:50,717
What the hell's going on?

752
01:12:50,717 --> 01:12:52,594
Where are you?

753
01:12:52,886 --> 01:12:55,764
There's a farmer.
He's a lunatic.

754
01:12:55,764 --> 01:12:59,811
He's killed Tracey.
I'm hanging on a hook.

755
01:13:00,228 --> 01:13:02,522
I'm in so much pain.

756
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:04,398
Wait.

757
01:13:04,398 --> 01:13:06,694
I'm trying to get free.

758
01:13:14,704 --> 01:13:17,498
Peter, can you move?

759
01:13:18,624 --> 01:13:20,792
I can't.

760
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:25,048
I'm stuck, pinned to the ground.
I need your help.

761
01:13:25,048 --> 01:13:28,885
Okay, wait there.

762
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:33,223
Okay. I'll wait here.

763
01:14:01,964 --> 01:14:05,011
Okay, David, I'm coming.

764
01:14:05,011 --> 01:14:07,888
Don't worry, I'm coming.

765
01:14:36,212 --> 01:14:38,048
Oh, God.

766
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,343
Oh, this is taking ages.

767
01:14:51,604 --> 01:14:54,484
Oh, hurry up, for fuck's sake.

768
01:15:14,589 --> 01:15:16,299
I'm here.

769
01:15:17,592 --> 01:15:19,470
I know.

770
01:15:21,847 --> 01:15:23,432
You okay?

771
01:15:23,557 --> 01:15:26,728
No, I'm in a lot of pain.

772
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:42,787
This is probably gonna hurt.

773
01:16:11,237 --> 01:16:13,364
I've only got half a foot.

774
01:16:13,364 --> 01:16:14,949
I know.

775
01:16:15,366 --> 01:16:17,870
I found the other half of it
over there.

776
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:20,539
What did you do with it?

777
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:22,165
I lost it.

778
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:25,337
Oh, not to worry.

779
01:16:28,548 --> 01:16:30,425
What a clear night.

780
01:16:32,302 --> 01:16:34,681
You can actually see the stars.

781
01:16:36,099 --> 01:16:40,561
Wow, they're amazing.

782
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:45,735
Peter, I'm sorry.

783
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:48,153
Oh, forget about it.

784
01:16:48,153 --> 01:16:50,865
I don't think even you
could have foreseen this.

785
01:16:56,121 --> 01:16:58,165
What's this?

786
01:16:58,165 --> 01:17:00,585
It's the deed to Mum's house.

787
01:17:00,585 --> 01:17:03,254
Oh, well...

788
01:17:04,088 --> 01:17:06,591
I'm sure we'll both be dead
within the hour.

789
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:10,846
Let's share for the rest of our lives.

790
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:13,432
Sounds like a plan.

791
01:17:14,517 --> 01:17:17,396
Mum would've...
she'd have liked that.

792
01:17:19,648 --> 01:17:21,399
Yes, she would've done.

793
01:18:04,992 --> 01:18:06,702
Fuck this.

794
01:18:06,702 --> 01:18:07,953
I want my boat.

795
01:18:07,953 --> 01:18:10,872
I want to sail on it
and live the rest of my life.

796
01:18:10,872 --> 01:18:13,584
We are not dying here tonight.

797
01:18:14,878 --> 01:18:16,463
Okay.

798
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:39,948
Have you looked for a phone yet?

799
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:42,158
No, not properly.
I was being chased by a madman.

800
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:43,409
I'm gonna look for one.

801
01:18:43,409 --> 01:18:45,245
No, no. Shouldn't we
just try and get away?

802
01:18:45,245 --> 01:18:46,956
It's taken us ten minutes
to get in here.

803
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:48,874
There isn't another house
for miles around.

804
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:50,709
Best thing we can do
is get help to come here.

805
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:52,294
- What shall I do?
- Just wait here.

806
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,380
If the farmer comes back,
just give me a shout.

807
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,466
Okay, be careful.

808
01:18:55,466 --> 01:18:58,093
Yeah, you too.
Don't do anything stupid.

809
01:18:58,093 --> 01:18:59,761
No.

810
01:19:02,806 --> 01:19:05,560
- Peter.
- Yes?

811
01:19:06,103 --> 01:19:07,979
About the greenhouse...

812
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:11,065
I'm sorry.

813
01:21:21,714 --> 01:21:24,719
Holy shit!

814
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,432
Peter! He's outside!

815
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:33,729
Outside. Outside.

816
01:21:37,608 --> 01:21:40,736
- I thought you said he was outside.
- He is outside.

817
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,451
I can't see him.

818
01:21:55,795 --> 01:21:57,713
Did you hear that?

819
01:22:02,677 --> 01:22:04,972
It's a head!
It's Andrew's bloody head!

820
01:22:04,972 --> 01:22:06,933
I can't take this anymore!

821
01:22:06,933 --> 01:22:08,393
We can't get out that way.

822
01:22:08,393 --> 01:22:10,186
We have to go out this way.

823
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:55,071
Oh, do you want this, do you?

824
01:22:56,448 --> 01:23:01,870
You fucking mad, mad bastard.

825
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,420
I swear.

826
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:13,425
If you move one more muscle,
I'm gonna rip this bitch in two.

827
01:23:15,428 --> 01:23:18,806
Okay, Peter, get away
from the trapdoor.

828
01:23:19,265 --> 01:23:22,143
You are going down in the cellar.

829
01:23:22,143 --> 01:23:25,064
Right, Peter, start moving
that dresser over the trapdoor.

830
01:23:25,064 --> 01:23:27,524
We're gonna lock the fucker
down there.

831
01:23:28,775 --> 01:23:30,653
Come on!
Get down now!

832
01:23:30,653 --> 01:23:32,238
Move it!

833
01:23:32,863 --> 01:23:34,783
Move!

834
01:23:37,035 --> 01:23:40,080
Come on,
the fucking pair of you.

835
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,043
I've got a whole book of these photos.

836
01:24:15,329 --> 01:24:18,832
No, David!

837
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,256
No! No! No, no, no! David!

838
01:24:30,721 --> 01:24:33,558
You bastard!
You bastard!

839
01:24:33,558 --> 01:24:36,228
You killed my brother.

840
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:30,565
Oh, you must be joking.
