1
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,467
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,053
y ou'll notice the "fasten
seat belts" sign is on.

3
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,181
Passing through
a little turbulence here.

4
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,684
Unfortunately,
We can't get up over it...

5
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,853
and We can't
get underneath it, so...

6
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,105
just hang in there.

7
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,273
Ex cuse me, miss?

8
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,486
Can I have
a different seat, please?

9
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,489
Oh, I'm afraid
We're full tonight, sir.

10
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,074
y ou're gonna have to stay put.

11
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,243
Thanks anyway.

12
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,563
He's going to make you
help him...

13
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,233
because you're the last.

14
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,161
Listen...

15
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,830
I really need
to change this seat.

16
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,166
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

17
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,837
I'm afraid of heights.

18
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,089
Don't be a pussy.

19
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,351
It's not fair! I Was almost out!

20
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,442
Shit!

21
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,057
I'll get you, my pretty...

22
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,351
and your little soul, too!

23
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,584
One ticket.

24
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,921
Round trip.

25
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,299
Hurry up, boy.

26
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,135
y ou don't Wanna miss the bus.

27
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,122
No screaming
While the bus in in motion.

28
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,910
NoW be a good little doggy...

29
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,245
and go fetch!

30
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,536
Spencer, I Wanna make sure
you understand our situation.

31
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,414
In one Week,
you Walk out of here...

32
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,917
and I expect some changes in
your behavior When you get home.

33
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,587
I knoW you're hearing me.

34
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,672
I put you in here
because you gave me no choice.

35
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,341
Next time, I'll leave you here.

36
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,509
Thanks for the visit, Dad.

37
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,765
Nice job on my kid.

38
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,559
I expected to see
some improvement.

39
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,019
He isn't a Toyota.

40
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,770
What a jerk.

41
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,320
y ou OK?

42
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,114
y eah. Dad just came by
to lay doWn some ground rules...

43
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,282
for When I come home...

44
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,327
no more running aWay, no more
setting his cars on fire.

45
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,494
There are other Ways
to get his attention...

46
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,996
besides bloWing up the garage.

47
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,456
y eah. He barely even blinked.

48
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,668
All he Wants me to do noW
is groW up to be him...

49
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,629
an exact copy.

50
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,465
I don't feel like playing
football and date-raping coeds.

51
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,926
One of these days, you're going
to have to face your father.

52
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,093
Maggie...

53
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,805
look What I found
in Spencer' s room.

54
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,474
A pipe bomb, huh?

55
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,686
That? Just shoWing the kids
survival techniques.

56
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,361
Been confiscating stuff
like this all Week.

57
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,862
Where do they get it?

58
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,281
I'll put this doWnstairs
With the rest of the arsenal.

59
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,408
Weren't the police supposed
to dispose of this stuff?

60
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,245
The police are supposed
to do a lot of things.

61
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,497
-Get your hands off of me!
-Tracy!

62
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,791
-What's the problem?
-She Was beating on another kid.

63
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,042
He Was hitting on me!

64
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,002
She doesn't like
to be touched.

65
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,089
We have a session today, yes?

66
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,632
I have Doc's class.

67
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,800
Work around him.

68
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,469
I'm sorry, sir.

69
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,309
y ou seen this junkie before?

70
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,478
No. He's neW.

71
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,482
Beautiful. Another afternoon
shot doing juvie paperwork.

72
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,733
ScreW that shit.

73
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,944
Let's just scoop him up
and take him to the shelter.

74
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,197
Let the bleeding hearts
do the typing.

75
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,243
That's it. Come on, Tracy.
That's it.

76
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,787
Oh, yeah. She's bad.
The croWd loves her!

77
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:44,955
She's getting ready...

78
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,250
for the heavyweight champion
boxing match of the World.

79
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,751
Hey, hey, hey. Look at her go.

80
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,336
y ou knoW, you are sexy
When you sWeat.

81
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,924
y ou ain't gettin' none, Carlos!

82
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,135
y ou Wouldn't hit a guy
With a handicap, Would you?

83
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,554
Oh, you call it a handicap?

84
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,389
I call it chicken, man!
Come on, let's spar.

85
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,808
-No, no. Forget it, Trace.
-Come on...

86
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,524
Don't tune out. Why don't you
talk back to her for once?

87
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,776
Oh, yeah, right. Like you
talk back to your father?

88
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,571
Let me tell you something.
I stopped talking back...

89
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,656
When it became hazardous
to my health, you knoW?

90
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,659
So, are We set?

91
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,496
y eah. No problem.
I gave the van driver our cash.

92
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,414
As long as We do it before daWn,
We're home free.

93
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,043
We're gonna be livin' large
in Cali before the Week is out.

94
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,629
y ou better be sure, man.

95
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,297
Trust me, all right?
I got it all covered.

96
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,382
I need to get outta here
even more than you do.

97
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,676
y ou don't knoW shit
about needing to get out!

98
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,303
y our family's a picnic,
rich boy!

99
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,014
What? y ou think I hang around
you morons by choice?

100
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,641
Least your father
didn't try to set you up...

101
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,518
With his girlfriend's
older sister.

102
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,311
Don't talk to me about fathers.

103
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,729
y ours come to visit, too?

104
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,815
y eah...
every time I close my eyes.

105
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,790
That did it. y ep. OK.

106
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,333
They caught
one of your star pupils...

107
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,252
beating up
on one of our kids again.

108
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,879
Thought you said
you Were making progress.

109
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,174
I only get tWenty-three minutes
a Week With these kids.

110
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,676
With that kind of attention...

111
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,135
you're lucky
she didn't kill him.

112
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,597
That's a good attitude
for a therapist.

113
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,268
Tracy's got some deep trauma
buried inside of her head.

114
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,895
Conventional therapy
is not going to Work.

115
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,273
And dream therapy is, huh?

116
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,649
y ou're such a hippie.

117
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,319
I can reach these kids
through their dreams.

118
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,363
y ou give me a chance, I can help
you With your little problem.

119
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,365
I don't have a little problem.

120
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,701
I just have
a little reoccurring dream...

121
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,369
and I'm handling it fine.

122
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,788
And you are not being paid
to be a dream doctor.

123
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,331
I'm barely being paid.

124
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,041
That's Why I gotta do
What I think is right.

125
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,459
This is neW.

126
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:55,627
y ou like it?

127
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,382
These are ancient dream demons.

128
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,010
Supposedly they roam
the dreams of the living...

129
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,930
till they find
the most evil, tWisted...

130
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,265
human imaginable.

131
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,686
Then they give him
the poWer to cross the line...

132
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,063
and turn our nightmares
into reality.

133
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,859
Maggie, cops just brought in
another kid. Real mess.

134
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,695
Hasn't sleep for days,
bad case of amnesia.

135
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,447
We need your evaluation
right aWay.

136
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,870
HoW long have you been aWake?

137
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,538
As far as I can remember?

138
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,790
I don't knoW. About three days.

139
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,836
Looks more like three Weeks.

140
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,549
y eah, Well,
that's the Wonder of amnesia...

141
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,052
alWays keeps you guessing.

142
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,428
Where you from?

143
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,222
I don't knoW!

144
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,227
All I knoW
is that Wherever I'm from...

145
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,561
I Was the last.

146
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,771
The last What?

147
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:56,980
Survivor.

148
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,401
Look, do you have any...

149
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,571
caffeine pills or coffee?
Maybe some coke?

150
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,991
I meant the soda.

151
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,079
Sit doWn.

152
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,925
Why do you Want to stay aWake?

153
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,677
Because if I fall asleep...

154
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,805
I'm not Waking up.

155
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,973
Why do you think that?

156
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,642
I don't think it. I feel it.

157
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,689
If I fall asleep...

158
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,107
there's gonna be trouble.

159
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,487
SpringWood.

160
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,491
Water toWer.

161
00:15:56,373 --> 00:16:00,085
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

162
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,546
Bottles of beer on the Wall

163
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,342
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-seven

164
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,219
Bottles of beer

165
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,558
If one of those bottles
should happen to fall

166
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,186
What a case of...

167
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,238
Four thousand five hundred
and sixty-six

168
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,824
Bottles of beer on the Wall

169
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,246
I Won't tell.

170
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,099
NoW you're it.

171
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,518
Remember What you have to do.

172
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,102
y ou got to tag me.

173
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,313
That's it.

174
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,528
Come to Daddy.

175
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,104
Play With me.

176
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,690
Tell me Who I am.

177
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,275
I Won't tell.

178
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,624
Free me, you idiot!
I'm your fucking memory!

179
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:53,050
Oh, shit.

180
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:57,346
Asshole.

181
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,933
What Were you dreaming about?

182
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,187
A room.

183
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,022
A house.

184
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,607
A little girl.

185
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,778
Something about the toWn
from my article.

186
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,948
I remember a Water toWer.

187
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,246
The article...do you remember
Where you got it?

188
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,208
The little girl...
What did she look like?

189
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,085
BroWn hair With...

190
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:29,461
red ribbons.

191
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,050
I don't like it.

192
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,678
There's some connection betWeen
your dreams and his dreams...

193
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,305
and his dreams mean bad neWs.

194
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,474
I knoW you think I'm crazy,
but I can feel it.

195
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,477
Why can't anybody talk about
anything but dreams around here?

196
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,980
I'm so sick of hearing
about this bullshit!

197
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,147
y ou don't believe that.

198
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,650
y ou think solving this boy's
puzzle can help With your oWn.

199
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,110
I don't have a puzzle.

200
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,322
y es, you do.

201
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,824
And although you think
you knoW everything...

202
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,535
you may not be ready to face
What this boy Will shoW you.

203
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,245
I never said I Wanted
to go back there.

204
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,247
I've dealt
With amnesiacs before.

205
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,666
Take you to SpringWood,
it's gonna trigger something...

206
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,293
some spark to help you remember.

207
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,588
I don't need a spark to remember
that it Was a bad place.

208
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:13,964
y ou Want a spark? y ou go.

209
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,216
I'll stay here,
sparkless but happy.

210
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,427
I'll be right there With you.
Don't Worry.

211
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,263
Kelly, We're gonna take
the van for aWhile.

212
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,337
I told you not to let me
fall asleep.

213
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:55,005
Was that too much to ask for?

214
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,761
Go back.

215
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,888
Oh, my God! Pull over!

216
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,056
John, Wake up!

217
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:11,230
Shit. Great.

218
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,816
Funny meeting you here.

219
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,527
Nice driving.

220
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,571
What the hell are you guys
doing here?

221
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,657
Great plan, asshole.

222
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,243
-lt almost Worked, all right?
-I can't believe you people.

223
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:27,454
Pulling a stunt like that.

224
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,665
Oh, my God.

225
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,501
Look, the first thing We have
to do is find a telephone...

226
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,336
and you call Kelly
and tell him Where you are.

227
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,671
y ou understand?

228
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,215
And then We have to figure out
hoW to get you home.

229
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:39,883
Are you listening?

230
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,134
Don't scream at me!

231
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,845
It Was your driving
that almost killed us.

232
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,668
T Wo for a dollar, right here!

233
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:15,878
Get 'em, tWo!

234
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,088
T Wo for a dollar!

235
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,593
First I Want you to find
a phone, call Kelly...

236
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,886
and tell him you're all right.

237
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,387
Then I Want you
to get in that van...

238
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,222
and drive straight back
to the shelter.

239
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,348
Think you can handle that...

240
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,808
or do I have to call
the police?

241
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,606
Get aWay from here. y ou go aWay!

242
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,649
"Or do I have to call
the police?"

243
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,693
She ain't my mother.

244
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,655
We Want some peach cobbler
here and...

245
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,880
-There are no kids.
-What?

246
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,424
ToWn fair...

247
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,092
and there are no kids.

248
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,564
-So What's up, Spence?
-This phone's out of order.

249
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:18,857
So is this toWn.

250
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:19,942
y ou are not kidding.

251
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:24,446
Oh, What beautiful,
adorable children!

252
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,198
Would you like to come
and live With us?

253
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:29,535
It's been so long since
We've had children in the house.

254
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,495
So long.

255
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,705
This time,
I sWear it'll be different.

256
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,457
This time, I'll be careful...

257
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,210
and I'll hide you better,
so that he'll never find you.

258
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,712
Looky, I got your nose! Looky!

259
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:41,880
Ethel!

260
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,718
I Want my children back!

261
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,220

262
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,522
NoW see What you done did?!

263
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,316
Jesus.

264
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,735
-We're in T Win Peaks here.
-Definitely.

265
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:04,903
Have We seen enough?

266
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,238
-y eah.
-Good.

267
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,493
Come on, back in the van.

268
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,245
That's a very good idea.

269
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,663
NoW. Go!

270
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:15,831
Jeez.

271
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:23,964
I hope they make it.

272
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,674
Let's see What they can tell us
at the school.

273
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:29,178
-What?
-Somebody rang those bells.

274
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,096
Lucky us.

275
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,657
Trace, there's a map back here.

276
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,284
Did I say I needed a map?

277
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,828
I can't get over the Way
those people looked at us.

278
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,497
y eah, that Was Weird.

279
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,549
Shit.

280
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,844
Nice going.

281
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,223
Takes talent to travel
in a complete circle.

282
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,891
And you're making me dizzy.

283
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,727
Jeez.

284
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,103
Do you have to do that?

285
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,314
y ou're such a high ho,
you knoW that?

286
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,858
I don't play that shit.
I need all the senses I've got.

287
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,902
Put that fucking thing out.

288
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:28,070
It's hard enough
staying aWake...

289
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,947
Without you lighting up
every ten seconds.

290
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,783
-This relax es me.
-I'll relax you.

291
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,368
I'll just puncture your heart...

292
00:25:34,535 --> 00:25:35,994
mess up these seats.

293
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,246
y ou need to get laid.

294
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:39,039
Would you like the map noW?

295
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,917
No, I don't need any map.

296
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:44,586
No, of course not.

297
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,597
-Why'd you stop?
-Look.

298
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,421
Oh, great.

299
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,300
Give me the map.

300
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,928
Not a Word.

301
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:37,472
Carlos, I asked you for the map!

302
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,293
What is this?!

303
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,094
I asked you for the map.

304
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,846
What?

305
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,184
y eah, Well,

306
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:26,522
Look, you've had tWo chances.
NoW it's my turn.

307
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,194
Dickhead.

308
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,362
Nice.

309
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,299
y ou'll all be expected
to pass...

310
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:57,386
both the Written
and an oral examination.

311
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,888
Don't disturb him.

312
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,017
y ou Will need to study...

313
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,227
this.

314
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,233
NoW the dates.
Got to get the dates right.

315
00:28:11,358 --> 00:28:12,734
Got to keep them in order.

316
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,862
If you get them out of order,
you'll get very confused.

317
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,507
y ou Were here.

318
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:36,675
What?

319
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,263
Welcome...

320
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,683
to Freddy 10 1 .

321
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,270
1493...

322
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,814
Freddy sailed across the sea.

323
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:59,156
These dates, they're all
Within a ten-year period.

324
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,200
What the hell happened here?

325
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:02,993
Freddy happened here.

326
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,246
Here Was the crucial point.

327
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,706
Anybody knoW
What I'm getting at?

328
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,791
Anybody? Hmm?

329
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,211
Come on, people!

330
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:13,045
We covered this!

331
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:17,049
This is Where
they took aWay his child.

332
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:18,383
What child?

333
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,551
Taken aWay...

334
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,386
put in the toWn orphanage.

335
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:22,638
Freddy had a kid.

336
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:31,313
1494...

337
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,107
Freddy came back...

338
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,651
to look...

339
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:36,902
for more.

340
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:45,953
There's no Way out.

341
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,329
Not With you driving.

342
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:49,248
y eah, Well,
you didn't do much better.

343
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,500
No, but at least I did it
in half the time.

344
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,004
Come on. Where are you going?

345
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,798
AWay.

346
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,341
Look, We're just too fried
to see straight.

347
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,509
Let's just find Maggie.

348
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:04,304
I'm not turning myself over
for any adult supervision.

349
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,931
This girl's getting some rest.

350
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:09,852
In fact, I think I see my kinda
neighborhood up ahead...

351
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,019
empty.

352
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,521
y ou knoW, she's losing it.

353
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,356
Sad thing is,
I'm starting to like her.

354
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:15,607
That is sad.

355
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,026
Come on, Trace. Wait up!

356
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:36,879
This is the one.

357
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,714
We'll have it all to ourselves.

358
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,050
-Bet there's no heat.
-No plumbing, right?

359
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,385
y ou'll survive.

360
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,889
Come on.

361
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:30,599
Where you going?

362
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,769
Gonna go upstairs
and find a bed. Man, I'm tired.

363
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,521
I gotta find a bathroom.

364
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,608
This place makes the shelter
look like the Ritz.

365
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,172
Great.

366
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,341
Well...

367
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:10,055
at least it beats the streets,
right, Carlos?

368
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:13,141
Ohh, this is good.

369
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:15,519
I'm gonna get some sleep...

370
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:18,188
and I Will get us out of here
in the morning.

371
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,619
Why do you think that kid
said not to fall asleep?

372
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,246
'Cause he's a lame-o freak.

373
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:37,541
Miss Maggie's pet psycho.

374
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,403
Where the hell are you?

375
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,780
Why aren't you listening
to me, Carlos?

376
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,841
Tracy, Where are you?

377
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,426
Behind you.

378
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:34,765
Mama?

379
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,939
Maybe you don't hear so good.

380
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,485
Maybe I clean out your ears
for you.

381
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,695
No, no. Mama, please,
I've been a good boy.

382
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:49,988
y ou don't understand.

383
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,865
I've been good, Mama!

384
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,952
Don't make me deaf, Mama!
Please! I'm sorry!

385
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:56,119
I'm not.

386
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,638
Oh, Carlos, lend me your ear.

387
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:47,814
Give me my hearing back!

388
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,468
Where is it?

389
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,648
y-you Wouldn't do that,
Would you, man?

390
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:13,817
No, no, no! Please!

391
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:14,985
No, man!

392
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:35,732
Nice hearing from you, Carlos.

393
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,504
I can't find Carlos.

394
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,007
See What's on this TV?

395
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,636
I'm gonna take the van.
I'm gonna look for him.

396
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:13,812
Give me some room!

397
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,150
Don't fall asleep, man!

398
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:19,318
Get out!

399
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:21,278
Spencer, get out, man!

400
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:22,988
Carlos, man...

401
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,741
We Were just looking for you.

402
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,745
Don't fall asleep, man!

403
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,997
Spencer, you stupid stoner!

404
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:42,925
We shouldn't even be here.

405
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:47,179
We're supposed to be
finding out about you...

406
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:49,640
not some dead killer' s kid.

407
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,392
We might be talking
about the same thing.

408
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,103
The Whole toWn's obsessing
on this Krueger character.

409
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:56,605
Don't you start.

410
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:01,026
But Why else
Would they be afraid of me?

411
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:03,862
Why else am I still alive
When everybody else is dead?

412
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:06,615
Skip, skip, skip to my loo

413
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,159
Skip to my loo, my darling

414
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,462
Martha, no running.

415
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:21,839
Everyone hold hands.

416
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,343
Oh, you've come back.

417
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,719
HoW nice.

418
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,013
Do you remember me?

419
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,682
Well, of course I do, my boy.

420
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:34,560
I remember
every one of my children.

421
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:35,853
Especially you.

422
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,480
What a pretty little girl
you were.

423
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,149
And I remember you...

424
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,193
and you.

425
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:44,570
Do you remember
the Krueger child?

426
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:46,071
Of course.

427
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,948
Who Was it?

428
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,492
We're not permitted to disclose
a child's real identity.

429
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,536
Oh, Melissa. Melissa.

430
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:54,663
y ou must let Bobby
have the ball.

431
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:57,708
Come here. That's all right.

432
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,084
We share.

433
00:40:59,209 --> 00:41:02,087
I Wonder Who has a little
bare footie around here?

434
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:03,547
"K. Krueger."

435
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:05,674
Could mean anything
from Kevin to Kyle.

436
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:08,135
All it really means is there Was
a child here by that name.

437
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,972
No. It's me.

438
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:17,019
I'm his kid.

439
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:18,937
That's Why he's kept me alive.

440
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:22,191
He's trying to play
some sick game With me.

441
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:24,693
He is dead, all right?

442
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,445
He's dead,
and you're not his kid.

443
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:29,198
HoW do you knoW?

444
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,866
She remembered me.

445
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,367
She remembered me, too...

446
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,703
and fifty other
imaginary friends.

447
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:36,205
Let's get out of here.

448
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,207
Let's draW a picture.

449
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:40,709
We can draW pictures all day.

450
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,877
There you go.

451
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,463
Clippety-clop, clippety-clop.
Isn't that fun?

452
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,804
I can't believe I found you.

453
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,306
What are you still doing here?

454
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:56,141
I can't find Carlos...

455
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:57,976
and Spencer' s Wasted
at this old house.

456
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,646
We gotta get to them
before Freddy does.

457
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,105
-Who's Freddy?
-I'll tell you on the Way.

458
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,273
Come on!

459
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:06,318
God damn it!

460
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:19,081
All right. Once again.

461
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,500
This is your brain.

462
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,672
This is your brain...

463
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,674
on drugs.

464
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,094
Questions?

465
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,390
y eah! What are you on?

466
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,685
Looks like a frying pan
and some eggs to me.

467
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,730
Hey, Spence.

468

NoW he's gone!

471
00:43:34,865 --> 00:43:36,492

00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,014
Hold on. Hold on to him.

492
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,850
-What's happening to him?
-He's stuck in a nightmare.

493
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,018
And it's kicking
the shit out of him!

494
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,979
-Wake him up.
-He's too Wasted.

495
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:31,523
-Spencer! Jesus.
-lt's Freddy.

496
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,068
We've got to get him out.

497
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:36,653
I'll go into his dream.

498
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,198
I'll try and bring him out
before he gets killed.

499
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:40,365
That's crazy.

500
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:44,912
What do you call that, rational?

501
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:06,266
Right...left.
Right, left, right, left. PoW!

502
00:46:21,114 --> 00:46:22,157
He's getting trashed.

503
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:23,325
I have to go in.

504
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,618
What about Freddy?

505
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:26,620
Freddy Won't hurt me.

506
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:28,205
I'm family.

507
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:29,957
OK, so hoW are you gonna go in?

508
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:31,625
Well...

509
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,253
you're gonna have to lay me out.

510
00:46:35,379 --> 00:46:36,380
What? What is th...

511
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:38,131
-Just fucking lay me out!
-Wait a second!

512
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:41,885
-Doc told me a different Way.
-No time to talk! Just do it!

513
00:46:50,394 --> 00:46:53,105
Jesus Christ.

514
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:02,239
I told you I kneW an easier Way.

515
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:05,492
Concentration meditation.
That's What Doc alWays says.

516
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:08,579
This place is incredible.

517
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:13,250
PoW! Bam! Splat!

518
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:14,418

00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,593
Oh, shit! Spencer!

Come on, John! Let go of me!

523

Boing, boing.

527
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,478
What do you knoW?

528
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:16,688
I beat my high score.

529
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:41,588
Great to be back in business...

530
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:43,423

531
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:53,892
Daddy's Waiting for you,
little girl.

532
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:55,269
Shut the fuck up, man!

533
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:10,409
Spencer' s gone.
I couldn't stop it.

534
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:12,703
John's still in there.

535
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,037
I couldn't Wake him up.

536
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,623
Come on! Snap out of it!
What are We gonna do?

537
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,126
We're gonna pick him up
and get the hell out of here!

538
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,527
Not again.

539
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,445
He's not gonna get me again.

540
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,865
Nothing is gonna
make me get off this bed.

541
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:36,703
Damn it!

542
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:42,876
I hate this house.

543
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:31,717
Up here!

544
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,276
I knoW Why you let me go.

545
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:55,032
Do you think I'm your daddy?

546
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,496
Wrong!

547
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:06,835
But you let me live.

548
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,964
Only long enough for you
to bring me back my daughter.

549
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,132

550
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:16,637

552
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:30,484
Grounded!

553
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:53,924
Oh, my God, Maggie!
What's going on?

554
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:57,010
Come on, Maggie. Let's go!

555
00:52:58,762 --> 00:52:59,972
Come...

556
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:01,807
Let's get out of here!

557
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:03,392
Let's get the hell out of here!

558
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:05,936
It...it's not a boy.

559
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:09,148
It's...

560
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:13,026
Come on!

561
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:15,195
NoW! Come on!

562
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:19,491
Let's go!

563
00:53:29,626 --> 00:53:32,421
y ou forgot
Where you came from, kid...

564
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:36,800
but I knoW Where you're going.

565
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:44,850
It's traveling time!

566
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,823
What's Wrong?
Maggie, get in the van!

567
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,991
Come on!

568
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,204
We gotta get the hell
out of here!

569
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:06,538
Oh, God.

570
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:07,873
Let's go!

571
00:54:30,354 --> 00:54:31,730
Whatever happened...

572
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,649
it Wasn't your fault.

573
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:47,788
Carlos, Tracy, and Spencer...

574
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:50,249
stoWed aWay in the back
of the shelter van.

575
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,751
They Were trying to escape.
Can you believe it?

576
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:55,754
So I took them to the phone.
They Were supposed to call you.

577
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:57,756
John Doe and I Were gonna
check out the school.

578
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:59,675
But Tracy got separated.

579
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,093
And then they ran aWay.

580
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:03,762
What the hell
are you talking about?

581
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:06,765
I'm talking about Carlos
and Spencer and the John Doe!

582
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,809
Kelly, they just disappeared!

583
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:10,435
Been handling
too many cases, Maggie.

584
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:11,895
Those kids Were never here.

585
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:15,440
I Would've remembered
any neW arrivals.

586
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:17,568
Kelly, I'm talking about
forty-eight hours ago.

587
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:18,735
I brought you a John Doe.

588
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,028
Don't tell me
you don't remember that!

589
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:21,864
y ou the one Who's handling
too many cases!

590
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,031
Get some rest, Maggie.

591
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,120
And then...

592
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:31,123
We got back and...

593
00:55:31,248 --> 00:55:33,876
no one remembers John or Carlos.

594
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:38,005
It's like they never existed.

595
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:39,798
I've been hearing strange shit.

596
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:43,302
Like some of the kids
are dreaming about Carlos.

597
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,721
And they don't even
remember him.

598
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:51,643
I remember him.

599
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:53,312
Why?

600
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:55,314
Because I can control my dreams.

601
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:58,233
I'm not fooled
by this thing you saW.

602
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,110
Whatever he is...

603
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:03,322
he's fucking With the line
betWeen dreams and reality.

604
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,949
He didn't just kill Carlos
and the others.

605
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:08,285
He erased them.

606
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:23,759
It's not a boy.

607
00:56:52,663 --> 00:56:53,664
Mother!

608
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:19,022
Shit.

609
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:25,237
y ou're getting ready
to kill somebody.

610
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:26,864
Defend myself.

611
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,493
It's your mind he'll go for.

612
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:35,205
y our fear.

613
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:39,376
I kneW it, I kneW it, I kneW it.

614
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,799
Maggie, What are you doing?

615
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:48,510
Who are they?

616
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,888
Let me have that.

617
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:53,307
-I have to knoW.
-I don't knoW.

618
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,559
I don't knoW Who they Were.
They Wouldn't tell me.

619
00:57:56,477 --> 00:57:58,812
They have rules
about no contact.

620
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:02,649
Oh, there's been contact.

621
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,211
Find me.

622
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:05,379
Find Daddy.

623
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:07,548
y ou're it.

624
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:11,301
Come to Daddy.

625
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,764
I Won't tell.

626
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:16,932
Oh, God.

627
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:27,568
Fred, please...

628
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:29,069
I Won't tell.

629
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,158
We need to talk, Loretta.

630
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:40,664
Go inside, honey.

631
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:44,251
I Won't tell.

632
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,420
I told you never...

633
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,755
never to go in there.

634
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,674
I told you that! I told you.

635
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:04,414
Catherine.

636
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:12,339
y ou Were such a little artist.

637
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:13,465
No, it can't be.

638
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:16,718
I knoW Who I am.

639
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,145
y ou're my blood.

640
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,981
Only you could have
brought me out...

641
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:30,732
in your mind.

642
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:32,985
But you can't be my father.

643
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,237
They took you aWay from me...

644
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:38,574
but I made 'em pay!

645
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:43,036
I took all their children
aWay from them...

646
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:44,246
and noW...

647
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:46,999
that's over.

648
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,294
Come on.

649
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:00,095
The shelter.

650
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:05,976
Time to start all over again.

651
01:02:06,143 --> 01:02:07,686
But this isn't SpringWood!

652
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:16,778
Every toWn...

653
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,947
has an Elm Street.

654
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,361
Tracy girl...

655
01:02:58,445 --> 01:02:59,655
Daddy's home.

656
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:03,367
Daddy...you're dead.

657
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:09,915
I'm home, darling.

658
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:21,927
Come say hello.

659
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,264
I don't Want to, Daddy.

660
01:03:35,566 --> 01:03:38,443
Come on, give Daddy some honey.

661
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:45,617
No one has to knoW.

662
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:55,169
y ou're not my daddy.

663
01:03:58,088 --> 01:03:59,798
Come on, Tracy.

664
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:10,184
Here! Do you love me noW?

665
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:16,732
He's dead!

666
01:04:16,857 --> 01:04:18,484
My daddy's dead.

667
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:27,868
No honey for Daddy?

668
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:37,503
What's With kids today, huh?

669
01:04:37,628 --> 01:04:39,463
No respect.

670
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,673
y ou can't scare me anymore.

671
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:44,343
Oh, you better speak up.

672
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:46,970
Must be my deaf ear.

673
01:04:55,312 --> 01:04:58,023
Kung fu this, bitch.

674
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:06,990
This is my dream,
and I do What I Want.

675
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:09,076
Might be your dream...

676
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:11,829
but it's my rules!

677
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:35,686
Doc...I need to talk to Doc!

678
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:38,272
Come on!

679
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:20,606
Doc? Doc, is that you?

680
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:22,274
y eah, Tracy. Where are you?

681
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:23,942
I'm over here
in one of the lockers.

682
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,235
y ou gotta get me out!

683
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:32,075
Where the hell are you?

684
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:33,327
Right here.

685
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:38,290
y ou taught her a lot...

686
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:42,461
but there's so much more
to learn.

687
01:06:42,586 --> 01:06:44,796
HoW about this, Doc?

688
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:18,288
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...

689
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:22,835
but nothing Will ever kill me.

690
01:07:23,794 --> 01:07:26,964
Well, let's see noW.

691
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:30,050
First they tried burning me.

692
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:36,223
Then they tried burying me.

693
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:46,275
But this...this is my favorite.

694
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:51,488
They even tried holy Water.

695
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,289
But I just keep on tickin'...

696
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:04,501
because they promised me that.

697
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:05,669
They?

698
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:07,379
The dream people.

699
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,673
The ones that gave me this job.

700
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:12,676
In dreams...

701
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:18,265
I am forever!

702
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:19,975
Too bad you're not.

703
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:41,246
Thank God.

704
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,958
I think I've got a Way
to get him.

705
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:48,253
So What's the plan, Doc?

706
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:51,757
Thanks.

707
01:08:51,882 --> 01:08:53,133
y ou can't get him
in the dream...

708
01:08:54,134 --> 01:08:57,137
but if this can come out,
he can come out.

709
01:08:57,304 --> 01:08:59,807
And if he can come out,
he can bleed.

710
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:01,558
-And die.
-Right.

711
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:03,185
HoW Will you knoW
When I got him?

712
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:04,937
I'm gonna find you With this...

713
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:06,438
and then I'm bringing you out.

714
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:08,732
y ou've got to be holding him
to carry him out.

715
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:10,317
I knoW.

716
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,110
He's gonna try and trick you
just like Tracy.

717
01:09:12,986 --> 01:09:14,988
He'll try to use your eyes
to fool you.

718
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:16,657
y ou'll use these.

719
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:17,991
Get the hell outta here.

720
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:19,535
y ou Want to live?

721
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,703
These mean nothing here...

722
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:23,997
but in a dream,
they can be anything you Want.

723
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:27,042
He got inside your head.
y ou get inside of his.

724
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:29,545
That's my job, isn't it?

725
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,631
Be careful. He's good at
finding out What hurts the most.

726
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:33,799
Exactly.

727
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:36,552
That's Why you gotta take me
With you.

728
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:37,886
I can't.

729
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:41,056
It's gotta be me and him.

730
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,060
All right, Doc.

731
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:47,354
Put me in.

732
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:53,569
Strap her in.

733
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,240
Take a deep breath.

734
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:01,160
Good.

735
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:03,162
Ten...

736
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:05,372
nine...

737
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:07,583
eight...

738
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:08,917
seven...

739
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:10,586
six...

740
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:11,920
five...

741
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:13,630
four...

742
01:10:13,797 --> 01:10:14,923
three...

743
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:16,091
tWo...

744
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:18,302
one.

745
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:19,655
Get inside his brain.

746
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:20,484
I'm in his memories.

747
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:33,539
Son of a hundred maniacs

748
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:13,704
y ou ready for it, boy?

749
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:18,417
y ou been a Waste
since the day I took you in.

750
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:21,170
NoW it's time
to take your medicine.

751
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:28,385
Thank you, sir.

752
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:31,889
May I have another?

753
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:39,021
y ou Want to knoW
the secret of pain?

754
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,524
If you just stop feeling it...

755
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:43,734
you can start using it.

756
01:14:50,491 --> 01:14:51,492
Child killer!

757
01:15:11,845 --> 01:15:13,639
We knoW What you Want.

758
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:15,390
I Want it all!

759
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:16,725
Of course you do.

760
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:17,893
Then open up.

761
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:21,230
And you shall be forever!

762
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:50,259
Mommy!

763
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,187
Don't Worry, baby.

764
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:04,690
Mommy just had
to take her medicine...

765
01:16:04,857 --> 01:16:06,984
for snooping
in Daddy's special Work.

766
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:12,406
But you Won't tell, Will you?

767
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:14,700
I Won't tell.

768
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:28,547
But you did tell, didn't you?

769
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:33,844
And noW it's time
to take your medicine.

770
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:40,601
y ou killed my mother!

771
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:47,649
She's got him!

772
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:50,027
Let's get her out of there.

773
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:14,218
I've got you!

774
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:22,935
I had him!

775
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:25,395
Where the hell is he?

776
01:17:28,148 --> 01:17:29,316
Maybe the trip killed him.

777
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:32,152
No...because
I'm still seeing things...

778
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:34,238
the Way I did in my dream.

779
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:36,073
It's not over. Let's go.

780
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,918
The cops Were supposed
to pick this stuff up.

781
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:49,086
I'm glad they didn't.

782
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:50,921
We'll have to hit him
With everything We've got.

783
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:57,469
Check out this knife.

784
01:17:57,594 --> 01:17:59,263
-Hey, put that aWay.
-That's too small.

785
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:06,979
Guess so.

786
01:18:07,104 --> 01:18:08,147
y ou sure that's big enough?

787
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:11,441
Still believe
he's gonna shoW up, huh?

788
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:13,819
Come on, Tracy. Over here.

789
01:18:16,613 --> 01:18:17,906
I can feel it.

790
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,482
y ou're real here.

791
01:18:51,648 --> 01:18:53,275
It Wasn't my fault.

792
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:55,152
It Wasn't.

793
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:59,573
y ou saW What they did to me
When I Was a kid.

794
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,866
y ou saW.

795
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,328
I loved you.

796
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:07,748
And your mother.

797
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:10,584
I tried so hard to be good.

798
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:13,337
I knoW, Daddy.

799
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:16,215
But When they took you
from me...

800
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,091
it Wasn't right.

801
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:20,636
Oh, I kneW you'd believe me.

802
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:23,388
Come to Daddy.

803
01:19:38,695 --> 01:19:39,905
Over here!

804
01:19:41,031 --> 01:19:42,366
I'm OK.

805
01:19:43,283 --> 01:19:44,409
Maggie, Watch out!

806
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:52,876
-Where's the key?
-I don't knoW!

807
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:55,379
The lock's jammed!

808
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:57,381
I didn't need a glove...

809
01:19:57,548 --> 01:19:59,508
to kill your bitch
of a mother...

810
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:03,178
and I don't need one noW!

811
01:20:11,812 --> 01:20:13,564
Come on.

812
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:14,898
Let go.

813
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:23,282
I'll shoW you hoW.

814
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:31,748
Like you shoWed my mother?

815
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:33,000
And Carlos?

816
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:36,044
And Spencer?

817
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:40,048
Give Daddy the glove back,
princess.

818
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:41,216
Never!

819
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:44,511
Give it to me!

820
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:48,974
Gimme the glove!

821
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:54,563
In your dreams!

822
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:14,791
Oh, Daddy, I remember When We
used to hold hands together...

823
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,752
When I Was a kid.

824
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:17,920
