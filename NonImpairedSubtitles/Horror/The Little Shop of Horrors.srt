Everyone knows but no one wants to see.

5
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:34,039
Here? the crime rate is higher than anywhere else.

6
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:36,880
Skid Row, my route.

7
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,804
Little Shop of Horrors

8
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,956

18
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:44,421

The water for irrigation.

00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:52,019
Silent ah? atr? s.

21
00:02:58,472 --> 00:02:59,906
? Why? do not let him sing?

22
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,673
We have a new client.

23
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:08,508
I can not even afford to fire that guy.

24
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:15,552
Mushnick's flowers, pleasures of spring.

25
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,320
? Qu? I can do for you., Dr. Farb?

26

I do not have much time.
Env? Eme two gladioli and ferns.

27
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:25,878
Perfect, two dozen gladioli and a fern in a pot.

28
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:30,159
No no no. Mushnick.
Two gladioli and ferns.

29
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:35,001
You want me to put two gladioli in the pot with fern?

30
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,124
No, a fern. There are three things separately.

31
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,809
They are waiting for.

32
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,211
- What ??
- The filling is gone.

33
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,086
All right. Har? a hole m? s great.

00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:50,892
? S? It wants two crappy gladioli and ferns shit?

35
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:54,693

00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,895
? Qui? N can be a dentist in Skid Row?

37
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,454
All right. Seymour command immediately.

38
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,691
I will not argue with science.

39
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:03,494
It is r? Ask.

40
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:10,299
Now he will have his due. Look.

41
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:15,219
Seymour Krelboin

42
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:19,382
Est? Bamos talking about flowers for the funeral.

43
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:25,302
- I called Mr. Mushnick?
- Do not.

44
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:30,747
Rockefeller called to borrow a Rolls Royce.

45
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:32,228
Listen Seymour.

46
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:37,307
Take two gladioli.
The short right.

47
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:41,591
And you take a fern and take him to Dr. Farb.

48
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,878
?All right? Come.

49
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:49,074

50
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:51,877

00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:02,365
Do not.
I want two dozen carnations.

54
00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:03,444
Carnations.

55
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,564
As you lose your, someone dies.

56
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:10,771
He has had very bad luck, Ms. Shiva.

57
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:16,367
If it had been given? Ado dir not you know? As the same.

58
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:17,690
? Qu? carnations tell me?

59
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:22,211
- He said he wanted to roses?
- S ?, Stanley.

60
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:26,253
Carnations.

61
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:31,341
Duty? To see what is? by Seymour.

62
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,217
Here? It has its carnations.
Is the wrap ?.

63
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:35,902
No, me eat? here? same.

64
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,022
? Why? do not?

65
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:45,902
Clear.

66
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,261
- Est n good?
- The best I've eaten.

67
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,143
? His is a small tent? A.

68
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:55,585
Large stores are expensive and pretty flowers.

69
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,707
The better you look, the worse the taste.

70
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:00,633
I like the little known sites.

71
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:04,432
Look to eat the flowers.

72
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,435
Do not say anything if you have not tried.

73
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,239
Look what happened.

74
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:14,160
This is what I refer? A.

75
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:17,674
Look at the quality of their work.

76
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:22,118
If you say goodbye,? D? Nde get? as good a job?

77
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:23,565
? It's going to fire me?

78
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:26,839
No, I will elect you President of the United States.

79
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:28,367
? S ?, is? S fired!

80
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,720
- Gravis, you can not do it.
- Why? do not?

81
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,082
- It's been unintentionally.
- As usual.

82
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:40,250
Like when you sent the bouquet wishing good health to the funeral.

83
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:43,692
... Or when you sent black lilies to the elderly in the hospital.

84
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:48,608
Tambi? N was unintentionally.
But this time I'm serious.

85
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:55,096
But I always try to do the right thing.

86
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,620
I love the flowers.

87
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,773
I like flowers almost as much as Audrey.

88
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:00,382
Very good. Est? S he fired.

89
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,180
- Why? You do not give him a chance?
- The chance to say goodbye.

90
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:05,260
I will not fire.

91
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:06,739
You are very brave.
Est? S he fired.

92
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:10,898
But it's not fair.
Do you know what I'm doing?

93
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:13,748
I'm working on a special plant.

94
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:16,225
It is a plant that has not seen jam? s.

95
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:18,707
I can not even sell the store.

96
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,510
- Out!
- Wait.

97
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,589
If a new plant has to see it.

98
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:24,830
I do not look at the flowers.

99
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:28,227
My ancestors s? They engaged in this, 200 years.

100
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,672
But I have a stinking Skid Row Store.

101
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:32,510
And do I like flowers.

102
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:33,833
Does not understand me.

103
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,753
I have eaten in vase? Ace worldwide.

104
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,397
And those plants m? Extra s? Ace earn m? S money.

105
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,393
? You see ?,? You see?

106
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:43,922
? Qu? This is it?
? A tango?

107
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:48,042
Very good. Tell me more.

108
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:52,319
I remember one with a wall covered with poison ivy.

109
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,962
People see? A very far to see it and buy it.

110
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:56,284
? And due? Or got rich?

111
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,129
No, it scratched? to death in a madhouse.

112
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,446
That was my cousin Harry.

113
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:05,170
According.

114
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:09,413
Come home and brings that plant.

115
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:12,334
Yes? L said to be a attraction? No, you keep your job.

116
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:14,607
If not, you take? both.

117
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:16,888
Do not worry, you like ?.

118
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:41,106
This has been more music to inv annelids.

119
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,587
We continue to serenade the asylum.

120
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:48,545
- Seymour, are you?
- S ?, mom ?.

121
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:53,829
- Come here? and m? rame language.
- I've already seen the language.

122
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,471
? Do you feel sorry for your poor mother?

123
00:08:57,597 --> 00:09:01,831
Ri? Ndote when it has one foot in the grave.

124
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,234
I said unintentionally.

125
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,716
Always unintentionally. M? Rame language.

126
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:09,555
All languages ​​look alike to me.

127
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:13,639
You got the results of my an? Lysis?

128
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:15,676
S ?, the doctor says you have nothing.

129
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:20,005
Dr. Mallard thought always dec? Truth.

130
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,846
He says he could? As the Rams play.

131
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:25,849
I want to die.
Should be assistant medical examiner.

132
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:32,243
I think back to have mumps.
The notice each morning.

133
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,330
That's when you eat the grapes.

134
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:38,132
? Have a surprise for me ??

135
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:39,889
? Brelo.

136
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,652
The t? Nico Dr. Slurpsaddle.

137
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:57,018
For v? To internal or external pain ...

138
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,338
Neuritis, neuralgia, migra? A.

139
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,106
In case of violation, call Traumat? Logo.

140
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:07,108
Alcohol content? Lico 98%

141
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,547
This will do wonders.

142
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:25,797
I notice the heat and Cure? N
Down my body.

143
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:29,231
I'll take my floor.

144
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,351
? That nasty weed from the kitchen?

145
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,279
If you do not like Mr. Mushnick, fire me ?.

146
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:39,475
I think I'm deaf.

147
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:46,561
It looks like your job depends on that floor.

148
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,367
Est? worse than this morning.

149
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:51,127
Eyelet? know what? do.

150
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,724
I throw? To the trash.

151
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,571
I do not like rotten vegetables.

152
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,809
? I get you something?

153
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:02,006
S ?, the peri physician.

154
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:04,569
There is a SELF-contest? Stico.

155
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:07,490
The winner go? the cl? nica May.

Adi? S, Mom ?.

157
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:12,415
Adi? S.
You see? the pink sunset.

158
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:24,376
P? Ngalo in my account.

159
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:33,385
- What? you think?
- Of course it's different.

160
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:35,660
It looks delicious.
But, do not you est? withered?

161
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,382
He is not well.
