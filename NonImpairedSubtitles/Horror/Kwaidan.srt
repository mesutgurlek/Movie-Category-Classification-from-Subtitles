THE BLACK HAIR

17
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:53,788
In old Kyoto there was
a young samurai

18
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:59,724
who had been reduced to poverty
by the ruin of his lord.

19
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:04,501
He decided to leave his home

20
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,536
and take service with the
governor of a distant province.

21
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,036
Goodbye.

22
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,722
Stay weII. I can't Iive here
with you. I have a future.

23
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,486
For men, advancement is the
most important.

24
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,857
I can't give it up
just because of you.

25
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,298
I can't bury my future here.

26
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:08,929
Must you Ieave Kyoto?

27
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:16,105
I'II work harder than before.
I'II weave day and night.

28
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:21,410
I'II sIave for a better Iiving.

29
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,213
If I Iose this chance,
I'II be finished.

30
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,853
Don't try to stop me. The new
post wiII bring me fortune.

31
00:06:33,258 --> 00:06:36,022
If you can remarry a man
of some distinction,

32
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:37,957
you'II have fortune too.

33
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:39,853
There's nothing more to say.

34
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,557
I've had enough of poverty!

35
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:29,205
You're going to Ieave
earIy in the morning.

36
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,873
So you better go to bed now.

37
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:34,810
Take her to the bridaI chamber.

38
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:12,245
My daughter is finaIIy married.

39
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,785
I feeI reIieved now.

40
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:19,090
I'm gIad to have you
in my famiIy.

41
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:22,290
Thank you.

42
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:26,365
He knows his obIigation.
He'II serve her weII.

43
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:31,832
PIease, take care of my daughter.

44
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:33,344
Yes.

45
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:14,804
The samurai could not understand
the value of love.

46
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:18,114
He divorced his good wife

47
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,186
and married the daughter of
a noted family to gain position .

48
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:24,378
And he took her
to his new post.

49
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,458
It was the thoughtlessness
of youth

50
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:31,754
and the experience of desire.

51
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:53,820
His second marriage did not
prove a happy one.

52
00:13:55,666 --> 00:14:00,626
His new wife was selfish
and callous.

53
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:06,908
He soon found every cause to
recall with regret his Kyoto days.

54
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,439
Then he discovered he still loved
his first wife -

55
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:17,443
loved her more than he could
ever love his second.

56
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:22,891
And he began to realize
how unfair

57
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:26,396
and how ungrateful
he had been.

58
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,719
Memories of a woman
he had wronged -

59
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:02,595
her gentle speech,

60
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:05,595
her smile,

61
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:08,471
her pretty dainty ways,

62
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:12,338
her impeccable patience...

63
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:16,279
...continuously haunted him.

64
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:53,429
I quit!

65
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:58,769
The same oId game!

66
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:01,936
I'm tired of it!

67
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:06,306
GirIs, you're dismissed.

68
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,557
You better go to bed now.

69
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:28,232
Your husband is stiII reading.

70
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:42,342
How ungratefuI you are!

71
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:49,910
You've gained position because of
my famiIy's sociaI prestige.

72
00:19:51,122 --> 00:19:52,885
You onIy used me.

73
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:56,717
You're aIways cherishing your
oId memories.

74
00:19:57,795 --> 00:19:59,194
You're waIking out on me!

75
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:33,795
The dew won't heIp.

76
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,233
PIease, go to your bedroom

77
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:42,362
and nurse her Iadyship.

78
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:46,936
Nurse her? That's your duty.

79
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:52,309
Don't say that.

80
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,842
She may return to her parents
tomorrow if she wants to.

81
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:04,059
I can't stand seeing her
dissatisfied Iook any more.

82
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,693
TeII her so.

83
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:18,897
After aII, I was young
and thoughtIess.

84
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:22,774
I'II find my ex-wife
whom I deserted

85
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,450
and make amends
for my sinfuI act.

86
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:39,452
The years went by.

87
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:43,765
And his official term expired.

88
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:46,694
It was September 10th when he
reached the street of Kyoto

89
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,566
where his first wife
used to live.

90
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:54,735
It was midnight and the city was
as silent as a cemetery.

91
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:51,818
When did you come back to Kyoto?

92
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,493
Now. Just now.

93
00:25:02,566 --> 00:25:09,768
How did you find your way to me,
through aII those bIack rooms?

94
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,373
Stay seated.

95
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:13,903
Don't bother.

96
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:15,771
I'II get supper.

97
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:17,311
I don't want it.

98
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:24,415
You haven't changed a bit.

99
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:29,150
You Iook just Iike you did before.

100
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:36,398
Your face that I couIdn't
forget for a moment...

101
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:40,694
and your voice that was
so dear to me!

102
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:47,505
Forgive me.

103
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,880
I was crueI. I was a fooI.

104
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:58,283
I deserve your hatred.

105
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:09,089
UntiI the day my officiaI
term expired,

106
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,863
how I Ionged to come back to you!

107
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:17,201
How deepIy I regretted
my seIfishness!

108
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:22,903
How wretched I was without you!

109
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:28,876
How I Ioathed myseIf
for divorcing you!

110
00:26:30,487 --> 00:26:34,583
How Iong I've hoped and pIanned
to make amends!

111
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:37,787
As soon as I became free.

112
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:40,923
I wanted to come back to Kyoto
and find you.

113
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,490
I hurried here in the dark.

114
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:47,697
It's very kind of you

115
00:26:49,706 --> 00:26:51,936
thinking about me so much.

116
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:54,207
Forgive me.

117
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:57,346
PIease forgive me.

118
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:00,541
I was such a fooI!

119
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:03,646
Don't reproach yourseIf.

120
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:12,290
It's wrong to aIIow yourseIf
to suffer on my account.

121
00:27:14,231 --> 00:27:20,101
I aIways feIt that I wasn't
worthy of being your wife.

122
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,762
Don't...

123
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:26,702
I knew that, but I couIdn't heIp
trying to be near you.

124
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:32,243
Anyway, it was very crueI of me
to have divorced you.

125
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,352
It was because of poverty.

126
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:47,989
WhiIe you Iived with me,
you were aIways kind.

127
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,769
Why shouId I think iII of you?

128
00:27:57,941 --> 00:28:01,069
I prayed for your good fortune
every day and night.

129
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:21,790
I'II make amends.

130
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:27,631
Forget it.
You came a Iong way home.

131
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:30,634
What greater happiness
than to see you again...

132
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:39,781
even if onIy for a moment?

133
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,851
OnIy for a moment!

134
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:51,219
Make it the Iength of
seven Iifetimes!

135
00:28:53,196 --> 00:28:55,824
UnIess you forbid it,

136
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,731
I'II Iive with you aIways...
aIways!

137
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:05,704
Nothing shaII ever
separate us again.

138
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:18,850
Your fragrant hair!
It's the same as before.

139
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:34,636
The same gIossy hair...

140
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:39,867
dark eyes...

141
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:43,872
IoveIy nose...

142
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:50,079
soft cheeks...

143
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,652
and...

144
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:40,328
I've forgotten my sorrow.

145
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:50,612
Many things have happened
in Kyoto since you went away.

146
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:53,748
I imagine so.

147
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:57,479
I can't teII you everything
in a night.

148
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:08,496
Soon it'II be dawn.

149
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:21,102
Yes. This room is very dear to me.

150
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:24,745
It was our bridaI chamber.

151
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:35,750
We spent severaI nights here.

152
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:38,285
I don't want to sIeep now.

153
00:31:45,535 --> 00:31:50,666
I want to taIk of the past and the
present and the future with you

154
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:54,910
and feeI as happy as I am now.

155
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:01,242
I aIso feeI as if
this were a dream.

156
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,554
I don't want to sIeep
for a moment

157
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:17,098
so I can keep you forever.

158
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:55,171
THE WOMAN OF THE SNOW

159
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,705
In a village of Musashi Province

160
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:10,649
there lived two woodcutters:
Mosaku and Minokichi.

161
00:38:12,255 --> 00:38:13,984
Mosaku was an old man

162
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:20,289
and Minokichi, his apprentice,
was a boy of eighteen.

163
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:26,830
Everyday, they went to a forest
a few miles away

164
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,527
from the village.

165
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:34,508
One cold day, a great snowstorm
overtook them on their way home.

166
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:19,232
The boatman had left his boat
on the other side of the river.

167
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:23,063
It was no day for swimming.

168
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:39,619
I intended to treat you Iike
the other man.

169
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:46,665
But I couIdn't heIp feeIing pity
for you

170
00:46:47,703 --> 00:46:50,228
because you're so young.

171
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:58,679
You're a handsome boy.

172
00:47:02,017 --> 00:47:06,750
I wiII not hurt you now.

173
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:18,357
But if you ever teII anybody -
even your own mother

174
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:22,234
about what you've seen tonight,
I'II know it.

175
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:27,373
And then I'II kiII you.

176
00:47:33,816 --> 00:47:38,719
Remember that.

177
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:41,913
Understand?

178
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:43,350
I'II be going now.

179
00:48:45,988 --> 00:48:50,550
We seII wood for a Iiving.

180
00:48:54,430 --> 00:49:01,666
You can't work for some time,
not before spring.

181
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:08,006
The terribIe coId night
made you iII.

182
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:13,341
Eat the porridge.

183
00:49:19,355 --> 00:49:23,689
Take care of yourseIf, son.

184
00:49:24,893 --> 00:49:27,555
Or you'II be frozen

185
00:49:28,497 --> 00:49:31,933
and dead Iike that oId Mosaku

186
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:36,432
whose bIood was aII gone.

187
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:42,803
If this happens to you again,

188
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,911
you won't survive.

189
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:50,682
Are you Iistening?

190
00:49:56,358 --> 00:50:00,954
You've said nothing
about that night.

191
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:33,294
A year passed.

192
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:37,955
As soon as he got well,
he resumed working.

193
00:50:40,002 --> 00:50:43,267
Every morning, he went
to the forest alone

194
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:45,703
and returned with bundles
of wood after sunset.

195
00:51:47,102 --> 00:51:50,230
Where are you going
in the evening?

196
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:51,766
Edo.

197
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:54,768
Now?

198
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:57,210
Yes.

199
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:10,859
I Iost my parents.

200
00:52:11,593 --> 00:52:18,021
My reIatives in Edo might heIp me
find work as a servant.

201
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:20,928
Brothers?

202
00:52:22,504 --> 00:52:23,630
None?

203
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:44,922
Come!

204
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:10,578
That's my house.

205
00:53:13,488 --> 00:53:14,955
Why don't you take a rest?

206
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:17,057
There's nobody you have to mind.

207
00:53:17,226 --> 00:53:18,193
But...

208
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:24,230
OnIy my mother and I Iive there.
Come!

209
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:04,836
Your name is Yuki?
I see, I see.

210
00:54:11,146 --> 00:54:17,210
Going to Edo aIone

211
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:22,820
sounds very dangerous.

212
00:54:25,494 --> 00:54:31,763
PeopIe are not aIways kind.

213
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:37,964
Young girIs must be carefuI

214
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:44,945
not to be bothered by bad men.

215
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:02,490
Come eat whiIe it's hot.

216
00:56:10,966 --> 00:56:13,161
And Yuki bore him
three children,

217
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:15,599
handsome and very fair of skin.

218
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:18,329
She acquired a fame for being a
good wife among the villagers.

219
00:56:45,834 --> 00:56:48,826
It seems she never gets oId.

220
00:56:49,004 --> 00:56:50,335
ReaIIy.

221
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:55,368
She's as young today as on the day
she first came into the viIIage.

222
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:57,912
She's a wonder.

223
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:05,786
Were you at the grave?

224
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:10,414
Yes. It's my mother-in-Iaw's
memoriaI day.

225
00:57:10,726 --> 00:57:12,023
That's good.

226
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:17,030
She must be pIeased to see her
nice grandchiIdren

227
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:19,257
praying for her.

228
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:20,934
She's happy.

229
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:24,939
She died praising
her son's wife.

230
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:29,207
It's not very common.

231
00:57:29,645 --> 00:57:30,737
No.

232
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:33,038
UsuaIIy, a mother-in-Iaw taIks iII
of her son's wife.

233
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:35,649
No matter how good the wife is.

234
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:37,045
That's not true.

235
00:57:37,219 --> 00:57:41,815
Thanks to you, I'm happy.

236
00:57:43,258 --> 00:57:46,250
What a happy coupIe,
you and your husband!

237
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,526
He must be happy.

238
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:53,259
He has such a good and beautifuI
woman for a wife.

239
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:54,629
NaturaIIy.

240
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:05,743
What a young wife!

241
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:09,075
Most peasant women age earIy

242
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:12,516
after having three chiIdren.

243
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:15,248
She stiII Iooks Iike a girI.

244
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:18,492
She's a wonder.

245
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:13,815
Put them on.

246
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:17,875
Is it too smaII?

247
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:21,519
And the chiIdren's?

248
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,087
I made them.

249
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:39,537
How nice! AII ready...the sandaIs
for the hoIiday season!

250
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:43,003
If the thongs are too tight,
I'II fix them.

251
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:45,002
Now try them on.

252
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,374
Yes.

253
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:54,651
How beautifuI!
Why the red thongs?

254
00:59:55,257 --> 00:59:56,656
You're stiII young.

255
00:59:56,925 --> 00:59:58,916
I'm a mother of three chiIdren.

256
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:01,119
Red is stiII your coIor.

257
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,055
Your feet Iook beautifuI.

258
01:00:28,824 --> 01:00:30,416
It fits weII.

259
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:34,153
Not too tight, not too Iose.

260
01:00:34,863 --> 01:00:37,195
It's exactIy my size.

261
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,463
Your sandaIs Iook beautifuI
and sturdy

262
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:45,971
so peopIe come to you
for speciaI orders.

263
01:00:47,142 --> 01:00:49,872
This pair is exceedingIy good.

264
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:54,072
I made them so that
they'II match your kimono.

265
01:00:56,084 --> 01:00:58,484
As if I were going away
on a journey!

266
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:06,784
I can't buy you a new kimono,
so at Ieast you have sandaIs.

267
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:15,127
With your sandaIs and my kimono

268
01:01:15,671 --> 01:01:18,401
our chiIdren wiII have
a wonderfuI hoIiday.

269
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:22,001
How is it going?

270
01:01:23,745 --> 01:01:26,339
A few more stitches.

271
01:02:34,983 --> 01:02:37,451
Why are you watching me
so intentIy?

272
01:02:47,762 --> 01:02:51,095
I just remembered
that night ten years ago.

273
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:56,498
It's strange to recaII it now
after so many years.

274
01:02:56,905 --> 01:02:59,237
You're sewing with the Iight
on your face

275
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:02,171
and I'm Iooking up at you
Iike this.

276
01:03:03,611 --> 01:03:05,772
That's why I remembered
that night...

277
01:03:10,885 --> 01:03:12,284
What night?

278
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:16,480
A strange thing happened
that night.

279
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:20,052
I can remember it weII as if it
happened yesterday.

280
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:27,865
I was eighteen then. I never
toId anybody about that night.

281
01:03:29,037 --> 01:03:32,598
I'm not sure it was reaI
or a dream.

282
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:40,545
It was the night that oId Mosaku
was frozen dead

283
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:43,306
as if his bIood were aII gone.

284
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:52,348
I saw with my own eyes a woman
who was bending over him.

285
01:03:54,429 --> 01:04:00,459
And she was bIowing her breath
Iike a white smoke upon him.

286
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:05,205
Then he became stiff and
couIdn't move.

287
01:04:08,109 --> 01:04:12,102
That woman stooped over me, too.

288
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,441
And I got aImost numb.

289
01:04:17,852 --> 01:04:19,649
Then,

290
01:04:20,855 --> 01:04:23,722
the eyes of the horribIe woman

291
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:30,288
Iooked very, very beautifuI.

292
01:04:30,865 --> 01:04:33,095
She was so beautifuI

293
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,102
and white Iike you.

294
01:04:41,309 --> 01:04:42,936
Yes!

295
01:04:44,245 --> 01:04:47,180
You Iooked exactIy Iike her
just now.

296
01:04:51,386 --> 01:04:53,581
That's why I remembered.

297
01:04:54,889 --> 01:04:59,792
Once the memory haunted me
day and night.

298
01:05:00,895 --> 01:05:03,329
I became sick after that.

299
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:15,900
I teII you, it was when I spent

300
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,872
the terribIe snowstormy night
in the ferryman's hut.

301
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:22,915
I saw very cIearIy the weird
woman who kiIIed oId Mosaku.

302
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:32,018
I've never seen in my Iife
a woman as beautifuI and white

303
01:05:32,193 --> 01:05:34,423
as her except you.

304
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:39,489
Of course, she's not a human
being and I was afraid of her.

305
01:05:40,468 --> 01:05:45,929
She was the Woman of the Snow
who was hungry for warm bIood...

306
01:05:48,943 --> 01:05:49,610
...or a dream.

307
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:50,542
...or a dream.

308
01:05:55,783 --> 01:05:57,182
Not a dream.

309
01:06:21,275 --> 01:06:22,765
I...

310
01:06:25,713 --> 01:06:27,613
It was me.

311
01:06:29,851 --> 01:06:31,318
Me!

312
01:06:33,721 --> 01:06:35,279
Me!

313
01:06:44,298 --> 01:06:48,257
It was Yuki.

314
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,844
You promised that night you'd
never teII anybody.

315
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,478
You finaIIy broke the promise.

316
01:07:04,218 --> 01:07:08,348
It was a pIedge for Iife
for both of us.

317
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:14,458
I toId you if you broke it,
I wouId kiII you.

318
01:08:05,746 --> 01:08:09,113
You betrayed me!

319
01:08:15,857 --> 01:08:20,089
Ah, if it were not for those
chiIdren asIeep there

320
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:26,727
I wouId kiII you this moment!

321
01:08:49,624 --> 01:08:51,819
From now on

322
01:08:54,762 --> 01:09:01,395
you'd better take good care
