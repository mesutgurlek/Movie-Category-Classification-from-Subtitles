1
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,310
What the hell
is this mess?

2
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:19,479
She did this.

3
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,231
It means something,

4
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,525
the way it's all
set up like that.

5
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,362
The Governor was right
to send us out.

6
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,155
Damn straight, Tim.

7
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:32,909
We're doing a righteous
public service here.

8
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,078
Go back.

9
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,746
What?

10
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,458
The arms are a G.

11
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,377
The legs make an O.

12
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:44,295
And that's a back.
It says, "Go back."

13
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:50,719
This is too good.

14
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,263
Look at this.

15
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,724
She sent us
a biter-gram, y'all.

16
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:00,228
I don't believe
this is happening.

17
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:05,275
Hey, hey!
You knock it off.

18
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:07,819
What the hell's
wrong with you?

19
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,029
Now, the Governor
chose you

20
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,532
'cause he thought
you were ready.

21
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:15,410
I want you to succeed.
I do.

22
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:17,871
But if you keep
announcing to the world

23
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,748
that you're pissing
your pants,

24
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,292
I'm gonna have to
smash your teeth in.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,840
Now how do you say
your last name?

26
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,508
Gargulio.

27
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:34,929
Well, I'm gonna keep
calling you Neil.

28
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,849
All right?

29
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:46,608
What's the deal,
Michonne? Hmm?

30
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:50,028
You gonna leap out of the woods,
1 against 4,

31
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,738
all of us armed
to the teeth

32
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:55,241
and you with just
your little pig-sticker?

33
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:57,577
No, no, no, Michonne.

34
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,441
We having fun yet?!

35
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,357
Hello?
Is-- is someone there?

36
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,693
Yes. Yes.
Who is--?

37
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,194
Oh, my God!

38
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,821
I can't believe
someone picked up.

39
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,699
We've been calling since--
since it all started.

40
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,200
Where are you?

41
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,035
I can't say.

42
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,162
You could be
1,000 miles away.

43
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,498
I'm not going to say
where we are.

44
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,500
Are you--

45
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,752
are you someplace safe?

46
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,546
Yeah.

47
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,549
And part of it
is because we're careful.

48
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,509
I can't tell you
where we are.

49
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,094
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:41,389
What ma-- what makes
your place so safe?

51
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,391
It's just...

52
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,435
away...

53
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,562
from them.

54
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,234
I have a son.

55
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:02,410
I-- I have a newborn baby.

56
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,538
I'm with a good group
of people.

57
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,415
Would you be willing--

58
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,461
could you take in others?

59
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,923
We can pull our weight.
We can help you.

60
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,758
I'd have to talk
to the group.

61
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,676
Well, put them on.
Let me make a case.

62
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,178
Let me talk to them first.

63
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,763
Please, please,
don't-- don't go.

64
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,767
Just-- please,
we're good people here.

65
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:28,561
We just need some help
and we can help you.

66
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:30,897
- I'll call back in 2 hours.
- Please!

67
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,524
You don't understand.
You don't know.

68
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,196
We're dying.

69
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:42,784
We're dying here.

70
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,510
Everybody okay?

71
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,679
Yeah, we are.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,437
What about you?

73
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:14,148
I cleared out
the boiler block.

74
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,609
How many were there?

75
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,487
I don't know.
A dozen, two dozen.

76
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:23,366
I have to get back.
Just wanted to check on Carl.

77
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,493
Rick, we can handle
taking out the bodies.

78
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,829
- You don't have to.
- No, I do.

79
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,624
Everyone have a gun
and a knife?

80
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,711
Yeah. We're running
low on ammo, though.

81
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,088
Maggie and me were planning
on making a run this afternoon.

82
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,173
Found a phone book
with some places we can hit,

83
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,717
look for bullets and formula.

84
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,510
We cleared out
the generator room.

85
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,512
Axel's there trying to fix it

86
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,222
in case of emergency.

87
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,641
We're gonna sweep
the lower levels as well.

88
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:51,185
Good. Good.

89
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,355
Rick.

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,447
Let's go. She's hit.

91
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,449
Slowed her down.

92
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,785
- Tim and Crowley, they--
- We're close to the red zone.

93
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:10,747
Them shots just pulled
every biter in this area our way.

94
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,583
Let's go. Get up.

95
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,585
Neil!

96
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:19,297
Now you're gonna rise
to the occasion, son.

97
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:21,340
Some serious shit's
going down.

98
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,551
I need you here.
You read me, amigo?

99
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:26,512
- I don't want you to die.
- Yes. Yes.

100
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,598
Get up.

101
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:33,019
Now you know we don't ever
let our own turn.

102
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,645
Never.

103
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,902
Come on.

104
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:42,528
Just do it.

105
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,700
Atta boy.

106
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,702
Come on,
let's get going.

107
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,497
She ain't running,
she's hunting.

108
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,583
So are we.
There we go.

109
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,795
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo,
catch a biter by the toe.

110
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,296
My mother said to pick...

111
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,215
You know you can join in.

112
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,425
They don't bite.

113
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:08,805
That's kind of the whole idea
of the place.

114
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,431
Seems like you also
encourage people

115
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,934
to punch each other
in the face.

116
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,103
The arena.

117
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,979
You didn't like
that much, huh?

118
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:21,109
No, not so much,
but I get it.

119
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,112
Listen, I want to
ask you something.

120
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,072
No.

121
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,366
Okay.

122
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,119
Hold on.
How do you get it?

123
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,079
I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your town.

124
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,580
This is our town.
You stayed.

125
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:37,125
You're part of this now,
so tell me.

126
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:45,466
If it's an escape,
I don't think it's the right one.

127
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,135
It's brutality for fun,

128
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,888
and I think the world's
brutal enough already.

129
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,059
It really
bothered you, huh?

130
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,061
But I do want to be here.

131
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:58,688
So what were you saying

132
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:01,649
before I made you condemn
our sadistic way of life?

133
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:05,069
I want to contribute.
Everyone else does.

134
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,737
Well, Robbie could use
some help in food distr--

135
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,156
I want to work the wall.

136
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,658
I'm a good shot.
I want to stay that way.

137
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,201
Can you use a bow?

138
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,828
I can learn.

139
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,122
Well, I can get
somebody to teach you.

140
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:34,348
-- Hello?

141
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,058
Hello?

142
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,352
You the guy
she was talking to?

143
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,857
Yes.

144
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,775
And you want to come
where we are?

145
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,196
- She said it was safe.
- It is.

146
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,866
No attacks,
no one's been bit,

147
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,619
no one's died,

148
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,705
no one's turned,
no one's gone crazy.

149
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:01,959
Yes, we want to come
where you are.

150
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,503
You could be dangerous.

151
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,672
Have you killed anyone?

152
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:14,931
Yes, people who threatened me
or threatened my group.

153
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,727
How many people
have you killed?

154
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,774
Four

155
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,402
2 outsiders who tried
to draw on me.

156
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,071
One threw me to walkers.

157
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:34,075
The other one,
he was one of our own.

158
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:36,202
He lost it.

159
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,204
Lost what?

160
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,539
Who he was.

161
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,417
He threatened me.

162
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:47,255
He tried to kill me,
so I killed him.

163
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,507
How did you lose
your wife?

164
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,593
How do you know
I had a wife?

165
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,305
You have a boy
and a baby.

166
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,766
Tell me how you lost
your wife.

167
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,528
I don't want to talk
about that.

168
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,117
Hello?

169
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:19,120
Hello?
No!

170
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,873
No!

171
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,927
Thanks for doing this.

172
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:37,138
When the Gov asks me
to do something, I do it.

173
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:38,639
I figure we can
start tomorrow.

174
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,850
There's a training area,
some hay bales.

175
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,476
There's even a bow
you can use.

176
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,978
It was my old one.

177
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,397
You must be pretty good.

178
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,152
Yeah.
My dad taught me.

179
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:52,653
He used to
take me hunting.

180
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,363
He wanted me to be
in the Olympics.

181
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,157
This one was his.

182
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,242
I mean, it's worth
more than my car.

183
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,912
It's... awesome.

184
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,498
So I totally
killed him for it.

185
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,171
That wasn't why
you killed him.

186
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:12,381
No.

187
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:15,384
My dad wasn't himself.
My brother wasn't either.

188
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,265
I had to kill my sister.

189
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,188
Sucks, right?

190
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:29,982
Yeah.

191
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,864
Walker.

192
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:39,992
Cool.
Watch this.

193
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,217
- I got it.
- I can do it.

194
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:57,885
We're not supposed
to go over the wall.

195
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,735
What the hell was that?

196
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,321
That is how it's done.

197
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,073
I said I could do it.

198
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,033
What is wrong with you?

199
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,202
This isn't a game.

200
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,150
May I?

201
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,050
Still feel it.

202
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:24,680
I'm wiggling
my toes right now.

203
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,685
I'm a ghost
from the knee down.

204
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,897
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,649
You saved my life, Rick.

206
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,619
She was sorry for
the things that happened.

207
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,872
She told me that.

208
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,417
She planned
on telling you.

209
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,962
Take your time,
whatever you need.

210
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,881
You carried us.

211
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:01,217
You didn't let us give up.
You got us here.

212
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:03,636
It's not enough.
It's not safe enough.

213
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,472
There isn't anywhere else.

214
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,475
I know you want
to get away from this,

215
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:12,102
but we've run already.

216
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,525
I got a call.

217
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,859
What?

218
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,694
Someone called.

219
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,948
On this phone.

220
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,950
A woman.

221
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,369
She was young.
She was part of a group.

222
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:31,705
She said they had
a safe place.

223
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,880
They said they were just dialing
numbers and I picked up.

224
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:45,052
She said they'd
be calling back.

225
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:48,556
If it sounds right, I want to talk
them into taking us in.

226
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,058
Did she say
where they were?

227
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,352
No, but it doesn't matter.

228
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,106
If it's safe, we'll get there.

229
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,900
Don't tell the rest
of the group, not yet.

230
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,576
I'll sit here with you.

231
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,704
That's something
I'm pretty good at nowadays.

232
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,539
No.

233
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,423
All right.

234
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,284
Move!

235
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,129
Ah!

236
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,309
Check it out, man.

237
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,478
Must have missed it
last night.

238
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,108
It's probably just
one or two of 'em.

239
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,485
Don't look
they got much fight.

240
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,702
They ain't going nowhere.

241
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,162
We'll take care of it
on the way back.

242
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,043
Come on.

243
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,926
You know, my mom,
she liked her wine.

244
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,264
She liked to
smoke in bed.

245
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,766
Virginia Slims.

246
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,731
I was playing out with the kids
in the neighborhood.

247
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,693
I could do that
with Merle gone.

248
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,282
They had bikes, I didn't.

249
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,286
We heard sirens
getting louder.

250
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,541
They jumped on their bikes,
ran after it,

251
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,836
you know, hoping to see
something worth seeing.

252
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:12,176
I ran after them,
but I couldn't keep up.

253
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,181
I ran around a corner

254
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,893
and saw my friends
looking at me.

255
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,395
Hell, I saw everybody
looking at me.

256
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,816
Fire trucks everywhere.

257
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,111
People from
the neighborhood.

258
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,656
It was my house
they were there for.

259
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,993
It was my mom in bed

260
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,287
burnt down to nothing.

261
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,708
That was the hard part.

262
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,378
You know,
she was just gone.

263
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,131
Erased.

264
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,634
Nothing left of her.

265
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,306
People said it was
better that way.

266
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,476
I don't know.

267
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,312
Just made it seem
like it wasn't real, you know?

268
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,943
I shot my mom.

269
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,489
She was out.

270
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,658
Hadn't turned yet.

271
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,038
I ended it.

272
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,207
It was real.

273
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,337
Sorry about your mom.

274
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,134
I'm sorry about yours.

275
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,515
Come on.

276
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:52,025
Come in.

277
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,243
I know why
you want to see me.

278
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,955
You were told we don't
go over unless we have to.

279
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,291
I just...

280
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,710
I wanted
a little practice.

281
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:11,378
Fair enough.

282
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,382
We don't need you
on the wall.

283
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,596
Okay.

284
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,643
I liked the fights.

285
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:36,236
I didn't like
that I liked them.

286
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,780
But you did.
I know.

287
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,785
What?

288
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,245
How?

289
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:49,207
Could have walked out.
You started walking out.

290
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,212
But you stayed.

291
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,090
Just like you stayed
right now to tell me that.

292
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,804
Are you saying
that I like you, too?

293
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:06,099
I think
I'm growing on you.

294
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,855
You rose
to the occasion, kid.

295
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,733
When we get back,
I'm gonna get you a beer.

296
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,443
Come on, she can't have
made it that far.

297
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,779
No, no, no, no.
We're done.

298
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,281
We're gonna grab a car,
haul ass home.

299
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,783
It's been
a good day's work.

300
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,078
But she-- she killed
Tim and Crowley.

301
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,831
Yep, but we messed
her up pretty bad.

302
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,834
Anyway, she's headed
straight for the red zone.

303
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,796
She's as good as dead.

304
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,464
What do we tell
the Governor?

305
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,091
What the hell you think
we tell him?

306
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:40,509
Tell him we killed her.

307
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,552
Like I said, man,
she's as good as dead.

308
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,305
I'm gonna keep going.

309
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,557
She ain't right
in the head.

310
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,434
She's gonna die.

311
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,228
Ain't worth our time.

312
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,188
Definitely ain't
worth our blood.

313
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,856
Now let's go.

314
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,818
This is some serious shit.
That's what you said.

315
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,115
I'm not gonna lie
to the Governor about it.

316
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,120
You're right.

317
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,288
Can't cut corners
on this one.

318
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,751
You've come along
pretty quick there, kid.

319
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,506
How do you say
your name again?

320
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,842
Gargulio.

321
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:27,139
Gargulio.

322
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,057
Hear that bird?

323
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,027
Gargulio.

324
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,023
Hello?

325
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,526
You didn't want to tell
him how your wife died?

326
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,529
No, I just lost her.
But if that's what it takes--

327
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,406
It'd be good.

328
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,200
You should talk
about it, Rick.

329
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,077
That sounds--

330
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,372
how--

331
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,921
how do you know my name?

332
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,822
Clear outside.

333
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,408
All right,
let's take a look.

334
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,660
Hey.

335
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,838
It's a beautiful day.

336
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,748
Glenn, get that duck.

337
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:42,042
- What?
- Get that duck.

338
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,461
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

339
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,422
A kid growing up in a prison
could use some toys.

340
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,969
You were the kind of guy who waxed
his car every weekend, right?

341
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:56,348
No, I wasn't particularly
proud of my car

342
00:25:56,514 --> 00:26:01,102
or my house or my job.

343
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,855
My dog was a wonder
of stupidity.

344
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,316
Lost a fight
with a tree once.

345
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,903
You did this.

346
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,073
I find it hard to believe that you
didn't have a single thing

347
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,575
that you were
proud of before.

348
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,621
I didn't say that.

349
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,416
I had something.

350
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,341
So how long has it been?

351
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,303
<i>Uh, since--</i>

352
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,889
since you had
whiskey this good?

353
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,102
So long,
I can't remember.

354
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:45,355
Well, I'm happy
to forget a lot.

355
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,400
Not just the bad stuff.

356
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,568
Even the good times?

357
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:54,447
I want to be here

358
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:56,449
right now.

359
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:01,496
This glass in my hand,
leaves in the breeze,

360
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,456
talking to you.

361
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,375
I feel special.

362
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,127
An audience
with the Governor.

363
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,837
Ugh.

364
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:11,006
Let's just go with Philip, huh?
I'm off the clock.

365
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,008
Oh, Philip.
That's better.

366
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,760
Makes me feel less
like a lobbyist.

367
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,473
You don't have to be ashamed
about liking the fight.

368
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,559
Or fighting the fight.

369
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,480
I love it.

370
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,318
It's not the only thing,
but nowadays,

371
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,904
it's part of being alive.

372
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,657
Really alive.

373
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,367
Most people don't have it,

374
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,786
what it takes to see
the whole story.

375
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:44,331
Being able to live
with it, to use it.

376
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:48,293
That's why there's a hell of a lot
more of them than us.

377
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,337
Us?

378
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,174
Yeah.

379
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,430
'Cause you have it, Andrea.

380
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,515
You made it.

381
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,436
So enjoy it.

382
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:10,023
Eat, drink, and be merry,
for tomorrow we die.

383
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,608
Oh, I'm not
planning on dying.

384
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:14,611
No, neither am I.
It just happens.

385
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,532
Other things happen.

386
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,061
We just hit the powdered
formula jackpot.

387
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,397
Oh, thank God.

388
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,942
I also got beans, batteries,

389
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:56,194
cocktail wieners,
many mustards.

390
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,738
It's a straight shot back
to the prison from here.

391
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,824
Probably make it
in time for dinner.

392
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,118
I like the quiet.

393
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,578
Back there, back home,
you can always hear them

394
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,747
outside the fence
no matter where you are.

395
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,419
And where is it y'all good people
are calling home?

396
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,757
Merle?

397
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:24,055
Wow!

398
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,183
Hey, back the hell up!

399
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,269
Okay, okay, honey.

400
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,770
Jesus.

401
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,106
You made it.

402
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:39,612
Can you tell me,
is my brother alive?

403
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,281
- Huh?
- Yeah.

404
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:48,580
Hey, you take me to him
and I'll call it even

405
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,957
on everything that happened
up there in Atlanta.

406
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,127
No hard feelings.
Huh?

407
00:29:57,547 --> 00:30:00,133
You like that?

408
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,843
Yeah.

409
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,265
Well, I found myself
a medical supply warehouse.

410
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,142
Fixed it up myself.

411
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:12,312
Pretty cool, huh?

412
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,148
We'll tell Daryl you're here
and he'll come out to meet you.

413
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:17,859
- Hold on. Just hold up.
- Whoa. Whoa.

414
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:20,111
Hold up here.
Hold up.

415
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:23,823
Hey, the fact that we found
each other is a miracle.

416
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,201
Come on, now.

417
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:29,245
You can trust me.

418
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,955
You trust us.

419
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:33,833
You stay here.

420
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:42,717
No!

421
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,139
Hey, hey, hold up,
buddy, hold up.

422
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:50,016
Let go of her.
Let go of her!

423
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,851
Put that gun
in the car right now.

424
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,645
Put it in the car, son.

425
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:59,192
There you go. Now we're gonna
go for a little drive.

426
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,069
We're not going
back to our camp.

427
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,946
No, we're going
somewhere else.

428
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:06,199
Get in the car, Glenn!
You're driving!

429
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,535
- Move!
- Don't.

430
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,203
Okay.

431
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,372
Get up.

432
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,250
That's it.

433
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,155
Oh, that's what
I'm talking about.

434
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,035
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

435
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,746
Yeah, buddy.

436
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,207
What the hell
you need slippers for?

437
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:59,460
You know,
end of the day, relaxing.

438
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,057
All right.

439
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,269
Must have been in
the cell at the end.

440
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:21,482
We checked
everywhere else.

441
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:32,660
That's Carol's knife.

442
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,361
How did you know
my name?

443
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:11,324
Because we know you.

444
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,326
How do you know me?

445
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,329
And you know them, Rick.

446
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,499
The people you were
talking to today,

447
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,668
that was Amy,
Jim, Jacqui.

448
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,337
Lori?

449
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,517
Lori?

450
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,603
Lori? Lori?

451
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,982
What happened, Rick?

452
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,861
Baby, what happened?

453
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:54,367
I loved you.

454
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,830
I loved you.

455
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:05,670
I couldn't put it
back together.

456
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:09,215
I couldn't
put it back together.

457
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,384
I thought it was...

458
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,853
I made a deal
with myself.

459
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,400
I would keep you alive.

460
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:33,030
I'd find a place.
I would fix that.

461
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,991
And then...

462
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,954
I couldn't open that door.
I couldn't risk it.

463
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,750
I was gonna
keep you alive.

464
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,754
Carl, the baby.
And then...

465
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:52,592
I thought
there'd be time.

466
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,635
There's never time.

467
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:59,766
But I loved you.

468
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,268
I love you.

469
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:07,023
I couldn't put it
back together.

470
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,277
I should have said it.

471
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:15,656
I should-- I should
have said it.

472
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,658
Rick.

473
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:20,953
Now you listen to me.

474
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,915
You have a baby.

475
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,792
Our baby.

476
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:29,504
And Carl.

477
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,757
And the others.

478
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,468
I love you.

479
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:37,428
Rick.

480
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:43,309
Can you do that?

481
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,394
Can you do that?

482
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,817
Rick? Rick?

483
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,819
Rick?

484
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:58,324
Rick? Rick?

485
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,862
I lied when I said
I was off the clock.

486
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,865
This is a 24/7 kind of gig.

487
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,993
Should I hide
under the bed?

488
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,203
Not this time.

489
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,014
Company?

490
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,729
Yeah.

491
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,231
We lost all three guys.

492
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:16,110
Tim, Crowley,
the other one.

493
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,905
Gargulio.

494
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:20,907
Jesus.

495
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:24,076
Yeah, she cut Tim down,
put her sword through him.

496
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,996
Then biters got
in the middle of it,

497
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,874
then I got her.

498
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,668
Damn.

499
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:36,088
Well, we'll dress it up.
Give 'em a hero's funeral.

500
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:39,634
You tell a story.
A supply run gone sideways.

501
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,594
Do you have 'em?

502
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:47,391
Her head.
The sword.

503
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:52,355
Um, we got caught
in a crowd.

504
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,441
The kid had the head,
Crowley had the sword.

505
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:58,694
They both got all tore up.

506
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,448
I got something else
for you, though.

507
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,784
A guy I used to know
from the Atlanta camp

508
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,119
and his pretty
little girlfriend.

509
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,791
- They know Andrea?
- Mm-hmm.

510
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,671
Anyone else?

511
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:18,673
Don't know.

512
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,883
Found them on
the return trip.

513
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,053
From the looks of 'em,
they got to be set up pretty good.

514
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,473
I'll find out where.

515
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:40,027
Everything okay?

516
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:43,864
Hell, yeah.

517
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:46,469
Hey.

518
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,554
Hey.

519
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:23,482
She looks like you.

520
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:31,657
Hey! Just-- you got her?

521
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:33,784
- Yeah.
- All right.

522
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:36,036
Okay.
