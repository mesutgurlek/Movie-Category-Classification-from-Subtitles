1
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,750
<i>...is not the only
such affliction.</i>

2
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,786
<i>And so we come
to that condition</i>

3
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:55,654
<i>which most often afflicts
the more nervous sex.</i>

4
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,090
Hysteria.

5
00:00:58,092 --> 00:01:00,259
Derived from the Greek
for "uterus".

6
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,594
Much studied
by the French,

7
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,198
it has of late
come under the scrutiny
of our Austrian colleagues.

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,569
Tonight, we'll endeavor
to add a British accent
to this chorus.

9
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,337
Bring in
the patient, please.

10
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,216
As you can see,

11
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:28,153
the patient
is a comely woman
of five and thirty years

12
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,756
who has been under my care
at Bethlehem Hospital.

13
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,159
Of impeccable breeding,
she has suffered much
of her life

14
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,795
from the classic symptoms
of the chronic hysteric.

15
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,464
Who can tell me
what these are?

16
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,631
Lassitude?

17
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,233
Correct.
Another.

18
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,734
The tingling
of the extremities.

19
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:45,504
Yes.
Another.
Convulsions.

20
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,739
Sometimes called
"hysteric fits",

21
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,542
during which the patient
may become violent,

22
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,544
<i>dangerously unmanageable.</i>

23
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,480
<i>Which is why,
as a precautionary measure,</i>

24
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:58,517
I've had her injected
with four grains
of heroin.

25
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,388
<i>One cannot be too careful</i>
<i>when attempting to trigger</i>
<i>a fit in a clinical setting.</i>

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,425
As I shall now
endeavor to do.

27
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,494
<i>Please.</i>

28
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:11,196
I beseech you, sir,
do not.

29
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,731
Shh, shh, shh.

30
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,766
<i>The trigger point...</i>
Help me.

31
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,169
Help me.

32
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,804
One of you, please.

33
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,439
<i>Look at me.</i>

34
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,840
<i>I am not mad.</i>

35
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,910
I am not mad.
Look at me.

36
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:29,515
<i>The trigger point</i>
<i>may be hidden anywhere</i>
<i>in the female anatomy.</i>

37
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:32,317
<i>Most often
upon the breasts.</i>

38
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,199
Do not touch me.
The inner thighs.

39
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,458
Or the ovaries.

40
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,700
Note the clenched fists,
the arched back,

41
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,643
the tonic
and clonic spasms.

42
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,440
Concluding finally

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,070
in a profound
contracture.

44
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,516
<i>Watch yourself.</i>

45
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,451
She's started
her monthly bleeding.

46
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,854
Next patient, please.
Bring in the patient.

47
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:13,425
Any questions?
What of the woman's insistence
that she is not mad?

48
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,295
Just as every criminal
maintains he's innocent,

49
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,864
so does every mad woman
insist she is sane.

50
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,201
But she seemed so...
Reasonable?

51
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,702
Perhaps.
Well bred?

52
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,837
Beautiful?

53
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,440
She is all these things.

54
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,444
<i>And quite mad.</i>

55
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,751
<i>And therein lies
the paradox of insanity</i>

56
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,588
<i>and the great peril
of our profession.</i>

57
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,857
<i>Thus, I caution
you all, gentlemen,</i>

58
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,539
<i>as you embark</i>
<i>on your careers</i>
<i>as alienists,</i>

59
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,365
<i>believe nothing
that you hear</i>

60
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,834
<i>and only one half
of what you see.</i>

61
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,486
Bloody hell.

62
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,940
Hey!
Wait!

63
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,709
Hello there.
Excuse me.

64
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,878
I beg you, stop.

65
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,580
<i>At first,
Da didn't want to stop</i>

66
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,815
on account you may be
a lunatic who escaped,

67
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,984
<i>but I convinced him
you couldn't be</i>

68
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,820
since you're headed
toward the madhouse
and not away from it.

69
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:51,323
Ah, clever deduction.

70
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,059
And you look like a man
who's only lost his way,
not his mind.

71
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,995
Well, I'm grateful.
Thank you.

72
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,731
<i>Are you visiting
someone at Stonehearst?</i>

73
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,333
<i>Actually, going there</i>
<i>to complete my training</i>
<i>as an alienist.</i>

74
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,806
<i>That's a doctor</i>
<i>who specializes</i>
<i>in asylum medicine.</i>

75
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,675
<i>Well, I can tell
you'll be a good one.</i>

76
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:12,044
You have kind eyes.

77
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,446
Aw, thank you.

78
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,596
The madhouse
is just up that hill.

79
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,965
You're certain?
Oh, yes.
Look!

80
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,771
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

81
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,342
Merry Christmas.

82
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,152
Hello?

83
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,596
Hello!

84
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,706
And who the feck
might you be?

85
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,976
Ah, good God.

86
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:54,780
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm-I'm Edward Newgate.

87
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,449
Dr. Edward Newgate,
from Oxford.

88
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,721
Might-Might you let me in?

89
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:06,091
Well, now, that depends.
Were we expecting you?

90
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:10,629
Well, I hope so.
I did send a letter
to the superintendent here.

91
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,865
<i>Must have been
weeks ago now.</i>

92
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,835
Well, the post
isn't regular
this time of the year.

93
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,105
Oh, really? I...

94
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,514
I'm just acting the maggot.
Of course you can
come in, Ted.

95
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:33,585
What kind of Christian would
I be to leave another outside
to freeze his onions off?

96
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,087
And on Christmas Eve
no less.

97
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,524
Well, thank you so much.
I-I do appreciate it.

98
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,094
My name's Finn.

99
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,764
I'm the chief steward.

100
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:49,734
Welcome to our
little madhouse
in the wilderness.

101
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:03,748
Presently we have
200 residents
at Stonehearst.

102
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,153
Sons and daughters
of some of the finest
families in the realm.

103
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,656
We have lords, dukes.
We even have a cousin
of the Queen.

104
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,025
Now, she likes
to finger paint
with her own shite.

105
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,161
There you go, Rosie.

106
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,930
We have a viscount
who's convinced
he has two heads,

107
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,967
and an earl
who thinks
he's a teapot.

108
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,735
Seriously.

109
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,540
Wait-Wait here.

110
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,709
The doctor
will be along shortly.

111
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,778
Right, yes.

112
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,847
<i>Trephination.</i>

113
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,183
An arcane
medical procedure
performed by savages

114
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,886
<i>upon those possessed
of evil spirits.</i>

115
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,055
By boring a hole
in the skull,

116
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:55,660
they believed
it would allow
the demons to escape.

117
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,697
Let us be thankful we live
in more enlightened times,

118
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,799
don't you agree,
doctor...?

119
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,336
Newgate.
Edward Newgate,
from Oxford.

120
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,905
Forgive me
for turning up
unannounced.

121
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:10,609
I did write a letter.
It's just your Mr. Finn
tells me it never arrived.

122
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,611
An Oxford man
is always welcome here.

123
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,815
So,

124
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,652
what brings you
to Stonehearst?

125
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,387
Well, as I wrote
in my letter,

126
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,389
I had hoped
I would observe
your methods in or...

127
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,625
Oh, no, thank you.
Nonsense.

128
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,293
You've had
an arduous voyage.

129
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,261
From the backwaters
of blissful ignorance

130
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,164
across vast oceans
of academic blather

131
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,734
until at last
you've arrived here,

132
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,096
on the shores
of my little kingdom.

133
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,740
And at the dawn
of a new century,
no less.

134
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,657
So,

135
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,825
it's asylum medicine
you wish to practice.

136
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,763
Uh, yes, since as long
as I can remember.

137
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,332
Why?
I'm sorry?

138
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,703
Why not some specialty
that's held in higher regard?
Surgery, for instance.

139
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,805
I don't much care
for blood, I suppose.

140
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,841
Tropical medicine then.
Or problems of the female
anatomy.

141
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,877
<i>Both offer better pay.</i>

142
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,018
Well, I've always
been fascinated
by the troubled mind.

143
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,256
So is a priest
but he at least
is guaranteed heaven.

144
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,358
<i>What do you hope
to gain?</i>

145
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,933
The satisfaction
of helping those
in hell.

146
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:48,473
<i>See, of all the afflictions,
I can think of none more,</i>

147
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,975
more cruel
than madness, sir.

148
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,846
<i>See, it robs a man
of his reason,</i>

149
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,816
<i>his dignity,
his very soul.</i>

150
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,250
And it does so,

151
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:05,123
so slowly,
without the remorse
of death.

152
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,493
<i>Please, sir.</i>

153
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,463
I have the desire
and the training.

154
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,705
All I lack
is the clinical
experience.

155
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,812
Time for afternoon rounds.

156
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,881
Of course.
I didn't wish
to keep you...

157
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,951
Join me, Doctor.
Thank you.

158
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:37,155
Mr. Finn,
help the doctor off
with his coat, would you?

159
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,099
Thank you.

160
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,935
<i>You'll find us well-stocked
with the usual cases.</i>

161
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,238
Neurasthenia,
dementia praecox,

162
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,908
incurable homosexuality,
epilepsy, melancholia.

163
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,810
But where we differ
from other asylums

164
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,813
is in the social station
of our patients.

165
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,448
All hail
from the finest
families in Europe.

166
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,950
For instance,
Terrance here

167
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,386
is heir to one
of the largest railroad
fortunes in the continent.

168
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,388
And what is the nature
of his disorder?

169
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,824
He suffers
from an utter lack
of interest in trains.

170
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,325
So his family
had him committed?

171
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,961
Interesting case
this one.

172
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,565
Signore Balzoni was thrown
from his horse during a polo
match in Milan

173
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,434
<i>and ever since</i>
<i>he's believed himself</i>
<i>to be an Arabian stallion.</i>

174
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:29,274
He gets a tad agitated
at feeding times.

175
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,409
Please go ahead.

176
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,582
You'll find most
of our patients are here

177
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,218
because they are
embarrassments
to their families.

178
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,419
Outcasts.

179
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:47,091
Signore,
give the gentleman
his arm back

180
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,333
or I shall be forced
to withhold grooming
for a week.

181
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,165
You-You groom him?

182
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,836
Small price to pay
to keep him contented.

183
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,272
Isn't that reinforcing
his delusion?
Yes.

184
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,042
What, you don't attempt
to cure your patients?

185
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,878
Cure them?
To what purpose?

186
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,480
Well, to bring them back
to their senses, of course.

187
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:13,084
And make a miserable man
out of a perfectly happy
horse.

188
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,393
<i>Madame.
Your Eminence.</i>

189
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,629
Is it always
this lively?

190
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,966
Here we do not believe
in sedating our patients

191
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,501
into a stupor
with bromides
and the like.

192
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:35,006
<i>We prefer to celebrate them</i>
<i>in their natural unadulterated</i>
<i>state.</i>

193
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,476
Check.

194
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,881
Mm.

195
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,283
Good afternoon, my lovely.

196
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,653
<i>Nurse.
Nurse?</i>

197
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,656
Has she eaten today?

198
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:56,227
She refuses to eat
until her son returns
from the war.

199
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,931
He was killed in action
in Peshawar, '85.

200
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,300
Have you tried
a feeding tube?

201
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,974
We do not use such
medieval methods here.

202
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,011
I'd hardly
call it "medieval".

203
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,646
What would you
call it then?

204
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,215
Well, a necessary means
of preventing death.

205
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,050
Death cannot be
prevented, Doctor,

206
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,052
any more
than madness cured.

207
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,221
<i>There's no cure
for the human condition.</i>

208
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,543
And it's a foolish
physician who tries.

209
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,264
<i>Suppose I were</i>
<i>to present you</i>
<i>with the following case.</i>

210
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,934
A woman who suffers
from violent fits

211
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,970
triggered by physical
or emotional contact

212
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,307
that she perceives
to be of too intimate
a nature.

213
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,108
Ah, sounds
like hysteria.

214
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,311
What treatment
would you prescribe?

215
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,947
Ah, mustard packs,
I should think.

216
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,182
Is she a patient
or a pickled herring?

217
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:54,252
Pelvic massage?
Potassium bromide?

218
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,355
<i>I'm interested</i>
<i>in your opinion, Doctor,</i>
<i>not some textbook's.</i>

219
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:01,025
Forget bromides.
Open your eyes.

220
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:02,961
Look at her.

221
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,602
So, I ask you again,

222
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:15,106
presented with a woman
of utmost grace
and refinement

223
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,076
within whose breast
roils passion so great

224
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,445
she fears
they will destroy her,

225
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,607
what treatment
would you prescribe?

226
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,387
Music.

227
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,223
Three times
a day, no less.

228
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,493
Bravo, Doctor.
I concur.

229
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,397
There are few therapies
better at restoring
the soul than music.

230
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,134
<i>Her name</i>
<i>is Lady Charles Graves.</i>
<i>Eliza. Mrs. Graves to us.</i>

231
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,136
<i>I presume you know
her husband?</i>

232
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,672
No.
Repugnant chap.

233
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,241
<i>Possesses
a tremendous fortune.</i>

234
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:54,579
Not to mention
many unnatural
appetites.

235
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:58,416
<i>As one would expect,</i>
<i>her hysterical episodes</i>
<i>worsened</i>

236
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,119
<i>following the engagement,</i>
<i>until one night she bit off</i>
<i>his ear</i>

237
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:04,255
<i>and gouged out
his eye with a comb.</i>

238
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,791
So her husband
had her committed.

239
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,393
<i>No, her father.</i>

240
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,194
If it had been up
to the Baronet,

241
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,530
she'd still be at home
in his loving embrace.

242
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,533
In fact, not a week goes by
that I don't receive a letter
from him

243
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,102
<i>threatening me</i>
<i>and demanding</i>
<i>I declare her cured</i>

244
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,138
so she might be remanded
into his custody.

245
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,673
So, you refuse?

246
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,410
For her own safety.

247
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,459
Come, Doctor.
Yes, of course.

248
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,562
We have much to see
before dinner.

249
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,647
May I just say
that your playing
is sublime.

250
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,718
Oh.
Oh, your playing
is sublime.

251
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,688
It's quite sublime.

252
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,492
I'm Newgate.

253
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:17,862
Dr. Edward Newgate.
My name is Edward Newgate.
Doc...

254
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,685
Nurse.

255
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,420
May I have
a glass of water?

256
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,289
Yes, ma'am.

257
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,468
Your playing
is sublime.

258
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,871
What was that,
Mozart, Beethoven?

259
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,940
No, I wrote it.

260
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:39,610
Of course.

261
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,346
Let me introduce myself.
My name is...
Dr. Newgate.

262
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,683
I know.
We don't receive
many visitors here.

263
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,486
We're rather
like a leper colony.

264
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,856
Well, I doubt lepers
are so charming.

265
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,758
<i>I wish you would stop
complimenting me.</i>

266
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,761
It makes me
uncomfortable.
Forgive me, Mrs. Graves.

267
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,596
The last thing
I wish to do
is offend you.

268
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,333
Are you quite certain
you're a doctor?

269
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,669
Yeah, well,
of course I am.

270
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,505
Because I've never known
one to apologize.

271
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,874
Or, for that matter,
give a damn who
he offended.

272
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,843
Well, I-I'm not like
other doctors.

273
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:16,214
I mean, to be honest,
I still haven't gotten
used to being one.

274
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,449
Whenever someone
calls "doctor",

275
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,818
I still turn to see
if they're talking
to the chap behind me.

276
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,590
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you, nurse.

277
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,563
Right.

278
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,238
Remarkable, isn't she?

279
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,006
She should be
on a stage,

280
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:45,009
not languishing
in some asylum.

281
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,678
Forgive me,
I'm Dr. Newgate.

282
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,281
Edward Newgate.
And you are?

283
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:53,918
Let Jael rejoice
with the Plover.

284
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:01,425
Pardon me?
And Hobab rejoice
with Heraclitus.

285
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,861
That is Greek
for the grub.

286
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:11,269
<i>Ah, Newgate.
Tuxedo fits, I see.</i>

287
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,672
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

288
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:17,908
I'm sorry,
but what's
he doing here?

289
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,378
Oh, Jeremiah.
He killed his wife
with a hammer.

290
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,280
Not without
provocation, mind you.

291
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,449
But what's he doing here
in the staff parlor?

292
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,419
When I was
a medical officer
in the war,

293
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,055
we would on occasion
invite the enlisted men
to dine with us.

294
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:34,625
It strengthened the bond
between the men and... kept
morale high.

295
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,794
And I believe
the same principal
applies here.

296
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,930
It's therapeutic
for the patients
to mix with polite society,

297
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:44,068
<i>and, I might add,</i>
<i>for polite society</i>
<i>to mix with them.</i>

298
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,572
Dinner is served.

299
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,847
<i>Good boy.</i>

300
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,419
<i>Good boy.</i>

301
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,455
<i>Good boy.
Good boy.</i>

302
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,527
<i>Tell me, doctor,</i>
<i>what do you think</i>
<i>of our little asylum?</i>

303
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:14,398
Why, it's quite... unlike
anything I've ever known.

304
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,636
Newgate recently took
his medical degree
at Oxford.

305
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:21,806
But why come
all the way here

306
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:25,009
when there are
other asylums
far closer to London?

307
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:29,080
Well, I've always longed
to return to the countryside,
I suppose.

308
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:31,382
You know, I-I grew up
in a farm in Yorkshire,

309
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,651
and, uh, some
of my fondest memories

310
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,373
are of the cows
and chickens that
were my playmates.

311
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,492
<i>You don't have
the Yorkshire man's accent.</i>

312
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,096
Why's that, Ted?

313
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:52,002
Well, my, my,
my parents died
when I was six

314
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:55,473
so I was sent
to an orphanage
in London.

315
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,542
Appalling place.

316
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:03,414
But, I mean, you know,
fascinating if one was curious
about human nature as I was.

317
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,550
In a funny way,
I was quite grateful
to them.

318
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,618
<i>How so?</i>

319
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:14,825
Well, misery has a way
of clarifying one's
convictions.

320
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:19,163
<i>See, it was in the orphanage</i>
<i>that I realized what my life's</i>
<i>work would be.</i>

321
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:22,466
To labor
amongst the wretched
and the friendless.

322
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,538
<i>And to give</i>
<i>these poor souls</i>
<i>some small measure</i>

323
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,808
of hope and kindness

324
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,810
in a world
that knows too little.

325
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,029
Forgive me, I-I seem
to have turned dinner
into a Dickens' novel.

326
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:49,126
Bon appetite.

327
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:52,663
<i>What is this tonight, Finn?
Squirrel?</i>

328
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:55,966
At present
we find ourselves
somewhat modestly provisioned.

329
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,169
A toast to Mr. Finn

330
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:01,038
for providing
such fine victuals
for our Christmas repast.

331
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,907
Mickey Finn.

332
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,643
Mickey Finn.

333
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,280
I'm-I'm sorry.
Is that really your name?

334
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,519
'Tis. Why?

335
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:18,722
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>to slip someone</i>
<i>a Mickey Finn,</i>

336
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,561
<i>you know,
with knock-out drops.</i>

337
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,830
<i>It's quite, quite, uh...</i>

338
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,102
Well, quite.

339
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,911
That never occurred to me.
"Slip someone a Mickey."

340
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,882
That must be
how me da got
me dear old ma

341
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:47,852
to lie still
while he ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah.

342
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,762
You'll forgive me
if I don't find that
at all amusing.

343
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:02,132
No?

344
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:06,036
<i>What would bring</i>
<i>a smile to that puckered-ass</i>
<i>of a mouth of yours?</i>

345
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,838
<i>That will be
enough, Finn.</i>

346
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,178
My apologies.
I meant no offense.

347
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,983
Yeah, well, none taken.

348
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:24,088
That's the Christmas spirit.
Come now.

349
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,993
<i>Let me offer you</i>
<i>a little drink</i>
<i>of friendship.</i>

350
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,596
No, no, no.
I've had quite enough.

351
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,265
Come on,
we're celebrating.

352
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,767
<i>Honestly, Finn.</i>

353
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,937
I'm sure he doesn't mind
raising a glass to our Lord
and Savior.

354
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,072
Do you now, Doctor?

355
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,215
I-I'd be delighted.

356
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:08,198
Oh, dear.
I'm afraid
that will stain.

357
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,267
<i>Soda water
will save it.</i>

358
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,335
Follow me.

359
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,788
You must leave here
immediately.

360
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,058
But I've only
just arrived.

361
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,927
You do not belong here.

362
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,764
Why, I was going to say
the same thing about you.

363
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,100
There's time before
they get suspicious.

364
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,936
They'll assume you went
to your room to change
your shirt, but don't.

365
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:49,106
Leave your things.
Go straight to the stable.

366
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,975
The roan is the most
sure-footed on the moor.

367
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,776
She'll see you
safely back to town.

368
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,645
You want me
to steal a horse?

369
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,647
Lower your voice.

370
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,149
No, not until you tell me
what's going on.

371
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,287
Do as I say.

372
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,823
Leave.
Now.

373
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,292
Eliza.
Eliza, please...

374
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:24,008
Mrs. Graves,
I'm... I'm so sorry.

375
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,490
<i>I didn't mean
to upset you.</i>

376
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:47,898
Mrs. Graves, indeed,
then listen to me.

377
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,067
There's-There's something
I need to tell you.

378
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,445
Help us.
Please.

379
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,258
Get off me.

380
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,228
<i>Help us!
Help us!</i>

381
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,864
Help us.
We need food.

382
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,101
Please.
Please, help us.

383
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,336
Who are you, boy?

384
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,208
I-I'm a doctor.

385
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,476
<i>Liar.</i>
<i>I've never</i>
<i>set eyes on you.</i>

386
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:48,378
Where are you from?

387
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,014
Upstairs.
Before that, you fool.

388
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,115
I'm from Oxford.

389
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,487
You listen to me,

390
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,891
<i>and listen
carefully, boy.</i>

391
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:04,361
You have got to help us
escape from these cages.

392
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,965
<i>We're not mad.
We're not mad.</i>

393
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:11,001
We're not mad.
We're not mad.
Please.

394
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,369
<i>Please help us.</i>

395
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,174
Of course you're not.

396
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,176
You've got to help us.
I will, I will.

397
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,345
First thing in the morning,
I'll consult with Dr. Lamb.

398
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,513
<i>Dr. Lamb?
Are you daft?</i>

399
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,283
If he learns that
you found us, he'll slit
your throat and ours.

400
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,352
You must get the keys.
Let us out.

401
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,454
<i>Please, we're not mad.</i>
All right.

402
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,022
You've got to help us.

403
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,924
I'll see to it
in the morning.

404
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,559
Let us out.

405
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,394
<i>Newgate.</i>

406
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,031
<i>Edward Newgate.</i>

407
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,646
How do you know
my name?

408
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,448
Your letter.

409
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,184
You remember, Benjamin?
It was weeks ago.

410
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:04,586
The young man
who wrote to us
from Oxford.

411
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,557
I remember.
Newgate.

412
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,996
<i>Your letter came
with the last mail delivery</i>

413
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,599
before Lamb
overthrew us.

414
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:18,602
Overthrew you?
<i>Yes.</i>

415
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,604
Overthrew?

416
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,139
<i>What is going on?</i>

417
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:25,375
I am Marion Pike.
Matron.

418
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:29,413
<i>Charles Swanwick.
Chief medical officer.</i>

419
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:33,317
Nurse.
<i>William Paxton,</i>
<i>groundskeeper.</i>

420
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,086
<i>Dr. Benjamin Salt,</i>

421
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:40,357
rightful Superintendent
of Stonehearst asylum.

422
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,462
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

423
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,098
If you really are
the superintendent,

424
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,334
then that means
that Dr. Lamb is...

425
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:53,603
A lunatic demon
of the worst kind.

426
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,340
Oh, good God.

427
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,342
<i>God.</i>

428
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,410
What happened?

429
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:03,046
They put something
in our drink, Doc.

430
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,016
<i>Chloral hydrate.</i>
<i>It's-It's a surgical</i>
<i>anesthetic.</i>

431
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:08,118
It's colorless
and odorless,

432
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,421
but lethal
in imprecise doses.

433
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,423
I lost four
doctors that night.

434
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,593
<i>Three of my nurses died.
Poor creatures.</i>

435
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:18,762
<i>They'd been</i>
<i>planning this for months.</i>
<i>Treacherous bastards.</i>

436
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:22,065
Just biding their time
to slip us...

437
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,701
A Mickey Finn.

438
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:26,470
<i>I don't believe...</i>

439
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,672
They give us water,
a pittance of food.

440
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,441
But make
no mistake, Doctor,
we are dying.

441
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,377
We are dying.

442
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,480
<i>You could steal
the keys from Finn.</i>

443
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,648
Ah?
Set us free.

444
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,451
They'd tear us apart
before we'd gone
a hundred yards.

445
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,120
<i>We'll take
our chances fighting.</i>

446
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,522
In our condition,
against their numbers?

447
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,492
<i>There are homicidal</i>
<i>maniacs upstairs</i>
<i>with guns, Charles.</i>

448
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:52,462
Look around you.
None of us are fit
to fight.

449
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,798
<i>Some of us are
too far gone already.</i>

450
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,302
There's only
one solution.

451
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:03,707
<i>It's you, Doctor.</i>
<i>You're our only chance.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

452
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,309
Run, boy.
The keys.

453
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,045
<i>Run, boy.
Get to town.</i>

454
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,814
Bring help.
Run.

455
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,749
The keys.

456
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:17,087
Run.
Run, boy.

457
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:27,130
Who is it, Eliza?
I'm frightened.

458
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,499
It's no one, dearest.

459
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,701
Just the Sandman.

460
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,737
Mrs. Graves.

461
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,739
<i>Is he going to try
and make love to us?</i>

462
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,474
Back to sleep.

463
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,315
Mrs. Graves, we must
leave here immediately.

464
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,152
You had your chance
to leave before.

465
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,609
I have found Salt
and the others,
Mrs. Graves.

466
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,841
Do you realize
what would've happened
if you'd been caught?

467
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,742
I have some idea.
You have no idea.

468
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,644
We can argue
about this later.

469
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,847
Right now I need you
to fetch your warmest coat

470
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,682
and meet me in the gazebo
in ten minutes.

471
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,118
We can steal a horse,
and if we're lucky

472
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,853
we can make it
to town and summon help.

473
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,888
Why would you presume
I would go anywhere
with you?

474
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,791
Because I cannot...

475
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,894
I will not leave
without you.

476
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,133
I must go back to bed.
Listen to me.

477
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:39,695
The lunatics
are running
this asylum.

478
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,640
Yes, and I am one of them.

479
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,146
<i>What's this I see?</i>

480
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:02,526
Evening rounds
are finished, Doctor.

481
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:05,368
<i>I was just giving</i>
<i>Dr. Newgate directions</i>
<i>back to his room.</i>

482
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,300
Lost, is he?

483
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:13,703
Ah, yes,
embarrassingly so.

484
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,805
I was looking
for the staff library.

485
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,941
<i>I must have made
a wrong turn.</i>

486
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,946
<i>Well, any event,</i>
<i>I know where</i>
<i>I'm headed now,</i>

487
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:25,515
so I'll bid you all
good night.

488
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,584
Thank you, Mrs. Graves.

489
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:30,353
Finn, see
the young doctor
to his room.

490
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,922
My pleasure.

491
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:34,257
No, no.
Won't be necessary.

492
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,794
Oh, I insist.
And I shall expect you
for morning rounds.

493
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,896
<i>Half past eight.</i>

494
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:42,265
Right.
Of course.

495
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,733
<i>This way, Ted.</i>

496
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,614
Does he suspect anything?

497
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,849
No.

498
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:03,353
We must endeavor
to make sure
it stays that way.

499
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:09,492
Something is
troubling you,
my dear.

500
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:11,728
This cannot last, Silas.

501
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,331
Eventually
we will be discovered.

502
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:17,500
The spring is coming.
People will come.

503
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,669
Visitors.

504
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,504
We cannot just
lock them out.

505
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,609
The only reason
any of us are here

506
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,911
is because the world
wanted to be rid of us.

507
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,480
We're embarrassments
to our family,

508
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,916
exiles to the human race.

509
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,719
We will not be discovered
for the simple reason
that no one cares.

510
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:38,021
My husband does.

511
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,028
I promise you

512
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,931
you will always be safe
within these walls.

513
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,824
<i>I'm afraid this
is all I could find.</i>

514
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,027
Supplies upstairs
are running low.

515
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,298
<i>I'll bring more
next time.</i>

516
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,999
And some laudanum
for that cough of yours.

517
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,402
Bless you, Doctor.

518
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:29,539
<i>It's men</i>
<i>with guns we need,</i>
<i>not medicine.</i>

519
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,808
That's not an option
anymore, Doctor.

520
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:35,478
After last night,
Finn and his goons
are watching me like hawks.

521
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,048
I barely made it
here undetected.

522
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,983
<i>Come back here.
Please mate, come on.</i>

523
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,687
I could be wrong,
but Lamb strikes me
as a man

524
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,722
<i>who would rather</i>
<i>see the ship sink</i>
<i>with everyone in it</i>

525
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,557
than give up the helm.

526
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,826
Oh, sweet Jesus.

527
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,095
<i>So, even</i>
<i>if we did steal away</i>
<i>and find help,</i>

528
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,464
God knows
what would await us
when we returned.

529
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:55,999
We?

530
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,770
Well, me-me
and Mrs. Graves.

531
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,406
Eliza Graves?

532
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:06,109
<i>Don't be a fool, man.</i>
<i>She's as mad as the lot</i>
<i>of them.</i>

533
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,345
No, no, I...
I don't believe she is.

534
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:10,880
<i>Tell that
to her husband.</i>

535
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,817
<i>But make sure you speak</i>
<i>into his good ear, the one</i>
<i>she didn't bite off.</i>

536
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:17,354
The man is a monster.
She was right
to defend herself.

537
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:21,091
<i>Mrs. Pike, may I remind you</i>
<i>on which side of the bars</i>
<i>you sit?</i>

538
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,727
<i>So, you cannot flee,</i>

539
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:26,396
<i>you cannot steal
Finn's keys.</i>

540
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:30,767
What do you
propose to do?
Huh?

541
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:34,738
Look, I came here
to study his methods.

542
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,707
<i>Now, Lamb sees me
as his protégé.</i>

543
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,377
If I could just
maintain that-that trust,

544
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,646
<i>you know, understand</i>
<i>the workings</i>
<i>of his mind,</i>

545
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:46,049
maybe I could
bring him to reason.

546
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:53,857
He killed
five soldiers
in cold blood.

547
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,497
And do you think
you can outfox him, boy?

548
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,801
If you could just
give me his case file.

549
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,569
<i>Long gone.</i>

550
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,971
It's the first thing
he'd have destroyed.

551
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,179
Well then... well then,
I'd best be back
before I'm missed.

552
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,717
In the medicine cabinet.

553
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,019
Behind the Scotch.

554
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:26,990
<i>In his...
In-in my office.</i>

555
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:31,661
He escaped once before
and he stole it, briefly.

556
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,564
I didn't want
to give him that
pleasure again,

557
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:37,867
so I hid his casebook.

558
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:40,103
Right.

559
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,140
<i>Doctor?</i>

560
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,975
<i>I want to warn you.</i>

561
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:49,779
I do not know
what Lamb's plan
is for us,

562
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:54,484
but I do know
that if he believes
you could jeopardize it,

563
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:58,021
<i>he will not hesitate
to slit your throat.</i>

564
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:01,825
Deplorable conditions these,
but soon I mean to make
a change.

565
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,027
And what better way
to bring in the new century

566
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:07,197
than by doing away
with this godforsaken ward

567
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,599
and all the backward
thinking it represents.

568
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,068
Right, Finn?
Right, then.

569
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,070
So, what do you hope
to do with the current
residents?

570
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,739
Introduce them
to the general population.

571
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,875
You're not serious.

572
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:21,010
Keep a man in a cage
and he'll behave like
an animal.

573
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:26,049
Give him his freedom
and he'll remember
his humanity.

574
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:29,291
And that's your plan,
is it, to create
an enlightened society?

575
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:35,058
Do I sense skepticism
in your question, Doctor?

576
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,995
No, not at all.
I suppose I'm just
curious to know

577
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:42,565
if you think there are
any individuals whose crimes
are so heinous

578
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,267
they justify imprisonment.

579
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:52,075
Sadists... who find
gratification

580
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:54,143
<i>in the debasement
of others.</i>

581
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,880
And those cowards who
would send younger men
to their deaths

582
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,549
in battles
they themselves
would avoid.

583
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,919
<i>Except for these,</i>
<i>I believe all men can</i>
<i>be rehabilitated</i>

584
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:07,824
often by the simple act
of having their dignity
restored.

585
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,769
Who-who's down there?

586
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,538
<i>The Ogre of Oxbridge.</i>

587
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,307
The Ogre of what?
<i>Stage name.</i>

588
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:27,189
<i>His family sold him off</i>
<i>to a side show when he was</i>
<i>a child.</i>

589
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:32,948
He injured his hand
a few days ago whilst
attacking a nurse.

590
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,722
<i>Would you be so kind</i>
<i>as to change the dressing,</i>
<i>Doctor?</i>

591
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,559
You expect me
to go down there?

592
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,241
You came here
for clinical experience,
did you not?

593
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,567
Yes, of course.

594
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:58,274
Well, two grains of opium,
I should think, will do
the trick.

595
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,577
Don't need that.

596
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,419
What do you
expect me to do,
sing him a lullaby?

597
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,049
Use these.

598
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:08,952
The asylum doctor's
greatest ally.

599
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,866
Look out
for the piss bucket.

600
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,712
Hello?

601
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,624
Now listen here.

602
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:50,693
I don't mean
to harm you,
Mr. Ogre.

603
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:53,217
I just want
to see your hand.

604
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,870
Oh, good God.

605
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,672
It's all right.

606
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,874
It's all right.
It's all right.

607
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,181
Lamb, please help.

608
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,303
<i>Eyes, Newgate.
Eyes.</i>

609
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,996
Arthur.

610
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:37,040
Arthur.
Arthur, please.

611
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,809
P-Please, Arthur.

612
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,446
Arthur.
Arthur.

613
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,689
<i>Forgive me, Arthur.</i>

614
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:54,924
May I call you Arthur?

615
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,161
Can I?

616
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,830
I-I didn't mean to enter
without permission.

617
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:03,132
I meant no offense.

618
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:04,834
I'm Dr. Newgate.

619
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,139
But you
can call me Edward.

620
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:11,808
It's all right.

621
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,849
Eddard?

622
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,751
That's right, Edward.

623
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,220
Eddard.

624
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,422
Now, Arthur,

625
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:29,926
let's, let's have
a look at that hand,
shall we?

626
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:32,729
It's okay.
All right.

627
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,797
<i>That's it, Arthur.</i>

628
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:38,067
Bravo, Doctor.

629
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,236
Bravo.

630
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,835
Can you take
your trousers off,
please?

631
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,488
No, no.
It's, uh,
it's my shoulder.

632
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,224
Please?

633
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:02,992
<i>I will do that, Millie.</i>

634
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,994
You may return
to your duties.

635
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:07,897
But I want to.
Leave us.

636
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,374
Sit down.

637
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,920
Bare your shoulder.

638
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:40,196
Stubborn fool.
Why didn't you listen?

639
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:42,365
You could've left
when you had the chance.

640
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,134
I didn't know then
what I do now, Eliza.

641
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,036
Don't call me that.

642
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:52,275
Mrs. Graves,
you have to understand,

643
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,843
you are
in danger here.

644
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:57,246
I can assure you
I am not.

645
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:58,448
Give me your hand.

646
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:07,323
And what of those
down below?

647
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,025
What about them?

648
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,565
Mrs. Pike
and the women,

649
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:18,167
are they suffering
terribly?

650
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,503
Yes, all of them are.

651
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,474
You could go down
there yourself.

652
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:28,945
Or are you afraid that
what you'll see will weaken
your loyalty to Lamb?

653
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:31,347
You have no idea
what it was like here
before.

654
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,016
What monsters Salt
and his men were.

655
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:38,120
How we were stripped bare
and subjected to examinations

656
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,890
of the most disgusting,
intimate nature.

657
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:43,359
Strapped to tables,

658
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,929
given drugs to dull
our senses, and doused
with ice-cold water

659
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:50,366
and made to suffer
a thousand other indignities
too horrible to mention.

660
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,468
But you couldn't
possibly understand.

661
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,438
I can.
I-I can.

662
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,644
I can.

663
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,114
I can.

664
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,268
I know what
cruelty is,
Mrs. Graves.

665
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,504
I-I know.

666
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:31,007
And I give you my word

667
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:34,377
that you will never again
have to suffer the way
that you have.

668
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:37,046
Never.

669
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:40,182
Why do you care so much
what happens to me?

670
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:43,119
Because

671
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:46,188
the very thought
of you locked away
in this madhouse

672
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,624
is abhorrent
to everything
that I believe,

673
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:53,162
as a doctor
and... and as a man.

674
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,169
Excuse me.

675
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:11,213
<i>For Christ's sake, Swanwick,
will you give it up?</i>

676
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:13,215
We have as much chance
of escaping that way

677
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:16,519
as a man
clawing his way
out of his own grave.

678
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:21,324
Maybe so, but at least
it won't say on my gravestone
what it'll say on yours.

679
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,628
"He died like a dog
in the dark."

680
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:35,438
You done it.
You done it.

681
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,240
<i>Get to town.
Quick. Hurry.</i>

682
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:39,802
<i>Get help.
Hurry.</i>

683
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,797
<i>I still don't get
why he's walking around.</i>

684
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:37,199
<i>He should be down
in a cage with the others.</i>

685
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,436
I cannot continue to run
this bloody asylum
on my own.

686
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:42,738
I need an assistant.
I thought that was me.

687
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,442
With medical training.

688
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:49,311
How hard can it be
to play a doctor?

689
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,514
"Turn your head
and cough."

690
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:54,150
"Bend over, young lady,
while I take a little
look at you."

691
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:58,187
Your talents
are better suited
to other duties.

692
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:05,361
Like making sure
the dipsomaniacs keep
the bloody boilers stoked.

693
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:07,797
<i>Bloody icebox in here.</i>

694
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:10,166
What's he got on you?

695
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,171
What are you
talking about?

696
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,093
<i>You haven't been the same
since he showed up.</i>

697
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:24,146
I suppose I feel
a certain sense
of duty towards him.

698
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:27,483
He has the makings
of a fine asylum doctor.

699
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:32,588
<i>Reminds me of myself,
a... headstrong, idealistic.</i>

700
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,691
Ah.

701
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:37,933
Fetch another,
would you?

702
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,099
<i>I sense a kindred
spirit in him.</i>

703
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,868
I believe he may understand
what I'm trying to accomplish
here.

704
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,404
Yeah, well,
how understanding
is he going to be

705
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:51,340
<i>if he discovers Salt
and all them others?</i>

706
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:54,622
Come the New Year,
that won't matter
any longer.

707
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,999
There'll be nothing
to discover.

708
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,553
<i>I tell you,</i>
<i>I don't trust</i>
<i>that little gutterfuck.</i>

709
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,122
He's up to something.

710
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,626
Perhaps I'm wrong
about him,

711
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:14,497
<i>but he's taken</i>
<i>a keen interest</i>
<i>in our Lady Graves.</i>

712
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:16,899
He won't be raising
any alarms

713
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:19,735
<i>unless he has her
on his side.</i>

714
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,872
And that I can assure you
will never happen.

715
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:28,544
Someone's escaped.

716
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,694
Oi.
Hai!

717
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,091
Here.
Here.
Here.

718
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,673
If they reach town,
it's the end of us.

719
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,543
They won't.

720
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,490
Come on.
Come on.

721
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,821
Oh, Lord, no.
No.

722
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:49,892
Now, now, gentlemen.

723
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:52,995
<i>You get back.
You bastards.</i>

724
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:55,831
Back.
Get back.

725
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,834
There's no need
for tears.

726
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:02,404
You have my word
you won't be harmed.

727
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:06,342
Is that what you said
to your mother and sister

728
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:08,477
before you slashed
their throats? Hm?

729
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,851
Aye, Mr. Swan.

730
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:19,622
But your methods
have cured my madness.

731
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,393
I'm a peaceful man now.

732
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:26,462
I am.

733
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:28,631
A veritable... lamb.

734
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,469
No!

735
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,281
It's a sad
and shameful thing that.

736
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,619
Come now, Mr. Swanwick.

737
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:53,781
Let's get inside
before we all catch
our deaths.

738
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,443
Oh, dear.

739
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:22,418
One of them
threw themselves
from Stag's Leap.

740
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,020
And this one came
at me like a banshee.

741
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:28,924
<i>The horse spooked,</i>
<i>reared up and kicked</i>
<i>the old pecker in the nut.</i>

742
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:33,495
Fell down stone dead.

743
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,932
<i>Suicidal tendencies</i>
<i>are not uncommon amongst</i>
<i>the seriously deranged.</i>

744
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:40,069
<i>As we know.</i>

745
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,639
<i>Finn.</i>

746
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:46,108
See that the body
is buried.
Aye.

747
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,943
Dr. Lamb.

748
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,716
Did he stab himself
in the back as well?

749
00:55:56,486 --> 00:56:00,422
He must have landed
on something when he fell.

750
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:02,358
Something sharp.

751
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,497
Pity.

752
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,819
No, you can't just
walk away from this.

753
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,069
From what, dear boy?

754
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,672
Sir, if you would only
just examine the body
yourself.

755
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:20,142
I am not a coroner.
Nor are you.

756
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:22,411
Dr. Lamb, this man
has clearly been...

757
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:24,380
Killed by a horse.

758
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:26,949
<i>I have an asylum to run.</i>

759
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:31,420
And you I believe, Doctor,
have patients to attend to.

760
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:33,555
This is madness.

761
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,691
What did you say?

762
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:38,494
I said
this is madness.
Madness.

763
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:41,130
Madness, you say?

764
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:44,166
<i>How dare you accuse me</i>
<i>of madness in front</i>
<i>of my own staff?</i>

765
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:45,834
I didn't accuse you
of anything.

766
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:48,537
Two patients
are dead, Newgate,

767
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,639
<i>because you</i>
<i>were not doing your duty</i>
<i>and watching over them.</i>

768
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,841
Silas.
<i>Where were you, Newgate,</i>

769
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,843
<i>when these two
fellows escaped?</i>

770
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:56,945
How many more must die
because of your negligence?

771
00:56:56,947 --> 00:56:58,747
Silas!

772
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,031
Nurse, I think
we'd better get
ourselves inside.

773
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,912
<i>March 1st, 1891.</i>

774
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,017
<i>This enigma</i>
<i>called Silas Lamb</i>
<i>continues to mystify me.</i>

775
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:42,491
<i>Silas remains mute</i>
<i>about his years</i>
<i>as a military surgeon,</i>

776
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:44,526
<i>the war,</i>

777
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:47,062
<i>and most of all,
the horrific incident</i>

778
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,398
<i>that had him committed
to this asylum.</i>

779
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,871
No! No!

780
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:58,540
<i>And yet he has
no such reservations</i>

781
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,676
<i>when it comes</i>
<i>to protesting</i>
<i>what he calls</i>

782
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:03,111
<i>my "barbaric" methods.</i>

783
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:15,224
<i>How ironic</i>
<i>to be called cruel</i>
<i>by a man such as this,</i>

784
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:18,660
<i>a man accused
of such atrocities.</i>

785
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,662
No! No!

786
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:26,635
<i>When you have found
the thing a man fears most,</i>

787
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:30,072
<i>you will have discovered
the key to his madness</i>

788
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,874
<i>and the means
to control it.</i>

789
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,786
<i>Silas appears
to fear very little.</i>

790
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,726
<i>But all men have
their breaking points.</i>

791
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:54,796
<i>And I am bound by my oath
as his doctor to find his.</i>

792
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:56,265
<i>To cure him</i>

793
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:58,800
<i>and to make him whole.</i>

794
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:08,710
<i>I believe Silas enjoys
what he mistakenly believes</i>

795
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,647
<i>is his control over me.</i>

796
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:17,219
<i>In his tormented mind,
his stay at Stonehearst</i>

797
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,954
<i>is merely a chess match.</i>

798
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:26,094
<i>And I am his pawn
to move as he sees fit</i>

799
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:29,565
<i>for his pleasure.</i>

800
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:32,100
<i>But like most children,
Silas seems to forget</i>

801
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,104
<i>all games must end.</i>

802
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,211
<i>And there is only
one victor.</i>

803
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:57,359
<i>October 3rd., 1899.</i>

804
00:59:57,361 --> 01:00:00,662
<i>Over the past
nine years now</i>

805
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:03,699
<i>I have struggled
to determine</i>

806
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:08,136
<i>what it is that haunts
the soul of Silas Lamb.</i>

807
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:09,805
<i>A cruel mother?</i>

808
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:12,074
<i>A sadistic father?</i>

809
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:14,743
<i>Indifferent God?</i>

810
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:25,821
<i>I don't claim
to know the answer.</i>

811
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:29,124
<i>I only know</i>
<i>that animals</i>
<i>like Silas Lamb</i>

812
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,626
<i>must be broken</i>

813
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,262
<i>to be made men again.</i>

814
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:57,377
That's one
of my suits
you are wearing.

815
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,722
Fits me well,
don't you think?

816
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:03,959
Of course,
I had to have it
taken in a bit.

817
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:06,828
But then,

818
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,930
you're a stouter
fellow than I am.

819
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:10,766
Or were.

820
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,803
I suppose
I shouldn't be surprised

821
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:18,206
that killing
unarmed men
in cold blood

822
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,976
hasn't affected
your appetite.

823
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:22,944
On the contrary.

824
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:25,947
Their deaths
were most distressing

825
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:28,984
to myself
and my staff.
<i>Staff?</i>

826
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:31,853
A bunch of inebriates
and chronic masturbators
more like it.

827
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:35,691
Funny I've never seen
the harm in chronic
masturbation.

828
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:40,228
Nevertheless,
I bring condolences

829
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:43,131
and a recommendation
that no one else repeat
their error.

830
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:45,767
<i>And as a show
of good faith,</i>

831
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,836
I'll increase
your rations

832
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:50,072
and send down
more fresh water.

833
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:53,141
<i>You see,</i>
<i>old friend,</i>
<i>unlike you,</i>

834
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:56,378
I'm not a cruel man.

835
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,384
Whilst, uh,

836
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,822
whilst I'm here,

837
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:10,959
I thought you might like
a report on the condition
of the patients.

838
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:12,794
I don't give a damn.

839
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:15,063
They're not
my responsibility
any more.

840
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,799
<i>The melancholiacs
are less lethargic</i>

841
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:20,936
since being weaned off
the large doses of opium
you had them on.

842
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:23,772
<i>The hysterics
are less listless</i>

843
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:26,374
<i>now that they don't have</i>
<i>you poking around their</i>
<i>private parts.</i>

844
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:30,812
Even the mongoloids
are thriving since being
taken out of their restraints

845
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:33,348
and put to meaningful
work in the kitchens.

846
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,983
A pity it's all
for naught

847
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:37,252
when they starve
to death.

848
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,287
We are sufficiently
provisioned.

849
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,995
<i>I'll tell you</i>
<i>what I think,</i>
<i>old friend.</i>

850
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:50,132
I think that
you haven't taken
anything for that cough

851
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:53,034
because you neglected
to lock the medical cabinet

852
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:55,437
and the opium addicts
got into the laudanum.

853
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:58,507
And I suspect that
you're wearing that suit

854
01:02:58,509 --> 01:03:01,777
because it's the warmest
suit in my closet,

855
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:04,246
<i>which comes in very handy
when you have imbeciles</i>

856
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,288
looking after
the boilers.

857
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,017
I hope
you've enjoyed

858
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:12,888
pretending
to be sane, Silas.

859
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:17,159
<i>Has this masquerade</i>

860
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:21,062
<i>helped you to forget
what it was like</i>

861
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:25,934
blowing those poor
boys' brains through
their skulls?

862
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,943
Mr. Finn.
Dr. Lamb.

863
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,947
<i>Find Dr. Newgate.</i>

864
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:41,049
Have him meet me
in the surgery.

865
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,391
Fine.
Don't eat.

866
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:51,827
See if I care.
Silly old cow.

867
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:53,295
Millie.

868
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:55,597
I'm tired.

869
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,233
I'm tired
of being a nurse.

870
01:03:58,235 --> 01:04:01,970
Can't things
go back to the way
they were before?

871
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,071
<i>May I try?</i>

872
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:11,513
Thank you.

873
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,119
Now,

874
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:19,588
will you try one
for me?

875
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:24,559
He doesn't like
the taste of it.
No.

876
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:26,995
Your son, right?

877
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:29,231
And he tastes
what you taste,
does he?

878
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,569
But how?
Right through the cord.

879
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:39,407
Do you not see
how it stretches from me
out the window to him?

880
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:45,313
He's off fighting
the Afghans, he is.

881
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,523
You don't want me
to starve, do you,

882
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,494
Mother?

883
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:04,199
<i>Daniel?</i>

884
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,968
Yes.
Blessed Lord.

885
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:09,337
Is it really you, Daniel?

886
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,073
Yes, it's me.

887
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:15,677
Listen, no matter
how great the distance
between us,

888
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:18,013
you will always be
on my mind.

889
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,917
My dearest boy.

890
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,621
Listen, Mother,

891
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:29,557
I'm afraid I have
to go abroad again

892
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:33,528
on a secret
diplomatic mission
for Her Majesty the Queen.

893
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,597
<i>Where?</i>

894
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,999
I'm not
at liberty to say.

895
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:41,603
But food
is very scarce there

896
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,471
so I need you
to eat for the both of us.

897
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,943
Can you do that for me?

898
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,580
For Daniel?

899
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:02,057
<i>I will.
I will.</i>

900
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:04,492
That's it.
That's it.

901
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:07,362
Well done.

902
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:08,430
Very good.

903
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,504
No, no, no.
Go off to bed.
Get some rest.

904
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:19,240
I still have
the bedpans to do.

905
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:21,176
No, doctor's orders.

906
01:06:21,178 --> 01:06:23,211
Fine.
Go.

907
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,082
Millie, lock the door.

908
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,453
A couple more.

909
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:34,489
Very good.
That's it.

910
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:36,224
That's it.

911
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,096
Very good.

912
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,268
Thank you so much.

913
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,637
Millie really
needs the rest.

914
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:52,340
Lamb has her
running herself ragged
doing the work of four nurses.

915
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:55,610
On an empty stomach,
in a ward with no heat.

916
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:59,314
Well, in a few months
it'll be spring.

917
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:01,416
In a few months
we may all be dead.

918
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:07,155
Pneumonia. Typhus.
Starvation.

919
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:09,057
<i>Finn, even.</i>

920
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:14,329
Look, Lamb's experiment
is crumbling, Eliza.

921
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:17,365
<i>Look, he cannot see it</i>
<i>because he's blinded</i>
<i>by madness.</i>

922
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,667
But you're not.

923
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:25,607
When I first arrived here,
Millie could barely speak.

924
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:29,009
Salt had put her
in a morphine coma
to control her.

925
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,248
Lamb took her off
all sorts of medication.

926
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,749
Had her work
on the wards.

927
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:37,252
It was good for her.

928
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:40,121
She's grown
into a capable
young woman.

929
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:45,126
Yes, with the mind
of a child, but she's
alive, Edward.

930
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:51,366
You love her
like your own sister.
Yes.

931
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:53,535
That's why
I can never
leave her.

932
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:55,537
Well, you don't have to.

933
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,408
Really,
you don't have to.

934
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,211
We can go together
all three of us.
Together.

935
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:05,346
Start a new life
away from here.

936
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:09,084
Where?
Spain, Italy.

937
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:11,419
Someplace where the sun
is always shining

938
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:15,757
and the sky is blue,
and... and you can be free

939
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:18,193
to do whatever
you want to do.

940
01:08:18,195 --> 01:08:20,695
Somewhere you can be
truly, truly alive.

941
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:23,264
I can make
that happen.

942
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,866
I can.

943
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:26,701
Nothing can get
in our way.
Nothing.

944
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,738
My husband can.

945
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,508
If he does,
then I would kill him.

946
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:36,878
Be careful, Edward.

947
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,747
When you speak like that,
you don't sound like a doctor.

948
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:42,784
When I'm with you, I...

949
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:44,786
I forget that I am.

950
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:49,330
<i>I wouldn't get
too close to that one.</i>

951
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,394
Bit of a biter, she is.

952
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,632
<i>Dr. Lamb requests
your presence.</i>

953
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,337
Where?

954
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,139
Follow me.

955
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:28,363
<i>Ah, Newgate,</i>
<i>just in time.</i>
For what?

956
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:31,499
To assist me
in an experimental procedure
of my own devising

957
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,170
which, when perfected,
I expect to usher
in a new era

958
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,705
in the humane treatment
of lunacy.

959
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,878
An unfortunate case.

960
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,248
Believes himself to be
the rightful superintendent
of Stonehearst.

961
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:51,219
It's a common delusion.

962
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:54,389
Ranks right behind
Napoleon and Jesus Christ.

963
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:57,358
What are you going
do to him?

964
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,294
Treat him, of course.

965
01:09:59,296 --> 01:10:02,363
With Edison's miracle
of our age,

966
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:05,200
we shall banish to history
the straitjackets,

967
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:09,270
the cold baths,
the nausea machines,

968
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:11,272
the floggings.

969
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:13,675
Finn, we will start
with three seconds.

970
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,948
I call it
"electrotherapy".

971
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:24,519
And I think you'll be
fascinated to see

972
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:27,455
<i>what happens</i>
<i>when it is applied</i>
<i>to the subject's brain.</i>

973
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,565
You'll need
a stronger stomach

974
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,934
if you expect
to practice
asylum medicine.

975
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:43,972
It may look painful,
but I can assure you
he feels nothing.

976
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:46,975
Yeah, but his heart.
A tenth of that could
stop his heart.

977
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:49,410
You may do the honors
this time, Doctor.

978
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,412
What? No.

979
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,848
A dose of five seconds
should clinch it.

980
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:56,370
<i>But, Dr. Lamb, you can't</i>
<i>possibly imagine that I...</i>
Do it!

981
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,521
Do it.

982
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:44,065
And now

983
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,401
you will see

984
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:49,370
the miraculous effects

985
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:52,440
of this remarkable
new therapy.

986
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,578
What is your name, sir?

987
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,949
I don't know.

988
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:05,320
Are you
the superintendent here?

989
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:09,090
I don't know.

990
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:11,993
<i>As you can see,</i>

991
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:14,762
<i>a mind that was not</i>
<i>moments ago tormented</i>
<i>by delusion</i>

992
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:16,998
is now pacified.

993
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:22,003
I... Am I in hospital?

994
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,342
You are a patient
at Stonehearst Asylum.

995
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,612
Who are you people?

996
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,583
Tell him, Doctor.

997
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,454
Tell him.

998
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,728
We are your keepers.

999
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:29,904
I'm afraid
that's the last
of the laudanum.

1000
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:32,006
Thank you, Doctor.

1001
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:40,515
Now listen.
You must rest
if you can.

1002
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:43,397
You need
your strength.
For what?

1003
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:48,956
Tonight I intend
to set you free.

1004
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,125
All of you.
Tonight?

1005
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:53,628
Why?

1006
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:59,967
Because I-I fear
Lamb's procedure
on Salt

1007
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:02,289
was merely
a rehearsal.

1008
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,752
I fear he means
to do it to all
of you.

1009
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:09,510
Tonight.

1010
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:20,488
I never did approve
of Dr. Salt's methods.

1011
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:24,592
Of course,
it wasn't my place
to criticize.

1012
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:27,728
You know,
Eliza said you were
always very kind to her

1013
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:29,864
and the other patients.

1014
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:32,867
I loved them
like my own children.

1015
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:35,903
Even Lamb?

1016
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,209
There is some good
even in poor Silas.

1017
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:44,745
Though I fear
it has become
deranged by madness.

1018
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,148
How do I understand him?

1019
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:53,654
Your first instinct
was the right one.

1020
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,756
Think of him
as your patient.

1021
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:59,026
Shine the light
of your sympathy

1022
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,229
into the darkest
corners of his mind,

1023
01:15:01,231 --> 01:15:05,967
and maybe then you'll find
what he so desperately wants

1024
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:09,504
to keep hidden from you
and from himself.

1025
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:11,806
Only then will you have
what you need.

1026
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:13,808
To defeat him?
No.

1027
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:16,043
To heal him.

1028
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,916
It is difficult
imagining Lamb
as a patient.

1029
01:15:21,918 --> 01:15:27,054
Perhaps you should spend
some time where he spent
so much of his.

1030
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:32,527
<i>Why won't you let me go?
I want to go.</i>

1031
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,196
Because it's not appropriate
for a girl your age.

1032
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,632
But I'm not a girl.
I'm a lady.

1033
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:40,601
Quite beautiful one,
mind you.

1034
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:43,137
You should see
how the boys stare at me.

1035
01:15:43,139 --> 01:15:46,007
Listen to me, Millie.

1036
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:48,543
<i>You must stay in this room
with the door locked</i>

1037
01:15:48,545 --> 01:15:50,978
until I return,
do you understand?

1038
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,181
You just want to leave me here
so you can run away with him,
don't you?

1039
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:57,885
Who?
Dr. Newgate.

1040
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:04,058
Millie, that's absurd.

1041
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,227
You're going to run away
with him and you're going
to leave me here

1042
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:09,964
to wipe bums
and empty bedpans,
and it's not fair.

1043
01:16:09,966 --> 01:16:11,699
Oh, no.
Sh.

1044
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:14,902
There, there.
I'm not going anywhere.

1045
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:18,773
Eliza?

1046
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:21,075
Yes, darling.

1047
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:26,247
What's it like?
What's what like?

1048
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,985
To be in love?

1049
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,038
You're the belle
of the ball.

1050
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,040
You're the belle
of the ball.

1051
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,913
You look beautiful.

1052
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:39,720
I suppose
you've come
to ask me to dance.

1053
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:42,189
Believe me,
nothing would
please me more.

1054
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,063
But there isn't time.

1055
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:51,365
Look, I need you
to do me a favor.

1056
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:54,301
There's something
I must do, and if Lamb
asks you,

1057
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,737
tell him I've gone outside
for some fresh air.
Now tell him.

1058
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:58,406
Where are you going?

1059
01:17:58,408 --> 01:18:00,341
To find a way
to put an end
to all of this.

1060
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,309
Wait.
Edward, wait.

1061
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:32,199
Dinner is served.

1062
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:33,834
Dinner is served.

1063
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,096
Oh.

1064
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:03,330
Eliza.

1065
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:13,908
How do you do?

1066
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,213
Who? Me?

1067
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:20,881
Why, I'd be delighted.

1068
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,558
<i>May I butt in?</i>

1069
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,596
Well, well.

1070
01:20:35,598 --> 01:20:39,400
What a beautiful dress.

1071
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:42,203
<i>And lovely shoes.</i>

1072
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:19,967
<i>Think of him
as a patient.</i>

1073
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:23,137
<i>Shine the light
of your sympathy</i>

1074
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:26,440
<i>into the darkest
corners of his mind,</i>

1075
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:31,211
<i>and maybe then you'll find</i>
<i>what he so desperately wants</i>
<i>to keep hidden from you</i>

1076
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,715
<i>and from himself.</i>

1077
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,666
No.

1078
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,744
Pleurisy, I suspect.

1079
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,147
<i>Brought on by catarrh.</i>

1080
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:41,682
The...

1081
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:47,287
The poor
child's heart
gave out.

1082
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,662
Take the body
upstairs, would you?

1083
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:59,299
No.
Do not touch her.

1084
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,495
She's gone
to a better place.

1085
01:24:28,497 --> 01:24:30,364
No.

1086
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:32,800
This was supposed to be
a better place.

1087
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,611
It is nearly midnight.

1088
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,682
Someone.

1089
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:52,586
You.
Fetch the champagne.
Bring it here, quickly.

1090
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:55,189
<i>All of my friends.</i>

1091
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:57,357
<i>Join me outside.</i>

1092
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:59,560
The new century
is nearly upon us.

1093
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:30,424
<i>Peter!</i>

1094
01:25:30,426 --> 01:25:32,659
Where's Peter?

1095
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:36,130
Peter, my pyromaniac friend.

1096
01:25:36,132 --> 01:25:37,698
You may do the honors.

1097
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:46,607
<i>Tonight</i>
<i>we shall warm</i>
<i>ourselves</i>

1098
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:49,877
<i>by the fire</i>

1099
01:25:49,879 --> 01:25:51,812
of our ignominious past.

1100
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:31,652
<i>Are you quite
finished there, Ted?</i>

1101
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,524
Spiking the bubbly,
I mean.

1102
01:26:39,495 --> 01:26:42,462
You're slipping
them all a Mickey Finn.

1103
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:48,602
Not if Mickey Finn
slips you one first.

1104
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,908
Well, I wasn't
expecting that.

1105
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,944
Ah!

1106
01:26:56,946 --> 01:26:59,546
Jesus,
Mary and Joseph.

1107
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,847
That's the other one!

1108
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:22,636
Come on.
Come on.

1109
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,520
Now, now, Ted.

1110
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:04,771
<i>Doctor.</i>

1111
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,740
You're just in time.

1112
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:08,575
Indeed.

1113
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:22,122
Ah, there you are.

1114
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:32,532
<i>There we are.</i>

1115
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,654
Won't you be
joining us, Doctor?

1116
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,507
Of course.

1117
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:42,576
Allow me.

1118
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:53,420
Ten,

1119
01:29:53,422 --> 01:29:54,721
nine,

1120
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,089
eight,

1121
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:59,126
seven, six,

1122
01:29:59,128 --> 01:30:02,829
five, four,

1123
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:06,433
three, two,

1124
01:30:06,435 --> 01:30:08,168
one.

1125
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:10,137
<i>Stop!</i>

1126
01:30:11,873 --> 01:30:13,974
Stop!

1127
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:17,911
Don't drink
the fecking champagne!

1128
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,887
<i>Believe nothing
that you hear</i>

1129
01:30:26,889 --> 01:30:28,849
<i>and only one half
of what you see.</i>

1130
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:38,965
Welcome back, Ted.

1131
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:03,523
There, have a little rest
while we set the stage.

1132
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:06,685
I'll be back
in two shakes
of a whore's tail.

1133
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:16,470
<i>Come on.</i>

1134
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:25,045
<i>Dear friends.</i>

1135
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:26,947
A few hours ago

1136
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:30,116
we celebrated
the arrival
of a new century,

1137
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:33,019
and in a few hours more,

1138
01:31:33,021 --> 01:31:36,990
we shall celebrate
the dawning of a new day

1139
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:41,127
in this,
the grand experiment

1140
01:31:41,129 --> 01:31:43,563
we have been
conducting together.

1141
01:31:57,044 --> 01:32:00,013
Oh, Eliza.
Oh, thank God.

1142
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,215
Please help me
undo these straps.

1143
01:32:02,217 --> 01:32:04,551
Please.

1144
01:32:04,553 --> 01:32:06,720
Eliza.

1145
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:16,930
It was found
on your person.

1146
01:32:16,932 --> 01:32:19,766
Why did you come here?

1147
01:32:19,768 --> 01:32:21,935
You know why I came here,
to study asylum medicine.

1148
01:32:21,937 --> 01:32:24,170
You're a liar.
He sent you.

1149
01:32:24,172 --> 01:32:26,172
Who?
My husband.

1150
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:29,175
To take me
back to him.
No.

1151
01:32:29,177 --> 01:32:31,311
I don't believe you.

1152
01:32:31,313 --> 01:32:33,013
Why did you come here?

1153
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:35,682
I...

1154
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:39,185
I came here for you.

1155
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:43,657
For me?
Why?

1156
01:32:43,659 --> 01:32:46,159
I-I saw you

1157
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:51,131
six months ago
at a medical lecture.

1158
01:32:51,133 --> 01:32:53,266
<i>I saw you.</i>

1159
01:32:53,268 --> 01:32:55,669
You were there?

1160
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:57,704
Help me.
One of you.
Please, I'm not mad.

1161
01:32:57,706 --> 01:33:00,106
<i>You looked so lost
and so beautiful.</i>

1162
01:33:00,108 --> 01:33:03,577
<i>It sickened me</i>
<i>to see you exhibited</i>
<i>like a sideshow freak.</i>

1163
01:33:03,579 --> 01:33:05,745
<i>Look at me.</i>

1164
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,081
<i>I would have stopped it
if I could, but I couldn't.</i>

1165
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,717
I-I couldn't.

1166
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:13,753
<i>So, I vowed
there and then</i>

1167
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:16,723
that I would find you
and that nothing would
stop me.

1168
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:20,833
Did you even know
my name?

1169
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:24,698
It didn't matter.

1170
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,933
No, it does matter.

1171
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:29,102
Saying otherwise
proves you're no better
than any of them.

1172
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:30,870
Than who?

1173
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:32,973
My family,

1174
01:33:32,975 --> 01:33:35,175
my doctors,
my husband.

1175
01:33:35,177 --> 01:33:39,312
You act like
I'm some precious
thing to be bartered

1176
01:33:39,314 --> 01:33:41,348
or put on display
or possessed.

1177
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:43,917
It-It's not like that
with me, Eliza.

1178
01:33:43,919 --> 01:33:45,619
No?

1179
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:47,253
How is it different?

1180
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:55,161
It's you
who possesses me.

1181
01:33:59,734 --> 01:34:01,635
<i>Excuse us, your Ladyship.</i>

1182
01:34:01,637 --> 01:34:03,303
<i>You must
get out of here.</i>

1183
01:34:03,305 --> 01:34:05,672
Go, please.
Ride to the village.
Please.

1184
01:34:05,674 --> 01:34:07,674
Time for Ted's
big debut.
Eliza, promise me.

1185
01:34:07,676 --> 01:34:09,409
<i>Promise me.
Promise me.</i>

1186
01:34:09,411 --> 01:34:12,045
Eliza.
Eliza!

1187
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,285
<i>Tonight
we will show mercy</i>

1188
01:34:19,287 --> 01:34:21,388
to a man
who has betrayed us,

1189
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:24,391
and through the miracle
of medical science

1190
01:34:24,393 --> 01:34:26,960
we make him
in our image.

1191
01:34:26,962 --> 01:34:29,996
And when we are done,
he'll not need to be locked
below in a dungeon

1192
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:33,233
like the criminal he was,
but will join us

1193
01:34:33,235 --> 01:34:35,935
up above in the light,

1194
01:34:35,937 --> 01:34:38,138
fully rehabilitated.

1195
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:41,775
And we shall embrace him
as one of our own.

1196
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:47,747
<i>Pity.</i>

1197
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:50,250
You would have made
a fine asylum doctor.

1198
01:34:50,252 --> 01:34:52,318
You showed
a rare talent for it.

1199
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,187
You're mad.

1200
01:34:55,956 --> 01:34:59,225
We're all mad,
Dr. Newgate.

1201
01:34:59,227 --> 01:35:01,928
Some are simply
not mad enough
to admit it.

1202
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:05,398
Crank it up, Finn.

1203
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,466
Now.

1204
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:15,108
We will start

1205
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:18,712
with a dose
of ten seconds.

1206
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:23,049
Wait, wait, wait.

1207
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:26,786
Before you start,
I'd like a final request.

1208
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,724
In my vest pocket

1209
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:33,793
there's a picture
of Eliza Graves.

1210
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:36,155
I'd like her
to have it.

1211
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:41,501
Very well.

1212
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:09,763
Silas.

1213
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:17,303
<i>Silas.</i>

1214
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:21,274
Silas!

1215
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,251
Keep going.

1216
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:34,020
<i>Faster.
Faster!</i>

1217
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:39,893
Feck, I don't need you.
I'll do it me self.

1218
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:53,173
Eliza.
Eliza, my feet.

1219
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:58,011
Hurry.

1220
01:37:00,881 --> 01:37:02,315
Eliza!

1221
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,586
Eliza!

1222
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:13,526
Eliza.

1223
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:15,995
<i>Look at me.</i>

1224
01:37:15,997 --> 01:37:18,198
Look at me.

1225
01:37:42,089 --> 01:37:44,991
Hit the switch.
Hit the switch.

1226
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:24,297
Quick, my hands.

1227
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:26,065
<i>Eliza.
Untie me.</i>

1228
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:27,267
Quick, my hands.

1229
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:33,439
Everybody out!
Evacuate the building!

1230
01:38:33,441 --> 01:38:34,674
Evacuate!

1231
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:41,080
Take these keys
and set them free.

1232
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,802
Where are you going?
To find Lamb.

1233
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:46,419
Everybody outside!

1234
01:39:10,412 --> 01:39:12,532
Go that way.
Keep going.

1235
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:17,283
Go that way.
Keep going.

1236
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:18,418
Quickly.

1237
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:42,976
Please help, Dr. Lamb.

1238
01:39:42,978 --> 01:39:45,578
Please help, Dr. Lamb.

1239
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:57,256
<i>Dr. Lamb.</i>

1240
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:33,626
They were suffering, so...

1241
01:40:33,628 --> 01:40:35,395
And I...

1242
01:40:35,397 --> 01:40:37,397
And I...

1243
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:44,270
It's over, Silas.

1244
01:40:46,807 --> 01:40:50,143
I saved them.
I know.
I know.

1245
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,513
I saved them all.
I know.

1246
01:40:55,783 --> 01:40:59,318
The war,
it's over, Silas.

1247
01:41:04,759 --> 01:41:06,426
There you go.

1248
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:11,731
<i>Ladies.</i>

1249
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:14,667
Let's start
putting the patients
in the far wing.

1250
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:20,840
William.
William, you may come
with me now.

1251
01:41:20,842 --> 01:41:23,276
Yes, Mrs. Pike.
Come.

1252
01:41:26,147 --> 01:41:28,081
Inside.

1253
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:31,384
<i>Eliza.</i>

1254
01:41:31,386 --> 01:41:33,853
Eliza.
Eliza.

1255
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:42,495
Down here.

1256
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:47,567
Silas.

1257
01:41:48,702 --> 01:41:50,636
Can you hear me?

1258
01:41:50,638 --> 01:41:53,306
Silas.

1259
01:41:53,308 --> 01:41:55,241
<i>Eliza, he's gone.</i>

1260
01:41:56,844 --> 01:41:58,111
<i>Eliza.</i>

1261
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:20,633
We could leave now.

1262
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:23,903
Edward, I can't.

1263
01:42:23,905 --> 01:42:26,172
You can't what?

1264
01:42:26,174 --> 01:42:31,577
I can't imagine
being anywhere
but here.

1265
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:34,579
You can't...
I'm quite sure
you don't mean that.

1266
01:42:35,415 --> 01:42:37,650
Yes.

1267
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:40,653
Because you are sane

1268
01:42:40,655 --> 01:42:42,855
and I am not.

1269
01:42:42,857 --> 01:42:44,924
I'm not sane.

1270
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:49,941
I'm madly in love
with you.

1271
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:10,616
Eliza, listen to me.

1272
01:43:10,618 --> 01:43:14,487
Listen to me.
There's something
I need to tell you.

1273
01:43:14,489 --> 01:43:18,324
I should've told you
right from the beginning,
but I was too afraid.

1274
01:43:20,627 --> 01:43:21,827
Eliza...

1275
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:38,277
Inexcusable this.

1276
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,614
<i>No way to run
an asylum.</i>

1277
01:43:44,952 --> 01:43:47,220
Dear God.

1278
01:43:52,659 --> 01:43:55,595
You realize
we've been ringing for over
a quarter of an hour.

1279
01:43:58,465 --> 01:44:00,466
We need to speak
with your superintendent
at once

1280
01:44:00,468 --> 01:44:01,628
on a matter
of utmost urgency.

1281
01:44:03,737 --> 01:44:05,771
No.
What?

1282
01:44:05,773 --> 01:44:08,908
We can't speak with him?
Well, why the devil not?

1283
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:14,247
There you are, dear.

1284
01:44:20,454 --> 01:44:22,388
Tea, Benjamin.

1285
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:29,362
<i>Sodomite.</i>

1286
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:36,402
Am I to understand
it is you who is
in charge here, Madam?

1287
01:44:36,404 --> 01:44:38,638
It is.

1288
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:43,609
Highly irregular.

1289
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:44,944
No mind.

1290
01:44:47,547 --> 01:44:49,949
And what is this, sir?

1291
01:44:49,951 --> 01:44:53,619
Release papers
instructing you to discharge
a former patient of mine

1292
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:56,656
named Eliza Graves
and remit her to our
custody.

1293
01:44:56,658 --> 01:44:58,658
I'm afraid
I cannot, sir.

1294
01:44:58,660 --> 01:45:01,427
What?
Why not?

1295
01:45:01,429 --> 01:45:04,397
Because she was discharged
three weeks ago.

1296
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:06,599
On whose orders?

1297
01:45:06,601 --> 01:45:08,567
Dr. Newgate's.

1298
01:45:08,569 --> 01:45:11,003
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

1299
01:45:11,005 --> 01:45:13,773
Dr. Edward Newgate,
from Oxford.

1300
01:45:13,775 --> 01:45:16,676
That's impossible.
Why?

1301
01:45:16,678 --> 01:45:20,713
Because, my good woman,
I am Dr. Edward Newgate.

1302
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:27,386
It's as I feared.
We're too late.

1303
01:45:27,388 --> 01:45:30,323
<i>Would someone please tell
me what's going on?</i>

1304
01:45:30,325 --> 01:45:33,492
The young man
you knew as Dr. Newgate

1305
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:35,728
is neither
a Newgate
nor a doctor.

1306
01:45:35,730 --> 01:45:37,863
How silly.
Of course he was a doctor.

1307
01:45:37,865 --> 01:45:39,665
I can assure you, madame,
he is not.

1308
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:45,638
Well, who is he then?

1309
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:48,874
A very cunning
and disturbed patient

1310
01:45:48,876 --> 01:45:51,711
who until two months ago
was under my care

1311
01:45:51,713 --> 01:45:54,413
at Bethlehem
Royal Hospital
in London.

1312
01:45:54,415 --> 01:45:58,417
Forgive me,
but that makes
no sense, Doctor.

1313
01:45:58,419 --> 01:46:02,388
Why would he go to the trouble
of escaping from one asylum
only to enter another?

1314
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:06,459
To find my wife.

1315
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:09,061
<i>Next patient.
Any questions?</i>

1316
01:46:09,063 --> 01:46:12,598
<i>It seems he became</i>
<i>unduly infatuated</i>
<i>with Lady Graves</i>

1317
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,967
<i>at a medical demonstration
I gave at Oxford.</i>

1318
01:46:26,113 --> 01:46:29,548
<i>Some time after that,</i>
<i>he managed to escape</i>
<i>his room,</i>

1319
01:46:29,550 --> 01:46:34,920
<i>elude two orderlies, and flee
via a laundry chute,</i>

1320
01:46:34,922 --> 01:46:38,524
<i>in the process
stealing my pocket watch,</i>

1321
01:46:38,526 --> 01:46:41,794
<i>my Derringer, and my, uh...</i>

1322
01:46:41,796 --> 01:46:43,796
Identity.

1323
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,433
In any event,
suffice it to say,

1324
01:46:47,435 --> 01:46:49,001
he's a very disturbed
young man.

1325
01:46:49,003 --> 01:46:52,738
He suffers
from Pseudologia fantastica,

1326
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,975
<i>one of the most severe
cases I've ever encountered.</i>

1327
01:46:55,977 --> 01:46:57,977
<i>In all the years
I've known him,</i>

1328
01:46:57,979 --> 01:47:00,379
<i>I've never uncovered
his true identity.</i>

1329
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:04,750
<i>It could very well be
that he's an empty shell</i>

1330
01:47:04,752 --> 01:47:07,052
<i>incapable
of true feeling</i>

1331
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:10,956
beyond a cure.

1332
01:47:12,459 --> 01:47:15,094
Check

1333
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:17,196
mate.

1334
01:47:22,602 --> 01:47:24,770
<i>You'll excuse me
if I disagree, Doctor.</i>

1335
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:27,540
<i>No one is beyond cure.</i>

1336
01:47:27,542 --> 01:47:31,577
<i>In fact, I believe</i>
<i>your young man</i>
<i>has found his.</i>

1337
01:47:31,579 --> 01:47:35,181
<i>What precisely
might that be?</i>

1338
01:47:35,183 --> 01:47:38,818
<i>Not what.
Who.</i>

1339
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:53,065
Shall we, Mrs. Lamb?

1340
01:47:53,067 --> 01:47:55,134
With pleasure, Dr. Lamb.
