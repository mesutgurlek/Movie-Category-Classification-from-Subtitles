1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:06,019
A painter, Johan Borg,
disappeared some years ago

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,978
from the small frisian island
of Baltrum.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,459
His wife Alma since gave me Johan's diary,
found among his left papers.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,259
This diary and her stories

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,536
are the basis of the film.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,859
THE HOUR OF THE WOLF

7
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,375
Silence! Take!

8
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,250
Camera !

9
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,216
No...

10
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,618
I can't tell you this.

11
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,212
You were given the diary..

12
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,860
You wonder why I stay on here ?

13
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,334
We lived here for 7 years,
together.

14
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,257
This winter, I can go
to the mainland

15
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,496
to work in the shop,
like I did before,

16
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,656
when we were short of money.

17
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,015
The baby will be born in a month.

18
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,136
I went to see the doctor before
going out here the last time.

19
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,377
It was on a friday I remember.

20
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,056
Quite late, at 10 I believe.

21
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,210
But it was still light outside.

22
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,857
I plan on staying here
until August.

23
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,097
We wanted to be completely alone.

24
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,371
He did not want to see anyone here.

25
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,094
He was scared...

26
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,899
He liked that I was quiet.

27
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,373
He liked...

28
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,178
We arrived here
at 3 in the morning.

29
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,653
On the beach,
there was a shed.

30
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,010
We were happy to find the

31
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,450
apple tree in bloom.

32
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,696
Later, we found footprints

33
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,258
outside the kitchen window

34
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,371
Johan didn't like that,

35
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,216
but we didn't think more about
it until...

36
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,534
We were happy.

37
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,770
Happy to be at home again.

38
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,692
Johan was a bit uneasy

39
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,575
because his work was not going well.

40
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,930
It had been like that for a while.

41
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,136
He slept poorly.

42
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,615
He was afraid.

43
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,371
Scared of the dark in a way.

44
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,175
It had become harder in the
last years.

45
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,090
I have an idea !

46
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,659
I want to draw you.

47
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,053
Go sit over there.

48
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,530
Move over !

49
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,939
Back up a bit.

50
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,014
Are you cold ?

51
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,448
Sit like you use to.

52
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,049
Pull down your robe a bit.
Disclose your shoulders.

53
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,574
Release your hair,
so I can see your neck.

54
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,413
That's it. Where are my glasses ?

55
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,378
Good. Sit like that.

56
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,608
Like I patiently draw you
day after day.

57
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,650
Look.

58
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,259
I never showed this to anyone.

59
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,891
This is the most common.

60
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,818
Practically without defense.

61
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,692
I think he is homosexual.

62
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,379
The old lady

63
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,050
threatening to remove her hat.

64
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,409
Do you know hat will happen
if she does ?

65
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,976
Her face will follow with it !

66
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,812
Here, this is the worst of them.

67
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,691
I call him the Birdman.

68
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,333
I don't know if it is a real beak
or just a mask.

69
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,651
He is very fast.

70
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,859
As if he were related to Papageno
in The Magic Flute.

71
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,979
The others, the carnivores,
the insects...

72
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,691
especially the spidermen.

73
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,614
And the school teacher,
with his stick...

74
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,373
And then these...

75
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,257
tattling metal-hard women ...

76
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,618
I have to stay awake awhile.

77
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,656
In an hour it will be day...

78
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,894
then I can sleep.

79
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,054
A minute
is really a long timespan.

80
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,899
It starts...

81
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,609
10 seconds.

82
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,293
Oh, these seconds !

83
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,972
See how long they last !

84
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,012
Still not a minute.

85
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,854
There it is !

86
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,739
Now it is gone.

87
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,699
Say something.

88
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,293
Talk to me, Alma.

89
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,368
I've been thinking about something
for a while...

90
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,254
Are you listening ?

91
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,137
Our life together for seven years...

92
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,336
No, that's not what I was going to say.

93
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,734
I know.

94
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,654
Isn't it so that people living together
for a long time

95
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,296
start to resemble one another ?

96
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,773
The develop so many things in
common.

97
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,336
Not just their thoughts...

98
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,008
Their faces
get a similar expression.

99
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,858
Why do you think that happens ?

100
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,774
I wish for us to become so old
together

101
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,737
that we start thinking eachother's thoughts.

102
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,097
And develop similar, dried-up
wrinkled faces.

103
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,732
What do you think about that ?

104
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,048
Are you sleeping ?

105
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,418
Let's go, Johan.

106
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,057
Let's go to bed.

107
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,458
Don't look so alarmed.
I'm not dangerous.

108
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,259
Give me your hand.

109
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,258
Do you feel my hand now ?

110
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,209
The fingers, the veins under
the skin ?

111
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,258
At my age, the hands are a bit cold.

112
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,700
Anyway, I'm 216 years old.

113
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,493
No, I wanted to say 76 !

114
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,777
I should be going.

115
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,090
Wait !
What was I going to say ?

116
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,850
I remember.

117
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,936
In his black bag,

118
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,893
under the bed
Is the book with drwaings....

119
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,892
One more thing.

120
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,012
In the same bag is his diary.

121
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,769
Read it !

122
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,816
Wednesday, 22 of July :
I've been sick.

123
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,937
Nothing serious,
but quite unpleasant.

124
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,775
Sorry for disturbing you.
I have for several days,

125
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,369
been looking for a way to
approach you .

126
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,050
I've chosen to go straight at you.

127
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,728
I'm baron von Merkens.

128
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,813
As you may know,
I own this island.

129
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,011
I live in the old castle on the northern
part.

130
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,928
Would you and your wife like to have
dinner with us ?

131
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,774
That's very kind.

132
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,416
It would be very simple,
but I can offer a good wine,

133
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,497
and the salmon here is well known.

134
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,888
Goodbye.

135
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,976
My wife and I are amongst your
admires,

136
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,213
possibly your warmest admirers !

137
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,451
Thursday, 27. of July :

138
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,775
A very hot and hazy day.

139
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,170
I still feel bad from my illness.

140
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,939
Do you see this mark ?

141
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,850
Be careful, my dear.

142
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,336
Or it will end in disasterl.

143
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,574
Don't you remember?

144
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,818
I was going to a party
and was wearing by green robe.

145
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,252
Afterwards it was difficult to set up
my hair again.

146
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,692
Then I forgot my gloves.

147
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,657
I have to speak to you about
something.

148
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,896
I need to show you a letter I got.

149
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,334
It was sent yesterday.

150
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,575
Here's how it goes.

151
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,057
"You don't see us,
but we see you.

152
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,016
"Horrible things
can happen.

153
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,770
"Dreams can
become real.

154
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,691
"The end is near.

155
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,971
"Tears will dry up.

156
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,288
"Other liquids will wet
your white clothes.

157
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,411
This has been decided.

158
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,096
I almost felt ill reading it.

159
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,816
How warm your hands are !

160
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,734
Do you have a fever ?

161
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,499
Always when I'm going to meet you,
I'm so troubled.

162
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,777
I walk around like in a
dream all afternoon.

163
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,449
Everything is unreal, meaningless.

164
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,176
Help me with the zipper of my robe, please.

165
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,736
It always gets hooked up.

166
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,936
I blows a lot,
but it is splendid, don't you think ?

167
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,295
Perfect for a painter.

168
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,375
You have been living here
for quite some time.

169
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,696
You return to the scene
of the crime, so to speak !

170
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,697
To commit new crimes.

171
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,694
You look tired.
Do not exhaust yourself.

172
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,579
At your age, be careful.

173
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,095
The young are more robust.

174
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,568
I know what I'm talking about.
My name is Hebrandt, curator.

175
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,050
I'm examining the souls.
And what do you get to see ?

176
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,329
I won't teach you anything.
You're an artist.

177
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,699
You do it in your facial studies ,
not to speak of your self-portaits.

178
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,650
Why do you look at me like that ?
Do you hurt ? Are you nervous ?

179
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,134
Anything bothering you ?

180
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,016
Shut up !

181
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,571
I have to ask you for more money.

182
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,811
The ones I got are almost out.

183
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,497
I will pay the Ferners
next time on the mainland

184
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,697
we owe them 176,50.

185
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,209
And then the milk.

186
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,093
Don't throw the money at me like that
Look at my accounts.

187
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,176
It is important, at least for me.

188
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,973
You gave me 500 on the third of the month.

189
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,896
Then you gave me the quilt, which
cost 35.

190
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,654
It is good to have
when I lie alone

191
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,490
Then, there was a large bill
from the shop :

192
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,136
sugar, flour, conservates.

193
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,258
That was 200. 219 !

194
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,135
And then pocket money, and stamps

195
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,416
and my bicycle chain
new batteries for the radio...

196
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,971
and the potato peeler...

197
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,289
Soap, detergent.

198
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,095
You really need a new toothbrush,
the one you have looks terrible.

199
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,252
Then 50 for your son's birthday.

200
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,172
Stamps 75

201
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,689
Total : 500.

202
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,175
Remaining : 7,36.

203
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,650
You can count to check it.

204
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,778
We are invited to the castle on friday.

205
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,969
I know.

206
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,933
How do you know ?

207
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,292
Good afternoon. May I introduce my wife Corinne ?

208
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,532
Welcome.

209
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,975
My mother,
the Countess von Merkens.

210
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,059
My brother, Ernst.

211
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,569
Im' pleased to meet you.

212
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,497
Mr. Lindhorst.

213
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,254
I'm one of your
warmest admirers.

214
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,052
And Mr. Hebrand.

215
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,010
I believe we met already.

216
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,619
Would you like a drink ?

217
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,455
We are so thrilled you could come.

218
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,051
Such a horrible servant,
but cheap of course.

219
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,134
My brother has no money.

220
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,733
We always stay here now.
We used to travel a lot.

221
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,578
Do you like to travel ?

222
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,891
"Alma", is an uncommon and beautiful name.

223
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,250
...incapable of agression...

224
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,617
...a certain desire to revenge...

225
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,015
...enjoys the humiliation...

226
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,249
I bought a painting by
a known artist

227
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,135
At that time.. I have no comments,
Ernst my friend..

228
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,853
I hung the painting upside-down in my livingroom,
invited the artist to my house

229
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,494
with some friends who understand
a good joke

230
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,217
How we laughed that time
How we laughed

231
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,251
What do you think, artist,
wasn't that a good joke !

232
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,456
The wounds never heal.

233
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,132
The infection is chronic,

234
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,220
it all depends on the heart.

235
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,819
I constantly loose weight.

236
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,454
I consult specialists
all over the world.

237
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,172
Sometimes it stops.
Like this summer.

238
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,777
But then it starts again.
My husband says it is psychic,

239
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,698
that it started
when we lost our fortune.

240
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,891
When I lost
the family fortune.

241
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,370
I, the guilty one.

242
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,854
Why is Lindhorst
at this table ?

243
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,814
Why can't we sell it all ?
My fault.

244
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,851
It is all my fault !

245
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,053
Then I scream :
to hell with your medicines !

246
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,138
It does not pass.

247
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,571
You must operate, cut it off.
I'm an old woman.

248
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,532
There are limits.

249
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,008
Then, the stupid professor,

250
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,338
says to me

251
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,171
"No ! Countess ! I dont
know any limits !"

252
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,056
Yes, we have children, two boys.

253
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,616
Not here, no !
They live with their uncle.

254
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,050
I believe you know them.

255
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,055
You know
Veronica Vogler, don't you ?

256
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,018
A very beautiful woman.

257
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,815
Veronica Vogler very charming.
Do you know her ?

258
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,411
A hatred like in those eyes !

259
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,775
Let's have coffee in the library.

260
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,372
Ladies and Gentlemen !

261
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,731
A small puppet theatre for your enjoyment !

262
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,338
May we turn off the lights ?

263
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:16,130
Our guests of honour.
Our invited guests of honour !

264
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,454
The Magic Flute
is the great example !

265
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,972
Tamino's companions
have left him in the dark palace yard,

266
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,216
outside the temple,

267
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,418
he cries in despair :

268
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,692
O eternal night,
when do you end ?

269
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,930
When will light
again touch my eyes ?

270
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,494
The deadly ill Mozart,
knows the intensity of these words.

271
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,130
And the choir responds :

272
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,649
Soon,
young man, or never !

273
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,294
The most beautiful
and troubling music

274
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,378
ever composed.

275
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,769
Tamino asks :

276
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,258
Does Pamina still live ?

277
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,611
The invisible choir responds :

278
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,808
Pamina still lives !

279
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:20,577
Listen to the strange, ingenious
partition of the syllables.

280
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,690
This is no longer
the name of a young woman,

281
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,812
it is a magic formula,

282
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,773
an incantation.

283
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,937
A naive text, a commanded work,

284
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,818
And yet the highest
manifestation of art.

285
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,817
What do you think Mr. Artist ?

286
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,053
Excuse me. I call myself artist,
short of a better word.

287
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,539
In my creative work,
nothing is evident,

288
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,934
rather it is a compulsion.

289
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,294
Without me wanting it, I have
been classified as something "exceptional",

290
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,090
5-legged calf, monster.

291
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,978
I have never fought for
that position,

292
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,740
nor am I fighting to keep it.

293
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,173
Sure enough, I have felt
megalomania lick my forehead

294
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,538
but I believe I am immune.

295
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,856
It is sufficient to think
about the small importance

296
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,972
of art
in today's world.

297
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,653
To cool down.
Yet my compulsion remains.

298
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,173
What an artist !

299
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,850
What bravery !
How clear-minded !

300
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,490
I want to propose a toast to our,
not just a genious,

301
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,009
but an equally strong thinker !

302
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,536
A rose in your hair...

303
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,856
Oh ! I scrathed you with my nail !

304
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,018
You're bleeding. Here, my handkerchief.

305
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,409
It is clean. How could I be so clumsy ?

306
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,808
Relax. You have drunk too much. Come be with me now.

307
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,294
He has insomnia,
that's why he can't take much alcohol.

308
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,456
Let us get some air on the terrace.

309
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,013
The core of the castle
is from the 14th century.

310
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,294
It has been in our family
since the end of the 15th.

311
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,890
We were a bit elated back there,
it is because we live so isolated.

312
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,212
We scared you.
But you won't leave us now ?

313
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,412
Look, Corinne, our
castle looks nice this time of night.

314
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,689
At night, yes.

315
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,738
Oh ! My stocking ! Turn away Mr. Hebrand.

316
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,170
Where were you, Ernst ?
Where did you walk ?

317
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,211
I took a different path.

318
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,014
I'm ashamed that
our park has been neglected.

319
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,253
19 years ago,
it was a paragon of parks !

320
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,020
We never kiss eachother, did you think about that ?

321
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,529
I can almost count our kisses.

322
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,975
One thing scares me innsanely.

323
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,736
I meet a stranger on the road.

324
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,931
We talk about various things.

325
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,856
Suddenly he turns around,
and strikes me on the cheek.

326
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,930
His face and eyes filled with hatred.

327
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,937
I don't understand a thing,
my nose is bleeding.

328
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,610
I stutter some excuses...

329
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,011
and I ask myself
when he has disappeared.

330
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,529
Is it like that ?
Does it have to be like that ?

331
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,859
I can never forget the man's eyes...

332
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,213
Are you leaving already ?

333
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,417
Before you leave you must see
where I put the painting of Veronica Vogler.

334
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,378
Alma dear, come with us.

335
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,531
She is asleep.
We must not disturb here.

336
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,173
No , I'm not asleep.

337
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,699
You want to leave ?

338
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,090
Come both of you.

339
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,449
Alma, now you will see something
beautiful created by your husband.

340
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,337
There it is. Opposite my bed.

341
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,216
I watch it morning and evening.

342
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,655
It is a part of my solitude.

343
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,689
I love her.

344
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,490
Were you together
for a long time ?

345
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,497
Pardon my indiscretion.

346
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,488
5 years.

347
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,735
Oh ! He told you !

348
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,333
He loved her, didn't he ?

349
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,813
I don't have to ask that.

350
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,613
Quite a scandal at the time.
But how romantic !

351
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,250
Jealous ?

352
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,691
I don't think so.

353
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,850
My husband is jealous.
But an excellent lover !

354
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,491
Look at this mark.

355
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,736
Form another man's "advances"

356
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,780
An eternal source of excitement.

357
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,931
Trivial, of course,

358
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,018
but stimulating for me !

359
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,893
But I will have to find
something else.

360
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,058
This mark is not
sufficient forever.

361
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,816
Will you help me please ?
Don't be angry, Alma, please.

362
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,459
I'm joking !
Silly, wasn't it ?

363
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,412
Let us join the others.

364
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,330
I have purchased a significant
part of your husband !

365
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,408
Don't you think ?

366
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:51,494
I want to tell you :
I have read your diary.

367
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,656
It filled me with fear.
No, let me finish.

368
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,694
I want you to hear
what I've been thinking these days.

369
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,095
Here it goes...

370
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,379
I can see something terrible happening,

371
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,492
undefinable...

372
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,815
But dont think
I will run away.

373
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,458
I won't run despite my fear.

374
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,658
One more thing:
They want to separate us.

375
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:20,299
They want you. As long as I'm with
you, it is harder.

376
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,458
Johan, you can't make me
run away, however much you try.

377
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,980
I'm staying...

378
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,331
Johan, answer me !

379
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,298
THE HOUR OF THE WOLF

380
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,935
Listen to the silence ?

381
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,810
There was a time when
nights were for sleeping...

382
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,450
deeply, without dreams.

383
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,055
To sleep, and awake without fear.

384
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,330
Tired ?

385
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,978
Not yet.

386
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,288
We've been avake until dawn,
every night.

387
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,936
But this hour is the hardest.

388
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,408
Do you know it's name ?

389
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,820
The old ones called it
"the hour of the wolf".

390
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,816
It is the hour when
the most people die,

391
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,617
and the most are born.

392
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,291
At this time,
nightmares come to us.

393
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,095
And when we awake...

394
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,449
We are afraid.

395
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:08,929
We are afraid.

396
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,050
What is it ?

397
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,092
Nothing. I was thinking about
something from my childhood.

398
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,011
A form of punishment.

399
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,136
I was thrown in the wardrobe,
the door was closed.

400
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,177
Without any sound, in the dark.

401
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,369
I was insanely scared and
pounded the door.

402
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,128
They had told me
a small person lived in the wardrobe,

403
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,935
who could bite away the toes
of bad children.

404
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,251
When I stopped the pounding,
I could hear a sound in a corner...

405
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,495
I believed my time had come.

406
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,012
In panic, I started climbing

407
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:04,100
inside the wardrobe.

408
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,776
On shoeboxes and shelves,
I tried to lift myself up by the hands.

409
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,932
I lost my grip and fell.

410
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:16,498
I fought wildly to keep the 
creature off me...

411
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,613
and all the time
screaming with fear...

412
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,458
asking forgiveness !

413
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,333
Finally the door opened
and I was allowed to come out...

414
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,210
in the light.

415
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:36,137
My father says :
"Your mother assures me you ask for pardon."

416
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,656
I shout : "Yes I do !"

417
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,138
"Let's go to the sofa then", he said to me.

418
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,530
I went to the green sofa 
in my father's room,

419
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,692
took a couple of cushions,
put them on top of eachother

420
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,736
I then fetched the stick,
unbuttoned my pants,

421
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,215
and lay myself over the cushions.

422
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,497
My father said :
"How many strikes did you earn ?"

423
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,371
I answered : "The maximum."

424
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,732
Then he beat me,

425
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,651
hard, but bearable.

426
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,217
After the punishement,
I turned towards my mother

427
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,091
and asked her : "Can you forgive me now ?"

428
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,657
She cried and said :
"Sure I forgive you."

429
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,657
She gave me her hand,

430
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,979
I kissed it...

431
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,337
Are you sleeping ?

432
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,852
No, I'm not sleeping.

433
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,219
My back aches.

434
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,415
All the pain still...

435
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,859
How quiet it is.

436
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,180
Strange when..
the ocean is calm and quiet

437
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,453
Eerie in a way.

438
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,415
Are you crying ?

439
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,493
No, I'm thinking about the child.

440
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,215
And of the big silent darkness,

441
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,729
as if the day
will never come back.

442
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,893
Poor you.

443
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,219
Give me your hand.

444
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,299
That is better.

445
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,051
Do you remember when I came home 
and told you I was bitten by a serpent ?

446
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,938
It was no serpent.

447
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,613
I was thinking I would never
tell anyone.

448
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,294
Tell me.

449
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,178
You must never tell anyone.

450
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,412
No, I promise.

451
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,651
You remember the place
where the water is deep ?

452
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,817
We were there sometimes 
in the beginning of summer.

453
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,019
Did you lock the door well ?

454
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,769
I checked it twice.

455
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,211
Good morning.
Pardon me for disturbing you.

456
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,737
It looks like there will be a storm.
I thought I would make a visit...

457
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,658
I have a message too.

458
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,860
May I sit down ? I won't be long.

459
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,898
There is an invitation
from the castle.

460
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,818
We are having a small party.

461
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,376
Nothing big, just us
pitiful people

462
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,368
enjoying eachothers company.

463
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:22,299
One of the invited will interest you.

464
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,092
Veronica Vogler.
She is coming. Are you ?

465
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,337
Good. We will see you then.

466
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,257
One more thing...
Von Merkens and I

467
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,530
have discussed how to defend you..

468
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,654
from the little dangers 
on this island.

469
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,333
That is all for now. 
See you later my friends.

470
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,656
Hope to see you at our party.

471
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,292
Wont you lock away your weapons ?

472
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,054
No, why ?

473
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,177
What shall we do today ?

474
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,296
Talk to me about Veronica Vogler.

475
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:16,650
What can I say ? It went on for 5 years.

476
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,176
You already know. It was discovered,
it was a big scandal.

477
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,292
Then it was hushed down.
That was the end of it.

478
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,051
This is not what it says in
your diary.

479
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,130
"My obsession with Veronica
became a torment to us both.

480
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:41,976
"I  followed her around,
spying, in jealousy.

481
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,060
"My suffering was stimulating for her,
I think,

482
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,410
"but she was passive and indecisive.

483
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,811
"There were some 
frightening scenes,

484
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,170
"without sense or reason.

485
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,132
"We traveled from town to town,

486
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,649
"to avoid her relatives and their lawyers..."

487
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,490
"We certainly lived by
the word of the Bible :

488
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,817
"Of man and woman as one flesh.

489
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,016
"Then her husband came to get her.

490
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,297
"I was taken to hospital.

491
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,611
"We did not see eachother for 
several years."

492
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:28,857
You once said to me 
what you liked about me was,

493
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,574
I was conceived as one piece
by God.

494
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,499
That my thoughts and
feelings are whole .

495
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:45,650
You said it is important
that there are people like me.

496
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,096
I thought that sounded so nice.

497
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,013
I was so happy.

498
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:57,934
I was wrong.

499
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,848
I understand nothing.

500
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:08,493
I understand nothing.
I don't understand you.

501
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,857
I'm just afraid.

502
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:17,459
Do you think I want to stay
here, risking being beat to death ?

503
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,696
Do you think I want to see
you running after that woman ?

504
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,449
Talking to your phantoms,
do you think I want to ?

505
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,411
But I stay.

506
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,258
Rise up from the table.

507
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,053
Go to the door.

508
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,769
Go outside.

509
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,539
Go dow the stairs.
It is no longer dark.

510
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,612
You can see clear.

511
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,695
What a surprise !

512
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,732
Carry these plates for me please.

513
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,699
Thank you.
This is my night-table you see.

514
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:22,853
Lindhorst, who knows the worlds,
says old trollops 

515
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,733
develop an insatiable appetite !

516
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,972
Do you really not want anything ?

517
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,899
Isn't there a party here tonight ?

518
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,173
As far as I know, yes.

519
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,931
Don't leave !

520
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,095
Help me with my stockings, please.

521
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,612
You like touching me.

522
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,093
I can feel it.

523
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,296
I don't understand you !

524
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,730
Veronica Vogler has arrived.

525
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,129
Only I can tell you
where she is.

526
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,419
Look good at my feet, 
dear artist !

527
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:11,289
Did you ever see younger-looking
or nicer feet ?

528
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,770
Look good.
Look at my heel.

529
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,971
How smooth and nice.

530
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,533
My strong toes, with their 
bautiful nails.

531
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,339
Kiss my foot.

532
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,139
That's it !

533
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,819
I will tell you where she is.

534
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,580
Look in the western gallery.

535
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,892
She was there 5 minutes ago, anyway.

536
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,453
You are always welcome, my friend.

537
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,253
You come, you stay, you are free
to do what you like !

538
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:27,892
Let us be honest :
you are looking for Veronica Vogler.

539
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,372
Before you meet her I should tell you

540
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:34,378
that she has been my mistress
for several years.

541
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:39,299
I have been told about your
common past.

542
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,891
I suffer, I can assure you.

543
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,296
This night 
I will stand by your bed.

544
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,769
Each word, each kiss, each movement
of your bodies

545
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,335
nothing will escape me.

546
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,573
Come, I will show you the way.

547
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:38,376
It is just my jeaolousy.
Go away, please.

548
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,297
Of course, I will leave.

549
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,334
It is Mr. Kreister who is playing.

550
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,889
A virtuoso on his instrument !

551
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:51,893
Dont you think Veronica has waited
sufficiently long now ?

552
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,817
She started preparing for your
viset early this morning.

553
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,216
She is more beautiful than ever.

554
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,818
My husband suffers.

555
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:04,773
He is jealous.

556
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,208
And your touching little
companion.

557
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:12,459
Three shots, of which
one was fatal.

558
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,933
How wonderful the music !

559
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:22,539
I must take off my hat
to hear better.

560
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,537
It really smells of glue !

561
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,574
Even if she says it
is all synthetic,

562
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,289
Ordinary glue is what it is !

563
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,692
We know our tricks, don't we ?

564
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,660
Let's see if we are indeed presentable.

565
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:23,052
How pale you are, my friend!

566
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,695
Your lips blue,
like blueberries !

567
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:32,290
What shall we do... 

568
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,616
A curve like Amor...

569
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:45,299
sensously swollen lips...

570
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,616
Your eyes are red, 
put these on..

571
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,253
Dear you.

572
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,574
Some eyeliner...

573
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,693
A bit of coulour...

574
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:25,579
What next ?
Take my robe.

575
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,732
Looks good on you.

576
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:40,575
A nice pyjamas belongs with it !

577
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,049
Some perfume ?

578
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:48,738
No ? You prefer your real oduor, of course.

579
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,419
Each has his own.

580
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,413
A little shower is nice on anybody.

581
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:56,458
Look at yourself.

582
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,016
You are yourself and yet not yourself.

583
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,690
The ideal premise for an amorous
encounter.

584
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:10,895
Let us go.
This way.

585
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:42,975
Look at the object of your desire.

586
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,970
Don't care about them.

587
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,409
I thank you.

588
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,893
The border has finally been crossed.

589
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:06,932
The mirror is broken,

590
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,656
But what is reflected by the pieces ?

591
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,574
Can you tell me ?

592
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:07,296
Yes, he fired three shots :

593
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:11,650
One of the hurt my arm,
I have a scar.

594
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,570
I fell over, perplexed

595
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:18,096
I found it best to lay still.

596
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,413
I could hear him walking
back and forth,

597
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,411
The he started running
along the pathway.

598
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:30,528
I stood up, walked inside,
and washed my wound.

599
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,653
I hid the gun,
and sat down to wait.

600
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,491
He was gone a few minutes.

601
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:40,691
Then he came back.

602
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,977
I hid myself to be sure.

603
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,891
He looked crazy.

604
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,891
He walked around the livingroom, 
talking to himself.

605
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:55,340
He took out his diary,
and started to write.

606
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,976
He wrote for hours.

607
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,733
Then he packed his bag

608
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,692
And walked towards the forest.

609
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:10,213
I thought it was best to follow 
him, since he could hurt himself.

610
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,128
Can't you see me ?

611
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:02,737
Where is he ?

612
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,738
I know where you can find him.

613
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,739
Shout for him.

614
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,730
I,ve been wondering about one thing :

615
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,209
Are you in a hurry ?

616
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,495
I want to ask something.

617
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:49,168
A woman who lives with a man
for a long time,

618
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:53,458
does she not end up like
the man ?

619
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:59,291
She loves him,
attempts to think like him.

620
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:01,139
See like him.

621
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:04,494
It is said such things can
change a person.

622
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:10,657
Is that why I started to
see the other ones ?

623
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:14,215
Or did they really exist ?

624
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,168
I believe...

625
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,332
if I had loved him less

626
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:23,658
and not worried so much
about what surrounded him,

627
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,210
Would I have been better
able to protect him ?

628
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:34,097
Or was it that I did not
love him sufficiently,

629
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:37,375
which caused my jealousy ?

630
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,691
Is that the reason those "cannibals",
as he called them...

631
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,458
Is that why things
went so bad for us ?

632
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:58,294
I felt so close to him.

633
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:04,293
Sometimes he would say he felt
close to me too.

634
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,656
One time, he said so decisively.

635
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,897
If only I could have followed him 
at all times !

636
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,456
So many things to think about...

637
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,331
so many questions.

638
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:29,769
Sometimes you dont know in
from out, and you turn completely...
