1
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,300
- Happy birthday, Alice.
- Hi, Dad.

2
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,700
We got a new patient at the back.
Your kind of dog, you know?

3
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
You can see him after school.

4
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
He's so cute. Aw!

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Hey, little boy. Thanks, Dad.

6
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
- Guess which hand.
- The right one.

7
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,500
Yes.

8
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,300
A locket. I love it.
Thanks, Mum. I love you.

9
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,200
I love you too.

10
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,300
Birthday girl.

11
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,200
Oh, you're so silly!

12
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,100
And straight to school. Happy birthday!

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Hi, boy. How are you?

14
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,100
Did Dad fix you OK?

15
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,000
No!

16
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,600
Excuse me. Um...

17
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,500
Is this hypoallergenic?

18
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,100
- Hello there.
- Afternoon, Arthur.

19
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,000
- Afternoon, boss.
- You here to keep your hand in?

20
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,500
I would normally. The knee,
you see, not getting any better.

21
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,800
That's why I got a younger man in.

22
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Steady hand, see.

23
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,900
Just steady her there, yeah?

24
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,400
Ah, there we are.

25
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,600
Hello. I'm sorry, I was hoping
to get something for a headache.

26
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,300
Sure. Come in.

27
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
Headache, was it, Miss Brogan?

28
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,600
- Mary. Are you all right?
- Yes, yeah.

29
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,100
I... I didn't see anyone else come in.

30
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,900
- Are you two togeth...?
- My niece. Deirdre.

31
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
- Hi.
- She's visiting.

32
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,800
- Looks like you need a refill.
- Right.

33
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,200
Yeah, thank you.

34
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,100
When did you do the place up?
It looks really different.

35
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,200
- Just recently.
- Must be nine months.

36
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,800
More, even, since they moved here.

37
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,400
Ventolin. I need to see a prescription.

38
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,300
I might have it here.
I do hold on to everything.

39
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
- How long are you visiting for?
- What a relief.

40
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,800
This expired last year.

41
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,600
Hey.

42
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
You all right?

43
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,500
- What are you doing?
- You know what I'm doing.

44
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,400
No!

45
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,900
It's like a black hole in here.

46
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,100
We're not just throwing
Alice's stuff away.

47
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,700
- No, we can't keep them.
- D'you not understand?

48
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm not... I'm not ready.

49
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
You'd forget her if you could.

50
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,800
What can I do?

51
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,200
You can let me go.

52
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,600
It's not you, Patrick.
It's not because of you.

53
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,400
You know what?
All I want is for you to be OK.

54
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,700
Drive me to the station.

55
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,300
What is it?

56
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,500
We'll get some help at Arthur's place.
He'll know a mechanic.

57
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,100
Listen. It's there when the wind dies.

58
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,700
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

59
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,800
Brilliant.

60
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,300
These look like gravestones.

61
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Car's there.

62
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,400
- I'll try and call him.
- I'll check round the back.

63
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,400
Let's go home.

64
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,700
What happened?

65
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,300
Louise.

66
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,100
- Talk to me, will you?
- Look, I just wanna go to bed.

67
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,900
Louise, Patrick.

68
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,100
Arthur, what are you doing here?

69
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,400
I just wanted to make sure that
everything's all right with you both.

70
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,600
- What do you mean?
- Well, is it?

71
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,800
Our car broke down
in the middle of nowhere.

72
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,800
We walked to your place,
couldn't raise you.

73
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,800
What is this, Arthur?
You just let yourself into our home?

74
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,900
Country habits, I suppose.

75
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,200
You say you came to my place.

76
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Well, that would make sense.

77
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,100
- What the hell is this?
- All right, I'm going.

78
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,100
You're doing a great job here, Patrick.

79
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,000
We're so glad you chose Wakewood
and hope you've found solace here.

80
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,700
Yeah, we're fine.

81
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,400
And how about you, Louise?

82
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,200
Is everything all right with you?

83
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,200
Deirdre?

84
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
- Are you...
- There you are, my pet.

85
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,700
- I'm going home today.
- Is she OK?

86
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,300
Fine, thanks.

87
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,900
- Now...
- I can't wait to go back.

88
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,700
I know, lovely. It's gone so fast.

89
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Um, uh...

90
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
There. For the sunglasses.

91
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Come on, darlir.

92
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,000
Alice has a lovely voice.

93
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,000
- Tell me my daughter's name.
- I don't know.

94
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,000
- Tell me. Tell me my daughter's name.
- I don't know, truly.

95
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,300
Her name was Alice.

96
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,500
Now, how did you niece know that?

97
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,500
What goes on in Wakewood
is not for everyone.

98
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
And what goes on?

99
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,900
Please, make another baby to love.

100
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,700
I can't.

101
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,300
I know how you feel.

102
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,000
No, I don't think you do.

103
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,600
Deirdre's not your niece.
So, then, tell me.

104
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
You want to get your daughter back,
don't you?

105
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,000
Is that possible?

106
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,100
I can't say, and that's the truth.

107
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,600
- Hello.
- Hey.

108
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
I've gotta go over to O'Shea's.
Can you help?

109
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,500
- I can't.
- Pick you up at ten?

110
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,700
- Go on, go on. Get in there.

111
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,400
Go on, get in there.

112
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,200
Go on, get up there.

113
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,700
- That's a bitch of a fever he's got.
- Yeah, he has all right.

114
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,200
I'll give him a shot.
Can you prep 35 mil?

115
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,400
And maybe get
an anti-inflammatory as well.

116
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,400
Go on, get up.
Get up here! Go on. Get up there!

117
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,100
- Move up. Move him up.
- Go up there.

118
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,900
- Go on, get up. Get up, get up!
- He won't move, Da.

119
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,300
Come on!

120
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,300
Come on!

121
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,800
- What are you doing?
- Let me see.

122
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,400
- Shush, woman!
- I'll try and get him where he is.

123
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,600
Keep still.

124
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,900
We're gonna have to get him
up to the restraint. Go on! Go on!

125
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,100
- Bad idea, Mick.
- Don't be upsetting yourself.

126
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,700
- Get out of there, Mick!
- Come on! Come on!

127
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,100
- Come on!
- Da, please! Da, please.

128
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,400
Get out of there! Pull him up!
Pull him up! Pull him up!

129
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,200
Open the front gate!

130
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,200
I can't! It's stuck! Push it!

131
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,300
Da! Da!

132
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,900
Da.

133
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,200
You did everything possible.

134
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,800
I think you'd better find someone else
to run the practice.

135
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,700
We're leaving Wakewood.

136
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,200
It's been a shock to you.
We'll talk tomorrow.

137
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,500
Arthur.

138
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
We're not staying.

139
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,200
Tell me about your daughter.

140
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,000
- This isn't the time.
- I think it is the time.

141
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,300
- Arthur...
- Listen to me.

142
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
Listen to me.

143
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,200
I can bring your daughter back to life
for a short time,

144
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,200
so you can see her, hold her again
and say goodbye properly.

145
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,000
- Would that ease your pain, hm?
- That's not funny.

146
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,000
If she's been dead for less than a year,
I can bring her back.

147
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
It's only for three days.
For most people it's enough.

148
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,500
That is ridiculous. It is nonsense.

149
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,400
All right. All right.

150
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,700
But do one thing for me, Patrick.

151
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,100
Before you deride my offer...

152
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
...ask your wife.

153
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
She knows.

154
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,900
- I told you already.
- You didn't tell me anything.

155
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,800
- Please, just stop this.
- Stop this? Stop what?

156
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
- What is it you think I'm doing?
- Come on, babe.

157
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,400
Please, come on, be straight with me.
What did you see?

158
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,800
What did you see?

159
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,500
I saw something like...

160
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
What?

161
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,500
A birth... maybe.

162
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,300
And?

163
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,900
I believe him.

164
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,700
Patrick, I believe what Arthur said.

165
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,300
If we do this, will you stay?

166
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,800
Louise?

167
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,900
I just want her back.

168
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,700
OK.

169
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,100
But it's not so simple, is it?

170
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,900
If we have to lie, isn't it won'th it?

171
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,800
- What was your daughter's name?
- Alice.

172
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,400
Alice Hannah Daley.

173
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,500
Alice Hannah Daley.

174
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,800
- Did she prefer mornings or evenings?
- Mornings.

175
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,300
- Was her skin moist or dry?
- Moist.

176
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,300
Would she have liked
cats, cows or horses?

177
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,800
Horses, ponies, definitely.

178
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,900
- Was her hair thick or lank?
- It was fine. Wasrt it?

179
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,400
Quite fine.

180
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,100
- What time of the year was she born?
- October. 22nd.

181
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,100
How long has your daughter
been in the ground?

182
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,500
Patrick, how long has your daughter
been dead and buried?

183
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,500
It's been eleven months,
two weeks, two days.

184
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
This is what we can do.

185
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,200
Your daughter will be brought back.
Make the most of the time.

186
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,200
And after she'll go back to the woods.

187
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,100
- She's just on loan.
- Will she be normal?

188
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,400
Yes, quite. Her heart will beat,
her breath will breathe

189
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
and she'll remember the time
she had with you, some of it.

190
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,900
It lasts for three days only,

191
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,200
during which you must keep Alice
within the townland of Wakewood.

192
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,200
The wind turbines lie beyond
our boundary. Let them be your guide.

193
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,400
This is a physical necessity.

194
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,600
Why only three days?

195
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,900
We tap the life force
of a fresh cadaver.

196
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,300
Three days' won'th is all we get.

197
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,200
Perhaps it mirrors the stages
of existence, birth, life, death.

198
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
I don't truly know.

199
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,800
Now, for this to work, we need a body,

200
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,800
and, as you are more than well aware,

201
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,700
we have recently had a tragedy
in the community.

202
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,800
Perhaps we should prevail on the family.

203
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,400
The ritual of the return
binds you to Wakewood.

204
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,700
You will settle here permanently
and you will tend animals without fail

205
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,400
whenever this town needs you.

206
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,700
Do we have an agreement?

207
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,300
We just wanna see her again.

208
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,000
Then you shall.

209
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,000
You were there. The vet's wife.

210
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,700
Yes.

211
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,700
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

212
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,300
Mrs O'Shea,
I'm very sorry for your loss.

213
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,200
In my mind, he's the young boy I met.

214
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,600
Our daughter was killed last year.

215
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,100
She was our only child.

216
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,100
When she was born, it didn't go well.

217
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,800
I can't have any more.

218
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,900
I know this is
a terrible time for you, but...

219
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,500
...I need to ask you
if we can use your husband's remains

220
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,100
to help bring her back.

221
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,700
- You don't know what you're asking.
- No, you're right. I don't.

222
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,400
But I need to see her again.

223
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,600
You live in Wakewood now, don't you?
But it's not part of you.

224
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,500
You're just visiting maybe.
I can't imagine what that's like.

225
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
We're all born here.

226
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,700
Mrs O'Shea,
we're very happy in Wakewood.

227
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,300
Stand up for me.

228
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,800
- No, it's not right.
- What?

229
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,900
I don't know what it is,
but it's not right. I won't do it.

230
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,500
Peggy, they have to ask.

231
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,400
You're upset.

232
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
There is something I don't like.

233
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,800
They have to ask you,
but you have to be amenable, Peggy.

234
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,700
That's the only way this can continue.

235
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,800
Do you not want
to see Mick yourself, hm?

236
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,300
You wouldn't deny me Mick's return.

237
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,400
They need your help.

238
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,700
You'll need to provide a relic of Alice
for the ritual.

239
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Like what?

240
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,100
In this case,
we're close to the time limit.

241
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Her favourite teddy?

242
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,600
The relic needs to be
more closely connected. A lock of hair.

243
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,500
We don't have anything like that.

244
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,900
Whatever you provide,
it needs to be personal to Alice.

245
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,900
In a corporal, physical way.

246
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Very much so.

247
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
D'you understand?

248
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
You think Peggy knows?

249
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
You're ready?

250
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,100
You're very welcome.

251
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,000
Come.

252
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,100
We have to crush his thorax first.

253
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,600
In times past,
they did this with a lump hammer.

254
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,400
Right, that'll do!

255
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,200
Patrick, lend a hand.

256
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,200
Now we cut the spinal cord.

257
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,000
You do it for me, would you, Patrick?

258
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,900
We need the relic.

259
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,700
Very good.

260
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
On the wild wind thee fly,
'tween this world and the next,

261
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,400
from that twilight realm
you see o'er your perch

262
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,300
the trials of the living
and the wake of the dead.

263
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,100
Help us now call Alice,

264
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,200
and bring her here for three days

265
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,500
and afterwards return.

266
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,200
Go to the trees. Lie among the roots.

267
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,600
Go to the trees. Lie among the roots.

268
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,500
Take these hands.

269
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,600
Alice.

270
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,000
- Take these bones.
- Alice.

271
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,700
- Take this heart.
- Alice.

272
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,300
And, Alice, take these eyes.

273
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,500
Bring him down.

274
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,800
Now we need living blood.
Female blood would be better.

275
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,100
Cut me.

276
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,600
Come, come.

277
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,200
Stand back, stand back.

278
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,700
Feel now the power of transformation

279
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,700
course through your true selves.

280
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,100
Look away, look away!

281
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,100
Avert your gaze!

282
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,200
Here she comes. Here she comes.

283
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Here she comes.

284
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,800
Here she comes. Here she comes.

285
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,800
Here she comes.

286
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,200
Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby.

287
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,800
My baby. Alice.

288
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,900
Your hair's grown so long.

289
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,000
I had such a strange dream.

290
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,300
It's over now.

291
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,500
- Her eyes are brown.
- Yeah, Mick had brown eyes.

292
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,800
- Where's Alice?
- Getting dressed.

293
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,600
- Hey, sweetie.
- Did you sleep well?

294
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,900
The house seems strange.

295
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,500
- It...
- Yeah, it is. Um...

296
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,400
- We came here for a break.
- I must have slept the whole way.

297
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,600
Is this for real?

298
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,100
After you.

299
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,800
No, you're not gonna get me.

300
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,800
Oh, Alice.

301
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,100
- Come on, start counting.
- One, two, three, four,

302
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,800
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

303
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,500
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

304
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm coming, ready or not!

305
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,500
- I got you!

306
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,900
I found your father!

307
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,500
He's my prisoner! You're next!

308
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Alice!

309
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,400
Come on, baby! Where are you?

310
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,700
Alice!

311
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,400
Alice?

312
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,900
Alice!

313
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,600
Al!

314
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
Alice!

315
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,000
Come on!

316
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,000
Alice.

317
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,700
Oh, sweetie. Are you OK?

318
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,100
What's that doing there?

319
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,500
I don't know. Maybe somebody put it
there to ward off the other birds.

320
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,400
- Hey, I found something.
- What?

321
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,400
Pick a hand.

322
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,700
- Pick another hand.
- Wrong.

323
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
Do you remember when you got it?

324
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,400
You gave it to me sometime.

325
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,600
Come on, baby. Time to go.

326
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,800
Mum, did you hear music last night?

327
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,200
- What kind of music?
- Voices, singing my name.

328
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,100
We'll take him home
and I can stitch him.

329
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,100
He doesn't have a collar.

330
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,900
- Dad.
- Uh-huh?

331
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,100
Can I do it?

332
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,600
Yeah, go and put
some of those gloves on.

333
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,900
OK, hold it. Hold it really tight.

334
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,800
Now, OK.

335
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,600
Now, open that. Take that piece.

336
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,400
Hang on. You pull that through and up.

337
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,500
Like that.

338
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,900
People shouldn't hurt animals,
should they?

339
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,200
No, they shouldn't.

340
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,800
And animals
shouldn't hurt people either.

341
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,400
Well, that's kind of different,
you know?

342
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,400
I'd heard you'd had a bit of trouble.

343
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,400
- Could say that, yeah.
- Mm.

344
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,100
- Dad, can we keep him?
- Well, I don't see why not.

345
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,500
- Mum said we could.
- Oh, she did, did she?

346
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,400
- I'm gonna call him Howie.
- Howie? Ooh, I like it.

347
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,400
Don't make it hard to say goodbye.

348
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,000
- Good night.
- Night.

349
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,900
- Got some blankets for us.
- OK.

350
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,500
Once upon a time, there was
a little tearaway called Alice.

351
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,200
- No, called Louise.
- This about me, is it?

352
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,700
OK, called Louise, and she lived
with her brothers and sisters.

353
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,800
- And her sheepdog.
- And her sheepdog.

354
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,600
And they lived in a big house on a hill
overlooking the city.

355
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,100
And the house had a field
and an orchard.

356
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,300
And every year the trees...

357
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,000
Hello, Alice. How are you?

358
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,500
How would you like
to come and ride our pony?

359
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,000
Dad, I'm going pony riding.

360
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,500
- Mrs O'Shea, it's very kind of you...
- Alice wants to ride our pony.

361
00:51:14,535 --> 00:51:17,100
And it needs the exercise.
I'll bring her back later.

362
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,600
I'm sorry,
but, um, we made plans for today.

363
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,200
- No, Dad, I want to go now.
- Calm down.

364
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,500
- Mum, I've been invited pony riding.
- Oh?

365
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,300
Why don't you all come?

366
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,000
Tell you what, why we don't have
some breakfast and then we'll see.

367
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,200
OK.

368
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,200
Keep her awake.

369
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,800
Now, would you like
to pop over a jump?

370
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,800
D'you think she's ready?
She's hardly ever ridden.

371
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,300
She'll be fine. She's a natural.

372
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,200
See that? No bother at all.

373
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,500
We have some tea and sandwiches
going inside. Would you like to come in?

374
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,300
- Alice, are you ready?
- Let her finish up.

375
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,100
We'll come in when she's done.
She won't be long, I promise.

376
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,700
Alice, there's a game
you might enjoy playing.

377
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,300
- What's the game?
- It's a quiz.

378
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,800
I ask the questions, you answer,
I keep score.

379
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,900
Now, Alice Daley, what is your name?

380
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,100
Right, I see the way it is.

381
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,400
Tell me, when you close your eyes
when you're tired,

382
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
what do you see,
more yellow or brown?

383
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,000
I see a big red shape.

384
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,500
Go on, have another one there, Patrick.

385
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,800
I think maybe we should check on Alice.

386
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,700
- Yeah.
- They'll be back any minute.

387
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,100
Let me see your hand.

388
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And what's your date of birth?

389
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,200
I think I know, a little bird told me,
but if you're not more cooperative,

390
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,600
I don't think
you'll be riding that pony again.

391
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,800
Alice, are you a normal little girl?

392
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,700
Why would you ask me that?

393
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,900
- Why don't you look at me?
- I've seen enough.

394
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,500
- What's up, sweetie?
- I don't like that woman.

395
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,200
She's not right.
You've got to take her back.

396
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,900
- Alice.
- Al, wait a sec.

397
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,400
Alice!

398
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,700
Peggy knows. Let's take our chances
and get out of Wakewood.

399
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Then we leave right now.
You go get the car.

400
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,100
Hey, Alice!

401
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,600
Mum's gonna come and pick us up, OK?

402
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,900
Did Mrs O'Shea frighten you?

403
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,500
Alice.

404
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,700
- Alice!

405
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,800
Open the door!

406
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,000
- What happened?
- Open it!

407
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,800
What happened to her?

408
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,000
- Go back. Go back!
- Is she OK?

409
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,500
- What happened?
- We tried to leave.

410
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,700
What happened?

411
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,000
Howie, good boy!

412
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,400
We're trapped.

413
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,800
Did you hear something?

414
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,200
We must put Alice back in the ground
where she belongs.

415
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,300
- Do it now.
- Three days. We have one day left.

416
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,000
- We cannot delay.
- You tried to leave.

417
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,400
Now, wait a minute.
She made Alice very frightened.

418
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
- It was necessary.
- It was cruel.

419
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,900
I'm disappointed.

420
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,300
You have to obey the rules, Patrick.
I thought I made that absolutely clear.

421
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,400
- Give up your last day.
- Do it now.

422
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,900
- Put her back, to be safe.
- You're not taking her.

423
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,400
- Louise, you'd better bring her now.
- You're not taking my baby.

424
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,500
- We want you to do this.
- Mum. Why are they here?

425
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,600
- It's OK.
- Three days, Arthur.

426
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,500
I'll fight you and every one of you
if I have to. Do you understand?

427
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,300
Patrick, we've come to talk,
and there are people here

428
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,200
who believe there's something amiss,
something not according to plan.

429
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,700
- Do you see any signs of that?
- No, I don't, none at all.

430
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:08,200
You must tell me
if you observe anything unexpected,

431
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,300
anything beyond what we discussed,
do you understand?

432
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,700
The smallest detail
could have disastrous consequences.

433
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,500
She's fine. She's our little girl.

434
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,900
For one more day.

435
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,700
Alice, wait here.

436
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,800
Patrick?

437
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,900
Oh, my God.

438
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,500
I don't understand.
Why would they do this to Howie?

439
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,000
- Are we so sure that it was them?
- What are you saying?

440
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Alice.

441
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,000
Show me your hands.

442
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,200
- Is this a game?
- Yeah, it's a game.

443
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,100
Alice, show me your hands.

444
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,600
Alice, go to your room and play.

445
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,300
Why?

446
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,600
- Louise.
- Go upstairs.

447
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,700
This is Alice's last day.

448
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,700
Today you must be strong for her.

449
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:31,100
But she'll want to go herself.
You won't have to persuade her.

450
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,800
Here's something for her to wear
around her neck.

451
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,500
We call it a clutch.
You'll find it gives her comfort.

452
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,800
Sure.

453
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,500
If she becomes agitated,
you can fasten it about her wrists.

454
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,800
Mary, I need
to talk to my husband for a sec.

455
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,400
I can't do this. I'm not ready. I can't.

456
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,200
We could run.

457
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,600
- This is all wrong.

458
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,000
Hello?

459
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,300
Yeah, look, I'll come tomorrow.

460
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,000
OK, 20 minutes.

461
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,000
- No.
- I've got to.

462
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,100
You want them all here again,
banging their sticks?

463
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,500
You just keep her away from Alice.

464
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,800
I'll come back before midnight
and we'll go to the woods.

465
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,000
Alice?

466
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,600
Hey.

467
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,100
Whers the baby coming?

468
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,700
What?

469
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,700
Alice?

470
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,000
Where are you?

471
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:06,500
- Anything you can do?
- We can put him out of his misery.

472
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,700
Injection, is it?

473
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,800
No, he's too big.

474
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,700
Alice. Alice! Baby...

475
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,100
Alice! Alice!

476
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,400
It's time to go to the woods.

477
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,200
Interesting.

478
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,000
Arthur.

479
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,600
Get out of this house.

480
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,700
Don't look at her.

481
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,600
Ben, don't look at her.

482
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,400
Look away.

483
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,600
Don't look at her. Look away. Ben!

484
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,500
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

485
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,500
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

486
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,700
Go back to the trees
and lie among the roots.

487
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,100
Back to the trees
and lie among the roots!

488
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,600
I'll see you later.

489
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,200
Now...

490
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,000
That won't work on me.

491
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,800
Alice?

492
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,100
Patrick, is Alice here? Is she with you?

493
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,400
Listen, I think
Alice has done something...

494
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,800
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me, Louise.

495
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Patrick, I'm pregnant.

496
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,300
No, you're not.

497
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,400
- No, you can't be. That's impossible.
- I know, but I am.

498
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,600
Alice found out.
I... I mean, she already knew.

499
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,500
I've looked everywhere for her.
I thought maybe she'd come here.

500
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,600
Yeah, yeah, I think she did come here.
Come and look.

501
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,200
Oh, my...

502
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,900
Where would she have gone?

503
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,200
Home, sooner or later.

504
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,200
What the hell have we done?

505
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,800
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't know.

506
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,600
There's some stuff on the road.

507
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,800
Oh, my God.

508
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,600
Oh!

509
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,000
Get in.

510
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,500
Mum!

511
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,200
Alice?

512
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:53,600
- You were going to leave me.
- We didn't know where you were.

513
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,500
I'm right here.

514
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:04,500
Dad, am I dead?

515
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,100
I've got something for you, Alice.

516
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,800
Do you want me to fasten it on for you?

517
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,800
Thanks, Dad.

518
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:43,000
- Love you.
- Love you, Dad. And you too, Mum.

519
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,500
I love you too.

520
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,900
I wanna stay with you.

521
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:14,100
- What is it? What's happened?
- We found her in the woods.

522
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:17,200
- It's all gone wrong.
- What have you done?

523
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,800
- I think she's stopped breathing.
- She'll not stay that way.

524
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,900
- You have the clutch I gave you?
- No, it's not here.

525
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,200
May we all survive.

526
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,000
Please put me down.

527
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,800
I don't wanna go back.

528
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,100
I don't want to be on my own again.

529
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Why are you making me do this?

530
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,500
We're almost there.

531
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,600
Patrick?

532
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,300
Come now, Alice. It's time.

533
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,900
Alice!

534
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,300
Stop!

535
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,200
Mum.

536
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,500
11 months, two weeks and two days.

537
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,600
- Well, you fooled me, Patrick.
- We wanted to see her again.

538
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,200
- You wanted to keep us here.
- How long has she been dead?

539
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,400
A year...

540
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,700
A month, a couple of days.
Let me go. I can help.

541
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,900
The clutch will release you
when she's back in the ground.

542
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,400
- Mum!
- Arthur, she'll kill my wife!

543
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,700
Where are you?

544
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:01,200
I hope not.

545
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,000
Mum!

546
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,600
Dad!

547
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,600
Alice!

548
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,700
Alice!

549
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,900
Alice!

550
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,400
Mum!

551
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,700
Alice, it's me!

552
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,800
Hey, sweetie.

553
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,900
Why did you run away?

554
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,600
I was scared.

555
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,800
Are you still scared?

556
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:40,100
- Not really.
- I bet you are.

557
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:47,400
- Maybe just a little bit.
- You could come to me now, though.

558
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,700
I know, but...

559
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,900
...l'm a little tired.

560
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,800
Mum.

561
01:17:57,900 --> 01:18:00,000
Yes, sweetie.

562
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,300
Can I have a hug?

563
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,100
Course you can.

564
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,700
I'm sorry.

565
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,400
It's OK. Off to bed.

566
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,300
Off to blanket street.

567
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,000
Almost there.

568
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,200
I'll just make up the bed.

569
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,900
There we go.

570
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,500
Are you comfy?

571
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:23,900
Once upon a time there was a little girl

572
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,900
who went for a long walk in the woods.

573
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,400
She walked and walked

574
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,200
until she discovered
she had lost her way,

575
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:39,700
and although the darkness
was drawing near,

576
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,000
the little girl knew
she didn't have far to go.

577
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,500
The cottage and safety
were only a few steps away.

578
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,300
A few short steps and she would be happy
for ever and ever.

579
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,700
The door opened...

580
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:08,900
...and her mum and dad
took her into their arms...

581
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,500
...and into the warmth.

582
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,500
And the door closed

583
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,600
on the cold and the darkness...

584
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,500
...and the night.

585
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,200
Louise.

586
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,600
- Help me!
- Patrick!

587
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,300
Help me!

588
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,700
No!

589
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:23,000
Louise! Louise!

590
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,600
Louise!

591
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,800
They've gone, Patrick.

592
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,800
You won't find them.

593
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,400
I tried to warn you
there'd be consequences.

594
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,300
So, how is it?

595
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,600
It's OK.

596
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,500
- And Alice?
- She's great.

597
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:29,600
We miss you.
She's hoping for a baby sister.

598
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,700
Really?

599
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,500
How much do you remember?

600
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,000
I don't really know.

601
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,100
I'll be there in a minute.
