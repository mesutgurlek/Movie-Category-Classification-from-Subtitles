1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,671
(thunder rumbling)

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,465
Merle:
That's right. You heard me, bitch.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,092
You got a problem?

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,344
Bring it on
if you're man enough,

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,555
or take it up the chain
if you're a pussy.

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,394
You heard me,
you pussy-ass noncom bitch.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,187
You ain't deaf.

8
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,231
Take it up
the damn chain of command

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,985
or you can kiss my lily-white ass.

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,113
(laughs)
That's right.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,532
That's what I said.
You heard me.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,118
And then this idiot,
he takes a swing,

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,245
you know, and well...

14
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,498
(laughing hysterically)

15
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,501
Oh, you should've seen
the look on his face

16
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,963
when I punched out his front teeth.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,591
Yeah, five of 'em.

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,553
Pow! Pow! Just like that.

19
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,555
Huh.

20
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,724
Oh my god.

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,102
16 months in the stockade--

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,439
oh, that's what them teeth cost me.

23
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,151
That was--

24
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,862
that was hard time,

25
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,074
but by God,
it was worth every minute of it

26
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,202
just to see that prick

27
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,413
spit his teeth out on the ground.

28
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,042
Yes sir,

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,753
worth every minute.

30
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,131
Mmm.

31
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,219
(wind blowing)

32
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,110
Oh no.

33
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,113
No no! No no! No no!

34
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,823
God! God!

35
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,326
No no!
(grunts)

36
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,536
God! Jesus!

37
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,121
No no, merciful Christ!

38
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,790
No no. No no.

39
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,210
God, help me! God! God!

40
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,254
Jesus, please! Jesus, please.

41
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,965
Help me! Come on now!

42
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,675
Help me.

43
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,844
(zombies growling, banging)

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,435
(softly)
No no. Oh, no no.

45
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,895
Oh my God.

46
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,356
Shh shh shh shh shh.

47
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:31,943
(crying)
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

48
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,491
No no no no no no.

49
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,159
Please.

50
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,537
I didn't behave, I know.

51
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,664
I know I'm being punished.

52
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,874
I know. I--

53
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,377
oh, I deserve it. I deserve it.

54
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,962
I've been bad.

55
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,842
Help me now.
Show me the way.

56
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,344
Go on, tell me what to do.

57
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,012
Tell me. Tell me.

58
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,100
God!

59
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,651
(grunting)

60
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,697
That's okay.

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,450
Never you mind, silly Christ boy.

62
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,536
I ain't begged you before.

63
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,038
I ain't gonna start begging now.

64
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,624
I ain't gonna beg you now!

65
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,711
Don't you worry about me

66
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,839
begging you ever!
I'll never beg you!

67
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,216
I ain't gonna beg you!

68
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,552
I never begged you before.

69
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,430
- (grunting)
- (banging, growling continues)

70
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,474
Oh shit.

71
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,563
No!

72
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,357
(theme music playing)

73
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,603
Best not to dwell on it.

74
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,939
Merle got left behind.

75
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,568
Nobody's gonna be sad
he didn't come back...

76
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,572
except maybe Daryl.

77
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,408
- Daryl?
- His brother.

78
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,286
(car alarm approaching)

79
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,081
(Glenn whooping)

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,960
Whoo-hoo!

81
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,798
At least somebody's
having a good day.

82
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,717
- (rattling)
- (kids grunting)

83
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,096
- Girl: Give it back.
- Boy: Stop it.

84
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,225
- Girl: No!
- Boy: I found it.

85
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,310
- Girl: No!
- Boy: Give it.

86
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,104
M'hijo, leave your sister alone.

87
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,605
- Why?
- Come on.

88
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,732
Baby, the more you fidget,
the longer it takes.

89
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,485
- So don't, okay?
- I'm trying.

90
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,736
Well, try harder.

91
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,154
Shane:
If you think this is bad,

92
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,782
wait till you start shaving.

93
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,158
That stings.

94
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,577
That day comes,
you'll be wishing

95
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,037
for one of your mama's haircuts.

96
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,665
- I'll believe that when I see it.
- (Shane chuckles)

97
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,001
I'll tell you what--
you just get through this

98
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,046
with some manly dignity and tomorrow
I'll teach you something special.

99
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,758
I will teach you to catch frogs.

100
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,012
- I've caught a frog before.
- I said frogs-- plural.

101
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,181
And it is an art, my friend.
It is not to be taken lightly.

102
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,934
There are ways and means.

103
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,602
Few people know about it.

104
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,063
I'm willing to share my secrets.

105
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,526
Oh, I'm a girl.
You talk to him.

106
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,904
(chuckles) It's a one-time offer,
bud-- not to be repeated.

107
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,324
Carl:
Why do we need frogs, plural?

108
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,119
- Shane: You ever eat frog legs?
- Eww!

109
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,039
- No, yum!
- No, he's right. Eww.

110
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,666
When you get down
to that last can of beans,

111
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:17,626
you're gonna be loving
those frog legs, lady.

112
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,005
I can see it now-- "Shane, do you think
I could have a second helping, please?

113
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,924
- Please? Just one?"
- Yeah, I doubt that.

114
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,135
(chuckles)
Don't listen to her, man.

115
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,596
You and me, we'll be heroes.
We'll feed these folks

116
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,639
Cajun-style Kermit legs.

117
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,725
I would rather eat Miss Piggy.

118
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,728
- Yes, that came out wrong.
- (Shane laughs)

119
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,439
Shane: Heroes, son,
spoken of in song and legend.

120
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,316
You and me, Shane and Carl.

121
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,318
- (Carl and Shane laugh)
- (car alarm approaching)

122
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,112
Man:
Hey, Dale, can you see what that is?

123
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,906
Shane:
Talk to me, Dale!

124
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,076
- I can't tell yet.
- Man: Let him get a good look at it.

125
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,457
Is it them? Are they back?

126
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,545
Dale:
I'll be damned.

127
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,049
- Amy: What is it?
- A stolen car is my guess.

128
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,606
- Holy crap. Turn that damn thing off!
- I don't know how!

129
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,441
- Pop the hood, please. Pop the hood.
- My sister Andrea--

130
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,777
- Pop the damn hood, please!
- What? Okay okay. Yeah yeah yeah

131
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,738
- yeah yeah!
- Is she okay? Is she all right?

132
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,074
- Yeah yeah. She's okay! She's okay!
- Is she coming back?

133
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,034
- Glenn: Yes!
- Amy: Why isn't she with you?

134
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,954
- Where is she? She's okay?
- Yes!

135
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,039
Yeah, fine. Everybody is.

136
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,084
Well, Merle not so much.

137
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,169
Are you crazy, driving this
wailing bastard up here?

138
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,046
Are you trying to draw
every walker for miles?

139
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,091
- I think we're okay.
- You call being stupid okay?

140
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,801
Dale: Well, the alarm was
echoing all over these hills.

141
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,137
Hard to pinpoint the source.

142
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,472
I'm not arguing. I'm just saying.

143
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,307
It wouldn't hurt you
to think things through

144
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,434
a little more carefully
next time, would it?

145
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,603
Sorry.

146
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,481
Got a cool car.

147
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,735
(truck approaches)

148
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,663
- Come meet everybody.
- (engine stops)

149
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,879
(sliding door opens)

150
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,048
- Amy.
- (crying) Andrea!

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,346
- Andrea: Oh!
- Oh my God!

152
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,516
You scared the shit out of me.

153
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,020
- Boy: Papi! Daddy!
- Morales: Hey.

154
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,980
Lori:
Come here, sweetie.

155
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,523
Morales: Hey.

156
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,443
I told you I'd be back, didn't I?

157
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,115
(silent)

158
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,368
(whispers)

159
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,705
- Dale: You are a welcome sight.
- (both laugh)

160
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,833
I thought we had lost
you folks for sure.

161
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,752
How'd y'all get out
of there anyway?

162
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,047
- New guy-- he got us out.
- Shane: New guy?

163
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,174
Morales: Yeah, crazy vato
just got into town.

164
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,802
- Hey, helicopter boy! Come say hello.
- (truck door opens, shuts)

165
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,224
Morales:
The guy's a cop like you.

166
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,285
Oh my God.

167
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,207
Dad! Dad!

168
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,959
(crying)

169
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,628
Carl.

170
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,423
Oh!

171
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:26,667
- (crickets chirping)
- Rick: Disoriented.

172
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,753
- (crickets chirping)
- Rick: Disoriented.

173
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,006
I guess that comes closest.

174
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,466
Disoriented.

175
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,096
Fear, confusion--
all those things but...

176
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,764
(thunder rumbling)

177
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,309
disoriented comes closest.

178
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,602
Words can be
meager things.

179
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,480
Sometimes they fall short.

180
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,983
Rick: I felt like I'd been
ripped out of my life

181
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,152
and put somewhere else.

182
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,114
For a while
I thought I was trapped

183
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,491
in some coma dream,

184
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,453
something I might not
wake up from ever.

185
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,498
Mom said you died.

186
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,464
She had every reason
to believe that.

187
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,674
Don't you ever doubt it.

188
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,262
Lori: When things started
to get really bad,

189
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,639
they told me at the hospital that

190
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,976
they were gonna medevac you
and the other patients to Atlanta,

191
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,271
and it never happened.

192
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,899
Well, I'm not surprised
after Atlanta fell.

193
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,735
- Lori: Yeah.
- And from the look of that hospital,

194
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,445
it got overrun.

195
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,407
Yeah, looks don't deceive.
I barely got them out,

196
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,368
you know?

197
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,579
I can't tell you how grateful
I am to you, Shane.

198
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,457
I can't begin to express it.

199
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,212
There go those words
falling short again.

200
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,422
Paltry things.

201
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,052
(wood clatters)

202
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,185
Hey, Ed, you want
to rethink that log?

203
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,229
It's cold, man.

204
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,068
The cold don't change
the rules, does it?

205
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:20,072
Keep our fires low,
just embers, so we can't be seen

206
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,574
- from a distance, right?
- I said it's cold.

207
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,743
You should mind your own
business for once.

208
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,586
Hey, Ed... (pats)

209
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,715
(softly) are you sure you want
to have this conversation, man?

210
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,721
Go on.
Pull the damn thing out.

211
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,432
Go on!

212
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,270
(mutters)
Christ.

213
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,399
(wood thunks, sizzling)

214
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,121
Hey, Carol, Sophia,
how are y'all this evening?

215
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,124
- Fine. We're just fine.
- Shane: Okay.

216
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,835
- I'm sorry about the fire.
- Shane: No no no no.

217
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,587
No apology needed.

218
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,798
Y'all have a good night, okay?

219
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,468
Thank you.

220
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,803
I appreciate the cooperation.

221
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,396
(Shane sighs)

222
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,065
Dale: Have you given
any thought to Daryl Dixon?

223
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,943
He won't be happy to hear
his brother was left behind.

224
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,155
I'll tell him.
I dropped the key. It's on me.

225
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,073
I cuffed him.
That makes it mine.

226
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,742
Glenn:
Guys, it's not a competition.

227
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,577
I don't mean to bring race into this,

228
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,954
but it might sound better
coming from a white guy.

229
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,167
I did what I did.

230
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,503
Hell if I'm gonna hide from him.

231
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,631
- We could lie.
- Or tell the truth.

232
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,050
Merle was out of control.

233
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:06,136
Something had to be done
or he'd have gotten us killed.

234
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,097
Your husband did
what was necessary.

235
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,682
And if Merle got left behind,

236
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,851
it is nobody's fault but Merle's.

237
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,270
And that's what we tell Daryl?

238
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,525
I don't see a rational discussion

239
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,777
to be had from that, do you?

240
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,114
Word to the wise--

241
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,867
we're gonna have our hands full

242
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,702
when he gets back from his hunt.

243
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,832
T-Dog:
I was scared and I ran.

244
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,210
- I'm not ashamed of it.
- Andrea: We were all scared.

245
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,837
We all ran. What's your point?

246
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,090
I stopped long enough
to chain that door.

247
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,677
Staircase is narrow.

248
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,304
Maybe half a dozen geeks
can squeeze against it

249
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,223
at any one time.

250
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,642
It's not enough
to break through that--

251
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,894
not that chain, not that padlock.

252
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,692
My point-- Dixon's alive

253
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,778
and he's still up there,
handcuffed on that roof.

254
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,739
That's on us.

255
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,339
I found you, didn't I?

256
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,093
I love you, Dad.

257
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,764
I love you, Carl.

258
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,139
I found you both.

259
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,933
- Lori: Yeah.
- (thunder rumbling)

260
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,189
I knew I would.

261
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,485
You're getting cocky now,
a little bit.

262
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,945
No. No, I knew.

263
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,659
Walking into our home,
finding an empty house,

264
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,661
- both of you gone.
- I'm so sorry.

265
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,914
I knew you were alive.

266
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,834
How?

267
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,880
The photos were gone,

268
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,174
all our family albums.

269
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,560
(chuckles)

270
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,366
I told you so.

271
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,035
Now you're getting cocky, huh?

272
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,704
A lot.

273
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,386
It belongs in here.

274
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,603
Baby, I really thought
I would never see you again.

275
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,943
I'm so sorry...

276
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,071
for everything.

277
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,868
I feel like--

278
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,162
when you were
in the hospital, I just--

279
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,080
I wanted to take it all back--

280
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,666
the anger and the bad times.

281
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,335
But the mistakes--

282
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,924
Maybe we got a second chance.

283
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,260
Not many people get that.

284
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,321
I wondered where that went.

285
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,575
Do you want it back?

286
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,496
Of course.

287
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,742
(rain pattering)

288
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,293
He won't wake up.

289
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,393
(thunder rumbling)

290
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,881
(bugs chittering)

291
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,049
(kids playing)

292
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,607
(people chatting)

293
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,317
- Morning.
- Man: Morning.

294
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,528
- Hey.
- Hi.

295
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,866
- Carol: Morning.
- Morning.

296
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,284
They're still a little damp.

297
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,744
The sun'll have 'em
dry in no time.

298
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,872
- You washed my clothes?
- Well, best we could.

299
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,248
Scrubbing on a washboard

300
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,500
ain't half as good
as my old Maytag back home.

301
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,586
That's very kind.
Thank you.

302
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,425
- (tools clanging)
- Look at 'em.

303
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,677
Vultures.

304
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,721
Yeah, go on, strip it clean.

305
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,640
Generators need every drop
of fuel they can get.

306
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,018
Got no power without it.
Sorry, Glenn.

307
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,938
Thought I'd get to drive it
at least a few more days.

308
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,358
Maybe we'll get to steal
another one someday.

309
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,281
Lori:
Morning, officer.

310
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,283
Rick: Hey.

311
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,997
You sleep okay?

312
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,459
Better than in a long time.

313
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,127
(chuckles)

314
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,839
Well, I didn't want to wake you.
I figured you could use it.

315
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,470
- God. What?
- I've been thinking

316
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,931
about the man we left behind.

317
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,852
You're not serious.

318
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,481
(car approaches)

319
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,988
Water's here, y'all.

320
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,740
Just a reminder to boil before use.

321
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,833
Are you asking me or telling me?

322
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,836
- Asking.
- Well, I think it's crazy.

323
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,171
I think it is just
the stupidest way

324
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,673
- to break your son--
- (woman screams)

325
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,133
- Carl: Mom!
- Carl?

326
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,467
Man:
It's over there!

327
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,844
- Carl: Dad!
- Lori: Baby!

328
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,304
- Girl: Mama! Mommy!
- Glenn: Rick!

329
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,348
- Lori: Carl!
- Man: Over here! Come on, come on!

330
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,892
Lori:
Carl! Baby!

331
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,020
- Carl: Mom!
- Lori: You're okay! I've got him.

332
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,147
Nothing bit you?
Nothing scratched you?

333
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,481
- No, I'm okay.
- (cans rattle)

334
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,326
(growling)

335
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,048
(gasps)

336
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,686
(men grunting)

337
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,916
It's the first one
we've had up here.

338
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,251
They never come this far
up the mountain.

339
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,004
Well, they're running out
of food in the city, that's what.

340
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,427
- (branch snaps)
- (footsteps)

341
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,239
- Oh, Jesus.
- Man: Son of a bitch.

342
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:12,742
That's my deer!

343
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,746
Look at it.
All gnawed on by this...

344
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,790
(kicking)
filthy, disease-bearing,

345
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,709
motherless poxy bastard!

346
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,294
Calm down, son.
That's not helping.

347
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,963
What do you know
about it, old man?

348
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,799
Why don't you take that stupid hat
and go back to "On Golden Pond"?

349
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:31,636
I've been tracking
this deer for miles.

350
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,638
Gonna drag it back to camp,

351
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,765
cook us up some venison.

352
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,767
What do you think?
Do you think we can cut around

353
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,310
this chewed up part
right here?

354
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,937
I would not risk that.

355
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,606
(sighs)
That's a damn shame.

356
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,276
I got some squirrel--
about a dozen or so.

357
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,154
That'll have to do.

358
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,160
Oh God.

359
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,913
Come on, people.
What the hell?

360
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,339
It's gotta be the brain.

361
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,592
Don't y'all know nothing?

362
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,518
Merle!

363
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,773
Merle! Get your ugly ass out here!

364
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,359
I got us some squirrel!

365
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,320
Let's stew 'em up.

366
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:35,408
Shane: Daryl, just slow up a bit.
I need to talk to you.

367
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,704
Daryl:
About what?

368
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,040
Shane:
About Merle.

369
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,666
There was a--

370
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,835
there was a problem in Atlanta.

371
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,678
He dead?

372
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,098
Shane:
We're not sure.

373
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,226
He either is or he ain't!

374
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,895
No easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

375
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,232
- Who are you?
- Rick Grimes.

376
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,818
Rick Grimes, you got something
you want to tell me?

377
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,904
Your brother was
a danger to us all,

378
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:16,032
so I handcuffed him on a roof,
hooked him to a piece of metal.

379
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,326
He's still there.

380
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,080
Hold on.
Let me process this.

381
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,124
You're saying you handcuffed
my brother to a roof

382
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,834
and you left him there?!

383
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,920
Yeah.

384
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,884
- (grunts)
- Hey.

385
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,595
Watch the knife!

386
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,555
(shouts, grunting)

387
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,893
Shane:
Okay. Okay.

388
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,230
- You'd best let me go!
- Nah, I think it's better if I don't.

389
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,357
(Daryl grunting)
Choke hold's illegal.

390
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,192
Shane:
You can file a complaint.

391
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,194
Come on, man.
We'll keep this up all day.

392
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,282
I'd like to have
a calm discussion on this topic.

393
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,325
Do you think
we can manage that?

394
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,662
- Do you think we can manage that?
- Shane: Hmm?

395
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,623
Mmm. Yeah.

396
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,084
(Daryl panting)

397
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,628
What I did was not on a whim.

398
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:14,757
Your brother does not work
and play well with others.

399
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,720
It's not Rick's fault. I had the key.

400
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,431
- I dropped it.
- You couldn't pick it up?

401
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,017
Well, I dropped it
in a drain.

402
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,027
If it's supposed to make me
feel better, it don't.

403
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,611
T-Dog:
Well, maybe this will.

404
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,572
Look, I chained
the door to the roof--

405
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,324
so the geeks couldn't
get at him--

406
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,244
- with a padlock.
- It's gotta count for something.

407
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,626
Hell with all y'all!

408
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,962
Just tell me where he is

409
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,006
so's I can go get him.

410
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,633
Lori:
He'll show you.

411
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,635
Isn’t that right?

412
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,977
I'm going back.

413
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,028
(sighs)

414
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,829
So that's it, huh?

415
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,831
You're just gonna walk off?

416
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,708
Just to hell with everybody else?

417
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,627
I'm not saying
to hell with anybody--

418
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,962
not you, Shane;
Lori least of all.

419
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,298
Shane:
Tell her that.

420
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,676
She knows.

421
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,221
Shane:
Well, look, I--

422
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,390
I don't, okay, Rick?
So could you just--

423
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,475
could you throw me
a bone here, man?

424
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,185
Could you just tell me why?

425
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,521
Why would you risk your life
for a douche bag like Merle Dixon?

426
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,398
Daryl: Hey, choose your words
more carefully.

427
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,483
No, I did.
Douche bag's what I meant.

428
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,485
Merle Dixon--

429
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,196
the guy wouldn't give you a glass
of water if you were dying of thirst.

430
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,073
Rick: What he would
or wouldn't do doesn't interest me.

431
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,659
I can't let a man
die of thirst-- me.

432
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,953
Thirst and exposure.

433
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,580
We left him like
an animal caught in a trap.

434
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,041
That's no way for anything to die,
let alone a human being.

435
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:17,088
So you and Daryl,
that's your big plan?

436
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,593
Oh, come on.

437
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,887
You know the way.
You've been there before--

438
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,348
in and out, no problem.
You said so yourself.

439
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,560
It's not fair of me to ask--
I know that--

440
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,145
but I'd feel a lot better
with you along.

441
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,105
I know she would too.

442
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,442
That's just great. Now you're
gonna risk three men, huh?

443
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,944
- T-Dog: Four.
- (huffs)

444
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,113
My day just gets better
and better, don't it?

445
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,198
T-Dog: You see anybody else
here stepping up

446
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,410
- to save your brother's cracker ass?
- Why you?

447
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:48,953
T-Dog: You wouldn't even
begin to understand.

448
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,831
- You don't speak my language.
- Dale: That's four.

449
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,293
It's not just four. You're putting
every single one of us at risk.

450
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,920
Just know that, Rick.
Come on, you saw that walker.

451
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,589
It was here.
It was in camp.

452
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,090
They're moving out of the cities.

453
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,009
They come back, we need
every able body we've got.

454
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,802
We need 'em here.
We need 'em to protect camp.

455
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,971
It seems to me what
you really need most here

456
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:12,226
- are more guns.
- Right, the guns.

457
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,145
- Wait. What guns?
- Six shotguns,

458
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,190
two high-powered rifles,
over a dozen handguns.

459
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,775
I cleaned out the cage
back at the station before I left.

460
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,487
I dropped the bag
in Atlanta when I got swarmed.

461
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,281
It's just sitting there on the street,
waiting to be picked up.

462
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,869
- Ammo?
- 700 rounds, assorted.

463
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,830
Lori: You went through
hell to find us.

464
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,000
You just got here and you're gonna
turn around and leave?

465
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,378
Dad, I don't want you to go.

466
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,342
To hell with the guns.
Shane is right.

467
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,511
Merle Dixon?

468
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:50,014
He's not worth one of your lives,
even with guns thrown in.

469
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,559
Tell me.
Make me understand.

470
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:58,189
I owe a debt to a man
I met and his little boy.

471
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,691
Lori, if they hadn't
taken me in,

472
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,693
I'd have died.

473
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,488
It's because of them
that I made it back to you at all.

474
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,907
They said they'd
follow me to Atlanta.

475
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,535
They'll walk into the same trap
I did if I don't warn him.

476
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,038
What's stopping you?

477
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,916
The walkie-talkie,
the one in the bag I dropped.

478
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:20,419
He's got the other one. Our plan was
to connect when they got closer.

479
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,422
- These are our walkies?
- Yeah.

480
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,424
So use the CB.
What's wrong with that?

481
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,385
The CB's fine.

482
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,303
It's the walkies
that suck to crap--

483
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,056
date back to the '70s,
don't match any other bandwidth--

484
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,933
not even the scanners
in our cars.

485
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,563
I need that bag.

486
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,785
Okay?

487
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,542
All right.

488
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,673
- (truck beeping)
- Rumor is you have bolt cutters.

489
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:11,053
- Maybe.
- T-Dog: Yeah, we get to that roof,

490
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,973
we'll need to cut that chain
and the handcuffs.

491
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,310
I never like lending tools.

492
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,061
The last time I did--

493
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,272
and yes, I am talking
about you--

494
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,608
let's just say your bag of guns

495
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,443
wasn't the only bag
that was dropped.

496
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,070
My tools got
left behind with Merle.

497
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,114
Rick:
We'll bring your tools back too.

498
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,576
Think of the bolt cutters
as an investment.

499
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,246
Sounds like more of a gamble.

500
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:46,881
- What do I get in return?
- Rick: What do you want?

501
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,674
How about one of those guns
you bring back?

502
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,093
- My pick.
- Done.

503
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,096
(man clears throat)
Dale, let's...

504
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,307
sweeten the deal a bit.

505
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,976
Now that cube van of yours--

506
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,145
What about it?

507
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,439
The RV's radiator hose is shot.

508
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:07,026
That's a problem if we need to get
somewhere and wanna get very far.

509
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:10,780
And the hose on that van is
just about a perfect match--

510
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,782
well, enough that I can make it fit.

511
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,825
I'll tell you what-- we get back,

512
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,454
you can strip that van down
to the bare metal.

513
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,998
(truck honks)

514
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,876
- Come on, let's go!
- Thank you.

515
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,593
Hey, Rick,
got any rounds in the Python?

516
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,179
No.

517
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,806
Last time we were
on the gun range,

518
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,226
I'm sure I wound up
with a few loose rounds of yours.

519
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,855
You and that bag--
like the bottom of an old lady's purse.

520
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,482
I hate that you're doing this, man.

521
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,026
I think that
it's foolish and reckless.

522
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,570
But if you're gonna go,
you're taking bullets.

523
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,032
I'm not sure I'd want
to fire a shot in the city,

524
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,743
- not after what happened last time.
- That's up to you.

525
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,746
Well...

526
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,543
four men, four rounds.

527
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,504
What are the odds, huh?

528
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:11,257
Well, let's just hope that--

529
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:14,093
let's just hope that four is
your lucky number, okay?

530
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,013
- Thank you.
- All right.

531
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:36,073
(truck starts, revving)

532
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,338
Hey.
(sniffling)

533
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,340
You know,
I bet they'll be just fine.

534
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,552
I'm not worried.

535
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,973
Are you?

536
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,561
Yeah, a little.

537
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,147
Don't be.

538
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,776
- Why?
- Think about it, Mom.

539
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,570
Everything that's
happened to him so far--

540
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,364
nothing's killed him yet.

541
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,200
(chuckles)

542
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,467
Daryl:
He'd better be okay.

543
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,636
It's my only word on the matter.

544
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,554
I told you the geeks
can't get at him.

545
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,475
The only thing that's gonna
get through that door is us.

546
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,352
- (brakes squeak)
- (gear shift clicks)

547
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,355
- (engine stops)
- We walk from here.

548
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,835
Lori: Dale.

549
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,463
- Have you seen Carl?
- Shane took him down to the quarry.

550
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,842
There was some mighty bold talk
about catching frogs.

551
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,015
(women chatting)

552
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,812
Carl:
I'm not getting anything.

553
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,772
Yeah.

554
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,024
Being all wily,
staying submerged.

555
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,985
Little suckers,
they know something's up.

556
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,486
That's what's going on.

557
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:40,531
Just going to have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

558
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,200
All right, little man, look.

559
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,744
You are the-- you are
the key in all this, okay?

560
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,872
All I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go after one of them,

561
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,207
all right, scare the rest of them off.
They're all gonna scatter.

562
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,251
- I'm gonna drive 'em your way, okay?
- All right.

563
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,544
What you need to do
is you need to round up

564
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,713
every bad boy you see,
all right? Are you with me?

565
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,548
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hells yeah. Give me your mean face.

566
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,425
- (both growl)
- Yes sir. Are you ready?

567
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:00,926
- Yeah!
- Are you ready? Here we go, boy.

568
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,887
Here we go.

569
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,398
- (laughing)
- All right, they're coming your way.

570
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,025
They're coming your way.
Go on, get 'em, get 'em.

571
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,401
They're coming
your way, come on.

572
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,237
Catch them frogs.
Catch them frogs.

573
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,198
They're coming, little man! Get 'em!
Get that net in there and get 'em!

574
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:27,119
I'm beginning to question
the division of labor here.

575
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,705
They're coming, little man! Get 'em!
Get that net in there and get 'em!

576
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,750
What have you got, bad boy?
What do you got? What do you got?

577
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,711
- Dirt.
- Oh boy.

578
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,129
All right, we've got to start over.

579
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,883
- Come on, let's find this bucket.
- (both laughing)

580
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:42,927
Can someone explain to me
how the women wound up

581
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,261
doing all the Hattie McDaniel work?

582
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,889
The world ended.
Didn't you get the memo?

583
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,644
It's just the way it is.

584
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,819
(fence clatters)

585
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,282
- Merle first or guns?
- Merle! We ain't even having

586
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,493
- this conversation.
- (emphatically) We are.

587
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,119
You know the geography.
It's your call.

588
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,247
Merle's closest.
The guns would mean doubling back.

589
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,041
Merle first.

590
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,877
(scrubbing)

591
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,589
Carol:
I do miss my Maytag.

592
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,053
I miss my Benz, my sat nav.

593
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,763
I miss my coffeemaker

594
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,682
with that dual-drip filter

595
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,059
and built-in grinder, honey.

596
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,727
My computer...

597
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,562
and texting.

598
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,940
I miss my vibrator.

599
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,442
Jacqui: Oh!

600
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,278
- (women laugh)
- Amy: Oh my God!

601
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,617
- Me too.
- (women laughing louder)

602
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,000
What's so funny?

603
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,252
Just swapping war stories, Ed.

604
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,879
Yeah.

605
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,134
(water dripping)

606
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,309
Andrea:
Problem, Ed?

607
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,062
Nothin' that concerns you.

608
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,858
And you ought to focus
on your work.

609
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,569
- This ain't no comedy club.
- (Andrea huffs)

610
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,323
Hey, Carl,

611
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,659
what did I tell you about
not leaving Dale's sight?

612
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,245
But Shane said we could
catch frogs, remember?

613
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,289
It doesn't matter what Shane says.
It matters what I say.

614
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,958
- Go on back to camp.
- (sighs)

615
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,127
Lori:
I'll be right behind you.

616
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,549
I've got to tell you,

617
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,593
I do not think you should be
taking this out on him.

618
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,887
Lori: You don't tell me what to do.
You lost that privilege.

619
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,890
Lori, could you just wait up a sec?
I think we should talk.

620
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,224
- We haven't had a chance--
- No. No no.

621
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,226
That's over too.
You can tell that to the frogs.

622
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,145
Damn it, Lori. Look, I don't know
how it appears to you

623
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,105
- or what you think--
- How it appears to me? I'm sorry.

624
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,816
Is there a gray area here?
Let me dispel it.

625
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,943
You stay away from me.
You stay away from my son.

626
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,987
You don't look at him.
You don't talk to him.

627
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,740
From now on,
my family is off-limits to you.

628
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,911
Lori, I don't think that's fair.

629
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,039
- Shane, shut up. Don't! (slapping)
- I don't think that--

630
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:20,584
My husband is back.
He is alive.

631
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,378
He's my best friend.

632
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,256
Do you think
I'm not happy about that?

633
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,425
How dare you?
Why would you be?

634
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,929
You are the one that
told me that he died.

635
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:35,891
You son of a bitch.

636
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,568
(shuffling footsteps)

637
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,120
(growling)

638
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:06,839
Damn. You are one ugly skank.

639
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,302
(thuds)

640
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,610
(scrubbing)

641
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,699
Ed, tell you what--

642
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,659
you don't like how
your laundry is done,

643
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,996
you are welcome to pitch in
and do it yourself. Here.

644
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,832
- Oh!
- Ed: Ain't my job, missy.

645
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,001
- Andrea, don't.
- What is your job, Ed?

646
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,878
Sitting on your ass
smoking cigarettes?

647
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,129
Well, it sure as hell
ain't listening

648
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,589
to some uppity
smart-mouthed bitch.

649
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,967
Tell you what--
come on. Let's go.

650
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:54,136
I don't think she needs
to go anywhere with you, Ed.

651
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,346
And I say it's none of your business.
Come on now.

652
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,348
- You heard me.
- Carol.

653
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,517
Andrea, please.
It doesn't matter.

654
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,187
Hey, don't think
I won't knock you on your ass

655
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,022
just 'cause you're some
college-educated cooze,

656
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,690
- All right?
- (gasps)

657
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,359
Now you come on now
or you gonna regret it later.

658
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,695
So she can show up
with fresh bruises later, Ed?

659
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,697
- Yeah, we've seen them.
- (laughs)

660
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,908
Stay out of this.
Now come on!

661
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,368
You know what?
This ain't none of y'all's business.

662
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,996
You don't want to keep prodding
the bull here, okay?

663
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,540
Now I am done talking.
Come on.

664
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,834
- No no. Carol, you don't have--
- (Carol mutters)

665
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:28,337
You don't tell me what!
I tell you what!

666
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,505
(clamoring)

667
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,591
- You think you can--
- Amy: Get off her!

668
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,426
- Ed: Come here! Come here!
- Amy: Get off her!

669
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,179
- Get off her! Get off her!
- Ed: Get off me!

670
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,431
- (Ed grunting)
- Carol: Ed?

671
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,725
- Amy: It's okay. It's okay.
- Carol: No!

672
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,353
- It's okay.
- No!

673
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,866
- (women yelling)
- Amy: Shane, stop!

674
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,451
Just stop!

675
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,996
Carol:
Stop it!

676
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,998
- Stop!
- You put your hands on your wife,

677
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,959
your little girl
or anybody else in this camp

678
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,336
one more time, I will not stop
next time. Do you hear me?

679
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,255
- Do you hear me?!
- (slurs) Yes.

680
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,131
- I'll beat you to death, Ed.
- Carol: Ed!

681
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,926
- I'll beat you to death.
- (Carol crying) Oh God!

682
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,469
No.

683
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,097
- God!
- (grunts)

684
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,101
(crying)
Ed, I'm sorry.

685
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,938
Oh my God. Ed, I'm sorry.

686
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,942
I'm so sorry, Ed.

687
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,528
Ed, I'm sorry.

688
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,822
- I'm sorry, Ed.
- (coughing)

689
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:45,247
(chain rattles)

690
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,507
Daryl:
Merle! Merle!

691
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,808
No! No!

692
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,606
No!

693
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:26,413
No! No!

694
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,884
(theme music playing)
