00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:06,226
Everyone! Get into your houses!
Go!

3
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:07,903
<i>(Glenn) My friend's
are in there.</i>

4
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:09,664
<i>My pregnant wife.</i>

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,750
No!

6
00:00:10,834 --> 00:00:11,834
Argh!

7
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:15,300
Ugh!
No!

8
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:18,206
<i>(Tara) You're not gonna
make it out there.</i>

9
00:00:18,292 --> 00:00:19,708
<i>(Wolf)
We'll see.</i>

10
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:21,153
<i>(Rick) We're gonna
gut these things.</i>

11
00:00:21,178 --> 00:00:22,970
<i>It'll mask our smell.</i>

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,429
<i>Make 'em think we're like them.</i>

13
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:27,103
<i>Stay calm.
Don't draw attention.</i>

14
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:28,971
<i>We can move right through 'em.</i>

15
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:52,756
Why don't you come on out,
join us in the road?

16
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:54,945
That's great.

17
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:57,094
It's going well
right out of the gate.

18
00:00:57,096 --> 00:00:59,630
Now, step two,
hand over your weapons.

19
00:00:59,632 --> 00:01:03,200
- Why should we?
- Well, they're not yours.

20
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:05,302
Whose are they?

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,285
Your property
now belongs to Negan.

22
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:22,629
And if you can get your
hands on a tanker,

23
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:25,232
you're people our person
wants to know.

24
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:29,236
So let's get those
sidearms, shall we?

25
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:32,639
Right now.

26
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,564
Thank you.

27
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,487
Thank you.

28
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:56,963
If you have to eat shit,

29
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:59,299
best not to nibble.

30
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:02,169
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.

31
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:03,970
It goes quicker.

32
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,683
( mouths )
Thank you.

33
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,655
Who are you people?

34
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:24,357
I get the curiosity,

35
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,560
but we have questions ourselves.

36
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,864
And we'll be
the ones asking them

37
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:34,868
while we drive you back to
wherever it is you call home.

38
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,771
Take a gander at where
you hang your hats.

39
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,375
First, though, your shit.

40
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,910
<i>What have you got for us?</i>

41
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:45,412
Yeah, you just took it.

42
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,517
Come on.

43
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,886
I mean, can we not, okay?

44
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:54,988
<i>There's more.</i>

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,524
<i>There is always more.</i>

46
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,695
( sighs )

47
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:04,431
T...

48
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,234
take my man to the back
of the truck,

49
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,202
start inside the back bumper,

50
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,671
<i>work your way to the front.</i>

51
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:12,839
Go.

52
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:20,213
Bite, chew, swallow, repeat.

53
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:21,748
Who's Negan?

54
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,251
♪ Ding, dong ♪

55
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,253
♪ Hell's bells. ♪

56
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,125
You see, usually
we introduce ourselves

57
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:34,561
by just popping one of you
right off the bat.

58
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,530
But you seem like
reasonable people.

59
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:40,500
I mean, you're sportin' dress
blues, for Christ's sake.

60
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:42,903
And, like I said, we're gonna
drive you back to where you were.

61
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,905
I mean, do you know
how awkward it is

62
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:47,774
carpooling with someone whose friend
or friends you've just killed?

63
00:03:47,776 --> 00:03:49,943
Oof.

64
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:54,114
But I told you
not to ask any questions.

65
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:56,216
And then what does
this ginger do?

66
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:00,203
So that's that.

67
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,455
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me.

68
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,207
- ( hammer clicks )
- Wait.

69
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,563
Wait.

70
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,933
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>

71
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,103
Shut up.

72
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:20,273
I am talking to the man.

73
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,943
No, you're not.

74
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,379

76
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:35,822
I'm not gonna kill you.

( sighs )

78
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:44,331
Wait, wait.

79
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,301
You know what?

80
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:49,569
Yes, I am.

81
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:08,955

Son of a bitch

85
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:24,371
- Sasha: Did he cut you?
- A little.

86
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:29,409
What a bunch of assholes.

87
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,845
Let's get you fixed up at home.

88

Yes, ma'am.

All of us drive.
We'll need to round 'em up.

00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,574
We'll die.

139
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:34,776
That is what will happen.

140
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,327
We have one gun,

141
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,497
and the streets are filled
with those things.

142
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,449
That man needs her.

143
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,118
Okay?
She's a doctor. He is sick.

144
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,337
And I think we've seen
that he knows how to survive.

145
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,424
But we need to make sure
that Carol and Morgan are okay

146
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:50,925

Where's Denise?

159
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,764
He took her, didn't he?

160
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,506
Let's get you up.

161
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,570
Maybe when they searched this
place, they missed something.

162
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:14,008
Depends if it was Aiden or Heath's
group who went through it.

163
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:16,794
Easy.

164

165
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:23,968
Look in the Bibles, too.

166
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,686
Could've hollowed out the pages.

167
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:27,688
Are you serious?

168
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,557
<i>We have two bullets.</i>

00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,526
People holed up in here--

170
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,864
people hide guns, ammo.

171
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,867
Maybe something to start a fire.

172
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:43,621
It's getting dark out soon.
Maybe we can distract them.

173
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,541
<i>We need sheets,
ropes, towels--</i>

174
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,010
<i>anything Maggie can use
to climb down the other side.</i>

176
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,476
Enid.

177
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,431
When I wanted to run...

178
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:17,355
you said, "That's
how you lose people...

179
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,527
even after they're gone."

180
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,117
What the hell does that mean?

181
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,122
People you love...

182
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,209
they made you who you are.

183
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:42,396
Glenn:
<i>They're still part of you.</i>

184
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,899
<i>If you stop being you,</i>

185
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:48,169
<i>that last bit of them that's still
around inside, who you are...</i>

<i>it's gone.</i>

187
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,143
Who are those people to you?

188
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,479
My parents.

189
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,482
A man named Dale.

190
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,653
Maggie's father, Hershel.

191
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,289
A woman named Andrea.
A man named Tyreese.

192
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,458
Who are they to you?

193
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,666
My parents.

194
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,005
Then they're still here...

195
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,507
'cause you're still here.

196
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:36,434
When there's an opening, we'll
make a break for that tower.

197
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,685
Hmm?

198
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,487
No, I'll just slow you down.

199
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:41,656
Denise.

200
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:45,443
Denise, you're here...

201
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,828

202
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,613
I need you.

203
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,035
Maybe I want you to stay

204
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,703
'cause I'm enjoying
your company so much.

206
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,293
I want you to stay put.

207
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,544
What?

208
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,962
I wanted you to come back.

209
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,348
I can handle myself.
You said you wanted help.

210
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,350
No, I didn't want you
to give up on this place,

211
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:11,719
on these people, to be afraid.

212
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,021
You were right.

213
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,642
So I'm here now.

214
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,729
And I'm going out there
and I'm helping you.

215
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,649
We have to get her
off that platform.

216
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,818
She's hurt.
She needs help getting over the wall.

217
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,322
I can climb up the gate.
You can distract them.

218
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,074
We do it together.

219
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:37,578
( chuckles )
I'm just gonna follow you, anyway.

221

<i>I'll make her something
to climb down.</i>

222
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,766
Okay.

223
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,606
I like what you said before.

224
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,942
That I wasn't born this way.

225
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:11,779
You're right.

226
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,615
I changed.

227
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,818
And now I want
to help you change.

228

<i>Hey.</i>

229
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,764
You were right.

230

Let's get Maggie.

231
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,303
Can't you just stay here?

232
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,139
Nope.

233
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:42,109
You've been given
a gift, Denise.

234
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,614
You'll see that one day.

235
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,517

<i>A husband?</i>

336
00:26:30,436 --> 00:26:33,487
I didn't want to hurt you,
I just had to stop you.

337
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:36,641
You saved him for you, not us.

338
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:41,546
If it was for us,
you would've...

339
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:53,891
I should've killed you.

340
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:55,993
I should've.

341
00:27:04,938 --> 00:27:07,138
You can't.

342
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:23,287
The infirmary's
right across the alley.

343

We need to get you there now.

Hey!

00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:32,463
The ladder was clear.
Could've made it.

346
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,916
You turned back for me.

347
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:38,052
Maybe it was because
you needed a doctor,

348
00:27:38,054 --> 00:27:40,171
or maybe you changed.

349

I'm fine.
How are my patients?

359
00:28:21,881 --> 00:28:23,965
They're doing well.
We moved them upstairs just in case.

Two IVs from the fridge and all

Michonne:

What are you doing?

We've been praying...
together.

Praying that God
will save our town.

Well, our prayers
have been answered.

416
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:40,642
God will save Alexandria...

417
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:43,862
because God has given us the
courage to save it ourselves.

Guys, it's thinning
out there in front.

It's time.

Did you see her?

426
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:13,057
Yeah, she made it
to the infirmary.

That's incorrect.
I do.

500
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,006
with them...

501
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,060
when it was over...

502
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,601
when I knew
we had this place again...

503
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,105
I had this feeling.

504
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:33,948
It took me a while

505
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,618
to remember what it was...

506
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,954
because I haven't felt it

507
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:43,791
since before I woke up
in that hospital bed.

508
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,465
( crying )
I want to show you the new world, Carl.

509
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,138
I want to make it
a reality for you.

510
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:03,060
Please, Carl...

511
00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:08,782
let me show you.

512
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:13,287
Plea-- please, son,
don't die.

513
00:42:17,116 --> 00:42:41,259
