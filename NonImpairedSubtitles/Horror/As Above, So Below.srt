1
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,711
(Motor engine whirring)

2
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,913
(Rattling)

3
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:55,054
(Chickens clucking)

4
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,166
I've just crossed the
iranian border en route
to the habala region

5
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,333
where they've
ordered the destruction

6
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,270
of a network of caves
by sundown tonight.

7
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,372
I believe that these
caves might contain

8
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,107
a critical missing
piece of our history.

9
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,176
If I'm found dead,

10
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,079
please know that I
entered this country
of my own free will,

11
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:22,047
fully knowing
that the punishment
for trespassing here

12
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,416
is burial up to
your neck in sand

13
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,752
and having a rock wall
pushed on top of you.

14
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:32,024
But they would have
to catch me first.

15
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,127
(Indistinct chattering)

16
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,103
(Knocking on door)

17
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,706
Hurry. Come.

18
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,045
Scarlett.

19
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:55,581
Scarlett: Reza.
Thank you.

20
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,951
If they catch you,
it would be very
bad for you.

21
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,919
Yes, I know, Reza.
We will be quick.

22
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:01,987
Okay.

23
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,292
Here it is.

24
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,229
Reza: Here,
use the ladder.

25
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,530
Okay.
Okay.

26
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,069
(Alarm blaring)

27
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,071
We haven't got
much time.
Scarlett: I know, I know.

28
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,439
They have already
cleared the area.

29
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,908
I know, Reza.
Hurry.

30
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,410
Just follow me. Follow.

31
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,213
Come on.

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,484
Watch your step here.
It's fine.
Go, just go.

33
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,753
Yes. Come on.

34
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,523
(Whispering)
Turn off the light.
Turn off the light!

35
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:42,427
Come on. Right this way.

36
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,497
(Man ordering
indistinctly
over loudspeaker)

37
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,774
(Man ordering
continues)

38
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,955
(Siren blaring)

39
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,358
We need to leave.
We are too late.

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,961
No, they are not
blowing the caves up
until sundown.

41
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:19,031
We still have
a few minutes.
We're not leaving.

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,833
Hurry, hurry!

43
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,302
Yes.

44
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,369
(Siren continues)

45
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,372
Come on.

46
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,640
Shit.

47
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,976
Reza: There!

48
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,578
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,979
Oh, my God!

50
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,381
It's even more
beautiful than
in the picture.

51
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,050
Okay.

52
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,118
We must hurry, please.

53
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,554
Okay.

54
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,489
There's more.

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,894
What are you doing?

56
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,663
They're going to
blow it up anyway.

57
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,999
I can't think straight
with this thing on my head.

58
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,774
They will
hear you. Stop!

59
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,142
I just need one minute.

60
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,952
Oh, my God.

61
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,832
(Scarlett exhales)

62
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,368
Scarlett: Oh, my God.

63
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,205
Yeah?
Reza?

64
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:34,806
Do you know
what this is?
I don't know.

65
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,775
Oh, my God.

66
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,611
It's the rose key.
Oh, Reza.

67
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,712
Careful.

68
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,813
Please hurry.

69
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:42,881
I'll be quick.

70
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,650
Scarlett, stop it.
Come on.

71
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,918
I have to scan
these markings.
I'm not leaving.

72
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,087
We must leave.
Now! I can hear them.

73
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,889
My father searched his
entire life for this.

74
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,591
I can't leave now.
I have to get this.

75
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,493
I'm sorry, Scarlett.
I have a family!

76
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,661
I know. It's okay.

77
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,462
Be careful.
I won't be long.

78
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,830
Be careful!

79
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,933
Scarlett: Come on.
Come on, Scarlett.

80
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,869
(Siren continues)

81
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,506
Shit.

82
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,545
Okay. Okay.

83
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,916
Man: <i> Scarlett.</i>

84
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,252
Hello?

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,988
(Siren tempo speeding up)

86
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,190
(Gagging)

87
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,258
<i>Scarlett.</i>

88
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,060
(Explosion)

89
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,600
(Screaming)

90
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,202
(Cave rumbling)

91
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,045
Shit! Oh, God!

92
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,917
Reza! Reza!

93
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,726
Reza! Reza!

94
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,895
Scarlett!
Over here! Scarlett!

95
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:04,996
(Scarlett coughing)

96
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,264
Come over!

97
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,567
Come on.

98
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,103
Are you okay, dear?
Are you okay?

99
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,473
Come on.
Give me your hand.

100
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,274
(Scarlett coughing)

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,454
I got it! I got it!

102
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,395
You remind me so
much of your father.

103
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,399
But, Scarlett,

104
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,334
you must be more careful.

105
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,935
(Dogs barking)

106
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,939
His quest was
a path to madness.

107
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,576
My father wasn't crazy.

108
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:56,281
Everyone who hunts
for flamel's stone
is crazy.

109
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,518
They all wind up dead.

110
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,356
Scarlett: <i> Do I look</i>
<i>in the camera?</i>
Benji: <i> Yeah. Thank you.</i>

111
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,358
<i>That's weird.</i>
(Benji chuckling)

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,860
Benji: <i> Um, so, you can start</i>
<i>by introducing yourself.</i>

113
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,295
<i>Right.</i>
(Clears throat)

114
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,696
My name is
Scarlett marlowe

115
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,233
and I'm a Professor
at university college,
London.

116
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:18,804
I have a ph.D.
In urban archeology,
a master's in chemistry

117
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,473
and another ph.D.
In symbology.

118
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:26,745
I'm also fluent in
four spoken languages
and two dead ones.

119
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:31,583
And I am a black
belt in krav maga,
so watch out.

120
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,085
Benji: That's a lot of
degrees for someone
your age.

121
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:38,190
Yeah. My father insisted.
We had a very
studious household.

122
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,026
Excuse me. One second.

123
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,328
(Stammering)

124
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,197
<i>Pardon.
Pardon.</i>

125
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,799
(Speaking French)

126
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,970
<i>Merci.
Merci beaucoup.</i>

127
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,371
Thank you.

128
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,942
You really need
to learn French.

129
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,977
Yeah, I do need
to learn French.
(Chuckles)

130
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,612
Your father.
Yeah.

131
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,482
What did he teach
you about the
philosopher's stone?

132
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:07,252
Everything. That it's
an elusive substance

133
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,622
that could turn
base metals into gold

134
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,525
and can provide
the key to eternal life.

135
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,595
Sort of crude representation,
but basically

136
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,364
the creation of the stone
was the goal of alchemy

137
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,333
which was an early
form of science

138
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,135
which studied
transformation
in all its forms.

139
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,105
And my father was
actually the world's

140
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,174
preeminent
historian in alchemy.

141
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,209
So, your father,
there was a lot
of speculation

142
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,513
that he was
mentally unstable.

143
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,915
Is there any truth
to that?

144
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,120
Why? Because
he killed himself?

145
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,290
Six hundred years ago

146
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,360
the greatest of
the alchemists,
Nicolas flamel

147
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,996
lived here,
in this house in Paris.

148
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,697
He was widely
believed to have
succeeded

149
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,466
in developing
the philosopher's stone

150
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,302
which would have given him
all the wealth
he could dream of

151
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:00,038
as well as
eternal life.

152
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,473
When grave robbers,
hoping to get

153
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,974
their hands on
the philosopher's stone

154
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,843
tried to dig his body up
out of the cemetery

155
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:08,013
that used to
surround this area here

156
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,249
they found his casket empty,
as well as his wife's.

157
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,520
Okay. So this is
Nicolas flamel's tombstone

158
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,089
which he designed
and carved himself.

159
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,824
And my father
believed that the clues

160
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,426
to the location of
the philosopher's stone

161
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:25,564
were encoded somehow
in these arcane symbols.

162
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,066
But their meaning
has remained
a mystery until

163
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,502
I discovered
the fabled rose key.

164
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,537
It's a kind of
rosetta stone

165
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,974
used for translating
alchemical symbols
into aramaic

166
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,345
which,
unfortunately,
I don't speak.

167
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,648
But luckily,
I know a guy
who does.

168
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,356
What are you doing?

169
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,359
I just have to open
this door quietly.

170
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,097
Benji: Please don't.
Scarlett!

171
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,768
(Door slamming shut)

172
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,806
I can't believe you
just did that. We just
broke into a church!

173
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,041
What does this guy do
all the way up here?

174
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,511
Uh. He likes to, um...

175
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,349
...break into places,
like this

176
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,918
and fix things.

177
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,220
Impressive.
That's a hell of a hobby.

178
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,321
Yeah.

179
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,724
Scarlett:
George? Hello?

180
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,364
I saw your bag, George.
I know you're here.

181
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,235
Hi. How are you?

182
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,903
Whatever it is,
I want nothing
to do with it.

183
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,340
I didn't even
say anything.
I'll save you the time. No.

184
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,410
Who's this guy?
Who are you?

185
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,645
I'm Benji.

186
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,447
He's making a
documentary about my
search for the stone.

187
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,517
Ah. Of course.

188
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,820
Do yourself a favor.
Stay far away
from this one.

189
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,156
I just need to
ask you one favor.

190
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,691
George: Yeah. Just one favor.

191
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:04,162
Benji, did she mention
to you, the last time
we were together

192
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,365
I literally wound up
in a turkish prison?

193
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,635
(Chuckling)
George, it was not a prison.
It was more of a jail.

194
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,872
Jail, in Turkey.

195
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,508
George, I'm sorry.

196
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,343
I couldn't let
the lead go dead.

197
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,844
God forbid.

198
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:24,182
Well, chase your lead.
See how far that gets you.

199
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,718
I got a clock to fix.

200
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,722
I found the rose key,
George.

201
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,192
(Chuckling)

202
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,301
You did?
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,236
It was in Iran,
wasn't it?

204
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,772
Yes.

205
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,975
I knew it.

206
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,712
And I need your help
translating the aramaic.

207
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,413
Wait a minute.

208
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,451
Did you go to Iran?

209
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,689
It doesn't matter
who went there, George.
You did, didn't you?

210
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,324
By yourself?

211
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,661
Doesn't matter
who went.

212
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,329
(Chuckles)

213
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,232
You're a lunatic.

214
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,036
She... you're...
(Laughing)

215
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,872
You're a crazy lunatic.

216
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,007
(Gears creaking)

217
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,514
So, you fixed it.

218
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,716
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

219
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,618
Go, go, go. Come on.

220
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,188
Scarlett:
Are you okay, Benji?
Yeah, I'm good.

221
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,590
Okay.

222
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,391
It's about to get
really loud.

223
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,760
Coming? You coming?

224
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,094
Benji:
Yeah, yeah. I'm good.

225
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,096
(Church bells
dinging)

226
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,364
Shit.

227
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,543
(Bell tolling)

228
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,147
(Chuckling)

229
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,383
Look at them.

230
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,885
George: Hearing their
church bells ring

231
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,454
for the first
time in 284 years.

232
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,629
I'll help you
translate.

233
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,564
But that's it.

234
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,002
(Indistinct chattering)

235
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,743
She's pretty.

236
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,813
Benji:
Yeah, she's really pretty.
She's got great legs, too.

237
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,082
She said we can have
10 minutes. That's it.

238
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,350
Okay.

239
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,621
How do you know her?

240
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,857
Professional circles.

241
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,193
Star is ammonia.

242
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,428
Okay, great.
Star is ammonia.
Is this making any sense?

243
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,363
Just keep going.
Just keep them going.

244
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,666
Lime.

245
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,100
Sword is lime?
Sword is lime.

246
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,669
Okay. And what about
the key?

247
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,103
Uh...

248
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,307
No key.

249
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,875
There's no key?
No.

250
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,844
Why is there no key?

251
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,348
He's carrying
the key on his back.
Look.

252
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,985
So, if he's carrying
the key on his back,

253
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,121
does that mean that
the key is on his back?

254
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,457
It's on the back
of the tombstone.
Scarlett. No.

255
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,692
I need to have
a look behind here.

256
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,227
Scarlett, no!
Come on!

257
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,062
I need you
to help me.
Okay! Shit!

258
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,864
Be careful. Let me...
I need to see
the back.

259
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,233
Okay. I can't...
Watch your foot.

260
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,468
We're gonna
have to put it down
because I can't see.

261
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,404
Shit.

262
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,683
There's nothing there.

263
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:46,985
I can see that.

264
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:50,388
Ammonia sulfonate,
distilled, with lime.

265
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,894
It's the mix of
a couple of basic
cleaning products.

266
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,662
Help me out
here, man.

267
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,730
Benji:
What are you doing?

268
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,834
Okay. You don't want
to breathe this in.

269
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,503
Benji: This is not
gonna end well.

270
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,705
It's on the back.
They will never see it.

271
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,574
George: Oh, my God.

272
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,010
And I need some matches.

273
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,411
Matches? No. No.

274
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,246
Benji: We're not burning that.
Benji, give me
your matches.

275
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,448
Scarlett, this is a museum!
Are you out of your...
Shut up!

276
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,917
Shit!

277
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,254
George: Oh, my God!
This is not okay!

278
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,128
Benji: Wow!

279
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,963
George: Okay,
that's pretty cool.

280
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,702
That's not
"go to jail" cool.
But that's really cool.

281
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,871
Wow.

282
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,406
Get your camera.

283
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,742
"Winged vulture
leads the way

284
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:49,047
"with brightest
light in darkest day.

285
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:52,817
"Underneath the
heaven's reign

286
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,886
"what is lost
shall be regained.

287
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:59,557
"Halfway twixt
the darkest gate

288
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,761
"and this tablet laid
atop a pairèd fate."

289
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,296
So, "underneath
the heaven's reign,

290
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,898
"what is lost
shall be regained."

291
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,399
"What is lost
shall be regained."

292
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,903
So that is,
underneath the night sky

293
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:15,173
or in the open?

294
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,343
Or on the tablet.
There's a night sky
right on the tablet.

295
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,444
Yes, good. Okay.

296
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,980
So, darkest gate.

297
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,684
Hell. Hell.
Darkest gate,
the gates of hell.

298
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,919
The gates of hell.
Right?

299
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,254
Yeah.
The gates of hell.

300
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,256
Okay, but that
doesn't give us anything.

301
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:36,260
I mean, that's halfway
between this grave
and the gates of hell.

302
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,930
No, wait.
I have my dad's
notebook.

303
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,533
Oh, my God. Okay.

304
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,103
So this marks what
they believe to be

305
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,472
the distance
between heaven
and earth and hell.

306
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:51,142
If alchemists believed
that the number of
the devil was 741

307
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,946
then it makes sense
that they would think
that hell was 741 feet

308
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,448
beneath the surface
of the earth, right?
So halfway twixt...

309
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,152
So, 370.5 feet
beneath flamel's
tombstone

310
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,954
is where we'll
find the stone!

311
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,222
Benji: Wait.
Hold on, guys.
How are we

312
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,791
supposed to get 370
feet into the earth?

313
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,660
The catacombs. Right?

314
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,895
Benji: The what?

315
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,132
Okay, we're in Paris, so

316
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:18,002
there are over
200 Miles of tunnels
right underneath our feet.

317
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,572
That are holding
the remains of six
million corpses.

318
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,808
Benji: Whoa, whoa.
Six million corpses?
Yeah.

319
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,143
That's where I would put it!

320
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,911
Right. Of course
you would.

321
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,146
Flamel's grave was here.

322
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:32,884
With the catacomb map,
would make it roughly...

323
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,319
There. Shit.

324
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,821
Wait. Are you sure?

325
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,190
Benji: What is it?
What happened?
Shit!

326
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:41,492
Catacombs don't go
under flamel's grave.

327
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:45,096
But if we burrowed
through this wall here...

328
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,664
No, you can't.
In this tunnel...

329
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,234
The walls are solid
limestone. There's no way
you can burrow in.

330
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,669
Plus, they've all
been reinforced

331
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,738
since pieces of
the city fell into the...

332
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,872
Well then...

333
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,607
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

334
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,676
In 1774,

335
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,346
about a hundred feet
of Avenue denfert-rochereau

336
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,850
was literally swallowed
up into the ground
by the city.

337
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,553
A couple of years later,
the same thing happened...

338
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,388
Barrière d'enfer,
right there.

339
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,957
Followed by
a third collapse.

340
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,628
Rue des innocents.

341
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,630
Benji: Why would
the street collapse
if there's nothing

342
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,699
but solid
ground underneath it?

343
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,568
That's a good
question, Benji.

344
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,204
So there's
a hidden chamber?

345
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,972
It would appear so.

346
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,207
We have to
get down there.

347
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,142
You have to
get down there.

348
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,711
I don't go underground.
Remember?

349
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,947
Yes.

350
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,982
Sorry.

351
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,151
By the end
of the 1700s,

352
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,654
residents from
all over Paris
began to complain

353
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:48,426
about the horrible
smell of the bodies
in the overcrowded cemetery.

354
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:50,394
Something had to be done.

355
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,463
Benji, get this.

356
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,235
(Scarlett reading)

357
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:00,571
"Stop. This is
the empire of the dead."

358
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:04,342
Wait, check out
the patterns and crosses
that they made.

359
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,409
It's beautiful.

360
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,744
Tour guide:
Six million bodies,

361
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,747
almost three times
the population of Paris

362
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,449
are housed
in these quarries.

363
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:15,086
Making it, by far,
the largest crypt
in the world.

364
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,755
Benji:
Seriously, Scarlett,
this is creeping me out.

365
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:18,823
(Scarlett giggles)

366
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,092
Get this.

367
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:24,162
(Scarlett reading)

368
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,933
"At the sound of
the trumpet,
the dead will rise."

369
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:32,603
Benji, here.
Cimetière des innocents.

370
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:36,040
These remains are
from the same cemetery
as the flamel graves.

371
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,510
Which means that...

372
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,784
Yeah, we basically
need to go

373
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,487
about half a mile
through this wall.

374
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:53,824
We need to find a way
into the off-limits
area of the catacombs.

375
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,827
Man: Go to the club
called le showcase.

376
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,196
Sorry?

377
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,334
Ask for papillon.
He'll bring you.

378
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,468
Benji: Papillon?

379
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,636
Tour guide: Please!
Thanks.

380
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,472
Come back into the group.
Please. Come on.

381
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,807
Sorry.

382
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,683
Are you sure
this is where
we're supposed to go?

383
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,085
Yeah, I think it's...

384
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,853
I think it's just
down here.

385
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,255
What's his name again?
Papillon.

386
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,823
Papillon?
Yeah.

387
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,891
Okay.

388
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,760
(Electronic music playing)

389
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,028
Papillon?

390
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,465
(Scarlett
speaking French)

391
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,851
(Speaking French)

392
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,654
(Speaking French)

393
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,808
(Speaking French)

394
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,878
Yes, what do you want?

395
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,880
I need to get
into the catacombs

396
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,616
and someone told me
that you could take me.

397
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,718
(Laughing)

398
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,720
No, sorry. Do I look
like a tour guide to you?

399
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,323
Do I look
like a tourist?

400
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,961
Okay, why would I want
to bring you down there?

401
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,666
Because we have
found a secret tunnel

402
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:45,202
in the catacombs
that no one else
knows about.

403
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,738
Look.

404
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,941
No. I know that place.
We would have found
it if it was there.

405
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,443
No, you wouldn't have.
Yes, we would.

406
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,346
No, you wouldn't have,
because it was designed,

407
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:58,015
years and years ago,
to be invisible.

408
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,751
Unless you knew
it was there, you would
never find it.

409
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,254
Why would that be?

410
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:07,958
Because I believe it's
filled with treasure.

411
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,126
You know what I mean?

412
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:11,329
Treasure,
yeah, I know what you mean.
(Laughing)

413
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,999
It's a joke.
I mean, is she serious?

414
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,502
I'm 100% serious.

415
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,705
If it's true,

416
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:23,808
me and my friends,
can we take half
of the treasure?

417
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,843
You can have all
of the treasure.

418
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,144
It's not what
I'm looking for.

419
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,779
Half is fine.

420
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,181
Okay.

421
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,950
So you'll take us?

422
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,485
Yes, I said okay.

423
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,786
Try this.

424
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:39,156
No, I'm sorry,
I'm not going.

425
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:40,524
No, he's coming.
He's coming.

426
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,792
I'm not coming.

427
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,061
George, come on, please.
I need your help.

428
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,629
You can text me
whatever you find

429
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,064
down there.
I'm gonna be around...

430
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,899
No. You can't.

431
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,836
No cell phones down there.
The ground is too dense.

432
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,137
(Man cheering)
We are so close.

433
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,472
I know.

434
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,073
You know there's
something there.

435
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:59,377
Guys, meet my team.
This is zed, our climber.

436
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:03,214
And this is souxie,
the banshee.
Hi. <i> Ça va?</i>

437
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,052
Souxie, the banshee.
(Papillon arguing in French)

438
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,391
Okay.
Okay.

439
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,693
Then we go near
<i>LA plage.</i>
Okay.

440
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,161
And then
it's a bit tricky.

441
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,829
Papillon:
There's water to here.

442
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,365
And we're prepared
for that? We have
enough equipment?

443
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,666
Yeah, we got
everything.

444
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,735
Benji: Zed, right?
How do you know
papillon?

445
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,107
Oh, I grew up with him.
He's my friend, you know.

446
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,677
Do you know how
he got the scar
on his hand?

447
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,515
Don't talk about
that to him.

448
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:43,120
Souxie, what are the dangers
that we're facing
when we go down there?

449
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,958
If you run out
of batteries,
with no flashlight,

450
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,527
you will die.

451
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:53,631
If you run out of water,
if you get hurt.

452
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:57,368
Zed: And there are
also dangers like
police and bats,

453
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,704
rats, claustrophobia,
drowning, bugs.

454
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,039
Yeah.

455
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,542
De niro?
You want to see de niro?
Yes, yes.

456
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,177
Papillon: Don't do it.

457
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,245
Souxie: No. He's bad.

458
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,614
Let me do de niro.

459
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,552
Fuck, man. Fuck.

460
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:17,788
Just like that!
(Laughing)

461
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,624
(Beat playing)

462
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,626
(Imitating beat)

463
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,497
You're up.

464
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,765
Zed: (Singing)
<i>Hey, yo, hey, yo...</i>

465
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,733
Listen to that.

466
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,735
No. And it's over.
Do it like that.

467
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,337
Three seconds.
You suck.
(All laughing)

468
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:38,242
Guys, when we leave
the van, we need to
be quick, okay?

469
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:42,079
Because if the police
catch us with all that
stuff, we're fucked.

470
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,747
Okay?
Benji: Okay.

471
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,251
George: I'll walk
you guys down there
but then I'm out.

472
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:49,353
Papillon: Quick, quick.
Souxie: Go, go, go.

473
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,532
Papillon: Okay, souxie.

474
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,767
Okay, make it quick,
make it quick.
Okay?

475
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,577
Papillon: Okay, wait.

476
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,780
Papillon: Zed?
Yeah.

477
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,855
(Souxie speaking French)
Benji: Can we keep going?

478
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,958
Zed: Congratulations.
Okay.

479
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,196
Okay. Now, we should
put our headlamps on.

480
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,137
Let's go.

481
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,305
Okay?

482
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:42,506
Can you check
if mine is on?

483
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:43,974
Where's yours?

484
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,710
George:
I'm not coming with you guys.
I told you a bunch of times.

485
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,811
Papillon: Okay.

486
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,481
I'm leaving you
guys in a second.

487
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:52,550
Scarlett:
Just give it a minute.

488
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,985
Papillon: Here we are.

489
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,353
This is it.
Where?

490
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,322
There?
There.

491
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:00,257
George: That's
the hole that
you're going into?

492
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,425
Papillon: Yeah.
That's it?

493
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,227
Souxie:
It's not a joke.

494
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,063
Okay.

495
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,164
George: Wow.

496
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:09,166
Let's do it.

497
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:11,435
Benji: All right. Look,
before we go down there,

498
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:15,606
I have installed pin-cams
on some of your headlamps.
Hold on.

499
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,075
Camera b, good, check.

500
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,444
All right.

501
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,616
All right, camera c, check.

502
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:26,684
Let's go.

503
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,953
What's this?
Good luck.

504
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:32,389
Scarlett, I'm not...
I shouldn't have
even come this far.

505
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,125
Please, I need you
with me.
I'm not. I'm sorry.

506
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,293
Souxie: Okay?

507
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,030
Are you sure you're
not gonna regret this?
Good luck.

508
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,732
Okay.

509
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,101
Listen, I don't know
what you do

510
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,136
but you make up
your mind now. Okay?

511
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,371
He's coming,
he's coming.

512
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,439
I'm not going.

513
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:54,311
(Policeman ordering
in French)

514
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,047
Scarlett:
George! Come on!

515
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,049
George!

516
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,584
Zed: Watch your head,
watch your head!

517
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,721
Scarlett: Quickly!
Fucking Christ!
Are you out of your mind?

518
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,123
(Frantic chattering)

519
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,063
Papillon:
Smoke bomb, look out!
Go! Go! Go!

520
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,732
Watch out!

521
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,333
Go back! Go, go, go!

522
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,405
(Smoke bomb detonating)
Quiet!

523
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,808
Papillon: You okay?

524
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,644
(All coughing)

525
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,583
Let us make sure
it's clear, okay?
Zed, souxie.

526
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:33,651
George.

527
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,819
You stay! You stay!

528
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,188
Benji: George.
What?

529
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,858
I have a headlamp
for you. Come here.

530
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,259
Okay.

531
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,627
Scarlett: Let me just...

532
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,262
Scarlett, I got it!
I got it!

533
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,432
I gotta turn it on.
Hold on.

534
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:51,869
All right.
Camera d, good, check.

535
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,938
Thank you.
You really don't
like caves, do you?

536
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,473
Is this working?
Yeah.

537
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,609
Okay. Thank you, Benji.

538
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,445
What did I say?

539
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,947
His little brother
drowned in a cave
when they were young.

540
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:04,982
Shit.

541
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,483
You didn't know.
It's fine.

542
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:07,618
All right.

543
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,321
Scarlett: George,

544
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,724
are you all right?

545
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,225
(Breathes heavily)
I will be.

546
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,727
Yeah.

547
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,298
You never returned
my calls after Turkey.

548
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
I know.

549
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:26,737
I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry

550
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,806
for leaving you there.

551
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,240
I know.

552
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,644
Hey.
What?

553
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,314
I'm really glad
that you're here.

554
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,517
I don't care. I'm not
here for you, Scarlett.

555
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,820
I agreed to be your
translator, that's it.

556
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,656
I know.
I didn't wanna
come down here.

557
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,327
But here I am.
I'm sorry.

558
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,495
George!

559
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:54,031
Papillon: The police
will never catch papillon.

560
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,399
Okay, let's go.

561
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,436
George.

562
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:00,738
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

563
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,243
That's me,
the classic "pap."

564
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,279
Nice.

565
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,754
We go through here.

566
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,057
Follow me, Benji.

567
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,258
Benji: Right.

568
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,362
Benji: Okay?

569
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,365
I probably should
have worn boots.

570
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,700
Papillon: I offered
you some.

571
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:31,368
Fuck.

572
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,370
It gets higher up here.
You'll be fine.

573
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:34,438
Okay.

574
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,642
How deep do
you think we are?

575
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,144
Souxie: It's okay?

576
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,146
Scarlett: Right.
So where are we?

577
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,717
There.
I make us there.

578
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,720
George?

579
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,822
You good?

580
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,824
(Clears throat)

581
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,893
You got something
for your camera
to go in water?

582
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,494
Benji: Yeah. I'm all set.
Yeah, he's got
a splash bag.

583
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:58,562
Okay.

584
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,300
It's going to
get deeper.

585
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,074
Rue bezout.

586
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,411
And there's a really
cool room in the other
side, but...

587
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:17,114
Scarlett: But you have to
swim through it.
We're not going to go.

588
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,582
Not this time.

589
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,584
Maybe another time.

590
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,587
Okay. This is the end.

591
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,590
Benji: You good?

592
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,492
This place is crazy.

593
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,363
That's hot candles.
There's people in here.

594
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,604
Come on.

595
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,672
(Chanting)

596
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,552
There is always
some weird peoples
down here.

597
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,387
Benji: You're not kidding.

598
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,695
Shit!

599
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,967
Papillon: Okay.

600
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,835
We go through here.

601
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,303
Really?

602
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,707
And I suggest
you pull your
hands up like this

603
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,309
so these bones
don't cut.

604
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,179
Benji: No, no. We're not
going through there.

605
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,647
Yes, it's the only way.

606
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:27,251
Fuck that, man.
I'm not climbing
over bones.

607
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,919
George: That's a great
tour guide you got.

608
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,687
What did you say?

609
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:35,058
If you need a tour guide,
you get a tour guide who say,

610
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,593
"look over here,
look over there"

611
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,195
and everything.
But that's not me.

612
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,430
If you want to find
your hidden treasure,
that's the way.

613
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,700
Wait. Papillon, look.
That isn't actually
the right way.

614
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,936
This one here.
This is a much
more direct route.

615
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:48,505
Sometimes the wrong
direction is better.
No.

616
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,674
Nobody uses
this corridor.
Why not?

617
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,776
It's a bad place.

618
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:56,280
What do you mean,
it's a bad place?
Is it dangerous or...

619
00:31:56,282 --> 00:32:00,717
Bad like, people
who go in this tunnel
don't come out.

620
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,921
We're talking about
some kind of urban
legend or something.

621
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,889
This could save us
hours upon hours.

622
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,292
You think because
you see something
in a book, you know it?

623
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,027
Just look at
the map, here.

624
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,296
Okay, this?
This is not
the catacombs.

625
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,598
This will not
tell you anything.

626
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,134
Tell me, which ones
are filled with water?

627
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,304
Which ones have collapsed?
Which ones are evil?

628
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:22,806
You don't need
to be yelling.
You don't know!

629
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,474
We had a friend
named LA taupe.

630
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,610
In English, <i> "LA taupe"</i>
<i>c'est</i> "the mole."

631
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,580
He lived down here
for years.

632
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,917
He knew every
corridor of every system,
except this one.

633
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,421
He knew there was
something horrible
down there.

634
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:40,390
But eventually,
he had to see
what it was.

635
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,826
He went inside
and nobody has
seen him since.

636
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,162
So if you want
to take this way,

637
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,097
go ahead.
Not with me.

638
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:48,832
Or me.

639
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,735
It's the best way.

640
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,906
These people have
been here before.

641
00:32:55,908 --> 00:32:57,307
We haven't.

642
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:02,412
If that rock is down here,
then it's been down
here for 600 years.

643
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,748
I think it can wait
a couple more hours.

644
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,917
Benji:
These are human bones!

645
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,285
I know.

646
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,987
Benji, nobody
wants to do this.
And you're cool with this?

647
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,288
I'm sorry,
Benji, I really am.

648
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,522
Let's go. Let's just go.

649
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,959
Okay, look at zed.

650
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:19,963
And use, like him,
all your legs and arms

651
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,264
because there
is rats under...

652
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,633
Benji: Are you fucking
serious, man?
No, no, no...

653
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,569
First bones, now rats?

654
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,305
(Zed shouting)

655
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,340
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

656
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,744
(Laughing)
I'm just fucking kidding!

657
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,180
Benji: That's fucked up,
man! Asshole.

658
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,615
Benji: I'm right behind you.

659
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,883
Scarlett: It's actually
not too bad.

660
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,518
Benji: Let's do this.

661
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,388
Scarlett: Give me that.
Mind your feet.

662
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,658
Scarlett:
Just keep it slow
and steady, yeah?

663
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,260
Watch your head.

664
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,763
Fuck!

665
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:01,705
(Panting)

666
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,377
Scarlett: Are you all right?

667
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,115
No, no.
I think I'm stuck.

668
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,217
I can't see you.

669
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,054
George: Benji!
Piece of shit bag.

670
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,555
You okay, buddy?

671
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,057
Okay. Fuck.

672
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,892
Just move
your shoulder down.
No, no, no.

673
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,160
I'm stuck.

674
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:25,996
Just move back, Benji.
I'm stuck. Fuck!

675
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,531
Just calm down.
It's okay.

676
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,599
No, no.
I can't breathe.

677
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,034
No, it's okay.
Benji, you can.

678
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:34,237
Look, you should go.
Just keep going, please!

679
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,239
Fuck. Fuck!

680
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,375
You have to move back!
No, just go, God damn it!

681
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,576
Move back a bit, please.

682
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,844
God! Why are
they singing?

683
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:42,512
Why are they
singing this fucking song?

684
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,247
Just tell them to
shut the fuck up!

685
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,084
You're gonna
have to calm down,
okay, Benji?

686
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,185
Fuck! Fuck!

687
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:50,053
Benji, just calm down,
okay?

688
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,923
Just breathe
with me, please.
It's okay.

689
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,292
Scarlett,
you gotta get
out of the way.

690
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:58,095
Just get out of the way.
Just get out of
the fucking way!

691
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:00,363
You are gonna
have to move back
a tiny bit, please.

692
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,866
I can't move back.
Just go forward!

693
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,701
Just a tiny bit.
Go forward!

694
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,104
You have to
flatten out the bones.
Benji, calm down.

695
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,405
Fuck! Shit!

696
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:11,475
I think something bit me.
Something bit me! Fuck!

697
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,443
Benji, just breathe!

698
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,078
Benji,
just listen to my voice.

699
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,746
Okay. Okay. Okay.

700
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,416
Just breathe, please.
You need to calm down.

701
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,052
You are
hyperventilating,
okay?

702
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:24,054
You will be all right.
We just need to
take it slowly.

703
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:25,422
(Distant chanting)

704
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:29,159
Now, breathe with me.
Just breathe with me, okay?

705
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:33,063
Fuck! Fuck!
(Groans)

706
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:35,632
Just line up the bones.

707
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,268
You will be all right.
Just keep coming.

708
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,238
Just move them
out of the way.
Good, good, good.

709
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,940
Well done. Keep coming.
And now move forward.

710
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:47,244
Just inch yourself forward.
Well done.

711
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,746
There we go,
keep coming.
Shit!

712
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,181
Keep going.

713
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,016
Shit!

714
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,117
George: What was that?

715
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,153
Fuck. I think
it's gonna collapse!

716
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:57,254
Go!

717
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,321
(Tunnel rumbling)

718
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,625
Grab the fucking camera!
Grab it!

719
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,360
Just grab the fucking camera!

720
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:06,196
Hurry! Keep coming!
Quickly!

721
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,065
Fuck!

722
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,336
(Frantic chattering)

723
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,208
Scarlett: Benji!

724
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,743
Souxie: Is he okay?

725
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,279
Benji: Fuck!

726
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,081
(Scarlett coughing)

727
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,285
Fuck.

728
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,123
It's collapsed.

729
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,425
That was so
fucking close.

730
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,297
Oh, my God.

731
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,898
Wait.

732
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,966
Fuck.

733
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,837
Scarlett: Wait.
Tell me we didn't just
go in a circle.

734
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:48,972
This isn't here.

735
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,807
This is the same
tunnel, no?

736
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,677
Papillon:
This isn't here.
Believe me. No, no, no.

737
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,912
Look, I thought
you said you knew
where we were going!

738
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,581
Wait. Listen to me.

739
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,252
Hey, hey, hey,
Benji! Stop it!

740
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:05,522
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
Benji, I'm sorry!

741
00:37:05,524 --> 00:37:09,259
Calm down!
But listen to me.
This doesn't go here.

742
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,760
Okay, calm down.
This is the tunnel.

743
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,830
There is no turns.
There is no turns.

744
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,566
This is straight.

745
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:18,668
I don't understand.

746
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,937
Benji: What the hell
do we do now, huh?

747
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,380
This is all right.
Okay.

748
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,182
Papillon:
We shouldn't
go this way.

749
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:33,216
Zed: Let's go,
grab your shit.

750
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,451
Papillon:
We shouldn't go in there!

751
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:35,952
George:
There's no other option.

752
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:39,556
Are you all right,
Benji? Let me help.
Let me help.

753
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:40,757
Benji: Okay.

754
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,130
Souxie: Okay.

755
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,106
What the hell
is this?

756
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,210
Great. Very funny.
So you have never
been here before.

757
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:01,578
No.

758
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,046
(Souxie speaking French)

759
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:04,414
I've never
been here, okay?

760
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,582
What the hell
is this, then?

761
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,984
People just tag
your name on the wall?

762
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,819
I swear I've never
been here.

763
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,054
I didn't do this,
okay?

764
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,222
Who did it, then?

765
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,658
I don't know.
I don't know.
For goodness' sake.

766
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,993
You better not be
fucking with us.

767
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,029
(Phone ringing)

768
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,668
George:
Did you hear that?

769
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,736
Is that a phone?

770
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,271
Are there phones down here?

771
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:31,574
The phone company used to
run lines through here,
but they...

772
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:32,642
Run lines through here?

773
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,144
Yeah.

774
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,345
They must have left some.

775
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:36,680
No.

776
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:39,683
Fifty years ago,
they took everything.

777
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:41,151
(Phone ringing)

778
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,755
Go.
This is wrong.

779
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,028
Scarlett! Scarlett!

780
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:56,299
Barrière d'enfer.
This is the spot
I was talking about.

781
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,335
This is where the buildings
collapsed into the ground.

782
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,270
Hundreds of people

783
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:03,073
fell to their
death right here.

784
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,008
Yes.

785
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,978
And when they sent
people to fix it,

786
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,247
50 more disappeared.

787
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:21,191
How the hell did they
get a piano down here?

788
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:24,260
Benji: Maybe it
fell when one of
the houses collapsed.

789
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,897
You gotta
be kidding.

790
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,870
When I was a kid,
we had a piano that
looked exactly like this.

791
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,338
Really?

792
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,174
Danny and I used to
play it all the time.
We only knew one song.

793
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,909
<i>My Bonnie lies
over the ocean.</i>

794
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,847
You remember that song?

795
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:47,751
We could never finish it
because the a4 key
was fucked up.

796
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,488
George...

797
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,056
This is a trip.

798
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,959
(Notes playing)

799
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,065
(No sound)

800
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,404
(Continues to make
no sound)

801
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:10,140
What's going on?

802
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,009
I told you.

803
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,077
We shouldn't be here.

804
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,512
We should
keep going.
Guys, no.

805
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,180
We should keep moving.

806
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,785
(Phone ringing)

807
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,394
Fuck that. I'm going.

808
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:32,595
Benji: Scarlett!

809
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,033
Scarlett!

810
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,971
(Phone continues ringing)

811
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:43,840
It's coming from
down here.

812
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,276
Papillon: Wait, wait!

813
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:47,544
Scarlett!

814
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:48,778
Benji: Hold up,
Scarlett!

815
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,289
(Ringing gets louder)

816
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,690
Papillon: Scarlett!

817
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:02,492
Wait.

818
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,332
(Ringing continues)

819
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:25,949
Man: <i> Why won't you</i>
<i>talk to me, Scarlett?</i>

820
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,116
George: Scarlett, hang up.

821
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,184
Who is this?

822
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,652
George: Hang up the phone,
Scarlett.

823
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,455
<i>Tell me.
Why won't you talk to me?</i>

824
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,324
Who is this?

825
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,928
(Man groaning)

826
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,301
Scarlett...
Man: You shouldn't
be here.

827
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,337
(All gasping)

828
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,274
Scarlett: Who is that?

829
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:52,675
Souxie:
LA taupe, <i> c'est toi?</i>

830
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,280
You shouldn't
be here, souxie.

831
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:58,314
LA taupe?

832
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,717
None of you
should be here.

833
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,685
LA taupe.
(Speaking French)

834
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,786
Scarlett:
That's LA taupe?

835
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,255
I thought you were dead.

836
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,959
You never even
came to look for me.

837
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,394
Never.

838
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,196
LA taupe...

839
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,398
Never.

840
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,933
LA taupe.

841
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,968
You're okay?

842
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,671
Come.

843
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:22,872
Where? Wait.

844
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,341
He doesn't know
where we're going.

845
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,877
You are looking
to get out.

846
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,546
Scarlett: Yes. Yes.

847
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,981
Come.

848
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,752
Benji, wait for them.

849
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:37,487
Let him go first.
Benji: How did he get
up there so fast?

850
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,521
George: Zed?
Yeah.

851
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:39,722
Is that the guy
that you were saying...

852
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,025
Disappeared
two years ago? Yes.

853
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:44,661
(Rumbling and cracking)
George: Jesus, Jesus.

854
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:47,263
Okay.
George: Is that bad?
Is that bad?

855
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,364
It looks bad.

856
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,900
We shouldn't stay
very long.

857
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,235
That is bad.

858
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,671
Quickly, guys.
Wait. Where did he go?

859
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:55,738
Come on.

860
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,173
Are you okay?

861
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,241
Go, just go!

862
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,076
Let's go! Let's go!

863
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,210
Papillon:
LA taupe! Wait!

864
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:02,645
LA taupe?

865
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,282
Papillon:
Everybody's here?

866
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,654
Careful.

867
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,262
(Panting)

868
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,433
Where is he?

869
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,369
Here.
Okay.

870
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,805
How can he
see down here?

871
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,944
The only way out
is down.

872
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:37,847
Benji: What?

873
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,455
Scarlett: Careful, Benji.

874
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,657
Careful.

875
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,306
Silent, silent.

876
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,211
(Rock hits bottom)

877
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,813
It looks deep.

878
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,517
This is a bad idea.

879
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:17,079
Scarlett: This space that
we're looking for,
the hidden chamber...

880
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,624
Didn't you notice
that it was perfectly
wedged

881
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:26,329
between the east system
and the South system
of the catacombs?

882
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,530
George: So it's got
to connect them.

883
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:32,435
If we find the chamber,
then that's the way out.
We'll find a way out.

884
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,469
Souxie:
Are you sure?

885
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,438
I think. I'm sure.

886
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,939
George:
What if there's
no chamber?

887
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,709
There is.
It's down there.

888
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,445
Okay.

889
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:45,314
Scarlett: George,
it's another 20 meters.

890
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,382
Are you at the bottom?

891
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,184
Yeah.

892
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,853
Okay. I'll be down
in a second.

893
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,890
Benji? You good?

894
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:55,291
Scarlett:
Benji, you can start now.

895
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,592
All right, good.

896
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,698
George: Fucking harness.

897
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,199
You okay, Benji, up there?

898
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,300
Okay.

899
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,202
Come on, George,
keep coming.

900
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:09,138
Hold on. I'm stuck. Shit!

901
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,907
Benji, watch out!
(Benji screaming)

902
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:14,711
(Benji screaming)
Fuck! Shit!

903
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,212
Fuck! My hands!

904
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,147
Benji, what happened?
I don't know!

905
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:19,916
Benji,
are you okay?
My hands.

906
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:22,485
No. Oh, my God.
The clip broke.

907
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,053
What? How?

908
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,755
I don't know!

909
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,727
I got you. I got you.

910
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:34,197
Fresh bandages in
one of the packs.

911
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,765
Just let me know
if you want me
to change them.

912
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:36,933
All right, let's go.

913
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,101
George: Guys?

914
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,370
Yeah. We're going,
we're good.

915
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,573
All good?
Sort of.

916
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,975
His hands are
still bleeding.

917
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,045
So I bandaged them up.

918
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:50,947
Is he getting any...

919
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,084
(Muffled)
Are you all right?

920
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,653
George?

921
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,256
Scarlett!

922
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,924
What?

923
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,631
(Muffled banging)

924
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,935
(Inaudible)

925
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,208
I can't hear...

926
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,610
(Loud rumbling)

927
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,452
(Alarm blaring)

928
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,888
(All exclaiming)

929
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,295
(Screeching)

930
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,299
Scarlett: (Exclaiming)
You all right?

931
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,735
Everyone?
Yeah!

932
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:47,136
You okay?

933
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,406
Zed: Are you okay?
What was that?

934
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,242
LA taupe: The question is
not what was that,

935
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:54,744
but who was that.

936
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:56,646
What the fuck
does he mean by that?

937
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:57,914
What did he say?

938
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:01,217
Papillon, how long
have you known
this guy?

939
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,086
He's different now.

940
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,222
Should we be
following him?

941
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,524
I don't know.

942
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:09,759
There seems to
be a right turn.

943
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:10,927
Souxie:
There is a door!

944
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,361
Come here,
come here.
A door!

945
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:13,496
Benji.

946
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,131
George: Thank God!

947
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,365
Scarlett:
Watch your head, Benji.

948
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:17,567
Come on.

949
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,804
Shit! It's a dead end!

950
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:23,706
You said this
is the way.

951
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,508
I thought it was
the way, too.

952
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,609
Yeah?

953
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:30,179
(Papillon yelling
in French)

954
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,380
(Speaking French)

955
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,984
Scarlett: Hey.
Everyone calm down!

956
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:36,686
George: Calm down.

957
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:38,621
We can't go back.

958
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:40,356
Scarlett.
Yeah. What?

959
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,557
Come here.

960
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,426
Oh, my God!

961
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,464
"Winged vulture
leads your way..."

962
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:49,999
"With brightest
light in darkest day."

963
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:53,135
Leads your way.
So this is...

964
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:54,537
Leads your way.

965
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,373
Watch out. Watch out.

966
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,810
There's something here!
What?

967
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:03,713
Is that a scarab?
Is that a scarab?

968
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,515
Scarab.

969
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,718
Egyptians, pyramids.

970
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,152
Pharaohs. Pharaohs.

971
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:11,520
Pharaohs. Pharaohs.

972
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:15,424
Didn't pharaohs
have a strange way
of hiding the tombs?

973
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:18,261
Yes! Yes!
A ptolemaic hinge!

974
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,696
I have never seen...
Could this be...

975
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:22,164
One second,
can you just explain?

976
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,866
What are you talking about?
What's a ptolemaic?

977
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:26,936
Ptolemaic hinge.
Basically, they form
a kind of riddle.

978
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:30,706
It's a sort of
ancient Egyptian padlock.

979
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,608
So you have to
take the exact
right stone

980
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,443
from the exact
right place, or...

981
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:36,078
Or what?

982
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,347
Or what?

983
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,385
Or the ceiling
will collapse on you
and kill you.

984
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,186
Papillon: What?
Are you kidding?

985
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:45,788
Benji: You have
to be shitting me!

986
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:46,856
It's fine. It's okay.

987
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:48,057
"Underneath heaven's reign."

988
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:51,460
What does it say on the tomb?
Underneath heaven's reign.

989
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:52,862
Underneath heaven's reign.

990
00:48:52,864 --> 00:48:56,032
Celestial spheres.
The celestial spheres!
Eight planets, right?

991
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,867
Wait, wait, wait.

992
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,936
But the last two
weren't discovered yet.

993
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,637
Okay, so 6 planets.
6 planets.

994
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:03,706
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Wait, wait, wait.

995
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,308
Scarlett. Scarlett!
Yes. What?

996
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,575
Don't touch anything.

997
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:09,045
Was this built before
or after copernicus?

998
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:12,048
So, they still believed
everything revolved
around the earth.

999
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,549
Which means the earth
didn't count as a planet.

1000
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:14,951
Right. But the moon did.

1001
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:17,653
And so did the sun.
So, 7 planets, right?

1002
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,488
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1003
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,556
Be sure.
7.

1004
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,591
That's my count.
7.

1005
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,460
Stand way the fuck back.

1006
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,895
Watch out!
It's moving!

1007
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,330
Shit! Okay.

1008
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,799
(Straining)

1009
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,634
Be careful!

1010
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,536
It's fucking heavy!

1011
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,871
Okay, it's moving!

1012
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,141
Watch out!
Okay. Okay!

1013
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,845
Benji: Careful!
Scarlett: Shit!

1014
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,313
(Rumbling)

1015
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,715
Oh, my God!

1016
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:50,920
Benji: Shit!
You okay?

1017
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:52,421
Benji: What is that?
What is that?

1018
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,424
Oh, my God!

1019
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,095
George, this is
the first time someone

1020
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:00,963
has shined
a light in this tunnel

1021
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:03,032
for over 500 years.

1022
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:05,201
It's the fucking way out.

1023
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:07,169
Papillon: The treasure.
The treasure!

1024
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,304
Someone give
me a boost.

1025
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,472
Be careful.

1026
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:11,474
Scarlett, please
be careful!

1027
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,142
It's fine.
Careful.

1028
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:15,111
Yeah. I'm good.

1029
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:16,178
Scarlett?
Yeah.

1030
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,279
What do you see?

1031
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,714
Oh, my God!

1032
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,683
Oh, my God!
What?

1033
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,419
George, you have
to see this!
Oh, my God!

1034
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,092
Benji: Wow.

1035
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,898
George: What is this place?

1036
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,900
He's dead.

1037
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,402
Yeah.

1038
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:42,304
He's dead,
but how is he not rotting?

1039
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:44,140
I have no idea.
George, look at this.

1040
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,042
What is that?
"Vitriol."

1041
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,178
Why vitriol?

1042
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,479
It's the motto
of alchemy.

1043
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,580
Vitriol?

1044
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:56,285
(Scarlett reading)

1045
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,821
Visit the interior
parts of the earth,

1046
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:01,390
by rectification
thou shalt find
the hidden stone.

1047
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,259
The hidden stone.
Fuck!

1048
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:04,393
Papillon:
Is he dead?

1049
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,529
George: Yeah.
For 700 years.

1050
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:07,596
Scarlett: Oh, my God!

1051
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,065
It's creepy.

1052
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,735
Wait. Visit the interior
parts of the earth.

1053
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,272
He's telling us
to go deeper.

1054
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,240
I think it means
we're here.
No.

1055
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,076
This has got to be
the interior
parts of the earth.

1056
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:21,710
No, there has
got to be more.

1057
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,379
"Winged vulture
leads your way,

1058
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:25,081
"with brightest
light in darkest day."

1059
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,916
Brightest light
in darkest day.

1060
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,519
Everyone turn
off your headlamps.

1061
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,121
Benji: Nah, fuck that.

1062
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:34,290
Benji, it will be okay.
There is a dead
man right there.

1063
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:35,758
It will be okay.

1064
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,194
Everyone.

1065
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,328
George: Okay.

1066
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,863
Scarlett?

1067
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:41,964
Holy shit.

1068
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:43,532
Look!
Benji: Yeah.

1069
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:46,302
Where's this light
coming from
if that's a wall?

1070
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:49,472
Benji, turn your
camera light on.
Please.

1071
00:51:49,474 --> 00:51:51,207
Scarlett, what
are you doing?

1072
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:56,078
I reckon we can
get through there.

1073
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,747
Scarlett, what
are you doing?

1074
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,049
There's a loose stone.

1075
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,553
Okay.

1076
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,057
George:
Can you see
anything down there?

1077
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,799
George: What is it?
Zed: Is something
in there?

1078
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,900
I'm going.

1079
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,702
What? Scarlett, no!

1080
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,306
George: Scarlett!

1081
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,083
(Panting)

1082
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:35,651
Oh, my God.

1083
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,764
Shit!

1084
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,834
Get out of the way.
You're going?

1085
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:52,902
Yeah.

1086
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:56,839
Zed.
What?

1087
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,174
Give me my bag.

1088
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,021
George:
Wow. Is this it?

1089
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,524
It's real.

1090
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,562
It's real.

1091
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,642
Holy shit!

1092
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:38,280
(Laughing
ecstatically)

1093
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,953
Benji: Scarlett.

1094
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,489
Benji.

1095
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,559
Let's not celebrate
until we're out of here.

1096
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,861
Scarlett, how are
these torches still lit?

1097
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:55,831
The philosopher's
stone can fuel a lamp
for eternity.

1098
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,734
Where is it?
Where's the stone?

1099
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,938
"Brightest light
in darkest day."
Think about it.

1100
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,408
Brightest light.

1101
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,743
Yeah.

1102
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,111
The sun.

1103
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:12,781
In ancient Egypt,
they said that
the earth God

1104
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:16,452
and the sky goddess
were madly in love.

1105
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:19,121
But when they had
their first child,
the sun,

1106
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:22,524
he became so jealous
of their affections
that he pushed them apart

1107
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:25,227
so that they were
only able to touch

1108
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,896
by the palms
of their hands

1109
00:54:27,898 --> 00:54:30,065
and the soles
of their feet.

1110
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:33,469
Every morning,
the sky goddess
gave birth

1111
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,304
to the sun,

1112
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,306
and every evening

1113
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,142
she would swallow him
back up.

1114
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,644
That's it!

1115
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,313
Oh, my God.
It looks so ordinary.

1116
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,164
What better place to hide
the most valuable
stone ever known

1117
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,800
than next to riches
you could never miss?

1118
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,736
Wait. It's a trap.
Stop! It's a trap!

1119
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,673
Stop! It's a trap! Wait!

1120
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:11,740
(Yelling)

1121
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,076
(Loud rumbling)

1122
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,123
Scarlett:
Is everyone okay?

1123
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,825
George: Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.

1124
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,060
Papillon: I am, yes.

1125
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:32,928
Benji?

1126
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,930
(All coughing)

1127
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:35,964
Benji: Scarlett?

1128
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,066
I'm good!

1129
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,268
Scarlett: Zed?

1130
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,172
Let me see.
(Coughing)

1131
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:44,606
Souxie?

1132
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,175
Souxie?
Souxie?

1133
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:47,943
George: Souxie?

1134
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,011
Souxie?

1135
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,112
Souxie!

1136
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:51,180
Get those rocks! Get her!

1137
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,683
Shit!

1138
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:56,852
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

1139
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,687
Are you okay?
Okay, get her.

1140
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,624
Sit. Are you hurt?

1141
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,028
LA taupe?
Where's LA taupe?

1142
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,063
LA taupe!
LA taupe!

1143
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,266
LA taupe!
LA taupe!

1144
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:13,469
Help me dig!

1145
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:14,703
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1146
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,071
George:
He can't breathe!

1147
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,173
Don't disturb the rocks!

1148
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,376
George, they might
collapse on us!

1149
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,478
George: Fuck!

1150
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,314
We can't move the rocks.
We can't.

1151
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,817
There's no use.
There's no use.

1152
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,085
George: No use,
papillon?

1153
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,221
No!

1154
00:56:32,223 --> 00:56:34,189
I need the first-aid kit.
I have to clean it.

1155
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,491
No, don't touch it!

1156
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:36,825
Papillon: The packs
are buried.

1157
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:38,494
Benji: What do you mean
they're buried?
They're buried!

1158
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:40,028
Benji: Do we
have anything?
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1159
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,631
George: Where's our water?
Our food?

1160
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,869
Do we have any batteries?
For the lights?

1161
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,904
Yeah, we should start
conserving the lights.

1162
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:50,572
Shit!
What do I do?

1163
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,074
Just keep it up,
so that it stops
bleeding.

1164
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,142
Okay.

1165
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,415
Okay.
It's all right.
It's okay.

1166
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,150
This might sting.

1167
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,321
Just a sting.

1168
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,190
(Groaning)

1169
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,429
It's okay. It's okay.
(Speaking French)

1170
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,043
Benji: Holy shit!

1171
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,812
It really worked.

1172
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,215
How did you do that?

1173
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,484
It's the stone.

1174
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,519
You okay?
Yeah.

1175
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:40,956
(Speaking French)

1176
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,026
It will be okay.

1177
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,433
They'd never build
something like this
without a back door,

1178
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:53,769
in case it
collapsed, right?

1179
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,604
Never. There's
gotta be something else.

1180
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:57,406
Look around.
Everybody look around.

1181
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:59,141
Benji: What are we
looking for?
I don't know.

1182
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,646
Is there anything?

1183
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,584
Zed: Some bones.

1184
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,186
What is that?
Is that something?

1185
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:14,256
Yes. Yes. Yes. George!

1186
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:15,757
What is it?

1187
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:23,031
It's the <i> porta alchemica.</i>
This is the door
to the mystical!

1188
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:25,200
Wait. This is a door?
That's a door?

1189
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:27,769
No, not exactly.
It works in
conjunction with this.

1190
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,338
Here.

1191
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:35,277
This is
"as above, so below."

1192
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:38,981
That phrase is believed
to be the key to all magic.

1193
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:40,516
It means that

1194
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,887
what is within me
is outside of me.

1195
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:47,623
As it is on earth,
so it is in heaven.

1196
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,158
As I am,
so are my cells,

1197
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,662
so are my atoms,
so is God.

1198
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:56,331
Basically,

1199
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,034
as I believe
the world to be,
so it is.

1200
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,203
Benji: I'm not following.

1201
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,806
As above, so below.

1202
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:08,210
So if they carved
a door on the ceiling...

1203
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,012
There has got to
be a door on
the floor, too.

1204
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:12,214
Yeah. Someone
hand me a rock.
All right.

1205
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,217
Wait. We are
in the bottom of
the catacombs.

1206
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,052
There's nothing
below us, Scarlett.

1207
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,055
Shit.

1208
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:25,661
If this is the floor
then where is all
that water going?

1209
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,467
There's a way out.

1210
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,781
Souxie:
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

1211
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,252
Guys, there's a passage
down here.

1212
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,387
Come down. It's okay.

1213
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:53,488
Souxie.

1214
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,026
Watch out, Benji.

1215
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,431
Can you read that?
What does it say?

1216
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:13,041
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here."

1217
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,278
Papillon: What?

1218
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,450
According to
mythology,

1219
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:25,153
that's the inscription
over the gates of hell.

1220
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,189
Papillon: What?

1221
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,059
I'm not going in there.

1222
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,695
I thought you didn't
believe in any of this.

1223
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:36,565
I don't.

1224
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,073
"And they shall be made
to crawl on their bellies

1225
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,808
"to enter
the kingdom of darkness."

1226
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,244
Yeah, that occurred
to me, too.

1227
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,412
Yeah.

1228
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,315
Shit.

1229
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,399
Fuck.

1230
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:17,839
It's exactly the same.

1231
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,142
Scarlett:
No. No, it's not.

1232
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:22,611
It's not exactly
the same.

1233
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,581
Everything's
the wrong way around.

1234
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,420
This is upside down.

1235
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,224
Papillon:
Wait. No!

1236
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,359
What?

1237
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,927
No.

1238
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:41,830
Benji: What the fuck?

1239
01:01:41,832 --> 01:01:43,865
What happened to
the entrance?

1240
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,203
Jesus.

1241
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,606
Are we dead?

1242
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,575
No.

1243
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,410
We're not dead.

1244
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,482
We should just
keep moving.

1245
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,651
Okay?

1246
01:02:02,653 --> 01:02:05,287
We have to
find a way out.
Come on.

1247
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,758
Shit. Okay.

1248
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,431
I go.

1249
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,591
(Screeching)

1250
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,526
(Gasping)

1251
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:46,194
Souxie!
Souxie!

1252
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:48,196
Is everybody out?
Yeah.

1253
01:02:48,198 --> 01:02:49,698
I don't have a light.
Do you have a light?

1254
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,032
I can't find
my light, either.

1255
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,437
Do you see that?

1256
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,372
Get the camera.

1257
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:58,774
Be careful. Careful!

1258
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,610
What is that?

1259
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,978
What is that?

1260
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:08,283
Benji: Jesus.

1261
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,286
(Heavy breathing)

1262
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:19,494
Zed: Souxie.

1263
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:21,730
No.

1264
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,873
Souxie.

1265
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:36,945
Souxie: LA taupe?

1266
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:38,013
Papillon: LA taupe!

1267
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,021
Are you okay?

1268
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,593
LA taupe?

1269
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:53,361
George: What the fuck?

1270
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:54,729
(Screaming)
Benji: Shit!

1271
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:56,498
Souxie, stay back!

1272
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,632
Zed: Stay back!

1273
01:03:57,634 --> 01:04:00,168
Scarlett: Careful,
Benji. Careful.

1274
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,604
George: The fuck is wrong
with him?

1275
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,005
Scarlett: What's wrong
with him?

1276
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,608
Hey.

1277
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,378
It's okay.

1278
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,647
It's me.
George: No, no, don't.

1279
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,850
Okay? Hey.
Benji:
Souxie, be careful.

1280
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,118
LA taupe.

1281
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,386
Souxie, don't.

1282
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:19,521
Scarlett: His eyes.

1283
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,056
Hey.

1284
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,657
(Thud)

1285
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:24,693
(All yelling)

1286
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,963
Benji: Souxie!

1287
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:29,364
Souxie, no!

1288
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,000
George: Benji!
Get a light on LA taupe!

1289
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:33,902
Benji! He's over here!

1290
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:35,637
Where is he?
Hold her head.

1291
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,138
Where is he?

1292
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,573
George: Where the fuck
did he go?

1293
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,477
The stone!
Bring her back, please!

1294
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:44,479
It won't work.
Fix her!
It will fix her!

1295
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:46,181
Please try!
Try it! Please!

1296
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:47,415
I'm trying. I'm sorry.

1297
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,317
Fix her. Fix her.

1298
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:56,791
It can't bring
back the dead.
I'm sorry.

1299
01:04:58,494 --> 01:04:59,828
I'm sorry.

1300
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,396
Is she dead?

1301
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,969
Benji: I'm so sorry, man.

1302
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,587
I'm so sorry.

1303
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,356
We have to keep moving.

1304
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:30,792
Okay?

1305
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:34,429
George,
you follow me.
Yeah.

1306
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,632
Benji: Okay.
I'm right behind you.

1307
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:38,934
Scarlett: Okay.

1308
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,037
(Loud creaking)

1309
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,374
Are you okay?

1310
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,442
Yeah.

1311
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,985
Man: <i> Scarlett.</i>
What?

1312
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:00,956
What?

1313
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:15,837
Everything is like
the mirror image of what
we have already done,

1314
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,907
but somehow,
we keep going deeper.

1315
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,376
Benji: How much deeper?

1316
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,379
Another 100 meters.

1317
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,848
Putting us

1318
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,317
1,000 feet down.

1319
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,159
Scarlett:
Did you hear that?

1320
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,829
Man: <i> Scarlett!</i>

1321
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:43,631
Is that Benji?

1322
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,867
No, I don't think so.

1323
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:47,135
Benji?

1324
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:48,269
You okay?

1325
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:49,771
Yeah. Yeah, you?

1326
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:50,805
Good!

1327
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:52,507
All right. Good.

1328
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,376
(Faint baby crying)

1329
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,791
Is somebody there?

1330
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,869
(Unclear whispering)

1331
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:21,936
Hello?

1332
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:25,974
(Screaming)

1333
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,143
George.

1334
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,078
(All screaming)

1335
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,180
Scarlett: Benji! Benji!

1336
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:33,648
George: Benji! Benji.

1337
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,050
Benji! Oh, my God.

1338
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,751
Get him over!
Get him over! Get him over!

1339
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,420
Is he alive?

1340
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:39,988
No, no, no!
Shit!

1341
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,224
Jesus.

1342
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,459
Scarlett:
Oh, my God.

1343
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,732
We should keep moving.

1344
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:51,833
Benji.

1345
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,938
We should keep moving.

1346
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,741
George: Come on.
Papillon: Let's go!

1347
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,709
We need light.
We gotta go.

1348
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:04,112
Come on! Let's go!
Let's go!

1349
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:05,547
(Sobbing)
Scarlett,
we gotta go.

1350
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,816
Oh, my God!

1351
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,519
Let's go.

1352
01:08:11,521 --> 01:08:13,455
Oh, my God!

1353
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:23,264
Danny:
George, help me.

1354
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,278
(Yelling in water)

1355
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,981
Danny?
George, help me.

1356
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,284
Danny! Danny!
Scarlett: George?

1357
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:44,986
Wait. Move the bones!

1358
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:46,588
Move the bones! Danny!

1359

Danny!

1361
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,059
That's my brother
down there!

1362
01:08:51,061 --> 01:08:52,927
Get off the bones!
Get off the bones!

1363
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:54,762
Danny! Danny!

1364
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,464
Move the bones!
Get out of the way!

1365
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,500
I said, get the fuck
out of the way!

1366
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:00,935
Danny! Danny!

1367
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:04,072
Scarlett: It's not real.
George! It's not real!

1368
01:09:04,074 --> 01:09:05,573
George!

1369

George.

1370
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,313
(Both breathing heavily)

1371
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,389
We have to go.

1372
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,000
Scarlett,

1373
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,469
why would he be here?

1374
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:35,537
I don't know.

1375
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,539
What is happening to us?

1376
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,844
(Man yelling)

1377
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:46,915
(Screams echoing)

1378
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,550
Wait.

(Yelling continues)

1380
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,748

1381
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,507
(Fire roaring)

1382
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,827
No. It wasn't my fault.

1383
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:08,963
It wasn't my fault!

1384
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,937
(Shouting in French)

1385

No! No!

1389

We have to go
back to get papillon!

1390
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:50,138
George: No. Absolutely not.
Come on!

1391
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,572
What is that?

1392
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,445
George: What was that?
What did you hear?

1393
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,314
George, let's go back.
Let's go back.

No, zed.

1396

Keep with us.
We can't.

1397

We can't go back.

01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:06,454
We have to keep going.

1399

01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,875
(Loud rattling
and screeching)

1403
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,545
George: What the fuck
was that?

1404
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,119
(All panicked breathing)

1405

the week in Turkey
was the greatest
week of my life.

Zed, put your hand here!
Just keep it down!

Yeah, yeah.
It's okay.

Hold on. Okay?

1436

Not yet. Hold on.
Okay. Okay.

parts of the earth,

"by rectification
thou shalt find
the hidden stone."

1449
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,147
"By rectification
thou shalt find
the hidden stone."

1450
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:01,782
Hidden stone.

1451
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,719
Rectification.

1452
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:08,255
George, the hidden stone.
This isn't the right stone.

1453
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:11,125
I have to rectify
the taking of it.

1454
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,160
Only by putting it back
will I find the real stone.

1455
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,631
Fuck!
(Monster moaning)

1456
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,933
Fuck!

1457
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:20,234
Zed: What?

1458
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:21,302
I'm going back.

1459
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,437
No, you can't!
I have to go back.

1460
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,673
By the time we
get him out of here
he'll be dead!

1461
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:27,308
Please! Wait!

1462
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,643
Stay with him.
I'll be back.

1463
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:30,344
Just keep him safe.
I'm coming back!

1464
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,480
Hold on! Hold on!

1465
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,649
I'm coming back!
Scarlett!

1466
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,385
Scarlett!

1467
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:04,912
(Groaning)

1468
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,120
You can do this.
You can do this.

1469
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:14,555
(Straining)

1470
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,534
(Panting)

1471
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,981
(Gagging underwater)

1472
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,218
(Screams)

1473
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,165
(Sobbing)

1474
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,761
Dad?

1475

(Screams)

1476
01:19:58,393 --> 01:20:01,662
"By rectification
thou shalt find
the hidden stone."

1477
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,334
Okay. I rectified.

1478
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:09,637
Where's the hidden stone?

1479
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:27,688
George. George,
do you hear me? George?

1480
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,595
(Coughing)

1481
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:38,432
Shut up. Come on.
Come on, come on.

1482
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,668
As above

1483
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:42,536
so below.

1484
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:45,439
As I believe
the world to be,
so it is.

1485
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,007
Hold on, George.

1486
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:58,552
Dad.

1487
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:08,195
I'm sorry

1488
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:12,099
that I didn't pick up
the phone that night.

1489
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:17,738
I didn't know you
were in that much pain.

1490
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,891
(Panting and straining)

1491
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:41,996
George?

1492
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:52,773
Zed!

1493
01:21:52,775 --> 01:21:54,275
Where are you?

1494
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:55,643
Scarlett! Here!

1495
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:01,949
Did you
find the stone?
Yes!

1496
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:03,250
Okay.

1497
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:18,832
How did you do that?

1498
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:20,401
(Coughing)

1499
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:21,835
Hi.

1500
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,639
George?
George?

1501
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:28,943
Come here.

1502
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,781
Scarlett, Scarlett.
Go, go.

1503
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:34,848
Give me your hand.

1504
01:22:38,586 --> 01:22:39,687
Scarlett: Zed!

1505
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:43,624
Zed! Zed!

1506
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:48,462
Dead end!

1507
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:49,630
Watch out!

1508
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,465
Zed: Shit, my lamp! Shit!

1509
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:54,735
Scarlett: Hurry!

1510
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:00,274
Zed: We will never be
able to climb down that.

1511
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:01,842
We have to jump.
What?

1512
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:04,945
We have to
rectify ourselves

1513
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:07,147
and jump.
Scarlett, you're crazy.

1514
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,248
We will die.

1515
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,416
No. George, listen.

1516
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:11,251
Why do you keep
seeing your brother
down here?

1517
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:14,021
What is it about his
death that torments you?

1518
01:23:14,023 --> 01:23:16,657
George. George.
It's not
gonna work.

1519
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:18,525
Why is he haunting you?

1520
01:23:18,527 --> 01:23:20,761
When Danny got
his leg pinned

1521
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:23,597
I promised him I'd
be back with help.

1522
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,833
But I got lost along the way.

1523
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:28,669
My brother drowned
waiting for me to save him.

1524
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,072
It's okay.

1525
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:34,975
Zed.

1526
01:23:34,977 --> 01:23:37,644
I have a child
I've never seen.

1527
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:39,780
I know it's mine,
but I deny it.

1528
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,950
It's okay.
Give me your hand.

1529
01:23:42,952 --> 01:23:45,486
Scarlett, it's not
gonna work.
George.

1530
01:23:45,488 --> 01:23:47,821
I can't.
I won't go without you.

1531
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,323
I won't.

1532
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:50,891
Okay.
Okay.

1533
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,328
We go on three.
On three.

1534
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:55,629
One.

1535
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:58,966
Two.

1536
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:03,070
Three.

1537
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:15,883
(Crashing)

1538
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:16,950
(All coughing)

1539
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,597
Fuck!

1540
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,835
Save the light.

1541
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:35,936
Zed: Yeah.

1542
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,339
We are trapped?

1543
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:40,607
Scarlett: No.

1544
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,544
Fuck!

1545
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:46,513
Fuck! No! Fuck!

1546
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,083
Zed! Zed!

1547
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:50,818
We'll die!
(Shushing)

1548
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:52,553
We'll die!

1549
01:24:52,555 --> 01:24:54,521
George: Hey! Down.

1550
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:55,789
Put the light down.

1551
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:57,925
Help me get
the rocks.

1552
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,100
It's a manhole.
Find a grip.
Find a grip.

1553
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:08,202
Can you get your
fingers in the sides?

1554
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,370
Just try! Try!

1555
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:11,872
I'm trying!

1556
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:14,308
I can't.

1557
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:17,644
Scarlett,
what did you just do?

1558
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:19,546
Pushed it down.
Okay. Okay.

1559
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:21,982
Scarlett:
One, two, three.

1560
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,285
Oh, my God.

1561
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:27,087
George:
We're gonna push
it straight down.

1562
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:28,822
Down and
to the side.
Okay.

1563
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:31,625
One, two, three.

1564
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,629
Good, good, good.

1565
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:36,997
Get it over here.

1566
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,481
Holy shit!

1567
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,682
Zed.

1568
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:57,818
Hello?

1569
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,989
We gotta get out.

1570
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:03,557
Get the camera out.

1571
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:27,915
(George gasping)

1572
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:38,125
(Distant moaning)

1573
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:27,941
(Sobbing)

1574
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,777
<i>People say that</i>

1575
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:34,948
I'm some kind of
treasure hunter.
It's not what I'm after.

1576
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:38,385
I'm not doing this
for financial gain.

1577
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:42,456
I'm a student.
Of history,
of alchemy.

1578
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:45,692
It would be

1579
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:49,062
of great historical
value.

1580
01:27:49,064 --> 01:27:51,098
So you simply
want the truth.

1581
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:52,799
Exactly.

1582
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:58,138
Yeah, I want the truth.

1583
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:17,430
LA taupe:
