1
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,270
All of you want chocolate?
I'll see what I can do.

2
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,139
Roberto! Excuse me.

3
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:54,847
Happy Thanksgiving. All the best.
Happy Thanksgiving. God bless you.

4
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,753
Happy Thanksgiving. All the very best.

5
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,823
Bless you.

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,099
Happy Thanksgiving.

7
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,177
Get the police.

8
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,898
Get on the radio.

9
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,905
coming through!

10
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:29,475
BP's 80/40.
He's already had a liter of D5w.

11
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,585
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
Get the priest into c, now.

12
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,780
- who's the perp?
- Benjamin Mears, age 37. New York license.

13
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,393
- Hold him in A.
- A, as in abused by a priest?

14
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,801
It hurt a bit?

15
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,740
well, that's nothing compared to the fires
you'll face on Judgment Day.

16
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,869
Now, let's see what we have here.

17
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,370
Hey, buddy. wake up.

18
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,612
Yeah, that's it.

19
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,912
Now give me one good reason why...

20
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,420
...as a good christian,
I shouldn't let you die right here.

21
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:16,220
Jerusalem's Lot.

22
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,907
<i>No one pronounced Jerusalem's Lot dead</i>
<i>on the morning of February 6th.</i>

23
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,047
<i>No one knew it was.</i>

24
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,645
<i>By and large</i>, <i>the town</i>,
<i>not knowing it was dead...</i>

25
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,753
<i>... would go off to their jobs</i>
<i>with no inkling...</i>

26
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,650
<i>... of what lay ahead.</i>

27
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,688
<i>Looking at Jerusalem's Lot...</i>

28
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,921
<i>... is like peering through</i>
<i>a pane of ice at your childhood.</i>

29
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,330
<i>It's wavy and misty</i>,
<i>but most of it's the same.</i>

30
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,438
<i>McDougall!</i>

31
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:40,736
<i>Lawrence Crockett is the richest man</i>
<i>in Salem's Lot</i>, <i>but the IRS will never know.</i>

32
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,707
<i>Like his neighbors</i>, <i>he relies on</i>
<i>the community to keep his secrets.</i>

33
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,252
<i>The social pact is the foundation</i>
<i>of every small town.</i>

34
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,721
Macy, tell Richard Straker
I'll be 10 minutes late.

35
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:57,056
oh, a Mr. Mears stopped by.

36
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,495
- I told him you'd be out at the trailer park.
- Mears?

37
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,295
Balls. The writer.
You told him I was here?

38
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,428
<i>I'm sorry</i>, <i>Larry. You have to tell me</i>
<i>when you're hiding.</i>

39
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,064
Larry?

40
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,235
Ben Mears. can I interest you
in a mobile home?

41
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,745
Great little place to raise a family.

42
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,716
I'll just take the keys
to the house, thanks.

43
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,178
- Still living in New York city?
- Yeah.

44
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,254
I was, till I sublet my place.

45
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,851
I saw the Marsten house
from the road. It's empty, right?

46
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,396
No, I sold it. I'm sorry.

47
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,623
Finally did. Same people
who bought the Laundromat.

48
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,236
I have an agreement to rent that.
I have the paperwork in my car.

49
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,030
So sue me. I'm sorry.

50
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,936
Look, Eva Prunier runs a clean
boarding house on clift Street.

51
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,474
who would buy that house?

52
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,410
- Two gentlemen, antique dealers.
- And they're aware of its story?

53
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,778
- I suppose. How could they not be?
- But you didn't tell them.

54
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,647
- I don't remember.
- But you remember our agreement.

55
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,587
what do you want me to say, Mr. Mears?
The deal is done.

56
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,763
would you mind moving your car?

57
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,228
<i>Go on</i>, <i>Mears. You wanna be</i>
<i>a Bloody Pirate</i>, <i>don't you?</i>

58
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,634
<i>Come on</i>, <i>Mears.</i>
<i>We've all been inside.</i>

59
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,137
<i>You a wuss or a Pirate?</i>

60
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,507
<i>The town has secrets</i>,
<i>but sees through lies...</i>

61
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,115
<i>... even the ones you tell yourself.</i>

62
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,878
<i>What are you doing coming back</i>
<i>to the place where you lived as a boy?</i>

63
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,285
<i>Trying to recapture something</i>
<i>that was irrevocably lost?</i>

64
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:36,224
<i>What magic do you expect to recapture</i>
<i>by walking roads you once walked?</i>

65
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,126
<i>They're now probably asphalted...</i>

66
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,595
<i>... and straightened...</i>

67
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,892
<i>... and litter-shot with tourist beer cans.</i>

68
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,870
<i>Do you even know?</i>

69
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:55,613
<i>The kids who ride Charlie Rhodes'</i>
<i>school bus are the best-behaved in town.</i>

70
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,151
<i>In the entire school district</i>, <i>for that matter.</i>
<i>Charlie Rhodes is a bitter vet...</i>

71
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,346
<i>... who runs his bus the same way</i>
<i>he ran Kilo Company in Da Nang.</i>

72
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,221
<i>Living proof that time</i>
<i>does not heal all wounds.</i>

73
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,187
You got a lot to talk about?

74
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,498
Take it outside.

75
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,474
<i>Don't romanticize the town</i>
<i>because it's small.</i>

76
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,637
<i>Or because you fished its waters</i>
<i>for pickerel and steelies as a boy.</i>

77
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,477
<i>This town knows darkness.</i>

78
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,347
You can't find them, grind them.

79
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,957
who said that?

80
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,827
champ.

81
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,231
<i>The town knows darkness...</i>

82
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,963
<i>... and the poor kids</i>, <i>like Mark Petrie...</i>

83
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,500
<i>... know more than their village peers</i>
<i>about the darkness of the human soul.</i>

84
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,705
Surprise, surprise.

85
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,008
<i>Salem's Lot is an accumulation</i>
<i>of three parts.</i>

86
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,275
Ass-wipe!

87
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,420
<i>The sum of which</i>
<i>are greater than their whole.</i>

88
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,554
what the hell are you two
making all those signs for?

89
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,388
He got my hat. He won't give it back.

90
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:20,931
<i>The town is the people</i>, <i>the buildings</i>
<i>they've erected to den or do business in.</i>

91
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,261
There you go. Problem solved.

92
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,131
<i>And it is the land.</i>

93
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,107
Screw charlie Rhodes.
I'd walk every day...

94
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,075
...if my mother wasn't tweaked
about the "preverts."

95
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,772
You meet a lot of preverts, Ralphie?

96
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,883
More than I know. Look at charlie...

97
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,248
...a normal jagoff, till you look under
the visor of his bus.

98
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,787
- Shut up.
- I know kids who've seen them.

99
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,887
- Seen what?
- Pictures. Porn.

100
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,425
charlieprevert. com.

101
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,688
Dude, we gotta check this, all right?

102
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,924
we'll hook up tonight,
see how charlie gets his rocks off.

103
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,864
Hey, Petrie...

104
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,235
<i>The people are Scotch</i>,
<i>English and French.</i>

105
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,402
<i>There are others</i>, <i>of course...</i>

106
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:11,278
<i>... a smattering</i>, <i>like a fistful of pepper</i>
<i>thrown in a bucket of salt.</i>

107
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,351
<i>Matt Burke teaches English</i>
<i>at the high school...</i>

108
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,147
<i>... and is a life-long bachelor.</i>

109
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,584
- Morning, Matt.
- Morning.

110
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,851
<i>Matt's alternative life</i>
<i>in Portland is tolerated...</i>

111
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,587
<i>... so long as he keeps it</i>
<i>out of the classroom.</i>

112
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:27,199
<i>The buildings here are nearly all</i>
<i>constructed of honest wood.</i>

113
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:31,530
<i>And when I was a boy</i>,
<i>it was largely agreed that Hubie Marsten...</i>

114
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,537
<i>... built the finest home</i>
<i>in Jerusalem's Lot...</i>

115
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,232
<i>... before going soft in the attic.</i>

116
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,439
Mr. Mears?

117
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,282
Mr. Mears, I'm Susan Norton.

118
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,115
we traded e-mails a few years back.
You probably don't remember.

119
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,191
I went to Boston University and couldn't
decide between art and English.

120
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,552
- Please, sit.
- lf I'm not bothering you.

121
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,753
Not at all.

122
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,931
- So what'd you choose?
- Art.

123
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,362
Nothing against writing.

124
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,333
Everyone knows you grew up here.
I found it inspiring.

125
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,138
- oh, thank you.
- I lived in New York for a year after school.

126
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,368
But I couldn't paint the rent.
So I'm home reevaluating.

127
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,877
New York's for artists
with generous parents.

128
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:19,677
And the Lot is for hobbyists who paint
lighthouses and lobster boats.

129
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,912
I wish you'd been more persistent
with your e-mails, Susan.

130
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,351
Because I'm interesting or blonde?

131
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,358
Because you're an interesting blonde.

132
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,627
- what brings you back?
- work.

133
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,529
A new book.
<i>Boring People in the Perfect Town</i>?

134
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,762
It surrounds the Marsten house,
but I'm not telling anyone.

135
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,566
A haunted house.
Not your genre.

136
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,565
complex characters can elevate genre.

137
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,976
Hubie Marsten, a respected pillar
of the community until the moment...

138
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,174
...he blew his wife away
and hung himself from a rafter.

139
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,285
Small-town Shakespeare.

140
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,848
You are the one who found them.

141
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,489
Yes.

142
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,529
- I tried to rent the place.
- You actually wanted to live there?

143
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,461
Yeah, it's my...

144
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,965
...attraction-repulsion compulsion.

145
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,365
Kinky things went on
in that place in Hubie's day.

146
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,167
I heard.

147
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,338
- You met the owners?
- Two guys. I hope they're gay.

148
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,413
It might alleviate
some of the gossip off me.

149
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,406
can I get you something?

150
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,746
Hello. I'm Susan's mother.

151
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,149
It's good to meet both of you.

152
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,025
Susan Norton, Norton's café.

153
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,561
I'm slinging latte here
till I can move back to New York.

154
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:43,634
I think that building you mentioned might be
a metaphor for something bigger in your life.

155
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,033
Does it always have to be
something bigger?

156
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,163
Like a theme?

157
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,399
There would be if it were my book.

158
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,575
<i>The land is granite-bodied.</i>

159
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,307
<i>Farming it is a thankless</i>,
<i>miserable business.</i>

160
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,777
You sure you wanna live out here, Dud?
It's getting cold.

161
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,355
I got a stove in the shack, Mike.
I'm all right.

162
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,856
we need the leaves
and tree cutting for fill.

163
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,257
- Don't burn them.
- I won't burn them, Mike.

164
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,523
- what you got there?
- He must have got thirsty.

165
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,259
- Hey, put that down.
- It's for my girlfriend.

166
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,801
You got a girlfriend now? who?

167
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,199
Let's go, gimp!

168
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,135
- who?
- I can't say!

169
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,741
okay, Floyd!

170
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,310
You better toss it away anyway.
She'll think you're a freak!

171
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,746
<i>The Rogers family ran a dairy here</i>
<i>for generations till Dud was born.</i>

172
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,216
<i>It was sold to the town</i>,
<i>which built the hospital Dud needs...</i>

173
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,947
<i>... but can't visit without insurance.</i>

174
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,325
- Royce, could you excuse us, please?
- why?

175
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,397
<i>This is what Sandy McDougall</i>
<i>gave up high school for.</i>

176
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,033
Your son has a significant contusion.

177
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,032
I wanna talk to Sandy about it...

178
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,500
...alone.

179
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,673
<i>A winter malaise is epidemic</i>
<i>in small towns.</i>

180
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:01,677
<i>Dr. James Cody fights it</i>
<i>with fine dining and new clothes.</i>

181
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,813
<i>Others self-medicate with alcohol</i>
<i>and television.</i>

182
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,221
Little Roy hasn't had breakfast.

183
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,286
what happened, Sandy?

184
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,428
I turned my back for a second,
and he fell off the changing table.

185
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,895
It's the truth.

186
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,871
Sandy, how long
have you been married, now?

187
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,511
Six months.

188
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,772
Still live in crockett's trailer park?

189
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,742
Not having money
doesn't make us bad parents.

190
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,385
No, of course not.

191
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:45,019
Sandy, I'm required by law
to report this type of injury.

192
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,822
- It's not what you think, Jimmy.
- It's not?

193
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,390
Sandy, was it Royce?

194
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,022
Look, this marriage isn't all I thought,
but little Roy's okay.

195
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,962
we had some fun times didn't we?

196
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,436
Dancing? New Year's at Dell's?

197
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,334
Please, don't report it. Give us a chance.

198
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,573
Bring the baby back tomorrow.

199
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,543
You're a good man, Jimmy.

200
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,745
And a good doctor.

201
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,954
If I'd been a little smarter...

202
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,889
...or drunker that New Year's...

203
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,462
...who knows?

204
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,264
<i>You stay because</i>
<i>a small town knows you...</i>

205
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:33,963
<i>... and thereby owns you. Sure as the bank</i>,
<i>the car dealer and the Sears in Livingston.</i>

206
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:40,177
The kitchen is available to all guests
from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.

207
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,644
Fresh sheets are provided weekly...

208
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,750
...and rents are negotiable
for those who wanna work.

209
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,351
Do you have a room with a view?

210
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,022
oh, yes, I do.

211
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,630
would you believe it's
my hardest room to rent?

212
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,892
Ed, a moment please.
Mr. Mears will be staying with us.

213
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,660
- For a few weeks.
- Pleasure.

214
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,237
Most tourists leave
soon as their tank's full.

215
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,365
I grew up in the Lot as a child
with my Aunt cynthia. cynthia Stowens.

216
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,038
I knew cynthia.

217
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,046
- You're her nephew?
- That's right.

218
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,777
- The boy who was in the Marsten house?
- I am.

219
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,882
You're the one who found Hubie
and his wife, Birdie?

220
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,224
Goddamn. You were a ballsy little fella.

221
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,955
Please, come and look.

222
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,165
Some of the men are building me
a rec room<i>:</i>

223
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,132
Gentlemen, this is Ben Mears.

224
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,101
Mr. Mears used to live in the Lot.

225
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,103
I know Mr. Mears.

226
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,469
You ever write a book
about Afghanistan?

227
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,602
- I did.
- waste of paper, that was.

228
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,806
- oh, Mr. Blair.
- That's okay. I'm glad somebody read it.

229
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:55,784
civilian casualties aren't avoidable
in combat. I was in the corps '64 to '70.

230
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,423
Tourists like yourself writing
about war...

231
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,219
...are naive, dangerous,
borderline traitorous.

232
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,454
- what do you think about war crimes?
- war crimes, my ass.

233
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,231
There's three good Marines rotting
in Leavenworth right now...

234
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,995
...because of Mr. Ben Mears.

235
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,805
<i>Beneath the postcard camouflage</i>,
<i>there's little good in small towns.</i>

236
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,784
<i>Mostly boredom</i>, <i>interspersed</i>
<i>with a dull</i>, <i>mindless</i>, <i>moronic evil.</i>

237
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,683
I love them.

238
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,587
I just love these brick walls.

239
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,186
Lawrence, son...

240
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,058
...I called you over an hour ago.

241
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,532
My secretary screwed up.

242
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,839
Fire her. She makes you look bad.

243
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,235
Thanks.

244
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,933
The shop looks good, Mr. Straker.

245
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,342
well, the truth be told,
we don't really need it.

246
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,415
Ninety-five percent of our business
is done online.

247
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,813
well, that explains opening in November.

248
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,582
weather is regional. we are global.

249
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,248
Madam!

250
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,918
what a beautiful-looking letterbox.

251
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,058
My father made it by hand.

252
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,497
well, your father is a fine craftsman.

253
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,234
I will give you...

254
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,802
...10 dollars to keep it.

255
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,463
You just turn around and take it back.

256
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:27,806
But if you insist,
I will buy that box from you for...

257
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,947
...$60, and I will find
a good home for it.

258
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,682
I need the money.

259
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:39,222
well, there you have it. Thank you
very much. Do come back again.

260
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,328
There's another chore I need you
to do for me, Lawrence.

261
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:52,462
You'll need a large truck. Be at the
Portland docks tonight, 7:00 sharp.

262
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,434
- okay.
- There are a dozen crates to be picked up.

263
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,337
All save one are to be
brought here to the shop.

264
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,810
The largest contains
an extremely valuable sideboard...

265
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,608
...a Hepplewhite.

266
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,274
That is to be taken to my house.

267
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,513
The movers will recognize it by its size.

268
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,981
Yes, sir.

269
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,591
They can leave it in the foyer.
The front door will be open.

270
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,896
Got it.

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,128
when do we meet your partner,
Mr. Barlow?

272
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,834
In his own good time.

273
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,607
This is fancy. Is it valuable?

274
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,408
It's an 18th-century harmony pin.

275
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,883
Belonged to a whoremaster's mistress.

276
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,982
Take it, Lawrence.

277
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,486
Take it...

278
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,022
...for services rendered.

279
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,398
Back it up there, Floyd.

280
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,097
Yeah.

281
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,076
what are you doing?

282
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,813
Give it here.

283
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,813
Give me that.

284
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,055
Get off my property.

285
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,021
He didn't mean anything by it.

286
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,558
I know what he meant.
Get him out of here.

287
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,669
Larry, Dud's harmless.

288
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,534
<i>I'll put him on another route.</i>
<i>He's like a brother.</i>

289
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,166
what if I find another trash service
and landscaper, huh?

290
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,576
- How about I pull all my accounts, Mike?
- <i>Don't say that.</i>

291
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:47,651
- I'm more than saying.
- Maybe you should talk to your daughter.

292
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:52,485
one more crack like that and you're both
through. <i>Finito.</i> Do you understand?

293
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,718
- Is that yours?
- I threw it out. It's too small.

294
00:19:55,894 --> 00:20:00,194
- You can't encourage that retard.
- Like I would. He's disgusting.

295
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,825
I've got 12 crates arriving at the Portland
docks tonight I need picked up.

296
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,894
Antiques.

297
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,597
- Stay out of there.
- I need money.

298
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:13,677
- Do you wanna make some money or not?
- Look, I'll help with the crates.

299
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,813
- call me later.
- Finders keepers.

300
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,007
How does it look, Daddy?
Is it too trashy?

301
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:30,954
- what?
- Nothing. I was just thinking.

302
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,648
So, what were you saying
about expression?

303
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,360
Graffiti is a condemnation of architecture.

304
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:43,024
Kids create on top of buildings because
they don't see the expression within.

305
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,260
what is the expression of a building?

306
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,503
lts soul, its ambiance,
a byproduct of design.

307
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,507
or events within.

308
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,175
Back to the Marsten house?

309
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,642
Sorry.

310
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,407
we can talk about your work.

311
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,448
we can talk about the dog.

312
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,913
I'm glad you called.

313
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,690
Get off the stage, boy.

314
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,997
Ben, found an old friend of yours.

315
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,798
- Ben Mears, welcome back.
- Hey.

316
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,062
- Hello, Susan.
- Mr. Burke.

317
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,900
I don't expect you remember
your 8th-grade teacher.

318
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,806
oh, no, I do. He was the tough guy
who taught for three reasons.

319
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,345
June, July and August. Right.
I was being facetious, Ben.

320
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,540
I teach high-school English now.

321
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,944
can you find time
to share your success with my class?

322
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,918
It's more of a working vacation.

323
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,648
- You sure?
- Yeah.

324
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,053
I'm disappointed.

325
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,786
we can talk all night.
The kids want celebrities.

326
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,487
when was the last time
you saw a kid read a book?

327
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,826
All I see are headphones
and cell phones.

328
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,730
You're right, weasel.
Literature's become elitist.

329
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,428
It's like black-and-white photography.

330
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,075
You know, Ben, I half expected
that cynicism from you.

331
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,376
- It's there between the lines.
- I like Ben's work.

332
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,072
- come on, we're just drinking here.
- It's okay.

333
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,980
Are you one of the few in town
who read the book?

334
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,018
or did you just skim the reviews?

335
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,419
I read <i>Damage Control</i>
and <i>Marching in Heels.</i>

336
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,752
well, don't hold back.

337
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,085
The world acknowledges
your talent as a writer.

338
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:22,131
I might argue your work is antagonistic
when it needn't be...

339
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,728
...emotionally detached
and lacking a moral center.

340
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,642
If that's the way you speak
with your English class...

341
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,643
...I would be honored to visit.

342
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,751
champ!

343
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,619
come on, boy!

344
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,589
champ!

345
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,521
I'll be lookout.

346
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,196
Panties a little tight?

347
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,723
All right.

348
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,866
- He's coming.
- Get out. Get out. Get out. Go. Go. Go.

349
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,845
- catch you tomorrow.
- All right.

350
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,487
champ!

351
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,988
champ!

352
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,189
what'd you see?

353
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,663
Dead soldiers. Their eyes are poked out.
Their ears are missing.

354
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,234
A soldier feeding pizza
to a lady's head!

355
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,268
You're a douche bag, Ralphie.

356
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,269
wait!

357
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,640
- where are we?
- It looks like...

358
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,310
Mark?

359
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,948
It has to be Mark.

360
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,283
Mark?

361
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:23,071
wait. I can't breathe.

362
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,889
Danny!

363
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,459
No, no!

364
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,993
Danny! Danny!

365
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,370
No!

366
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,183
I think Susie wants out.

367
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:18,193
She's always e-mailing other guys,
old teachers, old boyfriends.

368
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,796
well, how do you know?

369
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,432
I set up a computer for her
and her mother.

370
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,592
- So of course I got the passwords.
- Floyd.

371
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,562
Floyd.

372
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,106
- You set up my computer.
- Relax. I don't know your business.

373
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,541
I don't want to. what?
You have nothing to worry about.

374
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:39,116
- Nothing's wrong with surfing The Barnyard.
- You son of a bitch!

375
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:43,852
Yeah, I bet you felt real sorry
for that dog.

376
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,580
I can't believe you!

377
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,491
You could get that.

378
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,626
- Hello.
- <i>Mrs. Petrie.</i>

379
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,996
Hi, I'm Marjorie Glick. we've never met.

380
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,538
Look, are my boys still at your house?
If so, could you send them home, please?

381
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:06,871
one second, Marjorie. It's Mrs. Glick.
She thinks her boys are here.

382
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,673
- They went home.
- Mark says they went home.

383
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,147
- They must be on the way.
- Does he know what time they left?

384
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,112
- I didn't see anybody.
- we were outside. They left at, like, 8.

385
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,916
Mark says the boys left
around 8, Marjorie.

386
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:25,453
- okay. Great. It's getting late.
- <i>It is.</i>

387
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,689
- would you like to speak with Mark?
- No.

388
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,528
No. No, I guess not. Thank you.

389
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,364
- we'll have to meet some time.
- That would be nice.

390
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,564
Not in this life.

391
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,302
- Danny?
- I found him lying in the road.

392
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,845
My God, is he all right?

393
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,040
- where's Ralphie?
- call an ambulance.

394
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,139
Hubie?

395
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,881
Birdie?

396
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,717
It's Floyd.

397
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,125
Forgot to pay your electric.

398
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,788
Hey, you gonna give us a hand here,
Hubie Jr.?

399
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,832
crockett's paying us 100 bucks
to deliver this crate.

400
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,100
If I said to you, Mike...

401
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,244
...l'll pay you 200 bucks...

402
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:52,179
...to come into the Marsten house
alone at night...

403
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,850
...would you do it?
- Hell, no.

404
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,054
Me neither.

405
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,453
I find that humorous.

406
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,663
This place used to keep me up at night.

407
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,467
As a kid, I could see it
from my bedroom window.

408
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:20,299
I wouldn't be able to sleep
unless my mother pulled the shade.

409
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,942
where are you going?

410
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,679
I wanna see Hubie's bedroom.

411
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,582
And the bathroom where Birdie...

412
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,859
Straker?

413
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,970
Let's get out of here.

414
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,047
You better get back in there.
Birdie needs a boyfriend.

415
00:31:57,215 --> 00:32:00,810
- You heard footsteps. we both did, right?
- I heard squealing.

416
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,350
I think that was you.

417
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,620
Hey, Mike, what do these Beemers run?

418
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,019
Hurry up.

419
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,345
I told you it was Straker.

420
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,961
Just spread out.

421
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,867
<i>No sign of the Glick boy.</i>

422
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,802
- find evidence of the boy.

423
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:13,956
Mark, what were you boys doing
on this side of town?

424
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,756
we were just playing flashlight tag.

425
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,924
charlie Rhodes lives just over the hill.
Did you hear about his dog?

426
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,129
Yeah, I heard it died.

427
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:28,966
Mrs. Glick says you and her boys had some
trouble with charlie on the school bus.

428
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,632
You got him angry.
Did you see charlie last night?

429
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,175
No.

430
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,879
Shut up, cujo! Quiet!

431
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,246
Hi.

432
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,819
Mr. Mears. Surprised to see you
this morning.

433
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,120
A child won't last long in this cold.

434
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:55,322
These Norton girls are angels, Ben.
Before them it was Eva Prunier.

435
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,197
You may not see it, but our landlady
was the prettiest in the county.

436
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,634
Eva's still pretty. I can see it.

437
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,831
what I see in Eva, it's magic.

438
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,808
careful, Ed. Mr. Mears will turn
your heartbreak into a bestseller.

439
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,503
our secrets are safe.

440
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,114
Ben's working on a piece
of historical fiction.

441
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,648
Yeah, I heard.

442
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,979
- Marsten house?
- who told you that?

443
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,644
Little bird in the library.

444
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:21,288
what was it like in the house?
Tell us about when you found her.

445
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,518
You'll have to wait for the book.

446
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,628
come on. Give us a preview.

447
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:31,427
I was 9 years old, living out on Burns Road
with my aunt, cynthia.

448
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,264
I went in on a dare
from the Bloody Pirates.

449
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,897
was Hubie already hanging,
or did you see him do it?

450
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,307
I saw.

451
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:47,208
I spent the whole night in there until
a friend finally got my Aunt cynthia.

452
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,552
Terrible place, looking down
on this town like a dark idol.

453
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:55,180
- There's a quote for the liner jacket.
- we need some more water.

454
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,758
Yeah, I'll help.

455
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,294
what about Ronnie Barnes?

456
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,395
Did you see him too?

457
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,835
No.

458
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,350
No, I never did.

459
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,256
I'm so embarrassed.

460
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,487
I know you didn't want people
to know what you're writing.

461
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:36,565
I went to the library. I mentioned
your name to Loretta Starcher.

462
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,362
Now the whole town knows.
I was trying to help.

463
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,301
- It's okay.
- I was researching the Marsten's for you.

464
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,304
I wanted it to be a nice surprise.

465
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,568
- Are you mad? I would be.
- Ben Mears.

466
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,406
Didn't mean to interrupt.
May I speak with you?

467
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,344
I'll call you.

468
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,007
I know you're on to something
with this book.

469
00:35:56,554 --> 00:36:00,456
- Never thought we'd see you again.
- It's nice to see you too, chief.

470
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,293
So give me an alibi.

471
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,554
I was having drinks
with Susan till 9.

472
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,464
Matt Burke says you left Dell's at 8
because you wanted to work.

473
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,333
It might have been 8.

474
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,195
Did you see any children
on your drive?

475
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,567
- Any flashlights in the woods?
- No.

476
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,733
Anything unusual? Maybe a van parked
alongside the road?

477
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,242
No.

478
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,612
All right. I do appreciate your help today.

479
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:28,848
That dog in the cemetery,
who found it first?

480
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:30,982
I did.

481
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,652
okay.

482
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,425
Floyd, everything work out
last night?

483
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,967
He paid me, Larry.
Thanks for the job.

484
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,729
Pocket money. Keep your lady happy.

485
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,565
well, what can I do you for?

486
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,570
You heard about the missing kid?

487
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,504
A parent's worst fear.

488
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:57,478
well, while we were up at the
Marsten house making that delivery...

489
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,082
...I looked in the back
of the new owner's car.

490
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,413
I saw a plastic bag in the back seat.

491
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,421
It was leaking.

492
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,516
was it little-boy-sized?

493
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,090
It was head-sized.

494
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,431
The new owner is Richard Straker.

495
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:20,059
You think he killed the missing
Glick boy and kept the head?

496
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm not saying all that.

497
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,936
what will that do
to his antique business?

498
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,641
- It was leaking all over the leather seats.
- Did you tell Mike what you saw?

499
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:32,112
No. I didn't think much of it
at the time, until today.

500
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,951
So why tell me? Go tell Parkins Gillespie,
if you think it's important.

501
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,113
I'm telling you because you know him.

502
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,519
Relax, Floyd.

503
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:46,959
Straker called me this morning,
excited about tackle and shacks.

504
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:50,726
Seems he tried his hand at ice fishing
and finds it relaxing.

505
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,802
Ice fishing.

506
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:58,735
Maybe he bagged a tuna or cod, whatever
you swamp Yankees pull out of these lakes.

507
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,404
Ice fishing.

508
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,976
well, that's a relief.

509
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,144
I was driving myself crazy.

510
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,911
I understand...

511
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,817
...but we have to be careful, Floyd.

512
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,925
Loose talk can ruin people.

513
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:20,427
My first suspect was the other new
guy in town. Some hotshot writer.

514
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,657
- what writer?
- Mears.

515
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:26,360
Nice enough, but a city guy.
A bit abrasive. You know him?

516
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,796
Ben Mears.

517
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,469
I know of him.

518
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,777
I better get back to work.

519
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,005
Hey, thanks for last night.

520
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,742
And thanks for coming to me first on this.

521
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,545
Bishop's Lake.

522
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,882
That's the best spot for ice fishing.

523
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,788
I'll tell Straker.

524
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,359
You're on my short list, buddy.

525
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,455
Dud.

526
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,327
I'm sorry, Dud.
I can't use you today.

527
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,965
what? why not?

528
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:35,004
Ruth crockett. You shouldn't have been
messing with her, Dud.

529
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,198
Now Larry's threatened to pull
all the accounts.

530
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,779
well, I can't put you on the truck, Dud.
I can't afford it.

531
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,740
But we're friends, Mike.
we're best friends.

532
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,408
I know. I know.

533
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,316
we still are.

534
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,956
what will I do?

535
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,184
I don't know.

536
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,793
You know, I'll help you find another job.

537
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,695
Until then, look, just take this...

538
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,065
...to hold you over, all right.

539
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,567
It's not your fault, Dud.

540
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:17,007
whatever you did,
it was just, you know, misunderstood.

541
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,879
I'm sorry.

542
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,318
Danny, can you hear me?

543
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,819
Danny? can you hear me?

544
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,290
If you can hear me, blink your eyes.

545
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,162
He's in acute mental shock.

546
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,298
Maybe from excessive fear, grief...

547
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,398
...or some sort of emotional trauma.

548
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,402
Excuse me.

549
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,367
He's getting worse.

550
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,212
Marjorie.

551
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,182
I believe this is Danny's.

552
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,057
- Yes, doctor.
- Doctor.

553
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:12,091
Sometimes the power of prayer
and local facilities have limits.

554
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:15,705
It's shock, Father.
Your car didn't hit him.

555
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,664
He'll snap out of it.

556
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,049
Stop it.

557
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,485
Hi. How's little Roy today?

558
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,719
He's fine, Jimmy. See for yourself.

559
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,264
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

560
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,905
I really appreciate your help, Jimmy.

561
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:52,702
Maybe after you finish with Roy,
I could buy you lunch.

562
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,608
You know, I usually have my lunch
in the cafeteria, Sandy.

563
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,873
well, little Roy and I could join you.

564
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,550
That wouldn't be a good idea.

565
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:06,650
- what would your husband say?
- "order a salad. Your ass is fat."

566
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,386
That was a joke.

567
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,761
Most doctors love kids.
They have pictures all over the office.

568
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,366
It helps the patient relax.

569
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,733
They figure, "This doctor's so busy
thinking about his kids...

570
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,374
...he's not thinking about my naked body."

571
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:29,310
Yeah, well, I love kids, you know.
They're great to work with.

572
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,880
They have this, you know...

573
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,246
...way to thank you with their eyes.

574
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:39,082
Yeah, but you love your toys too.
I mean, look at this car.

575
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:40,621
- Still a player.
- Player?

576
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:44,249
- You think this car's too dope for Doctor c.?
- Maybe.

577
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,431
I only said "player" because I know
how you were at Dell's.

578
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:58,405
- I danced with you, remember?
- oh, yeah. I remember.

579
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,573
would you pull over?
I have to check on little Roy.

580
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,077
Sure.

581
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,633
I can't.

582
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,934
You're still a nice guy.

583
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,703
You are.

584
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,346
If I could have chose everything
in my life...

585
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,043
...l'd have chose a man like you.

586
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,577
The more interesting items
are in the store.

587
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,719
I'm sorry. I was looking
for a local boy who's missing.

588
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,048
I don't think you'll find him here.

589
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,085
No.

590
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:59,057
I'm Ben Mears, Mr. Straker.
Been anxious to meet you.

591
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,628
Richard.

592
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,926
You and your partner took the house
I was interested in.

593
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,127
You comfortable up there?

594
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:11,130
well, it's a handful, Ben.

595
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,139
I hope you find the little boy.

596
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:20,147
Somehow, I don't think we will.
Not alive, anyway.

597
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:21,784
How's your alibi?

598
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,112
Excuse me?

599
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:29,357
The police spoke with me today.
we're both new in town.

600
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:34,122
we're not even new. In a small town
like this, we're strangers the first 20 years.

601
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:37,427
well, I happen to like it here, Ben.

602
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:39,692
And your partner?

603
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,394
- Mr. Barlow?
- You a reporter?

604
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,039
writer.

605
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,074
- critics call me "typist."
- "Typist"?

606
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,241
Typist.

607
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,807
well, if you're curious about the house...

608
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,177
...come up and have
a drink one night.

609
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,816
The truth is the place scares me.

610
00:45:56,987 --> 00:46:00,980
well, then you never intended to take it,
did you, Mr. Typist?

611
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,197
- It's Romeo.
- More like Hannibal.

612
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,598
Ruth!

613
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,336
- can I talk to you?
- Send him for pizza.

614
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,978
- Hey, go wash my car!
- Shut up.

615
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,214
I got fired, Ruth.

616
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,981
Mike said I shouldn't have
been messing with you.

617
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:36,355
I was thinking maybe you could talk
to your father so I can get my job back.

618
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:40,190
It wouldn't do any good.
He's mega-protective.

619
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,390
- I hate my father more than you do.
- Really?

620
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:47,264
well, I still like you, Ruth.
I really do.

621
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,440
You seem like a nice person, Dud.

622
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,667
But that stuff at my house
was just to make my father mad.

623
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:57,405
- But, Ruth...
- I'm sorry, Dud, but you gotta get real.

624
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,014
Get out of here, gimp!

625
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,155
You're not my best friend, Mike.

626
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,535
Not anymore.

627
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,908
Dump's closed, mister.

628
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,712
I'm just watching the fires.

629
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,214
It scares the animals away.

630
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,283
Just the rats.

631
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,984
Smokes them from their holes.

632
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,257
Yeah. where will they go?

633
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:52,162
I guess they'll find another hole.

634
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,667
You from around here?

635
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,305
Yeah, just over the hill.

636
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:02,108
- what are you writing there?
- Nothing.

637
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,181
I lost my job.

638
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,750
Mike was my best friend
since junior high.

639
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,318
It's his backhoe.

640
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,047
- I'll wash it off.
- No, leave it.

641
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,520
I didn't do anything wrong.

642
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:20,959
I was just talking with Ruth crockett,
my girlfriend...

643
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,099
...and her father got crazy...

644
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,862
...and told Mike he had to fire me
or he'd lose all his work.

645
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,096
Yeah, that's too bad.

646
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,567
Say, aren't you one of the fellas
that bought the Marsten place?

647
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:39,341
- Very good.
- Are there any ghosts in that old house?

648
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:40,813
Ghosts?

649
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,752
No.

650
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,151
- No ghosts.
- I didn't think so.

651
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,250
well, anyway...

652
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,760
...it's always nice when someone comes
down to, you know, shoot the breeze...

653
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:57,593
...but the dump closes at 6
and it's half past 9 now, so...

654
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,996
Dud...

655
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,231
...I noticed your limping.

656
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,968
curvature of the spine?

657
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,976
- Does that bother you?
- Nope.

658
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,406
I can work fine.

659
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,578
I meant in other ways.

660
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,307
No.

661
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,448
well...

662
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,354
...girls.

663
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,653
Just girls.

664
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,259
Their boyfriends, the other kids?

665
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,662
Sometimes they laugh.

666
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:34,895
what were you to say
if I gave you a chance...

667
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,404
...to be equal to those boys and girls?

668
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:41,537
or maybe even a little more.
would you take it?

669
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,675
Equal?

670
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:59,259
<i>Danny.</i>

671
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,726
<i>Danny.</i>

672
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,328
Danny.

673
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,593
Danny.

674
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:08,430
Danny.

675
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,129
Danny?

676
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,867
come on, Danny, it's me...

677
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,601
...your brother, Ralphie.

678
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,670
Remember?

679
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,576
You left me in the woods.

680
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,683
Ralphie?

681
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:29,620
- I'm just messing with you, Danny.
- Go away.

682
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,324
Danny, I'm not mad.

683
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,794
Danny.

684
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,364
I knew you were scared.

685
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,967
cripes, I was scared too.

686
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,670
But not anymore.

687
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:49,975
Danny...

688
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,910
...l'm messing with you, Danny.

689
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,950
I ain't scared at all.

690
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,052
Let me in, Danny.

691
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,454
Don't let Mom and Dad blame you.

692
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,959
Let me in, Danny.

693
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,228
All right.

694
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,932
You went to lunch
with Sandy McDougall?

695
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,073
- what's wrong with that?
- oh, nothing.

696
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,200
She's 19, married, barely educated.
what else is right?

697
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,279
what's going on here?

698
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:44,391
Now, who remembers the Morris chair?

699
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:45,796
This.

700
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,802
Such an excellent example.

701
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,236
Very popular in Berkeley.

702
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,876
Look at that leather.

703
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:57,536
Please be kind enough
to tell your friends we're open...

704
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,979
...and that our prices
are so very reasonable.

705
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,052
Madam...

706
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:09,488
...this drop-leaf table would look beautiful
in a foyer...

707
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,561
...or in a servants' entrance.

708
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,789
I am the only servant in my house.

709
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,992
And I am Richard Straker.

710
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:23,971
Eva Prunier. I own
a boarding house on clift Street.

711
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,405
Eva Prunier.

712
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,840
Your name is familiar.

713
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,143
And your accent.

714
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,582
Excuse me?

715
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,021
Tell me, Eva...

716
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,824
...of all the old parlor games,
which one do you miss the most?

717
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:53,561
As you may share a little morphine
<i>avec</i> his little friend.

718
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,102
I am jealous.

719
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:02,371
You must have been so young
at that time then.

720
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:06,607
All you little village girls,
what, 16 years old? Fifteen?

721
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,043
Did you give to Hubie...

722
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,312
...what I think you gave to him?

723
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,086
oh, I knew it.

724
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:17,488
- And did you wear his goat's-head mask?
- Stop it!

725
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,696
I taught Ben Mears in the eighth grade.
He survived.

726
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:30,536
Since then, he's had a distinguished
literary career.

727
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,733
In 2001, he was captured
by Taliban troops...

728
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,105
...while reporting the Afghan war.

729
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:39,646
He was rescued from certain death
by U.S. Marines.

730
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,575
on the return trek...

731
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,219
...Ben's Marines killed 10 Afghan villagers.

732
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:48,153
<i>Damage Control</i> is a factual account
of the incident.

733
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:51,590
Three Marines were court-martialed
and imprisoned.

734
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,999
Ben received the Pulitzer Prize. Mr. Mears
is in town researching his new book...

735
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,494
...on the Marsten house.

736
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:04,203
Mr. Mears, should anyone
in their right mind trust an author?

737
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,003
A good author illuminates truth.

738
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,610
- Yes.
- what's the truth about this town?

739
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,809
I used to think nothing happened here.

740
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,545
But the truth is everything happens here.

741
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,315
one has to look close in a small town.

742
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,481
The beauty is in the details.

743
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:28,188
You have all the horror of Qalai Janghi
prison right here in one battered child.

744
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:32,802
All the beauty of Michelangelo
in the alabaster calf of one...

745
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,937
...shoulder-high waitress.

746
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,404
The longing you feel for the boy or girl
in the next row...

747
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:42,067
...is equal to or greater than what
your favorite musician feels...

748
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,213
...for his favorite supermodel.

749
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,208
Never minimize your feelings.

750
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,317
or this town.

751
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,647
what's the truth about the Marines
that saved you in Afghanistan?

752
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,655
I'm not a waitress or shoulder-high.

753
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:05,931
- Let me checked those Michelangelo calves.
- It was metaphors on the fly.

754
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,366
- what do you want from me?
- Proof.

755
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,199
And they really liked him?

756
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,739
I'll say they warmed up to him.

757
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,568
The boy went from mental shock
to extreme anemia overnight.

758
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,381
what our grandfathers would call
wasting away.

759
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,313
That poor family. Two sons.

760
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,918
can you imagine?

761
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:29,787
The red-cell count on a 14-year-old boy
should run between 85 and 95 percent.

762
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,256
Danny's was 45.

763
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:35,097
- How long until people make a connection?
- Here it comes.

764
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,098
come on.
Ben, the whole town's talking.

765
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,599
The house.

766
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,134
It's like a curse.

767
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:46,772
Did you know that Hubie Marsten's
trucking firm in Boston was a front?

768
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:51,773
Hubie was questioned twice by police.
once in Boston, and once in Malden.

769
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:55,346
The Malden thing was for the murder
of an 11 -year-old boy.

770
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,816
Hubie and his wife moved
to the Lot in 1958.

771
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:01,548
Between '58 and '74,
five children disappeared.

772
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,888
But we've had no missing kids
since Hubie died. Not one.

773
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:09,225
Now the house is occupied and we have
one boy missing and another one dead.

774
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,993
So the house is a beacon for evil men.

775
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,795
It attracted you.

776
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,167
Ben, I'm sure what you saw there
as a boy still haunts you.

777
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,639
- You think?
- It stayed in the town's consciousness too.

778
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:25,372
Not just because tales of nastiness do,
but I think because of location.

779
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,776
It looks down on us...

780
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,975
...like it's judging us.

781
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,814
or it's the mirror by which
you judge yourselves.

782
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:35,321
we have to go up there.

783
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,917
Introduce ourselves to the new squire?

784
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:42,064
- on behalf of the town, of course.
- I've met the squire.

785
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,133
- It's research.
- Susan, stay away from there.

786
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,700
Ben, you're committed to the truth.

787
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,339
why don't you tell us
why you're really here?

788
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,642
You're not writing a book
on the Marsten house. Right?

789
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,549
No. No, I'm not.

790
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,582
what do you mean?

791
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,686
- Ben?
- The book is a non-fiction look...

792
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,155
...at the roots of domestic evil.

793
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,753
You're writing about us?

794
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:16,797
- of course he is.
- You lied? To everyone?

795
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,331
Haunted houses are not my genre.

796
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:24,405
So we're evil. we're a small town,
small-minded and evil?

797
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,941
- I won't be a character in your stupid book.
- Hey, Susan!

798
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,310
You will find evil if you want it, Ben.

799
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,783
Racism, greed, envy.

800
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,413
But we have heroes here too.

801
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,784
- I'm sure.
- lf you're gonna look at this town...

802
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,088
...look fair and throw away
your preconceptions.

803
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:52,200
I've seen the good,
and it far outweighs any bad.

804
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,871
we're wrapping up for the night.

805
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,904
Eva?

806
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,011
You all right?

807
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,680
No, I don't think so.

808
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:10,015
what is it, Eva?

809
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:13,121
That house.

810
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,314
It haunts me.

811
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:21,454
I used to sneak up there
with Eva werts and Loretta Starcher.

812
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,792
we were young, bored.

813
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,327
Hubie and Birdie Marsten were alive.

814
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:30,732
I'm ashamed of the things we did.

815
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,966
You were just a kid.

816
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:38,239
I used to write letters in French
for Marsten, to a man in Marseilles.

817
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:43,283
Marsten admired this man,
said he was beyond good and evil.

818
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,353
Horrifying, sublime.

819
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:50,084
I'm thinking about the missing boy
and his brother, Ed. I feel terrible.

820
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,661
I feel as though the invitations
that I wrote...

821
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,264
...are somehow being answered.

822
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:01,567
- After 50 years?
- well, suppose he had a partner or a son?

823
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,262
No, no.

824
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,167
Eva...

825
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,943
...you know how I feel.

826
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,140
I liked your husband. I respected him.

827
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:16,978
But I love you now.

828
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,115
And these last 10,
15 years of our lives...

829
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,191
...they can be great together.

830
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:28,655
This loving you from afar was killing me.

831
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,794
<i>Mom?</i>

832
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,871
<i>It's Danny.</i>

833
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,546
<i>I found Ralphie.</i>

834
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:23,983
Go away. Stop it.

835
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:26,052
who is this?

836
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,056
I wish you'd told me earlier
about the dog, Michael.

837
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,890
I'd have postponed the funeral.

838
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,589
It was dead, Father.
It was hanging on the fence.

839
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,930
Yes, but now all this land
has got to be reconsecrated.

840
01:00:41,104 --> 01:00:45,234
Technically speaking, we're standing
on unhallowed ground.

841
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,414
"Jerk."

842
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,947
It's Dud. Should never have fired him.

843
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,919
where's he been hiding?

844
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:02,387
when tragedy strikes in a family,
there's a safety net.

845
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:08,227
It's the safety net of community,
of which we are all a part.

846
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:11,399
However, when tragedy reaches out
and touches us all...

847
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,362
Sticking to the anemia, Jim?

848
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:17,965
The family refused an autopsy.

849
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,037
It may have been anemia. I'm not sure.

850
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:25,704
whatever killed Danny Glick
is being buried in that grave.

851
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:30,649
<i>Ben Mears was in a motorcycle accident</i>
<i>three years ago. A girl was killed.</i>

852
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,050
<i>Mears was cleared of all blame.</i>

853
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:37,022
<i>Kurt Barlow</i>, <i>antique dealer.</i>
<i>That's all they found on him.</i>

854
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,218
- That's it?
- <i>On him.</i>

855
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:43,263
<i>Richard Thomas Straker</i>,
<i>born in Tampa</i>, <i>Florida.</i>

856
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:48,837
<i>Expelled from UF in 1966</i>
<i>for selling MDMA.</i>

857
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:53,475
<i>Charlie Rhodes is clean.</i>
<i>The big surprise is the boy's father.</i>

858
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:58,774
<i>Tony Glick filed for bankruptcy in 1990 and</i>
<i>left a lot of people in Nashua on the hook.</i>

859
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:01,041
Thanks, Nolly.

860
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,283
- <i>Your daughter called from Florida.</i>
- Danny!

861
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,978
<i>Congratulations</i>, <i>boss.</i>

862
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:09,613
- Stop this nonsense.
- <i>Aren't you young to be a grandfather?</i>

863
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:15,558
Ed...

864
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,924
...I wanna pay my respects to Jack.

865
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,399
I feel guilty about last night.

866
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:26,106
I was upset and did something
I shouldn't have.

867
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:28,310
It's my fault.

868
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:30,802
I'm sorry, Ed.

869
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:37,277
- Hi, doctor.
- Hi.

870
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:40,354
- I'll see you later, Matt.
- I can't believe it.

871
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:44,118
- I used to babysit Danny Glick.
- Yeah. oh, how's the baby?

872
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,124
Poor little boy has a chest cold.

873
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:50,230
I don't have the car, and Roy says doctors
don't make house calls anymore.

874
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,197
- He says they're on a pedestal.
- I didn't say that.

875
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:57,237
well, I wouldn't say a pedestal,
but I guess I could make a house call.

876
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,222
Ruth?

877
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,499
Ruth.

878
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,673
It's freezing in here.

879
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,766
I came home from school.

880
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,708
what's wrong, honey?

881
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,981
Are you sick?

882
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,714
why don't you let me
take that necklace off?

883
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:51,382
No.

884
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:56,031
I had the strangest dream.

885
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:59,194
I was married to Dud Rogers.

886
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:03,498
He took me flying over town,
and I saw a big fire.

887
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:08,668
- I saw you yelling up at me.
- Dud Rogers? The cripple?

888
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,244
Sounds more like a nightmare.

889
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,007
You had Dud fired.

890
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:18,142
- That job was all he had.
- The guy is a menace.

891
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,324
can I get you something?

892
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,590
No.

893
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,226
You sure?

894
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:30,922
- Nothing?
- Not that!

895
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,398
can't you see I don't feel good?

896
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,611
Floyd?

897
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,476
You there, Floyd?

898
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,278
come on.

899
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:31,392
come on, we'll get you inside.
It's too cold, too cold.

900
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,308
It's okay, it's okay.

901
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:07,294
what?

902
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,065
<i>Mike.</i>

903
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:19,099
- <i>Mikey?</i>
- Are you staring at me?

904
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,742
<i>Mikey.</i>

905
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,646
<i>Your eyes are poked out.</i>

906
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,213
<i>Ears are missing.</i>

907
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,479
Stop staring at me.

908
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,880
Damn you.

909
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,549
You will shut those eyes!

910
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,855
Damn you, shut those eyes!

911
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:56,568
I'm a working mother. I can't drive Mark
to school. I need him on that bus.

912
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,441
I understand.

913
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,411
I spoke with charlie Rhodes,
and he seems to think...

914
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:04,849
...Mark knows a lot more
about the dead dog than he's saying.

915
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,820
He also thinks that Mark
may be selling pot on the bus.

916
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:12,017
- That's bull.
- Is he crazy? My God.

917
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,685
what's the problem
between you and charlie?

918
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,595
what, besides the fact I don't
have a father to kick his ass?

919
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:23,136
Maybe I can speak to the principal
at Mark's school.

920
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,102
Maybe she can broker a truce.

921
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:30,210
You know what? Don't bother. The guy's
a moo-goo-gai maniac anyway.

922
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,013
what?

923
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,880
You know, like, Vietnam, the...

924
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,146
charlie was there.
He shows us pictures on the bus.

925
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,812
He thinks he can, like,
impress us or something.

926
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,289
Don't lie about this, Mark.

927
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,224
He keeps them locked
in his glove compartment.

928
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:58,033
Royce!

929
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,003
Royce, no!

930
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,640
You're going to die.
Are you ready to die, doctor?

931
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:07,146
Is my wife a whore?
If not, you think you can pump her for free?

932
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:09,477
- No, no.
- No, because she is a whore.

933
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:13,648
- Royce, baby, please...
- Shut up, Sandy. Shut the hell up!

934
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:19,116
That's a $ 10,000 whore you just
rolled off. You understand?

935
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:22,330
Ten thousand tomorrow,
or I pull this trigger.

936
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,296
who'd blame me?
who'd feel sorry for a dirty doctor?

937
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,901
okay! okay.

938
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:43,013
- Shut that thing up!
- It's okay, Roy. It's okay.

939
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:49,080
- Shut that thing up!
- what? Royce, no!

940
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,990
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

941
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:06,441
- Hi, guys. what can I get you?
- Hey, Susie, take a seat.

942
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,270
I'm pretty busy now, Floyd.

943
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,441
Hi, Mike. How are you?

944
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:19,783
- well, I'm fine, Susan. Thanks for asking.
- So where you been, Susie?

945
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,714
working.

946
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,388
can we talk about this
another time? Soon?

947
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:29,291
- I think we have some things to talk about.
- we do.

948
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:33,162
oh, that was good, Floyd,
but I think we can push a bit further.

949
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:37,599
My point being is, why doesn't anyone
here just, I don't know, say the truth?

950
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,571
what's wrong with you?

951
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,937
- He doesn't feel well.
- come on, Floyd.

952
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,373
Tell her you're pissed.

953
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,308
She got dumped by the writer...

954
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,472
...and she's crawling back
to homeboy.

955
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,584
- Knock it off.
- what's he saying?

956
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:53,017
Floyd, tell her to kiss off,
or tell her you love her.

957
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:55,349
At least say something real.

958
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:59,252
Look, this... This isn't fair, Susie.

959
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:01,758
Are you with me or with him?

960
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,090
- Neither.
- who is this writer guy anyway?

961
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,566
come on. He's the one
you been reading about on her e-mails.

962
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,796
- I said, shut up!
- what e-mails?

963
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:14,465
- Shut up, Mike. Shut up!
- Hang on, now. You two are friends.

964
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:24,909
- what kind of junk are you on, Mike?
- Nothing.

965
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:28,848
I'm just sick.
Sick of all that bullshit, anyway.

966
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:30,855
You upset about the funeral?

967
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:34,925
I came back after everyone left.

968
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:39,394
I waited around a long time, and that's
when I must've started to get sick.

969
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,097
Everything after that is gone.

970
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,102
what do you mean?

971
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,967
I saw my mother's eyes...

972
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,005
...which is pretty weird,
because she's dead.

973
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,446
My mother's eyes watching me drown.

974
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,312
It was a pretty crazy dream.

975
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,526
why do you say it was a dream?

976
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,786
Look at my clothes, Mr. Burke.

977
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:10,898
- I must have fallen asleep in the dirt.
- come on, we'll get out of here.

978
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,534
- You can sleep in my guest room.
- I can drive.

979
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:16,694
Listen to your old teacher.
You're either sick or high.

980
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:20,501
So if you're not better in the morning,
I'll drive you to the clinic.

981
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,373
Susan.

982
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:26,070
could I speak to you
for a minute, please?

983
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:30,150
- I've said all I have to say...
- But I haven't.

984
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:35,150
- Please.
- I think we've had enough for one evening.

985
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,451
Mom, I'll be right in.

986
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:48,963
I'm not gonna stop writing the book,
but I can change the name of the town.

987
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:53,268
I could change the state. The town
was only meant to be a metaphor anyway.

988
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:58,444
- Then why choose Jerusalem's Lot?
- Because this is the town I know.

989
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,840
It's a town you think you know...

990
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,746
...and a town that thought it knew you.

991
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:16,956
He'll be gone in a day, Susan. You'll see.

992
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:18,929
Now that the truth is out.

993
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,679
Dud?

994
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,117
Hey, Floyd.

995
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:44,987
- where you been, gimp?
- I don't limp anymore, Floyd.

996
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,855
And why not?

997
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,826
Because I'm different.

998
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:53,666
You were always different, Dud.
where you going?

999
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,304
I'm going to see Ruth crockett.

1000
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,732
Do yourself a favor. Stay clear.

1001
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:04,106
clear of them all. Bitches ain't worth it.

1002
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,215
I need some food, Floyd.

1003
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:10,145
For Ruth.

1004
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:14,522
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, Dud.

1005
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:20,393
If you're pissed with anyone,
it should be Larry crockett.

1006
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,121
Mike and I always been good to you.

1007
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,163
Especially Mike.

1008
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,628
Dud?

1009
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:40,147
You seem a lot better now.

1010
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:44,110
Yeah, the fresh air
must've sobered me up.

1011
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,419
I have a sweatshirt for you,
and sweatpants.

1012
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,489
That door leads to the bathroom.

1013
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,391
Thanks.

1014
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,595
That...

1015
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,293
...bruise looks painful.

1016
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:05,907
oh, yeah.
You should've seen the other guy.

1017
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,677
well...

1018
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:11,743
...you should get it taken care of.

1019
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,280
- Good night, Mike.
- Good night.

1020
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,125
Ralphie?

1021
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,389
Ralphie, where have you been?

1022
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,396
Yes.

1023
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:37,665
Yes, of course you can come home.
Please come home, Ralphie.

1024
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,775
<i>Mike.</i>

1025
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,401
<i>Mike.</i>

1026
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:37,954
Hello?

1027
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,128
Thank you for coming.

1028
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,641
I'm surprised you called me.

1029
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:53,178
what you write
is the least of my worries.

1030
01:15:58,487 --> 01:15:59,852
well, is he alone?

1031
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:03,114
- He is now.
- Maybe it's an intruder.

1032
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,453
- Did you call the police?
- No.

1033
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,824
Not yet.

1034
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:12,431
- I want you to see the body first.
- The body?

1035
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:17,163
- You said he was acting strange.
- He's not moving.

1036
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,304
Did you go in there?

1037
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,107
I peeked in, briefly.

1038
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,044
was he dead?

1039
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,975
- I don't know.
- Matt.

1040
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:29,378
what the hell is going on here?
You didn't kill him, did you?

1041
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:32,611
No. of course not.

1042
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:40,759
Mike?

1043
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,993
Mike Ryerson?

1044
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,636
You see? Nothing.

1045
01:16:57,346 --> 01:17:01,112
Look at his chest. Loot at the bruise.

1046
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,725
- There's no bruise.
- I saw it. It has to be there.

1047
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:15,296
He might be G'd out
on some designer drug.

1048
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:21,430
call an ambulance, the police
and a lawyer, if you have one.

1049
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:25,539
Hang on, hang on.
Mike buried Danny Glick today.

1050
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:29,006
There was a bruise on his chest.
I saw it!

1051
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:34,015
I heard talking in this room. I heard him
open the window. I heard laughing.

1052
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:37,549
I should have come in,
but I was too scared.

1053
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:45,091
Your intruder would have to be
a fireman to climb up.

1054
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,785
Ben, I know what I heard.

1055
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:51,396
I wanted to tell you before
everyone starts calling me crazy.

1056
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,502
okay, let's get this done.

1057
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:07,003
Handsome corpse. You sure he's dead?

1058
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,541
Atypical lividity, but he's dead all right.

1059
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:14,355
- Sorry to drag you into this.
- Don't be.

1060
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:18,459
- I don't know why you did, though.
- lf I told you, you'd have me committed.

1061
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:23,496
Maybe we should move down the hall a bit.
could be some kind of contagious disease.

1062
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:28,802
Is it similar to what killed Danny Glick?
Acute anemia?

1063
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:33,504
we'll leave that for the lab coats,
but there's no immediate sign of foul play.

1064
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:36,075
As for that intruder you heard...

1065
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:39,680
- You have a 12-foot ladder in your garage?
- No.

1066
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:45,551
You heard Mr. Ryerson's voice
and some laughter.

1067
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,781
- could it have been his laughter?
- It sounded like a child.

1068
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:52,916
You said he slept here because
he was acting loopy and started a fight.

1069
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:56,996
- Yeah?
- Some people laugh when they're drunk.

1070
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:00,900
They'll run some toxicology tests
on his blood.

1071
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,333
How did you get involved in this,
Mr. Mears?

1072
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,063
Matt called me.

1073
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:09,537
close friends?

1074
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,577
Literary men.

1075
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:17,447
See, most people find a body,
and they call the police. You called a writer.

1076
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:22,247
<i>I should've pulled that trigger.</i>
<i>You're finished</i>, <i>Cody.</i>

1077
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,984
Banks don't open until nine, Royce.

1078
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,926
- Look, I'm with a dead body here, okay...
- <i>You're gonna be the dead body.</i>

1079
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,496
<i>My wife came to you professionally!</i>

1080
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,464
- <i>I'm calling the medical board!</i>
- Don't call the board.

1081
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,103
Don't call the board.

1082
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:39,729
That's not gonna help anybody.
I need time to shift some funds.

1083
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:42,035
I just bought a car.

1084
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:44,735
You'll have your 10 grand by tomorrow.

1085
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,341
You okay?

1086
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:53,016
Pupillary contraction. Gets me every time.

1087
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:06,195
- were you waiting for me?
- No, sir. Run along, Mark.

1088
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:18,212
Anything unusual?
A van parked along side the road?

1089
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:45,296
oh, Ben, I heard about Mike Ryerson.
what happened?

1090
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:48,408
- Nobody knows.
- Ann Norton called.

1091
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:51,137
She has some things to say
about the book.

1092
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:55,942
- I don't have to look for a new room, do I?
- No, no. You could write a chapter on me.

1093
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:57,778
Thanks.

1094
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,621
Ed, where were you all night?

1095
01:21:01,790 --> 01:21:05,317
Blowing off steam.
Hope I worried you sick.

1096
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:07,427
I've been thinking about us, Ed.

1097
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:10,565
Is that right? what have you
been thinking, Miss Prunier?

1098
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:13,064
weasel, got some beer,
if you give me a hand.

1099
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,930
Breakfast of champions.

1100
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:33,814
Parkins, I want my phone call!

1101
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:38,190
Let me out of here!

1102
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:42,492
- Let me out of here!
- Shut up!

1103
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,836
Do you think these bars will hold me,
Mears? I'll see you tonight!

1104
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:56,671
Yeah, I'm really scared!
why don't you bring your rubber gloves?!

1105
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,979
No wonder she broke up with you!

1106
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:04,680
If that's what you wear to a fight,
what do you wear to bed?!

1107
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:17,593
who do you think
was in the room with him?

1108
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,469
I have my suspicions.

1109
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:24,935
I'm holding back, lest peop...

1110
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,638
call me crazy. There's someone upstairs.

1111
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,811
You're sure?

1112
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:37,611
I know my house.
There's someone up there.

1113
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:40,652
You hear?

1114
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,349
call the police.

1115
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:47,120
- Matt.
- Not yet.

1116
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:51,163
Start talking. About anything.

1117
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:56,899
well, you won't get any argument from me.
I completely agree.

1118
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,006
You hope he gets run out of town?

1119
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,544
You're totally right. He can't be trusted.

1120
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:18,018
He did deceive you.
He deceived all of us.

1121
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:27,100
- and then they just turn out
to be someone completely different.

1122
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,314
Mr. Burke.

1123
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,418
Mr. Burke.

1124
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:24,622
Mike.

1125
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:38,464
- what happened to you?
- Look at me.

1126
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:43,240
Mr. Burke. Look at me.

1127
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:49,483
- I know why you invited me here.
- Go away, Mike.

1128
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:54,611
- I can feel the way you look at me.
- I revoke your invitation to this house.

1129
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:04,359
Mike, in the name of God Almighty...

1130
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:06,626
...leave.

1131
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:11,166
wouldn't it be a relief to touch me,
just once?

1132
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,237
Then I can touch you.

1133
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:23,482
- Look at me.
- You're dead, Mike!

1134
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:32,191
- what happened to me?
- You died, Mike. You died.

1135
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,658
You died yesterday.

1136
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:37,627
You're a monster, a nightmare...

1137
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:40,233
No. No, that can't be.

1138
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,165
Go away, Mike. Go away.

1139
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,205
No!

1140
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:55,544
Matt?

1141
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:57,207
Matt!

1142
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,887
No, no! No!

1143
01:26:03,458 --> 01:26:07,155
- Lights out.
- Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

1144
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:11,864
- what am I being charged with?
- Drunk and disorderly.

1145
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,565
Mears.

1146
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:22,742
oh, Mears.

1147
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:26,009
- You wanna finish this, Mears?
- Go to sleep...

1148
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,617
...before I charge you with assault.
- You're a coward, Mears.

1149
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:33,413
You'll never be a Bloody Pirate.

1150
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:36,189
what did you say?

1151
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:40,791
You'll never be a Bloody Pirate.

1152
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:44,454
You'll never be a Bloody Pirate.

1153
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:50,766
Marjorie...

1154
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:53,464
Ralph!

1155
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:05,377
Mark.

1156
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,985
open the window.

1157
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:12,692
come on, Mark. open the window.
