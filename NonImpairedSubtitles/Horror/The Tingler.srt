1
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,882
I am William Castle, the director of
the motion picture you're about to see.

2
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,382
I feel obligated to warn you...

3
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:29,221
...that some of the sensations,
some of the physical reactions...

4
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,489
...which the actors
on the screen will feel...

5
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,567
...will also be experienced for the
first time in motion picture history...

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,432
...by certain members of this audience.

7
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:43,837
I say "certain members" because
some people are more sensitive...

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,502
...to these mysterious
electronic impulses than others.

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,681
These unfortunate, sensitive people...

10
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:57,087
...will at times feel a strange,
tingling sensation.

11
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,450
Others will feel it less strongly.

12
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,389
But don't be alarmed.
You could protect yourself.

13
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:06,290
At any time you are conscious
of a tingling sensation...

14
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:10,765
...you may obtain immediate relief
by screaming.

15
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,430
Don't be embarrassed about opening your
mouth and letting rip with all you got.

16
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,304
Because the person in the seat
right next to you...

17
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,775
...will probably be screaming too.

18
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,675
And remember this:

19
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:27,846
A scream at the right time
may save your life.

20
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,931
- Who are you?
- I'm nobody.

21
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,503
- Unless you got business...
- I won't bother you.

22
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,004
You got to have a pass to come in here.

23
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,974
Will this do?

24
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,141
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was a relative.

25
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,147
- It's my wife's brother.
- Try not to faint.

26
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,944
I won't faint.

27
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,684
- I understand going to friend's funeral.
- We weren't "friends," exactly.

28
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,827
I had a pass
to the execution, and I mean...

29
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:55,527
- Does it always kill them in the chair?
- I've never heard of it failing.

30
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,329
Well, in the chair, does it hurt them?

31
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,606
Not if it's done properly.
At least, I don't think so.

32
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,799
Even a slight shock hurts.

33
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,535
Try putting an electrode soaked
in saline solution on your head...

34
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,649
...another strapped to your leg,
then slamming 2,000 volts between them.

35
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,216
If it hurts, let me know.

36
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,983
Well, if it works, then why this?

37
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,550
I've never found it to be necessary.

38
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,988
But it happens to be the law.

39
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,587
An autopsy must be performed
immediately after the execution.

40
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,400
Interesting.

41
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:34,537
This man's vertebrae are cracked.
They're nearly splintered in two.

42
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,208
Two thousand volts!

43
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,673
Electricity had nothing to do with this.

44
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,074
I've seen this phenomenon many times
in people who were badly frightened...

45
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,910
...just before they died.

46
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:50,553
There's a force in us that science
knows nothing about. The force of fear.

47
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,824
That it's strong enough to shatter
the spinal column, we know.

48
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,890
But what it is...

49
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,622
...what causes it to appear
and disappear, we don't know.

50
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,995
Some day I hope to find out.

51
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,364
Maybe it's what makes your spine
tingle when you're scared.

52
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,000
Exactly.

53
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,304
Tingle?

54
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,942
It can do a great deal more than that.

55
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,080
It's odd. I've been experimenting
with this force for years.

56
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,515
Never had a name for it until now.

57
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,716
Now I think I'll call it "The Tingler."

58
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,518
- You do all the autopsies out here?
- Most of them, and for the county too.

59
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,960
It ties in with
my experimental work in fear.

60
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,464
Many people die in fear.
I wonder how many die of fear.

61
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,331
You mean, being scared to death?

62
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,797
Not on the death certificate.

63
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,502
Fear causes tremendous
tensions in the body.

64
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:51,580
If you can't relieve them, why can't
they become strong enough to kill you?

65
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,318
Never thought of it that way.

66
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,425
I've thought of little else
for some years now.

67
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,790
That man's vertebrae are cracked.

68
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,762
Sensation of fear alone
can't have done that.

69
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,700
Something real and powerful
broke those bones.

70
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,910
And on the death certificate...

71
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,681
...I'll write down that death
was caused by heart failure...

72
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,182
...due to electrically induced shock.

73
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,927
I guess he deserved it, killing
those two women in cold blood like that.

74
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,061
What?

75
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:41,131
He killed two women. Right
down the street from where I live.

76
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,668
Looked for a while, though. They
couldn't find a clue, but they did.

77
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,201
I seldom know who they are
or what they did.

78
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,067
I suppose because I don't want to know.

79
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,347
Science is sometimes
frighteningly impersonal.

80
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,277
Being my wife's brother...

81
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,654
Well, you ready?

82
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:07,155
You wouldn't be able to give me
a ride into town, Doc?

83
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,092
I'm sure I'd be glad to, Mr...?

84
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,230
My name's Oliver Higgins.

85
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,491
Everybody calls me just OIlie.

86
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,496
Where do you live?

87
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,824
There aren't many theaters
like this left.

88
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,726
You'd be surprised how many
come to see these old pictures.

89
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,924
- Not just to make fun, either.
- Yours?

90
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,796
It belongs to my wife.

91
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,868
We run it together, though.

92
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,974
- Would you like a beer or coffee, Doc?
- Coffee'd be fine.

93
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:01,169
Good, I live right up there.
I'll check with the wife first.

94
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,555
I'm going upstairs
and make some coffee.

95
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,887
I'll open up later.

96
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,259
Well, shall we go, Doc?

97
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,624
It's kind of old-fashioned,
but she likes it this way.

98
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,336
- You like cream and sugar?
- No. Black, please.

99
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,028
Just the two of you run the whole show?

100
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,438
You'd be surprised
how much work it takes.

101
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,635
Just the cleaning up alone.

102
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,848
Mopping, sweeping, vacuuming
the seats and the runners.

103
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:15,484
Once a week, we go over everything.
We even do the ceiling.

104
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,521
We even do behind the screens
and under the seats.

105
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,054
- I tell you, it takes a lot of work.
- It sounds like it.

106
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,729
You know, you ought to
come sometime, Doc.

107
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,367
Some of the silents are just as good
as the movies they make nowadays.

108
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:33,130
Even with the sound and the color,
and the screens a block wide.

109
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,570
I'd like to see some of the old
Charlie Chaplin films again.

110
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,973
We show them once a year.
I'll let you know.

111
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,008
That's my wife.

112
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,480
Never mind. She'll come in here.

113
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,366
She has to wash her hands first.

114
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,597
Martha?

115
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,572
This is Doctor Warren Chapin.

116
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,721
She says she just finished
washing her hands.

117
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:28,360
She's deaf and dumb. She can read lips
if you talk straight to her.

118
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,461
How do you do, Mrs. Higgins?

119
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,167
She says to excuse her,
but she never shakes hands.

120
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,367
People's hands have germs, she says.

121
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,669
Tell her she's so right.

122
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,748
She can't make a sound
or hear a sound.

123
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,882
No vocal cords?

124
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:52,914
None.

125
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,352
She's a bug in this washing up.

126
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,051
Our bill for towels is
five bucks a week.

127
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,891
There you are, Doc.

128
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,859
Thank you.

129
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,634
I'm sorry.

130
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,142
That was a clumsy thing to do.

131
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,748
- It's my fault.
- No, it's nothing but a small cut.

132
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,936
Go down and get the bag
out of my car.

133
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,176
She always does this.
One drop of blood and out she goes.

134
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,784
It affects some people like that.

135
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,548
Did you notice how rigid she became?

136
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,419
She always does.

137
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,184
It's interesting.

138
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:13,463
Because she has no vocal cords, she
can't release fear vocally.

139
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,158
So they continue to mount,
until she can't endure it.

140
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,563
So she faints?

141
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:24,140
It isn't a faint as we know it.
It's more of a psychosomatic escape.

142
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,269
I never thought of that.

143
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:08,282
You go downstairs and open up.
I'll come downstairs in a minute.

144
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,329
It's time to open up the box office.

145
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,796
We'd better go down first. She won't
leave anybody alone with that safe.

146
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,994
Thanks for asking me up, OIlie.
I'm sorry I caused you all that trouble.

147
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,002
That's all right, no harm done.

148
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,074
Thanks for the ride home.
I'm sorry about...

149
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:35,270
Goodbye, Mrs. Higgins. I'm sorry
I caused all that trouble.

150
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:46,013
She says goodbye, and she hopes
your cut isn't serious.

151
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,653
No. No, it isn't.

152
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,425
Goodbye. Bye, Mrs. Higgins.

153
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,029
Goodbye, Doc.
Good luck with your experiment.

154
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,289
Thanks.

155
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,664
Hi, Lucy. Where's my devoted wife?

156
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,361
Where's David?

157
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,131
Tell me something, Warren.

158
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,642
What happened to those rules I learned
about what every young girl should do?

159
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,214
Like, keep your date waiting
for at least ten minutes.

160
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,353
And never let him know that she wonders
if he's ever going to show at all.

161
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,318
It's all my fault.

162
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,885
I sometimes...

163
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,392
...like right now, wish
he didn't work for you at all.

164
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,565
- That he was...
- A what? A Persian rug merchant?

165
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,734
That's much worse.

166
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,762
Just an ordinary eight-to-fiver
with a yen for picket fences.

167
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,135
And waste one of the best
minds in pathology?

168
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,741
Not really.

169
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,803
I love David just the way he is.

170
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,241
I don't even want to change him.

171
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,385
Golly, is that abnormal?

172
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,151
Refreshing.

173
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,583
Isabel went out about an hour ago.

174
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,999
What are we going to do about her?

175
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,733
- She's simply ruining her life.
- It's not her fault.

176
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,809
A husband who spends
all his time in the laboratory.

177
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,945
And hates cocktails and parties,
and falls asleep at the opera.

178
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,309
She's out almost every night now.

179
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,919
And with men who aren't very nice.

180
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,414
I'm ashamed of my sister.

181
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,924
Lucy, as soon as David and I
finish this experiment...

182
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,327
...I'll have more time for her.
He'll have more for you.

183
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,261
I'd wait for Dave forever if I have to.

184
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,532
But why do I have to, Warren?

185
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,973
Does being someone's guardian
give you the right to rule them?

186
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,649
You've had another battle with Isabel?

187
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,613
No. The same one.

188
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,549
I'm too young. David's too poor.

189
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,053
If I do anything
she doesn't approve of...

190
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,191
...she won't give me
my share of the money.

191
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,950
I'll talk to her.

192
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,255
What good will that do?

193
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,931
Who knows?

194
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,566
- Have you had any dinner?
- Not yet.

195
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,297
- I'll fix you something.
- No, look. I'm not really hungry.

196
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,441
Warren, you've got to eat.

197
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,084
Cut my head off.

198
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,784
Boil me in oil.

199
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,130
Young man?

200
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,098
What do you mean,
keeping this beautiful girl waiting?

201
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,231
You say, "Go get a cat."

202
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,704
You ever chase a cat down an alley?
I'm lucky to be alive.

203
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,941
Did you get one?

204
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,676
A big black brute.

205
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,006
Trouble is, I don't think
we can scare him.

206
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,943
Well, what are you two up to now?
Black cats in dark alleys?

207
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,246
Fear has the same effect on all animals.

208
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,013
You mean I'm an animal?

209
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,851
Better-Iooking than most,
and can't run as fast.

210
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,057
I hope.

211
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,259
- I got that prescription for you.
- Good.

212
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,229
From the articles I read,
it's a very interesting drug.

213
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,766
So is nitroglycerin.

214
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,130
Where is that all-for-science attitude?

215
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,671
I left it in my other suit.
Don't fool with that stuff alone.

216
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,070
It can produce pretty weird effects.

217
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,736
Speaking of which, I saw an interesting
reaction this afternoon.

218
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:07,044
There's this deaf-mute. She can't utter
a sound, and she has a blood trauma.

219
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,518
I cut my hand on a broken saucer,
and she went into total shock.

220
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,783
I've never seen anyone so terrified...

221
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,518
...or so unable to release
her fear tensions.

222
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,060
What happened?

223
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,427
Her husband thinks she faints,
but it isn't a true faint at all.

224
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,158
It's much more serious.

225
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,634
Her unreleased tensions grow so great...

226
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,707
...that she goes into
psychosomatic blackout.

227
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,069
What if she didn't?

228
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,109
That's an interesting question.

229
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,442
If we get her to a fluoroscope,
and show her some blood...

230
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,912
Please!

231
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,012
We're going to dinner!

232
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,512
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,823
All right, you kids get out of here.

234
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,123
We'll go, if you stay
out of the lab tonight.

235
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,931
The further we go, the surer I am
that what we're looking for...

236
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,433
...is something tangible. Real.

237
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,863
Anything that can exert such tremendous
pressure on the spinal column...

238
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:06,238
...must be something you can see,
touch, hold in your hand.

239
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,675
It may exist for only a fraction
of a second, but...

240
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,285
...there's something in every frightened
person that's as solid as steel.

241
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,486
And probably stronger.

242
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,215
I think I've found a name for it.
The Tingler. You like it?

243
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,983
The Tingler? Why not?

244
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,721
Since we don't know what it is yet,
we can't give it a Latin name.

245
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:26,920
Tingler.

246
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,133
It must cover almost
the entire backbone.

247
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,395
The only way we'll ever isolate it
is to catch someone...

248
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,132
...at the instant of complete terror.
Not before, not after.

249
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,331
David.

250
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,969
You'll be too weak.

251
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,010
Weak?

252
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,080
From starvation.

253
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,644
Have fun. And David...

254
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,322
I know. I know.

255
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,721
Don't keep him out late. He has
a hard day in the lab tomorrow.

256
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,988
- Good night, Warren.
- Good night.

257
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,021
Good evening.

258
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,128
I wish you wouldn't
stand around in the dark.

259
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,923
Feet hurt?

260
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,825
As a matter of fact, they do.

261
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,727
Not from running.

262
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,166
That was a charming
little scene out there.

263
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,639
Wasn't it?

264
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,913
- Good night.
- Love in bloom, right on the sidewalk.

265
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,208
Rather shopworn, though, isn't it?

266
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,517
Don't tell me you've abandoned corpses
for peeping out of windows.

267
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:09,183
If there was anything honest about
your behavior, I might feel differently.

268
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,359
You're just playing the field,
and vice versa.

269
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,634
You know, I think I'll have
a nightcap with amateur psychiatry.

270
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,504
Jealousy doesn't look well
on your tie, dear.

271
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,569
There's no jealousy involved.

272
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,015
You know, Warren, you've lost contact
with living people.

273
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:38,053
Nobody means anything to you
anymore, unless they're dead.

274
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,082
And you can root around in them
with your sharp little knives.

275
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,458
There's a word for you.

276
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,528
There's several for you.

277
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,095
Lucy's very upset. So is Dave.
And for that matter, so am I.

278
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,291
Good.

279
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,903
The only way Dave Morris will marry
my sister is over my dead body.

280
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,839
Unconventional, but not impossible.

281
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,047
They're nice kids. They're in love.

282
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,082
They're old enough and
wise enough to make a go of a marriage.

283
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,276
Nice kids! Love!

284
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,421
Morris is another you. A scientist...

285
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,717
...who thinks the world is in his lab.

286
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,558
I won't let my sister
sacrifice herself the way I did.

287
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,258
You may have to.

288
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,293
What do you mean?

289
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,091
You suggested a way.

290
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,302
I'm tired and I'm sleepy.

291
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,332
- Good night.
- Stay awake a little longer.

292
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,444
The next time you sleep,
it may be forever.

293
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,877
- Is this the hour for melodrama?
- Depends on your definition.

294
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,550
Sit down. Let's have a chat.

295
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,312
- You've nothing to say I want to hear.
- Sit down anyway!

296
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:44,611
Go on!

297
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,917
Now you won't have so far to go.

298
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:55,032
I'd like to make two suggestions.
First, leave Lucy and Dave alone.

299
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,667
You're a shrewd and evil woman,
adept at twisting people's minds.

300
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,839
Leave them alone. Please.

301
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,942
Next, I suggest that you give
Lucy half of the money you've got.

302
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,877
So Dave can continue in pathology,
without the obstacle of having no money.

303
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,277
I know a wonderful psychiatrist with
a divine straitjacket...

304
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,615
...just your size.

305
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,291
Are you forgetting anything?

306
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,091
- Probably.
- That's the understatement of the year.

307
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,288
Now remember this:
Everything you've got, I paid for!

308
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,595
Your lab, all that expensive junk,
Morris' wages, your car, this house!

309
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,633
And remember!

310
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:37,366
All I have to do to put you and Morris
into the street is to turn the key.

311
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,438
On the goodie box?
Where did the goodies come from?

312
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,169
My father.

313
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:46,573
Nice man too.
Pity he died so suddenly.

314
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:51,113
I had nothing to do with
my father's death, and you know it.

315
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,781
- Like me to prove it isn't nonsense?
- You can't prove anything.

316
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,224
- There's nothing to prove.
- You wouldn't like me to try?

317
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,990
And you should
remember this, darling.

318
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,895
Organic poisons,
like old soldiers, never die.

319
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,627
They just lie smoldering in the grave.

320
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,640
And I'm not bad at autopsies.

321
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,544
You're crazy! You really are.

322
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:19,410
Isn't everyone?
Now walk straight ahead.

323
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,607
Go on.

324
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,452
What are you going to do?

325
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:28,888
We'll have a little chat. What I do
next is entirely up to you, so walk.

326
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,928
Where are you taking me?

327
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:39,570
It'll be easier to "rearrange" things
in the laboratory.

328
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,844
You should come in here
more often, dear.

329
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,682
Let's stop all this childish behavior.

330
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,057
- A gun is so out of character.
- Isn't it? Over there.

331
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,255
- Warren, stop it!
- Over there!

332
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,128
Have you gone completely
out of your mind?

333
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,370
Not at all.
You see, you're a good teacher.

334
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,641
You taught me how to get
what I want, no matter who gets hurt.

335
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,434
- What do you mean by that?
- Just this:

336
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,713
Ever since you've been Lucy's guardian,
you've tried to ruin her life.

337
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,784
You've greedily kept what was hers.
Now I'm giving you a choice.

338
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:33,083
Either you give Lucy half of all
the money you got and leave her alone...

339
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,289
...or you commit suicide right now.

340
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,987
Suicide? You mean murder.

341
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,429
When I finish rearranging things,
it'll look like suicide.

342
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,125
Now make up your mind.

343
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,033
We want to be through with this
before Lucy comes home.

344
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,267
I won't give that child anything,
so put away that silly pistol!

345
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:56,106
This "silly" pistol
can make a hole in you...

346
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,680
...the size of a medium grapefruit.

347
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,643
I'll call the police!

348
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,827
You're not hurt, dear.
It was just a blank cartridge.

349
00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:00,061
Thanks for helping with the experiment.
You played your part excellently.

350
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,497
I see.

351
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,834
Sharing in your husband's work
and all that, you know.

352
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,838
Kitty.

353
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,707
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

354
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,813
I was going to use this cat.
But you made a much better subject.

355
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,887
Have you two met?
In the same alley, perhaps?

356
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,619
When my turn comes, and it will come...

357
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,890
...it won't be an experiment.

358
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,575
Howdy, boss!

359
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,444
I've got something to show you.

360
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,913
Wait.
I brought a dog.

361
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,751
A dog? What for?

362
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:56,183
You say, "Get a cat." I got it,
You say, "Get a dog." I get a dog.

363
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,326
We don't need him.

364
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,230
"A" for effort.

365
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,561
I wouldn't be surprised if in a fair
fight that cat'd whip this dog.

366
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,170
- What do you want to show me?
- You've never seen anything like this.

367
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,150
See anything unusual?

368
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,922
What's this?

369
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,459
You tell me.

370
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,792
I don't know. But it's
stronger and denser than bone.

371
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,701
I'm showing you these
negatives in reverse order...

372
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,236
...on purpose.

373
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,008
Look at that!

374
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,202
Wait.

375
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,051
The Tingler.

376
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,751
It must be.

377
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,663
Until we get a specimen of it,
we can't be sure.

378
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,897
I can't see any bone structure.

379
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,038
- It must be solid matter.
- That's what I thought.

380
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,236
How'd you get this picture? Who is it?

381
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,639
- It doesn't matter how or who.
- Isabel?

382
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,676
I said it doesn't matter.

383
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,780
- I'm sorry, Warren.
- That's all right.

384
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,413
Let's review our progress so far.

385
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,380
What do we know about The Tingler?

386
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,923
What do we think we know,
and what've we got to find out?

387
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,493
First, we know that it exists.

388
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,722
If roentgen rays can't penetrate it,
we know it's solid.

389
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,198
We know that fear energizes it,
gives it strength.

390
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,261
That's about all we know.

391
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,066
Except that it exists
in every human being.

392
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,038
And that it's extremely powerful.

393
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,108
What do we think we know?

394
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,413
That fear causes The Tingler
to spread along the spinal column.

395
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,848
And with those arm-like things,
between the vertebrae...

396
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,181
...forces it to become arched and rigid.

397
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,187
And you believe that screaming...

398
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:11,385
...or any sound the human in fear
can make, paralyzes it?

399
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:16,056
At least screaming seems to stop it
from bending the spinal column.

400
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:20,203
Screaming may dissolve it,
or if it's a living organism, kill it.

401
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,703
And these are things
we have to find out.

402
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,808
- What do you think it's made of?
- I don't know.

403
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,605
But I'd guess sinews
of some very powerful material.

404
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,415
You said, "living organism."

405
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,710
Could The Tingler be alive?

406
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,945
A separate and living thing
inside our bodies?

407
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,316
Why not?

408
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,458
You know, of course, that after death...

409
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,151
...many things continue to live
in the body.

410
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,694
Fingernails grow.

411
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,766
So does hair, and the formation
of calcium in the bones continues.

412
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:55,463
Life is not merely a matter
of breathing and a beating heart.

413
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,370
- We've come a long way.
- We got a long way to go.

414
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,842
Perhaps. And perhaps not.

415
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,275
We now know that
at the peak of terror...

416
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,420
...The Tingler is a solid mass extending
from the coccyx to the cervicals.

417
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:13,613
If one could stand the pain
without screaming...

418
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,124
...or otherwise releasing their tension
until they died...

419
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,559
...an autopsy would give us a Tingler
we could work with.

420
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:24,360
The advancement of human knowledge
is fine, but dying for it...

421
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,763
If that's your attitude...

422
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,771
...we'll have to find someone
else who's willing to die for science.

423
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,966
And eventually we will.

424
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:54,557
I'm worried, David. Isabel has been
sweet to me all day.

425
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,462
Me too. At least she said good morning.

426
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:58,657
Even smiled.

427
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,998
So look out.
The roof is going to fall in.

428
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,668
- Coffee, Warren?
- No, thanks.

429
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,004
I've been thinking...
Yes, I'd love a cup of coffee.

430
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,270
Thank you.

431
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,469
So?

432
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,351
I've been trying to frighten myself,
but nothing works.

433
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,012
It isn't that I'm too intelligent.
Just too grown up.

434
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,055
Kids can scare themselves...

435
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,162
...by lying in the dark and making
ghosts out of chairs, but we can't.

436
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:31,701
The only way I can frighten myself
is to make it real.

437
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,905
Jump out of a window, get run over
by a car, go out and drown.

438
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,003
After those x-rays,
we know The Tingler exists.

439
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,373
Why do you have to scare yourself?

440
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,345
I want to personally sense
the power of The Tingler...

441
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,283
...in a genuine fear situation.

442
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,393
In a controlled experiment,
with my own fear...

443
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,791
...perhaps I can find out
all the things we have to know.

444
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:02,792
Only nothing scares me.

445
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,962
Exactly. Boo!

446
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,537
Well, back to the salt mines.

447
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,368
Why don't you take the night off?

448
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,514
Go to a movie. You and Lucy.

449
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,909
I'll be in later.

450
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,744
I mean it. Take the night off.

451
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,511
Okay, boss. The night off.

452
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,249
Good night.

453
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,493
This is not good.

454
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,937
- He's leaving us out of something.
- But what? There's nothing in the lab.

455
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,939
That drug you brought...

456
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,169
It's not a drug. It's an acid.

457
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,406
I wonder...

458
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,524
Locked.

459
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,890
He never did that before.

460
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,628
Can you see anything?

461
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,170
He's locking the other door.

462
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,468
What's he doing now?

463
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,940
He's saying something
to the tape recorder.

464
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,808
Average injection: 50 micromilligrams.

465
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,481
Fifty.

466
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:03,620
I'm making it 100 micromilligrams
in solution.

467
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,975
What's happening now?

468
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,245
Warren wanted to do this.

469
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,084
Let's hope he's accomplishing
something important.

470
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,782
What's he doing now?

471
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,668
Time: 8:03.
Sharp stinging sensation.

472
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,765
Now he's sitting down.

473
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,400
- Is he all right?
- As far as I can tell.

474
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,382
Definite blurring of vision now...

475
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,591
...at 8:11.

476
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,024
Emotionally, I feel nothing abnormal.

477
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,958
What does that stuff do to you?

478
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,632
For one thing, nightmares.

479
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:30,568
You're wide-awake.
But you're having nightmares.

480
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,875
Blurring of vision...

481
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,746
...has been replaced
by distinct rocking...

482
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,182
...and tilting sensation.

483
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:48,183
I don't seem to be tilting,
but the room is...

484
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,091
...from side to side.

485
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,719
Time...

486
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,799
...8:13.

487
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,368
Emotionally, I begin to feel
somewhat apprehensive.

488
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,537
Probably normal, however.

489
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,824
The room is closing in on me.

490
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,831
He's talking again.

491
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,697
I wish I could hear.

492
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,496
Is he all right?

493
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,503
Something is scaring him.

494
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,739
The room is closing in on me.

495
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,112
You've got to make it stop.

496
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,143
The walls!

497
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,481
The walls!

498
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,759
Can't we help him?

499
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,196
No, we can't, Lucy.

500
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,844
Break the door. He may be suffering.
That drug may be hurting him.

501
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,172
He's only suffering in his mind.
Nothing is hurting him.

502
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,516
It may hurt his mind.

503
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,083
There's nothing we can do
to help him now.

504
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,345
That acid must wear off naturally.

505
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:28,958
If I try to stop it or even minimize it
with an antidote, I might kill him.

506
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,724
I got to get out of here!

507
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,899
No breath!

508
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,827
No air!

509
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,731
I can't breathe!

510
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,635
The window. It won't open!

511
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,947
It's locked. Barred!

512
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,910
Somebody's got to help me!

513
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,462
- Isn't there another key?
- Maybe. I'll go look.

514
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,633
Mustn't scream.

515
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,169
I mustn't scream!

516
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,350
I broke down and screamed, didn't I?

517
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,356
I couldn't help it, Dave.

518
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,154
Things were pretty foggy...

519
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,330
...but I remember thinking
that I mustn't scream.

520
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:44,929
But the pain and the fear
were so great.

521
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:50,033
I don't think anybody could keep from
screaming if they were really terrified.

522
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,769
Unless...

523
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,243
Unless what?

524
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,545
Just an idle idea.

525
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,213
I'd better be on my way.
Good night, kids.

526
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,125
Unless what, Dave?

527
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,388
Suppose a person could not
possibly scream?

528
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,197
Well, everybody can scream.

529
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,098
A deaf-mute can't scream.

530
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,778
- Evening, Doc.
- OIlie.

531
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,472
Come to see the show?

532
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,778
Not tonight. I just dropped by
to see how you were doing.

533
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,181
Well, pretty good.

534
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,755
- How's your experiment?
- It's making progress.

535
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,689
In fact, I dropped by
because I was worried about your wife.

536
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,728
A shock like that can have
pretty bad after-effects.

537
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,966
I've been a little worried
about her too.

538
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,602
She hasn't eaten a thing
and she can't sleep.

539
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:58,138
Ever since she saw that blood, she just
roams around the theater all night.

540
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,533
Is she here now?

541
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,906
She's upstairs. She won't even
tend the box office anymore.

542
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:06,879
Why don't I have a look at her?
It may be a simple case of nerves.

543
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,750
- I'd appreciate it.
- What drugstore do you use?

544
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,946
The Cut-Rate around the corner.

545
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,156
Good evening, Mrs. Higgins.

546
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,729
OIlie told me to come up.
He said you weren't...

547
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,107
OIlie told me to come up and see you.

548
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,975
He said you weren't feeling well.

549
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,718
Would you like me to check you over?

550
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:37,101
All you need is sleep and rest.

551
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:41,869
Now I'm going to give you a shot.
To relax you.

552
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:46,809
And then I'm going to give OIlie
a prescription for some barbiturates.

553
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,686
Sleeping pills. They won't hurt you.

554
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:52,448
All right?

555
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,182
All you need is rest and sleep.

556
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:43,299
How much? How about
a couple of passes for your theater?

557
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:51,136
Now you just go to sleep,
and you'll be as fit as a fiddle.

558
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,008
Lie down.

559
00:45:58,689 --> 00:45:59,849
Good night.

560
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,038
How is she, Doc?

561
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:30,448
It's just nerves.
I gave her a shot to relax her.

562
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:34,750
If she should wake up,
give her these pills.

563
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,284
- How long will she sleep?
- Now?

564
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,289
The shot should wear off
in two or three hours.

565
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:45,093
Have her take these pills.
She needs a lot of sleep.

566
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,031
I'll go get this filled.

567
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,569
I have time to have a beer, don't I?

568
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,098
Sure.

569
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,806
Join me? With her sick,
I certainly need one.

570
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,980
I'd like to very much.
But I have some work to finish.

571
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,073
Thanks, Doc.
And good night.

572
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,497
Home so soon?

573
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,170
Did you hear what the husband
said to the wife?

574
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,904
This another one of your oblique jokes?

575
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:02,946
Why does the back door slam
every time I come in the front door?

576
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,053
Because he was a jealous husband?

577
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:08,183
Nothing like a good
two-fisted drinker, right?

578
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,360
Are you sure I didn't
mix them for you, dear?

579
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,324
You look tired.

580
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,371
It's a pity I'm not the type
for gold tie clips.

581
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,475
But you are, Warren. Exactly.

582
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:38,852
Doc! Doc, my wife!

583
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:40,784
I know it's late, but my wife...

584
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,084
Take it easy. What's the trouble?

585
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,126
She's sick. Maybe dead by now.
It's terrible.

586
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,455
I'll get my bag.

587
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,098
I brought her here
because you treated her.

588
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,358
I tried to phone you.

589
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,162
Let's bring her around to the lab door.

590
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,567
Just a couple of beers.
When I got home, there she was.

591
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,106
You suppose...

592
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,510
Could it be that shot you gave her?

593
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,111
Well, hardly.

594
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,344
I found her lying on the bathroom floor.

595
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,883
She was so cold,
I thought she was dead.

596
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,213
When I picked her up, she moved.

597
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,796
OIlie, your wife is dead.

598
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,595
I'm very sorry.

599
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:34,136
I guess I wasn't
much of a husband to her.

600
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,744
There's no way I can make up for it.

601
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,913
OIlie, I'm really sorry.

602
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,414
Do you feel like helping me
with some details?

603
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,214
I feel okay.

604
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,919
What do you want to know?

605
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,624
Tell me as closely as you can...

606
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,596
...what time you found her,
and the circumstances.

607
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,362
It must have been
about one o'clock, Doc.

608
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,905
When you left, I went to have a beer.
When I came home, I just went in.

609
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:08,043
There she was,
lying on the bathroom floor.

610
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,372
- Age?
- She's 46.

611
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,575
Was there any sign of a struggle?

612
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:16,682
There was nothing. She was
just lying on the bathroom floor.

613
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:19,582
There wasn't anything unusual
about the room at all?

614
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,916
No. Just the way it always is.

615
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:27,687
From her expression, something must
have terrified her just before she died.

616
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,166
You haven't any idea what it was?

617
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,733
Everything was locked.
There was no sign of anyone there.

618
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,339
My God, she's alive!

619
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:12,705
She's not alive.

620
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,538
Something frightened her to death.

621
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,481
She's been dead for over an hour.

622
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:23,150
She moved.

623
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,156
May I find out why?

624
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,292
Sure, Doc, sure. Anything you want.

625
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,672
Just sit over there.

626
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,853
The Tingler!

627
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,260
Give me that glass tank.

628
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:19,224
- What happened?
- It attacked him.

629
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:20,623
That thing?

630
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,730
How strong is it, Doc?

631
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:26,197
Strong enough to kill a man,
easily and quickly.

632
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,241
- What made it let go?
- My screaming, I think.

633
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,237
Must have been.

634
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,744
Your wife is...

635
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,351
She's dead.

636
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,955
Are you badly hurt, Warren?

637
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,959
Good night. I'm sorry about your wife.

638
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:09,008
Is there anything I can do
for your arm, dear?

639
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,076
No, thank you.

640
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,633
Thank you, OIlie.

641
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,972
We'd better call a funeral parlor.

642
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,443
No, not in the middle of the night.

643
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:48,481
Couldn't I just take her home
and call in the morning?

644
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,949
It's easier that way.
They'll just come...

645
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,021
It might take quite a long while.
It's so late.

646
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:55,918
You'd have to wait up.

647
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:00,553
- I'd rather take her myself.
- All right.

648
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,561
- Can you manage?
- I can manage.

649
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,730
You'd better notify the police
right away.

650
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,102
I will.

651
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,581
Has he gone?

652
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,114
This is very important to you,
isn't it, Warren?

653
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,716
Yes, very.

654
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,427
You've worked so long to find it.

655
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,856
Let's celebrate, shall we?

656
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:42,266
Let's celebrate finding
The Tingler. And me.

657
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:44,662
You?

658
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:48,610
I've been a bad and foolish wife.

659
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:52,849
All this time I've been
jealous of your work.

660
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,716
All this time I've been
jealous of your work.

661
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,145
How silly can you get?

662
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,982
- Scotch?
- Yes, I think so.

663
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,181
Thanks.

664
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,093
Here you are.

665
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,593
I'd rather have
the other glass, darling.

666
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:12,825
Why?

667
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:14,900
More booze.

668
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,436
They're both exactly the same.

669
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:20,298
You're so amusing.

670
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,906
And so trusting.

671
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:24,802
Thanks.

672
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,874
Here's to The Tingler...

673
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,484
...and your new wife.

674
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,756
I hope the new wife doesn't turn out
to be as dangerous as The Tingler.

675
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,691
One thing that's so nice about you...

676
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,491
...I can always count on you.

677
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:46,957
To do what?

678
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,661
The right thing.

679
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,598
Now, about this new wife...

680
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,808
First, about The Tingler.

681
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,105
Is it really so dangerous?

682
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,281
You know...

683
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,648
...I felt as though my arm were
in one of those hydraulic presses.

684
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,987
Tremendous power.

685
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,761
What are you going to do with it?

686
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,597
Probably for my old wife.

687
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,068
That you, Doc?

688
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,478
I just called to let you know
everything's all right.

689
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,945
You really didn't have to bother.

690
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:37,280
I left her...

691
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:41,015
Well, I mean...
She's at the funeral parlor.

692
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:44,818
I called the police.
They said let it go till morning.

693
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,552
Nothing affects it.
You can't destroy the thing.

694
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,555
Doctors will be amazed
when they see The Tingler.

695
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,387
They're not going to see it.

696
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,825
Aren't you taking it to the convention?

697
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:12,193
You'll write about it
in the journals.

698
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:15,766
There's not going to be anything
in the journals about it.

699
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,933
After all this work!
What are you going to do?

700
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:21,770
To break the laws of nature
is always dangerous...

701
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:25,205
...and we've violated
some basic principles.

702
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,314
We had to. But now we'll stop.

703
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,609
But, Warren, you can't just...

704
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,479
Hear me out.

705
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:35,248
That The Tingler exists
in every human being we now know.

706
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,456
Look at that.
It's an ugly and dangerous thing.

707
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,289
Ugly because it's
the creation of man's fear.

708
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:45,695
Dangerous because
a frightened man is dangerous.

709
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:50,395
We can't destroy it, because we've
removed it from its natural place.

710
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:52,233
Then what can we do?

711
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,043
Call OIlie.

712
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:58,809
Ask him the name of the funeral parlor
where he left his wife.

713
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:02,013
We can only hope, and try.

714
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:07,149
Fear made that Tingler grow
from microscopic size to this.

715
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,618
We can only hope...

716
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:12,783
...when it goes back where it came from,
it'll also go back to a thing...

717
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:17,125
...infinitely small. Even die.

718
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:21,396
Because its creator is dead.
All fear gone.

719
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,599
OIlie doesn't answer.

720
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,775
Then call the police or the coroner.
They'll know.

721
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,706
- Isabel's gone.
- Isabel is always gone.

722
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,813
- I mean she's left.
- Give me the police department.

723
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,848
- She's taken her clothes.
- I want to check on a death.

724
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,286
Well, I can only hope
she'll be happier.

725
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,950
They have no report of her death.

726
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,788
But they must have!
OIlie called me...

727
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:49,191
I wonder.

728
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,395
Call OIlie again.

729
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,835
Call him till he answers.

730
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:59,633
And when he does, tell him
not to do anything foolish.

731
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,704
That I'll try to help him.

732
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,994
- What did you do with her?
- I took her to the funeral home.

733
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,069
Like I told you on the phone,
but you hung up on me.

734
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,230
- Where is she?
- I keep telling you, Doc.

735
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:07,874
What's in there?

736
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:11,979
Just my things. I'm moving out.
It's too gloomy here.

737
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:17,775
You killed her.

738
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,181
No, I didn't.

739
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:22,949
Your wife was frightened to death
with this.

740
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,759
And this.

741
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:26,526
What did you do with her?

742
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,594
- I keep telling...
- You're lying!

743
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,147
You don't know how it was with her.

744
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:54,311
She would've killed me if she could've.
She tried to lots of times.

745
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,081
You don't know how it was.

746
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,556
I know exactly how it was.

747
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,312
What are you going to do?

748
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,149
First, I'm going to put The Tingler
back where it came from.

749
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,655
So that if it can die, it will.

750
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,289
And then I'll call the police.

751
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,972
It broke out of the box!

752
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:53,946
What's that?

753
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,215
It's just a loose board.
I've been meaning to fix it.

754
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:01,088
What's below this?

755
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,558
The theater!

756
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:05,452
The theater!

757
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,663
The Tingler is in the theater!

758
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,664
I'll warn the audience.

759
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,437
No, you'd start a panic.

760
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,268
We've got to be quiet and careful.

761
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,301
But we've got to find it.

762
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:57,124
It must be in here somewhere.
Let's look down the other aisle.

763
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:46,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no cause for alarm.

764
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,678
A young lady has fainted.

765
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:52,411
She is being attended to
by a doctor, and is quite all right.

766
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,919
So please remain seated.

767
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,421
The movie will begin again right away.

768
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:01,221
I repeat,
there is no cause for alarm.

769
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:44,900
- Must have been about here.
- No, it's further down.

770
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:49,335
Why can't we see it?

771
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:40,353
Ladies and gentlemen,
please do not panic!

772
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:43,793
But scream! Scream for your lives!

773
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,990
The Tingler is loose in this theater!

774
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:49,068
And if you don't scream,
it may kill you!

775
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,499
Scream!

776
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:51,866
Scream!

777
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:56,172
Keep screaming! Scream for your life!

778
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,637
It's here! It's over here!

779
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,212
Help! Help!

780
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,813
- Look out, it's under the stage!
- Ladies and gentlemen.

781
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:07,284
The Tingler has been paralyzed
by your screaming.

782
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:09,923
There is no more danger.

783
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:14,061
We will now resume
the showing of the movie.

784
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,262
The projection booth, quick!

785
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:29,639
Are you all right?

786
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:32,006
- Where is it?
- Right there.

787
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:36,076
- You must have screamed just in time.
- I guess so.

788
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:17,087
All right, no more stalling.

789
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:22,625
Don't open that film can
until I tell you.

790
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:24,594
And then you'll have to help me.

791
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,138
I'm sorry now I did what I did, Doc.

792
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:34,539
You gave me the idea.

793
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:40,846
Just because poison happens to exist
is no excuse to commit murder with it.

794
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,914
I'm not blaming you.

795
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:47,782
But I knew she couldn't scream,
and about The Tingler and all.

796
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:53,324
Give me The Tingler now.

797
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,073
Come on. Give it to me.

798
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:14,948
It isn't as though I'd shot her or
taken a knife and stabbed her, is it?

799
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,411
If you kill anybody deliberately,
it's murder.

800
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,349
No matter how you do it.

801
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:26,291
I guess they'll probably
electrocute me, won't they?

802
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:29,326
I'm neither judge nor jury.

803
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:34,630
This time you're going
to the police with me.

804
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,971
You're wrong. You're going by yourself.

805
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,809
Look, all I have to do
is go downstairs and call the police.

806
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,674
It won't do you any good.

807
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:51,946
Goodbye.

808
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:11,563
Ladies and gentlemen,
just a word of warning.

809
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:15,793
If any of you are not convinced
that you have a Tingler of your own...

810
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:20,737
...the next time you're
frightened in the dark, don't scream.
