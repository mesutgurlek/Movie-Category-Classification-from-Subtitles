A day filled with hope

Open your heart to happiness

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,500

C'mon! Stop it!


37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,600
And look up at the big, blue sky

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
And look up at the big, blue sky

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,670
Listen to the voice on the radio

Hey, are you all right?


41
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,240
Listen to the voice on the radio

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,010

50
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,580

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,620

One! Two! Three! Let's go!

56
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,890
I wonder if this dog was owned by
a single working girl or something?

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,450
They Aren't Human

58
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,170
What's this?

59
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,800
It's displaying some text.

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,740
Your...

61
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,710
"Your lives are now over, you bastards.

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,380

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,750

What the hell is that?

90
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,680
Is this some kind of game?

91
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,040
Is it going to let us out?

92
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,390
Awesome!

93
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,480
These look like the real deal!
They're heavy too!

94
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,760
There's a man inside!

95
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,130
I guess you could call him a bubble boy!

96
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,290
Why are you clinging to him?

97
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,660
It's probably a fake!

98
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,600
For a fake, it looks pretty realistic.

99
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,500
Ouch.

Isn't this kinda cool?

00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,590
Try it on.

What's with this? It doesn't fire!

112
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,640
Bang!

113
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,280
What do you think you're doing?

114
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,710
Get off it! Nothing happened.

115
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,680
What's this? It's like an X-ray!

116
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,310
Hey!

117

Hey!

120
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,840
What do we do now? Everyone's vanished, Kei.

121
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,040
What? I'm vanishing too?

122
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,750
Wait!

123
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,480
I'm outside.

124
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,160
Damn it!

125
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,360
Oh, yeah! Do I still have time?

126
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,190

Come on, come on!

128
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,770
Damn, this is tight...

129
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,710
I can't get it on!

130
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,850
It's Kei.

131
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,980
Not good!

132
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,820
Got it!

133
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,560
I got it just in time.

134
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,760
What the hell are you doing butt-naked?

135
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,300
Kei...

136
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,590
It's not what you think!

137
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,930
Butter Dog!

138
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,140
Are you all right?

139
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,650
Yeah...

140
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,980
Oh, man!

141
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,630
This is so embarrassing!
This really is cosplay.

142
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey, which line was that again?

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,090
Well, for now, let's look for
the nearest train station.

144
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,030
Why is she following him?
I ran to her rescue too, you know.

145
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,910
Maybe now I can get back
in the political arena.

146
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,180
If so, I've still got a chance.

147
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,550
A chance to mop the floor with
that cheeky Prime Minister.

148
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,480
Aw, man, I need some action...
Maybe I'll hit that soap.

149
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,760
Too bad these aren't real guns.

150
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,060
I swear I'm gonna fuck that girl
before I leave here.

151
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,700
I'm glad we get to go home.

152
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,230
I've got to grade those tests tonight.

153
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,370
Let me let you in on a little secret.

154
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,510
There are criminal aliens living here on Earth,
unbeknownst to humans.

155
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,420
I was recruited by a secret organization
of the Japanese government.

156
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,220
So it's our job to get rid of these aliens.

157
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,390
What the fuck you talkin' about?

158
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,900
You're full of it!

159
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,830
You mean like the Lost Continent of Mu,
or something, right?

160
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,610
Son, the current government doesn't have
that kind of money. I should know.

161
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,270
You don't have to believe me, but...

162
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,330
I hear if you kill one, you'll get ten million yen.

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,950
Get outta here!

164
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,380
Kei, you believe him?
Get outta here!

165
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,150
Kei, you believe him?

166
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:33,550
Kei, you believe him?
Uh, well...

167
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,180
Uh, well...

168
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,120
Aren't you stretching things a bit?

169
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,140
My dad's one of the top brass at
the Cabinet's Information Bureau.

170
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,090
You don't mean Vice Minister Nishi?

171
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,090
Old man?

172
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,100
If I remember correctly, there's a man
named Nishi in the Information Bureau.

173
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,400
He's sharp as a knife.

174
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,230
He's unlike most bureaucrats
in that he never lies.

175
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,040
You're shitting me!

176
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,490
Ten million yen...That's enough
to buy my own soap.

177
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,860
It's all in here.

178
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,980
So this is where we are? It's nearby!

179
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,650
Ten million yen...

180
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,050
But this can't be. Something like this can't be.

181
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,460
Mr. Suzuki, bureaucrats don't
tell politicians the truth.

182
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,890
That's because politicians are just there
for show. Did you know that?

183
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,830
You've all been recruited for this alien hunt.

184
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,460
I don't buy that.
You've all been recruited for this alien hunt.

185
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,160
I don't buy that.

186
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,570
No one recruited me.

187
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:29,090
Didn't somebody come up and talk to you
just before you entered that room?

188
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,010
We've only got an hour!

189
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,980
Let's go!

190
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,110
This is foolishness! I'm going home!

191
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,560
What are you going to do, Kei?

192
00:08:59,270 --> 00:08:59,930
Is he there?

193
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,270
Isn't this the right place?
Is he there?

194
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,370
Isn't this the right place?

195
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,800
He isn't here, you fuck!

196
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,180
Hey, kid! If you're fucking with us, I'll kill you!

197
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,240
I don't care. It appears as though
I'm already dead anyway.

198
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,780
The Green Onions

199
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,020
There you are!

200
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,190
Hey, is he there?

201
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,700
Green onions are enough for me!

202
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,800
There he is!

203
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,140
He's eating green onions.

204
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,280
Hey! Taxi!

205
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,150
None of them are stopping.

206
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,360
Ouch! Damn...

207
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,260
Oh, well. That means I'm alive.

208
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,990
It hurts. I bleed.

209
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,800
When I get back...

210
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,810
When I get back, I'll start over from scratch.

211
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,940
Ichinomiya? Where the hell is Ichinomiya?

212
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,080
Ichinomiya


213
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,080
Ichinomiya? Where the hell is Ichinomiya?

214
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,280
Ichinomiya

215
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,750
Ichinomiya

216
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,750
Damn! I can't go home dressed like this.

217
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,340
Damn! I can't go home dressed like this.

218
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,520
I must say, she's definitely my type.

219
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,060
It'd be a shame to just go home
without doing anything about it.

220
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,490
What's going on?

221
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,160
What? What do you mean?

222
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,530
What do I mean? You mean you don't know?

223
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,500
What a cute voice!
What do I mean? You mean you don't know?

224
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,560
What do I mean? You mean you don't know?

225
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,400
Well, we're going home, right?

226
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,410
All right, all right! You can have my pants too.

227
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,270
That's okay!

228
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,840
So...what are we going to do now?

229
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,280
I don't even know your names.

230
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,550
I'm Kei Kurono!

231
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,380
Okay...

232
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,750
Excuse me...

233
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,720
Me? I'm Masaru Kato.

234
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,090
Mr. Kato? Just plain Kato?

235
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,030
I don't care what you call me.

236
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,050
Why are you cozying up to him?

237
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,260
I'm going to find the rest of them.

238
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,130
Are you really going?

239
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,830
Something just doesn't feel right.

240
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,490
Yeah, I know.

241
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,830
Why?

242
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,740
Just gimme two.

243
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,180
Hey, what are we gonna do about him?

244
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,700
Just two.

245
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,190
Gross! Why, you little!

246
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,020
Oh, I get it. You gotta do this to fire it?

247
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,390
Just gimme two. Just gimme green onions.

248
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,690
Why are you carrying two of them?
Hand one over, now!

249
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,260
You too, blondie!

250
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,170
All right, let's do it!

251
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,360
Hey!

252
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,600
Wait a sec...

253
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,080
What's this?

254
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,880
What do you mean, what's this?

255
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,670
No, I...

256
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,770
Hey! Watch where you're pointing that!

257
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,610
Oops, sorry!

258
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,390
You little runt!

259
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,190
Just two...

260
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,250
Look what you did to my clothes, you little fuck!

261
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,290
He went up those stairs!

262
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,270
Hey, you! Wait!

263
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,980
What an idiot!

264
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,270
Outta my way, you!

265
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,500
Hey, are you okay?

266
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,900
Hey! I don't think you should be
moving around like this.

267
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,770
Just gimme green onions.

268
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,970
Hey!

269
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,200
Hey, wait!

270
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,130
Get back here, you!

271
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,030
What was that?
Get back here, you!

272
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,650
What was that?

273
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,600
Kei, what was...

274
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,400
So does that mean we really ARE dead?

275
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,300
Mr. Kato! Kato!

276
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,830
Why does it have to be like this?

277
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,800
Hey, wait!

278
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,010
Take my green onions! Take my green onions!

279
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,320
I don't want them!

280
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,810
Damn, you're fast!

281
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,490
So, like, you told me you'd buy me
that ring the other day...

282
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,460
Kei, take her home for me!

283
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,290
Wait!

284
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,370
Score!

285
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,170
It's all right! I can get home by myself!
Well...

286
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,000
It's all right! I can get home by myself!

287
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,580
Now I've got you!

288
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,980
Take my green onions! Take my green onions!

289
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,810
I told you I don't want them!

290
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,140
What the...It had a good kick to it, but...

291
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,900
Wait!

292
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,450
No way!

293
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,110
One blast from this, and you'd be dead!

294
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,230
Take my green oni...

295
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,960
Hey, how do you shoot one of these things?

296
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,730
There are two triggers.

297
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,430
I got it to fire when I pulled both
at the same time!

298
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,350
Something's coming out of his ears!
Who is this guy?

299
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,790
It's funny, but he pisses me off!

300
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,690
Especially his face!

301
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,490
He's got razors!

302
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,490
Shoot him!

303
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,500
Stop it!

304
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,060
Hey!

305
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:03,810
Take my green onions! Take my green onions!

306
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,860
I'll forgive you for that because you're cute.

307
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,030
What the hell are you doing?

308
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,040
I can't believe you guys. I can't!

309
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,940
We gotta call an ambulance!

310
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,320
You got a problem with this, kiddo?

311
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,170
This can't be right...It just can't be!

312
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,360
What do you mean? You're strange.

313
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,100
Yeah, we got caught up in the thrill of it
and bagged ourselves a weirdo.

314
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,840
I couldn't save him.

315
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,240
Damn it! I couldn't save him!

316
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,350
Stuff it, you hypocrite!

317
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,680
He wasn't even human!

318
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,450
What difference does that make?

319
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,660
But what are we going to do about this?

320
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,650
Shit! Someone saw us!

321
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,360
Hey! Call the police!

322
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,460
What the fuck are you saying?

323
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,730
Mom! The Saitos' house is all messed up!

324
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,470
It looks like she didn't see us.

325
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,640
I guess that means we really are...

326
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,170
Dead...

327
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,690
Who the fuck is this?

328
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,090
The Green Onion Alien's dad?

329
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,740
Say something, you fucking green onion man!

330
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,880
Stop! I'm not exactly sure,

331
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,910
but I don't think it's a good idea to
get him any more agitated!

332
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,280
Shut up, kid!

333
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,810
What?

334
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,250
What the fuck are YOU looking at?

335
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,430
Are we gonna die?

336
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,160
This might be the end for us.

337
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,180
What is he made of, concrete?

338
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,720
Shoot him! Now!

339
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,950
Wait!

340
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,320
Don't shoot!

341
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,700
Okay...

342
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

343
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,300
Hey, kid!

344
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,330
You still going to tell us to stop
even when it comes to this?

345
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,680
I told you not to shoot!

346
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,030
Would you shoot one of your kids
if he didn't listen to you?!

348
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,470
Well?

349
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,740
I'm sorry!

350
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,840
WELL?!

351
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,570
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

352
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,410
It won't work on me.

353
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,640
I will live through this!

354
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:12,390
Hajimari wa dare demo junshin muku na baby

355
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:24,000
Nigai mi kajitte mo kujikecha
dame yo walk straight

356
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:43,100
Satta koto da kedo ame no naka
zukizuki itamu yo

357
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,370
I'm lonely as floating ice

358
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,200
Yaseta yubi ni kiss o shite

359
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,970
Naita anata o omoidasu yo

360
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,750
Kore de owari da to shite mo

361
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,690
Saigo no kiss wa wasurenai yo

362
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:12,320
Wasurenai yo

363
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,490
Wasurenai yo

364
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:30,380
Kare no kiss o wasurenai yo

365
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,320
The Kei Kurono I remember.

366
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,250
A running, shining, shouting friend.

367
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,760
But now his friend is being ravaged
by strange, ferocious claws.

368
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,160
What will the others do?

369
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,930
What will he do?

370
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,090
Next time: "Kei, You're Awesome!"
