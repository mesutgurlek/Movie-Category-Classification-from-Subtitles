1
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,104
(Woman) It's got to lead somewhere.

2
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:10,195
Well, we'll stop and make camp
pretty soon. Got your breath?

3
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,116
Yeah. Let's go.

4
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,710
What is this?

5
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:33,510
It doesn't look like anyone's been here for
a while. Let's go inside and check it out.

6
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,806
- Think we should?
- Barbara, who'd know the difference?

7
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,017
OK.

8
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,609
Besides, a little lawbreaking'll
do you good.

9
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,790
(Barbara) Wonder why this place
wasn't on your map.

10
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,710
(man) Maybe it's
supposed to be a secret.

11
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,921
Maybe.

12
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,383
Hey!

13
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,887
Far out!

14
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,402
It feels great.

15
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,615
Come on, let's wash off, so it won't
be so funky in that sleeping bag.

16
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,409
What if somebody catches us?

17
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,120
Who's gonna catch us?

18
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,209
There's nobody here.

19
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,214
Let's get wet.

20
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,218
- Last one in is a rotten egg.
- That's really original.

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,682
- Wait a minute.
- What?

22
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,395
What if this is some kind
of a sewage treatment plant?

23
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,689
Idiot.

24
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,819
Now you're gonna get it.

25
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,408
How is it?

26
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,204
Here I come.

27
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,380
- That's not funny.
- What?

28
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,592
You bit me. I can't believe
you actually bit me.

29
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,595
What do I look like?
A creature from the black lagoon?

30
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,515
You are paranoid, kid. Listen,
I’ll race you to the deep end.

31
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,914
Barbara! There's something in here!

32
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,707
David!

33
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,000
God damn!

34
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,294
David!

35
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,887
David?

36
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,808
David!

37
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,480
David! David!

38
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,195
(Barbara screams)

39
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,703
(screaming)

40
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,689
- Rent a Jeep?
- She'll be on unpaved mountain roads...

41
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,316
All right. Where do I sign?

42
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:31,201
We're all set. At Indian Springs you’ll get
a Jeep. The roads are very rough there.

43
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,495
No sweat.

44
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,290
- I can handle it.
- I know.

45
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,001
I wouldn’t send you if
I didn't think you could.

46
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,211
Wait. Got ya.

47
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,883
- I found the bigamist.
- Right.

48
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,385
- And the bad-cheque lady?
- Right.

49
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,014
- And Mo Schneider.
- Three times, but those were all in town.

50
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,808
You're a city kid.
These kids are out in the boon...

51
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,103
I can find anything, Earl.
I'm two-thirds bloodhound.

52
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,898
I told you that when you hired me.

53
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,280
Oh, my gosh. My ticket. I could
have sworn I put it in my pocket.

54
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,490
Where's my ticket?

55
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,582
- I can manage it.
- Of course you can.

56
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,710
- It's money in the bank.
- My money.

57
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,407
Hello, Brandy. How are you, huh?

58
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,000
This hike from town is
gettin' longer every week.

59
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:06,004
- You oughta get a car, Jack.
- I got a car.

60
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,508
It's up on blocks. That's where it belongs.

61
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,514
Scotch.

62
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,517
Gin.

63
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,603
Bourbon.

64
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,900
(laughs)

65
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,820
Tequila!

66
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,407
You're the 7th Cavalry, Jack.

67
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,784
You know, I just ran dry today.

68
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,496
Your corn meal is down there, but
I ain't gonna walk down and get it.

69
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,416
Man cannot live by booze alone.

70
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,715
In lieu of rent. What's up in town?

71
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,303
- Same as usual.
- I bet you miss it, Jack, huh?

72
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,600
I bet you miss sellin' whatever
it was. That plastic fruit.

73
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,686
No.

74
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,189
Got the river.

75
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,902
It wakes me up in the morning.

76
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,407
Gives me a bath.

77
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,701
Does the laundry.

78
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,082
Gives me my dinner.
Puts me to sleep real gentle.

79
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,211
I got my river.

80
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,713
I got Brandy.

81
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,800
Paul.

82
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,097
What have you got up here?

83
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,602
I got scotch, gin, bourbon, and tequila.

84
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,688
- What's it to you, anyhow?
- OK.

85
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,400
OK, buddy. I’ll see you.

86
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,195
Come on.

87
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,781
Take it easy, Brandy.

88
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,396
Ow!

89
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,784
Hm.

90
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,508
(knock at door)

91
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,594
It's open.

92
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,390
Paul Grogan?

93
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,520
Hi. I'm Maggie McKeown.
I work for a skip-tracing company.

94
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,690
- What's that?
- We find missing people.

95
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,610
Did my ex-wife send you?

96
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,612
No.

97
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,197
Um...

98
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm looking for a pair of teenage kids.

99
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,119
Some friends said they might
be backpacking up here.

100
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:27,915
I haven't seen'em. Did you
talk to the sheriff's people?

101
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:31,084
- They said it was a big mountain.
- They're right. It is.

102
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,799
I figured they may have followed the river.
Are there any places to swim near here?

103
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,887
Well, if they'd drowned,
they'd be swept down to the dam.

104
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,806
So you're startin' at the wrong end.

105
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,893
Boy, you're the wrong end all right.

106
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,814
Look, am I interrupting something?
This is kind of important.

107
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,900
Hey,

108
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,319
you cool your jets, lady.

109
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:02,199
I didn't axe-murder your young couple.
I can't help you. I haven't seen'em.

110
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,579
Are there any other shacks up here?

111
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,415
Cabins. This is a cabin.

112
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,711
Are there any more of them? Any places
where they might be holed up?

113
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,300
There's an old fella named Jack,
has a place down the river a bit,

114
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,719
but he's not with them.

115
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,890
And there was some kind of army
test site way up the mountain.

116
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,519
- That closed down five or six years ago.
- Come on. Let's go.

117
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,397
- Go where?
- You're taking me up there.

118
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,692
Oh, no, I'm not.

119
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,991
You think I'm wasting my time, don't you?

120
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,785
No. I think you're wastin' my time.

121
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,403
- Find anything yet?
- Not yet, but it's still early in the day.

122
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,487
David!

123
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,198
Barbara!

124
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,005
- What were they testing here?
- Who knows?

125
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:26,301
I hiked up here once with my ex-wife.
They had guard dogs out.

126
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,179
The fence was electrified. The works.

127
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,606
“BR.” Barbara Randolph.

128
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,193
Hm.

129
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,908
Man, that is cold.

130
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,619
Their parents said they
were excellent swimmers.

131
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,581
Wouldn’t they be floatin'
up on top by now?

132
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,292
It takes a while for
the body to bloat with gas.

133
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,586
Nice business you're in.

134
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,213
You think there's a way
to pull the plug on this?

135
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,683
- Tropical fish?
- Looks like it's for laboratory rats.

136
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,896
You know, where they had to get through
an obstacle course to get a reward.

137
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,189
Hm.

138
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,909
Still warm.

139
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,801
Come here. Take a look at this.

140
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,515
Yeuch.

141
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,609
Let's get outta here.
This place gives me the creeps.

142
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,586
Hey! What are you...

143
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,217
Well, they've been here all right.

144
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,680
And they never left.

145
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:23,020
- I say we drain the pond.
- Well, now. Now, wait a minute.

146
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:27,399
You can't do that without gettin'
somebody's permission, you know.

147
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,613
If it works it's the quickest way
to know if they're down there.

148
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,199
What are you doing?

149
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,218
(alarm ringing)

150
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,108
Are you all right?

151
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,407
- He's breathing.
- No thanks to you.

152
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:21,703
- What was I supposed to do?
- I would have got loose in a second.

153
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,291
- Look at this. You put a dent in it.
- Could I have a sip of that, please?

154
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,711
It's not water.

155
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,599
- What is it?
- The water's salty.

156
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,313
Where does this drain to?

157
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,816
It was a fish hatchery
before the army took it over.

158
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,986
It probably drains
underground into the river.

159
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,988
Uh-oh.

160
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:08,417
I think it's a dog. I don't suppose
they would have fit through here.

161
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,211
Not in one piece.

162
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,299
You think he's all right up there?

163
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,593
(engine)

164
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,012
Oh, shit.

165
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,100
Oh, my God.

166
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,192
(engine noise fades)

167
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:39,489
I guess I must have left
the keys in it. Huh?

168
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,406
- He's alive.
- He's indestructible.

169
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,909
(shouts)

170
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,703
Easy. Easy, now. Easy. Easy.

171
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,707
- Razorteeth.
- What's “razorteeth”?

172
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,501
- You drained the pond?
- Yes...

173
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,711
- You let them out?
- Let who out?

174
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,588
What's he doin'?

175
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:39,383
You don't know what
you've done. Untie me.

176
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,886
The question is, what you've done, mister.

177
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,097
You don't know.

178
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:48,892
They breed like flies.
There'll be no way to stop them.

179
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,312
Would you talk sense, dammit?
What about those kids?

180
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:56,400
I can't tell you. Mother of God,
they’ll kill us. They’ll kill all of us.

181
00:21:56,817 --> 00:22:00,487
OK, mister, listen. They're gonna
sweat it out of you in town.

182
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,699
They’ll kill us.

183
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,410
What have we done?

184
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:21,008
Oh, my God.

185
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:36,481
- He thinks someone's going to kill him.
- He's right.

186
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,318
I am, if he steps out of line.

187
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,779
- Do you have any cigarettes?
- No.

188
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,782
I quit a year ago.
It interfered with my drinking.

189
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,995
Do you mind if I come in for a minute?

190
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,581
Sure.

191
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:01,089
So, did you start drinking before or after?

192
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:04,510
- Before or after what?
- Your wife left you.

193
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:11,099
- What the hell kind of question is that?
- Look, I'm sorry. I was just interested.

194
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,481
Um,

195
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,317
do you mind if I sit here?

196
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,320
Go ahead.

197
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,788
- How long were you married?
- Huh?

198
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,915
Um,

199
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,209
ten years.

200
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,796
She was just 17 when we
eloped in her father's car.

201
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:45,300
Man, we thought we had
the world by the balls.

202
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,015
Where did you live?

203
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:56,520
In town. I worked in
a smeltin' operation downriver.

204
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,898
The government closed us down.
Said we killed too many fish.

205
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,611
They gave it to the army, and the
army sold it to some resort outfit.

206
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:09,199
So you know that somebody's makin'
bundles somewhere along the line.

207
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,785
How do you make a living now?

208
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,413
Back pay. Unemployment.

209
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,082
Gonna have to go to work
come September.

210
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,211
Keep my daughter in saddle shoes.

211
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:25,591
- Does your daughter live with you?
- Yeah.

212
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,184
- What's wrong?
- Hm?

213
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,812
- You're so tense.
- Hm?

214
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:44,318
I don't know. I guess I'm not
used to bein' around people.

215
00:24:46,195 --> 00:24:50,991
That's obvious. I've been trying to hint
my way under the covers for five minutes.

216
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,496
(Paul) You are really somethin'.

217
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:07,716
(Paul) There's no way we're gonna get
this guy down to town without your Jeep.

218
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:11,386
We have to do something.
He might have fractured his skull.

219
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:16,099
We gotta get him to the dam.
There's usually a ranger there.

220
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:19,186
- How do we get there?
- On a raft.

221
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,316
- Stop kidding. How do we get there?
- You’ll see.

222
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:28,695
I read my daughter
Huckleberry Finn last summer.

223
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:33,784
We wanted to light out for the territories
so we settled on this as a compromise.

224
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:37,496
- It looks authentic.
- Yeah. We cut all the logs ourselves.

225
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,415
Not a single nail in her. It's all lashing.

226
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:46,088
- Where's your daughter now?
- Summer camp, other side of the dam.

227
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,799
Just how sturdy is this thing?

228
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,385
I think it’ll hold three people.

229
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:56,390
To tell you the truth, we never tried it.
My daughter's afraid of the river.

230
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:01,311
(girls singing)  Boys are made
of greasy grimy gopher guts

231
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,480
Mutilated monkey meat

232
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,482
Little dirty birdie feet

233
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:07,818
Sneezed-up snail snot

234
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:09,987
Bashed-in beetles' brains

235
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:13,282
All in a bottle of blood

236
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,793
Suzie? Suzie, honey, don't be scared.

237
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,380
You just have to swim out
to the marker and back.

238
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:31,508
You've probably swum
twice that far in a pool.

239
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:38,891
If you don't pass your solo swim
you can't get your water badge.

240
00:26:39,183 --> 00:26:41,185
I don't care.

241
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,688
What is it that you're afraid of, honey?

242
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,608
- Things.
- You mean like sea monsters?

243
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:51,904
There's just a few little fish in here.

244
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:54,781
They eat plants at the bottom of the river.

245
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,993
They're not interested
in little girls' fingers and toes.

246
00:26:58,285 --> 00:27:00,913
- Dickinson!
- Over here, Mr. Dumont.

247
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,090
Letter for you, Dickinson. That same boy.

248
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:14,301
Oh, thank you.

249
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,095
Still haven't tackled
your solo swim, Grogan?

250
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,305
No, sir.

251
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:20,891
She's kind of afraid of things in the water.

252
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:26,605
Things? What things? Fish? People eat
fish, Grogan. Fish don't eat people.

253
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,319
Do you wanna be the one to lose the
camp competition for the Minnows?

254
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,196
Course you don't.

255
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,910
- She's doing really well on handicrafts.
- Handicrafts don't take any nerve.

256
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:43,288
Any intestinal fortitude.
You know what that means, Grogan?

257
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,791
- Yes, sir. Guts.
- Right.

258
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,585
Is there any mail for her?

259
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,881
Nope. Skunked again, Grogan.

260
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,718
Grogan.

261
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,012
Guts.

262
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,393
Uh...

263
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,688
Come on, let’s go.
We’ll play some Monopoly.

264
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:12,192
Why don't we try it in
an inner tube tomorrow? Huh?

265
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,404
Come on.

266
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,583
Hey, Brandy.

267
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,087
Did I ever tell you about that
other dog of mine called Philip?

268
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,592
Philip grew up in Baltimore with me.

269
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,595
He was a good dog.

270
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,305
He...

271
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:47,394
He run across the street one day,

272
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:52,316
and he walked right
in front of a trolley car.

273
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,902
It ran over his tail. It surprised him.

274
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,988
He turned around and the trolley car...

275
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:01,700
I'm tellin' you a story. The
trolley car ran over his head.

276
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:08,999
It's what you call losin' your head over
a little piece of tail. Pretty funny, huh?

277
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,585
(laughs)

278
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,295
(dog Whines)

279
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:16,089
What's the matter with you?

280
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,513
You didn't like the story? Want me
to tell another? Maybe you didn't get it.

281
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,306
(dog Whines)

282
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:27,100
Are you soft in the head?

283
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,701
OK, my friend.

284
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,704
Number one:
what happened to those kids?

285
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:55,504
All right, then, try number two: what
were you doin' up at the army site?

286
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:58,215
- Stop that!
- Oh, he speaks.

287
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,008
Hey.

288
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:05,097
- Keep your hand out of the water.
- What's wrong with the water?

289
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:09,184
Since you're talkin' this morning,
buddy, how about a name?

290
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,104
Hoak. Dr Robert Hoak.

291
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:16,900
- What's wrong with the water?
- The water is filled with carnivorous fish.

292
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,111
Piranha.

293
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:20,988
(Paul) Oh, Christ.

294
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:24,908
In here? How did they get in?

295
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,412
You let them in when you drained
the pond at the test site.

296
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:31,206
- Paul...
- Piranha are tropical fish.

297
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:35,085
This is cold mountain water. They
wouldn’t last in here for a minute.

298
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:38,297
What about that skeleton?

299
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:44,720
OK. What would piranha
be doin' up in that pond?

300
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,891
Huh?

301
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,810
- Untie me.
- Hey...

302
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,814
What if I dipped you in
the water a little bit first, Doc?

303
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:59,401
See if you're makin'
the whole thing up or not. Huh?

304
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:01,111
(dog barking)

305
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:04,907
Brandy.

306
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,201
That's Jack's dog.

307
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:09,411
Is he always so ferocious?

308
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:14,583
(Paul) I don't think I ever heard him do
more than roll over and beg for food.

309
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,503
We'd better take a look.

310
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,597
(dog Whines)

311
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,190
Easy, boy. Easy.

312
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:06,510
He must have dragged himself
this far. Bled to death.

313
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:14,601
I'm sorry.

314
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:20,983
I’ll get a shovel.

315
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,695
He wouldn’t wanna be buried in town.

316
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,087
- Even in an inner tube, huh?
- Uh-huh.

317
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:47,009
- It's almost impossible to fall in.
- But they can still get you.

318
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,094
They, huh?

319
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:53,807
OK. If that's really the way you feel about
it, I’ll try and help you get out of the race.

320
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:58,020
But we've got to come up
with an excuse. Do not lie.

321
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:01,899
- I got poison ivy.
- So does everybody else in the camp.

322
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:06,111
Hey, maybe you could just be getting
your... No, you're too young for that.

323
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,280
Huh?

324
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:11,116
Wait a minute. I have an idea.
Come with me.

325
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,414
Come here. Sit down here.

326
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:21,793
Let's see what we have in our
magic box. Give me your knee.

327
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,299
OK. Get Darlene to take
your place in the race. OK?

328
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,302
And if Dumont squawks, limp a lot.

329
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,889
And, uh, I’ll get you
a huge bandage for this.

330
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:40,604
Feels like this thing's
snagged on the bottom.

331
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:44,107
- Got myself tangled in it too.
- Want me to help?

332
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,402
No, you better stay there.
You might tip the canoe.

333
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:51,990
I thought you knew all about this kind
of fishing, from when you were a boy.

334
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:56,203
Listen, when I was a boy we made
our own nets and made 'em right.

335
00:33:56,995 --> 00:34:00,582
Jesus. It feels like
something's snagged in here. Ow!

336
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,293
- Did you get bit?
- Ouch!

337
00:34:03,585 --> 00:34:05,712
- Ow!
- Dad!

338
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,091
- Stay back! Stay back!
- Dad! Dad!

339
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:20,811
Dad!

340
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,900
- The government paid you?
- Of course they paid.

341
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:30,612
Where there's germ warfare,
the bomb, chemical warfare,

342
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:34,199
there's plenty of money.
Special agencies.

343
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:40,080
They pay. They pay a lot better
than they do in private research.

344
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:42,791
For raisin' fish.

345
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,503
Oh, no. It's a matter of genetics.

346
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:50,591
Radiation. Selective breeding.

347
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:54,595
They called it Operation Razorteeth.

348
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:58,891
What was it all for?

349
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:02,603
To destroy the river systems
of the North Vietnamese.

350
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:07,983
Our goal was to develop a strain of this
killer fish that could survive in cold water

351
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,611
and then breed at an accelerated rate.

352
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:14,281
We had everything. Blank cheque.

353
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,409
And then the war ended.

354
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,786
You sound disappointed.

355
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,498
They poisoned the water.

356
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:26,919
After all that work,
they poisoned the water.

357
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:29,588
But some survived.

358
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:33,884
We developed a lot of mutants and a few
of them were able to resist the poison.

359
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:37,095
They ate their own. Their own dead.

360
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:42,017
And then began to breed
like some wild species.

361
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,896
Suddenly there were hundreds.
Maybe thousands.

362
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:50,901
- Our tax dollars at work, huh?
- That's science in the service of defense.

363
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:55,113
Sure. Spreadin' strains
of bacteria in the subway system.

364
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:59,701
You put them in the river where they
could kill people. Including civilians.

365
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:03,288
- And kids swimming in the rivers.
- I never killed anybody.

366
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,292
If you wanna talk about killing,
talk to your politicians, the military.

367
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:09,711
No, no. I'm a scientist.

368
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,006
- Kids in the water.
- What?

369
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:15,092
The dam.

370
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,179
They let water through every few days
to keep the level steady on the new lake.

371
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:24,017
The resort's down there. Summer camp.
All those kids. Come on.

372
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,605
(children scream)

373
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,294
(boy) Hey, stop splashin'!

374
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:56,383
It was pure research.
No scrounging for grant money.

375
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,095
No academic politics. You don't know
what that means to a scientist.

376
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,891
You fed them. You kept them alive.

377
00:37:04,892 --> 00:37:07,102
I continued the experiment.

378
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:10,105
There was so much more
I could do with the species.

379
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,983
So much further I could take them.

380
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,904
You're not holding me responsible?

381
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:23,994
I think you are. You pulled the plug and
you're holding me responsible. Incredible.

382
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:27,080
You're blaming me.

383
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:31,084
I think if you open your mouth again
I’ll stick this pole in it.

384
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:35,797
- You think they've opened the dam yet?
- I don't know. We can only hope not.

385
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,800
(boy) Daddy.

386
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,683
(Paul) Let's move it.

387
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,895
- It's sinking, Paul. The canoe is sinking.
- Yeah.

388
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,403
Daddy?

389
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,909
Daddy! Daddy! It's going under.

390
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,288
(Paul) Don't do it! Get outta there!

391
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,002
Come on, Maggie.

392
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:44,199
(Hoak yells)

393
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:00,090
Hold it here. Hold it.

394
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:11,894
(Maggie) Come on! Come on! Come here!

395
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:16,607
Come on! Give me your hand.

396
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:19,193
Get the doctor. OK, now the doctor.

397
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:43,884
Easy, Doc.

398
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,803
Here. Here you go.

399
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:54,019
What do we do? What do we do?
How do we stop them?

400
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:03,320
Oh, Christ.

401
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:11,787
(Whistle)

402
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:14,289
Campers. No swinging after lunch.

403
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:43,694
(Paul) So far we know that they
can live in cold water.

404
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,991
(Maggie) They seem to be
moving downstream.

405
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:53,203
Gotta find someone who knows
how to deal with these things.

406
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:57,207
There’ll be a phone at the dam.
We can call on ahead.

407
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,213
- Hey.
- What?

408
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:09,386
I don't know. It seems like
the lashing's workin' loose.

409
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:19,897
Paul... there's something under us.

410
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,913
His blood. It's the doc's blood.

411
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:41,084
It's seepin' through. They're eatin'
away at the lashing to get to it.

412
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:46,715
- Daddy!
- Let go, son. No. We gotta get rid of him.

413
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:49,384
No. That's what happened to my daddy.

414
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:51,887
- (Maggie) Let go.
- (boy) They're eating him.

415
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:54,515
They're eating him!

416
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,604
- Come here.
- They got my daddy!

417
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,704
You OK, boy? How about you?

418
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,915
- I'm all right.
- You gotta stay here.

419
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:06,295
I'm gonna try to get to the dam before
they let 'em through with the water.

420
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:16,889
(air horn)

421
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:26,607
(air horn continues)

422
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:52,508
(TV) Acres and acres of reclaimed land
nestled in a scenic mountain valley,

423
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:55,219
site of the newly formed Lost River Lake.

424
00:43:57,095 --> 00:44:00,307
Swimming, sailing, snorkeling,
skin diving, shuffleboard,

425
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:03,894
and Buck Gardner's
Aquarena Amusement Arcade.

426
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:10,484
So pack up your RVs, your station
Wagons, your trailers and cars,

427
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:15,113
and hustle on up to Lost River Campsite
for a free introductory Weekend.

428
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:27,417
Don't open it!
Whatever you do, don't open it.

429
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,911
(man) All right, men, off your butts.
Fall in. Move it!

430
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:16,091
Forgive our skepticism, but we don't
come across stories like yours every day.

431
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:19,303
Piranha are warm-water fish.
This is hardly the Amazon.

432
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:24,016
But I told you, these are mutations.
They've already killed five people.

433
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:27,603
- Science fiction.
- You ready with that bait, soldier?

434
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,397
- Yes, sir.
- Let her go, son.

435
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:41,783
Actually, a piranha was caught once
in a pond in Miami, in '72, I believe.

436
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:45,496
But the Fish and Game Commission
poisoned the water, and that was that.

437
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:49,291
- That was that, huh?
- The rumors persisted, you know, but...

438
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,919
Pull it in, son.

439
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:03,388
Sergeant, tell the major
to start the pumps.

440
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:06,183
We should be able to
contain them in this area.

441
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:10,521
Piranha travel in schools, and we've
brought heavy doses of rotenone 235.

442
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:13,899
- Came well-prepared, didn't you?
- Won't it ruin the river?

443
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,318
Sometimes you need to destroy
in order to save.

444
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,488
What if they realize they're
bein' slaughtered and leave?

445
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,990
We're talking about fish, Mr. Grogan.

446
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:25,911
- They don't realize much of anything.
- Who are you trying to kid?

447
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:28,997
You must've known
all along they were here.

448
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:34,002
OK. You and Miss McKeown are the only
two civilians who know about this project.

449
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:39,883
What the colonel means is that he'd like
you to join us. Become one of our team.

450
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,388
It figures.

451
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:54,815
Impossible.

452
00:46:55,899 --> 00:47:00,487
Look, you're a full colonel, right?
I assume you can read a map. Here.

453
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:03,115
We are here at the dam, OK?

454
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:06,618
Over here you’ll see there's
a stream that feeds into it.

455
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:11,290
Follow the stream back for an eighth
of a mile and you see there's a fork.

456
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:14,084
Take this branch, follow it downstream,

457
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:18,005
and you’ll see it empties into the
river on the other side of the dam.

458
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:21,592
In other words, the piranha have
a way to get around the obstacle.

459
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,596
Even if there's a chance he's right,
don't you think you should do something?

460
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:31,101
No. If a bypass exists, piranha haven't
the intelligence or the motivation to find it.

461
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:36,315
But you know Hoak was breeding them
for endurance and intelligence and...

462
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:40,194
- Well, Bob was a dreamer. He, er...
- Bob?

463
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:44,198
Dr Hoak?

464
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:46,200
You knew him?

465
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:50,412
Fish genetics is a very small field.

466
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,290
You were friends?

467
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,420
Let's say we were
a great deal more than that.

468
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:02,382
You're covering up.

469
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:09,181
Is it Waxman? Are you afraid of what
the army might do to you if you...

470
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:13,894
No, I'm not afraid. I'm a scientist.
I'm head of my department.

471
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:17,397
It's just that there are priorities, and...

472
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:21,902
some things are more important
than a few lives.

473
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:26,114
That's not how Dr Hoak felt.
Not at the end.

474
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:30,494
As I said, he was a dreamer.

475
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:35,415
- (Waxman) The situation is under control.
- (Paul) Hold on. What is this?

476
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,918
Why won't you listen to me?

477
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:41,004
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

478
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:45,592
As far as you're concerned,
this project does not exist.

479
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:48,303
The piranha do not exist.

480
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:50,597
- And if I make a squawk?
- Paul...

481
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:54,017
The interests of national security
permit extreme measures.

482
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:56,812
Oh, come on! The war's over, dammit!

483
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,606
There’ll be other wars, Mr. Grogan.

484
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:05,404
I think for your own protection
we'd better secure your tent for the night.

485
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,785
- Look who's here.
- What's goin' on?

486
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,787
Nothin'.

487
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:25,591
Psst! Is he still out there?

488
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:27,092
Yep.

489
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,511
- Then you’ll have to distract him.
- Why?

490
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,307
- So I can get away.
- So you can get away? What about me?

491
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:37,102
- Suit yourself. But first you distract him.
- How?

492
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:42,316
How would I know? Just get him with
his back to the opening. Come on to him.

493
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:48,989
What if he's gay?

494
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:51,783
Then I’ll distract him. Let's go.

495
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:57,581
Hi.

496
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,292
Uh...

497
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:02,419
Nice night, huh?

498
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:06,381
- Listen, are you gay?
- What?

499
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:08,884
Oh...

500
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:13,305
Well, I was just reading
this article in this magazine, and...

501
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,808
- What did you ask me before?
- Look! Up in the sky!

502
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,019
It's Superman!

503
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:27,986
Oh, shit!

504
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,280
- What's wrong?
- Have you got a dime?

505
00:50:30,614 --> 00:50:32,491
(phone)

506
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,710
Hello?

507
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:47,297
What? What piranhas?
What are you talking about?

508
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,008
What?

509
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,594
Are you crazy? Who is this?

510
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:57,808
Oh, Grogan. Yeah, I remember you.
You're not crazy, you're drunk.

511
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,812
No, I don't wanna talk to her.
I'm sure she's as drunk as you are.

512
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,606
You wake me up again,
I’ll have the cops on you.

513
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:08,110
What? No, you can't talk to your daughter.

514
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:10,696
Sober up, Grogan, and fly right!

515
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:17,286
Piranhas!

516
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:20,289
- Asshole!
- He didn't believe you.

517
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:23,584
- He thinks I'm drunk.
- Can you get through to your daughter?

518
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:26,211
No way. We gotta get down there.

519
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:54,281
(siren)

520
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,618
Paul, behind us.

521
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:01,205
I know. No way we can
outrun him in this thing.

522
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,999
Maybe we can talk to him.
Maybe he’ll believe us.

523
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,921
Piranha, huh?
And where did they come from?

524
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,715
From an army test site
up on the mountain.

525
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,218
That's posted. There's no trespassing.

526
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,679
Two people were killed up there,
and more along the river.

527
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,681
You've gotta believe us.

528
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:23,310
Now wait. Say, aren't you Grogan?

529
00:52:23,602 --> 00:52:26,313
- Yeah, that's right.
- Uh-huh. I remember.

530
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,191
We had you in on
a drunk and disorderly last month.

531
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:34,112
I am not drunk! You give me a breath test,
whatever you want, only listen to me!

532
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:38,116
I think I'm gonna take you up on that,
buddy. Back to the station.

533
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:41,620
And you can explain why
you're in an army staff car.

534
00:52:41,912 --> 00:52:46,583
And don't you get any notion, man,
cos I got my gun in my other hand here.

535
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,210
OK?

536
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,712
Okey-dokey. Let's go.

537
00:52:55,717 --> 00:52:57,594
Yes. We've got a situation up here.

538
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:02,182
A very delicate situation. And you can
help us control it by holding them for us.

539
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:06,812
Yes, Colonel. Yes, yes.
I understand. We’ll do it.

540
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,815
Make sure they don't
communicate with the outside.

541
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:12,192
We're tryin' to avoid unnecessary panic.

542
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:13,402
Certainly.

543
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,780
Their best interests, I agree.

544
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:20,617
Well, you're welcome, Colonel. Uh...

545
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,709
See you in the mornin'.

546
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:43,182
Well, you best make yourself comfortable,
folks. You’ll be spending the night.

547
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:47,186
- What about a phone call?
- I don't wanna hear it.

548
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:49,313
I don't wanna hear it.

549
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:51,899
I gotta get back on that road now.

550
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:55,486
So you folks, you just behave yourselves.

551
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:58,614
No, wait a minute. You can't just leave!

552
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:01,408
My daughter's down there!

553
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:05,412
There are kids down there,
and the piranhas are in the river!

554
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:07,706
Please!

555
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:13,795
The witch and the demons of the forest
scoured every corner of the church,

556
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:17,716
venom dripping from their fangs.

557
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:21,720
“Where is he?” hissed the witch.

558
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:27,518
The demons peeled
their heavy eyelids back.

559
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:33,190
There he is!

560
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:41,114
(Waxman) There's absolutely no cause for
alarm. It's a complete hoax, believe me.

561
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,783
Yeah.

562
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:46,995
I just wanted to warn you in case
they were able to get a call through.

563
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:50,415
Groundless panic wouldn’t help
our grand opening any.

564
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:55,587
Uh-huh. I really appreciate the warning.
I’ll brief my staff. We’ll take care of it.

565
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:59,007
Yeah. Don't worry.

566
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:03,804
Uh-huh. By the way,
are you comin' down tomorrow?

567
00:55:04,596 --> 00:55:08,392
Ah, good. Your presence will lend
a certain prestige to the opening.

568
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,018
Mm-hm.

569
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:11,520
Huh?

570
00:55:14,606 --> 00:55:17,985
No. No, Colonel.
Nobody knows about your investment.

571
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,281
With me, a silent partner's
privacy is sacred.

572
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:25,993
I swear to you on my honor
as a Texan, nobody knows.

573
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:29,288
Yes, Colonel.

574
00:55:29,496 --> 00:55:31,915
Good night. Good night.

575
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:34,418
Schmuck!

576
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:40,507
Come on, you guys! Will you haul ass?
This stuff's gotta be set by ten o’clock.

577
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,886
What are you doing back there?

578
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:46,388
Hide, that's all they do.
Drink beer and hide.

579
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:59,401
- Hi.
- Hi.

580
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:05,282
I always like it at night.

581
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:07,409
Yeah, me too.

582
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:10,204
It's like it's resting.

583
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:13,290
- Hey, wanna race me across?
- To the island?

584
00:56:13,582 --> 00:56:17,211
Yeah. Ever since I got here, I haven't
been able to just swim by myself.

585
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:21,507
I've always had half a dozen
campers hangin' on to me.

586
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:25,511
I don't know. I don't feel like swimming.
But go ahead, I’ll watch you.

587
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:31,099
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

588
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,894
Something... Something's wrong.

589
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,190
Come on, come with me.
It'll do you some good.

590
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:41,193
- You're probably right.
- Good. OK.

591
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,279
Grogan, turn off that flashlight!

592
00:56:44,988 --> 00:56:46,990
Don't be alarmed - it's only me.

593
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:50,702
There's a rumor some campers
are coming for a midnight swim.

594
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,790
If I catch them swimming, they’ll be
in pretty hot water, I can tell you.

595
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:57,709
- What are you doing out here?
- Oh, well, we...

596
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:01,296
I thought I heard some campers
swimming. We came down to look.

597
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:04,591
- Swimming? Where?
- Over by the waterfall.

598
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:07,386
The waterfall?
Is that where they're doing it?

599
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,304
- (splash)
- What was that?

600
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:12,516
It sounded like campers
on the other side of the lake.

601
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:15,394
The other side of the lake?

602
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,190
Thank you. Kim Burrell, is that you?

603
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,405
Well, there's always
tomorrow for that swim.

604
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:28,991
Yeah. Let's do it tomorrow.

605
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:39,501
(banging on pipe)

606
00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:47,801
- What are you doin'?
- Did I tell you about Mo Schneider?

607
00:57:48,594 --> 00:57:52,514
- Who's that?
- This guy they sent me to find one time.

608
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:58,020
He was a plumber. He kept running off
and getting busted for indecent exposure.

609
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,194
What are you doin' there?

610
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:09,490
Mo was in the poky so many times that
he developed a regular escape routine.

611
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:12,284
Being a plumber,
he used what he knew best.

612
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,119
(crash)

613
00:58:15,496 --> 00:58:17,706
What the hell was that?

614
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:21,293
What are you doing? Are you all right?

615
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:23,921
Christ, listen.

616
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:28,383
This, uh, this plan,
whatever it is, did it ever work?

617
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:32,095
No. But he came pretty
close a couple of times.

618
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:36,600
Pretty damn close.

619
00:58:39,812 --> 00:58:44,983
What's all that racket? Sounds like the
roof fell in. What's all this water from?

620
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,821
Something's leaking,
and I’ll catch pneumonia if it doesn't stop.

621
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:52,115
- What's the matter with that sink trap?
- I've tried,

622
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:55,786
but I'm just not strong enough
to put the pipes back together.

623
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:58,914
All right. Stand back, I’ll take a look at it.

624
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:11,009
What the hell did you do to this thing?
Tryin' to crawl through the drainpipe?

625
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:22,813
- What's happenin'?
- He's knocked out, but he's alive.

626
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,816
Get his keys. Can you get his keys?

627
00:59:26,108 --> 00:59:29,987
- They're chained to his pants!
- Well, take his pants off, then.

628
00:59:40,998 --> 00:59:45,419
Come on. I'd have thought you could
get a man's pants off quicker than that.

629
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,011
Got 'em! I got 'em!

630
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,097
Come on. Let's go.

631
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:02,519
- What did you hit him with?
- A piece of the toilet lid.

632
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:06,190
- Maybe I should have tried bribery first.
- Thank you, Mo Schneider.

633
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:09,818
Don't suppose one of those
keys would fit a patrol car?

634
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:12,404
I wouldn’t be surprised.

635
01:00:58,617 --> 01:00:59,910
(applause)

636
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:02,579
Howdy, folks. I'm Buck Gardner.

637
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,415
Thank you.

638
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,584
(cheering)

639
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:12,714
Thank you. I appreciate that.

640
01:01:13,507 --> 01:01:17,219
On behalf of Buck Gardner's
Aquarena Development Corporation,

641
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:22,015
it gives me great pleasure to invite you
here to our opening-day festivities.

642
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:27,980
If you have any questions about
purchasing land up here,

643
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:32,192
our people will be mingling in the crowd
to answer your questions.

644
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:37,281
You got no obligation to buy anything,
only to enjoy yourselves. Annie?

645
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,995
Right there.

646
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:44,997
Right there.

647
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:47,916
Try again.

648
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,793
Nice try, kid.

649
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:52,212
That's it!

650
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:58,719
Don't forget, free barbecue
this afternoon at one o’clock.

651
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:00,721
Enjoy yourselves.

652
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,098
We got 'em.

653
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:10,689
No comics! No comics. No discipline.

654
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:15,986
(Whistle)

655
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,198
Water competition.
Muster up. Water competition.

656
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:22,117
Put the arrows away.
Put the bows in the tep...

657
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:33,420
That isn't funny.

658
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:34,588
(Whistle)

659
01:02:34,796 --> 01:02:36,715
Minnows, over here!

660
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,884
Come on, kids.

661
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,804
Come on, you guys.

662
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:48,310
Guppies! Come on, let’s go!
Come on, line up. That's right. Come on.

663
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:51,313
Standing in line. Straight line.

664
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:56,401
Straighten up. OK. We're gonna
have a tube race. Who's gonna win?

665
01:02:56,693 --> 01:02:58,904
- Minnows!
- (all) We are!

666
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:00,989
We are!

667
01:03:01,198 --> 01:03:03,617
All right. OK, you guys.

668
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:06,620
You cannot swim with your glasses on.

669
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:09,790
Let's turn this way now.
Buddy system. Arms up.

670
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:12,417
There we go. Stand up straight. Come on.

671
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:16,088
- Stand up straight.
- Come on, be proud you're a Guppy.

672
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:21,009
That's good. That's good.
Hold your stomach in.

673
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,513
(Dumont) Morning, campers.
Fall in back here and buddy up.

674
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,015
Mr. Dumont, we're ready for you, sir.

675
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:29,017
(Whistle)

676
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,520
Arms down!

677
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,608
All right now. This is where we separate
the tortoises from the hares,

678
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:41,196
the wheat from the chaff,
and the sinkers from the swimmers.

679
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:44,408
Salt water.

680
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,411
- What?
- I just remembered. It was salt water.

681
01:03:47,703 --> 01:03:50,497
- What was?
- In the pond at the test site.

682
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,709
- I thought it was strange, then I forgot.
- So?

683
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:58,797
Piranha are freshwater fish.
Hoak must have developed a strain

684
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:02,009
that can live both in fresh and salt.
Like salmon.

685
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:08,682
- That's why they headed downstream.
- And if they get to the ocean?

686
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:13,395
There’ll be no way to contain 'em. They’ll
be able to swim up every river system.

687
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:15,606
(shrieking)

688
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:42,299
What are you doing?
You should be in that race.

689
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:45,719
- But Betsy told me...
- I don't want to hear any excuses.

690
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:48,680
- Get a tube and get out there.
- But I hurt my knee.

691
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:50,599
On the double, camper!

692
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,818
(Whistle)

693
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,903
Listen up, you kids!

694
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:05,614
We're gonna start
the tube race in a minute.

695
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:08,408
Kathryn! McCarthy! MacBride!

696
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:11,203
All you campers, come in here.
You're too far out.

697
01:05:15,082 --> 01:05:17,292
Goddamn Sunday driver.

698
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:32,516
(Whistle)

699
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:35,519
Ready?

700
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:36,687
(bang)

701
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:56,582
(Dumont) Come on! This is a race, people!

702
01:06:26,695 --> 01:06:30,616
Jacobson, put a little muscle in it!
Parkinson, a little effort!

703
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,691
Kids, let’s get a little leg action!

704
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:16,286
(screams)

705
01:07:19,081 --> 01:07:20,707
What's the matter?

706
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:24,002
What is that?

707
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:50,487
(screams)

708
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:55,904
- Suzie! Suzie, no. Go back! Go back!
- Get on the boat.

709
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:18,510
Betsy!

710
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:24,391
Betsy!

711
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,584
Suzie!

712
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,003
Daddy!

713
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:58,800
There's a phone in there. Call the resort
and warn 'em. I’ll get the kids out.

714
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:10,395
Operator, get me the number
of the Aquarena Springs Resort.

715
01:11:10,687 --> 01:11:12,397
Look in the phone book.

716
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:16,985
Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself.
Everything's free today. Enjoy yourself.

717
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:19,279
Keep 'em moving, Terry.

718
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:24,493
Wrong away, kid. This is the exit.

719
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:30,207
- Hey, baby.
- Mr. Gardner? Mr. Gardner?

720
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:32,793
- What is it?
- Real important.

721
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:37,214
- Buck Gardner.
- Now listen to me.

722
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:41,301
This is not a crank call.
I am completely serious.

723
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:44,388
Emergency?

724
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,391
Easy. Easy.

725
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,893
I got you. I got you.

726
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:52,104
All right.

727
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:55,190
Please. Please, you've gotta believe me.

728
01:11:56,692 --> 01:12:00,195
- Thank you.
- Listen to me! Please, before it's...

729
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:02,906
Thank you. Piranha.

730
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:22,301
- They're sending an ambulance.
- We gotta drive to the resort ourselves.

731
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:25,804
- Can you handle this?
- Uh, yeah. I think so.

732
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,901
Honey, I’ll be back
for you real soon, I promise.

733
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,904
So you be brave, huh? Help out here?

734
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:46,783
That's my girl.

735
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:57,002
It's OK, Suzie.

736
01:12:57,294 --> 01:12:59,213
He'll be back.

737
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:39,002
We got plenty of targets.
Yes, sir. Right over there.

738
01:13:50,597 --> 01:13:53,308
By the way, sir, they've noticed.

739
01:13:53,517 --> 01:13:56,520
One woman recognized
the submarine ride from Florida.

740
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,398
Of course she did.
I picked it up second-hand.

741
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:03,986
Skyway's from Redondo Beach.
Boathouse is army surplus.

742
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:06,905
Dancing chickens?
From a carnival in Idaho.

743
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:09,700
Ralph the Swimming Swine?
From Atlantic City.

744
01:14:09,908 --> 01:14:13,120
They're saying, for a new resort,
nothing's looking very new.

745
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:17,291
What do they know? Ralph the Swimming
Swine's practically a national monument.

746
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,419
He's been swimming for
more years than I can remember.

747
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:25,090
The other stuff they just don't make. That
submarine ride is a piece of Americana.

748
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:26,884
Yes, sir.

749
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:29,720
- Maybe they never heard of recycling.
- I don't know.

750
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:34,183
Smile, we're goin' public.
Hello, Senator. How are you?

751
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:35,809
(siren)

752
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:47,321
If they get to the media,
we're both screwed.

753
01:14:50,407 --> 01:14:53,619
Colonel Waxman. Dr Mengers.
What a pleasant surprise.

754
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:55,787
They busted jail.

755
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,710
- They already called.
- Is your staff ready?

756
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:04,296
- They're all set.
- Call your local newspaper.

757
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:06,882
Warn 'em they might get
some crank calls.

758
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:10,219
- Wouldn’t it be better...
- You got your orders. Hop to it.

759
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:13,013
Cool it with the military crap.
I’ll take care of it.

760
01:15:13,305 --> 01:15:15,808
Whitney? Let's hop to it.

761
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:23,982
- General Waxman, it's been so long.
- It's Colonel, ma'am.

762
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:27,194
Colonel, still? Oh, I can't imagine why.

763
01:15:27,486 --> 01:15:29,780
Politics, ma'am. Politics.

764
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,910
Stupid cow.

765
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:50,509
- Ready?
- (Water-skier) OK.

766
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,397
Hey, he really does ski great.

767
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:36,198
- He's such a show-off.
- He thinks he's such hot shit.

768
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:40,202
- Maybe we're not going fast enough.
- I can fix that.

769
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:06,103
Hold it! There's something back here!

770
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:11,191
Take it in! Now!

771
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:16,613
- I think something's wrong.
- Yeah, we haven't dumped him yet.

772
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,211
Stop!

773
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:40,220
Take me in! There's something in here!
Come on! Get me outta here!

774
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:42,389
Slow down. Stop!

775
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:47,102
Faster! Don't stop!

776
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:51,315
- Wait. He says...
- No!

777
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:55,194
Speed up. Speed up!

778
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:00,407
Stop!

779
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:21,386
(siren)

780
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:40,405
(screams)

781
01:19:43,283 --> 01:19:45,786
Argh! Argh! Argh!

782
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:21,989
(screams)

783
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:40,507
Dammit!

784
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:48,015
No, Bob. It's completely false.

785
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:51,101
There's not a word
of truth to it, believe me.

786
01:20:51,393 --> 01:20:53,312
- Sir?
- I'm on the phone!

787
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:54,980
(Whispers) Piranhas.

788
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:57,399
- Don't even say that word!
- But the piranhas...

789
01:20:57,691 --> 01:21:00,819
- What about the piranhas?
- They're eating the guests, sir.

790
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:08,494
Uh...

791
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:13,916
Bob, I'm gonna have to get back to you on
this. We've got a... a situation down here.

792
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:16,001
(screams)

793
01:21:19,296 --> 01:21:21,089
(everybody screaming)

794
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:04,591
Come on. Get off! You’ll tip us over.

795
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,685
Get off!

796
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:30,701
Dammit, get off!

797
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:17,307
Where are we going?

798
01:24:17,516 --> 01:24:20,602
The lake narrows where
the outlet for the refinery was.

799
01:24:20,811 --> 01:24:23,605
They’ll be bunched tight
when they come through there.

800
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:24,982
What then?

801
01:24:25,315 --> 01:24:29,695
If it isn't tapped off, there might be
enough waste left in the smelting tanks.

802
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:32,906
- It'll kill the fish?
- It'll kill anything.

803
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:35,909
We’ll pollute the bastards to death.

804
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:46,920
Oh, Lord. No.

805
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:52,092
- What's wrong?
- It's all flooded.

806
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:55,012
The control booth is underwater.

807
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:58,182
- What can we do?
- Well, we gotta do somethin'.

808
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:01,685
- Where's that towline?
- It's in the back.

809
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:10,486
So I want you to start
counting slowly up to 100.

810
01:25:10,694 --> 01:25:15,282
Then, whether I'm up to the surface or
not, hit that throttle and get outta here.

811
01:25:15,699 --> 01:25:20,496
If I'm not up by then, I'm in trouble, cos
that's as long as I can hold my breath.

812
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:23,916
So, let’s count it down together.

813
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:25,918
- OK?
- Yeah.

814
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:27,794
- One.
- One.

815
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,213
Two.

816
01:25:29,379 --> 01:25:30,589
- Three.
- Three.

817
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:32,007
- Four.
- Four.

818
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,592
Five.

819
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,719
Six.

820
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:37,387
Seven.

821
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:31,316
48.

822
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,484
49.

823
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:33,295
63.

824
01:27:33,587 --> 01:27:34,505
64.

825
01:27:58,195 --> 01:27:59,404
82.

826
01:27:59,613 --> 01:28:00,614
83.

827
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:28,016
98.

828
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,518
99.

829
01:28:29,685 --> 01:28:31,395
100.

830
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:19,401
Paul!

831
01:29:20,694 --> 01:29:25,199
Lost River Lake.
Terror, horror, death. Film at 11.

832
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:10,702
- (man) Medic!
- (Woman) Help!

833
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:17,709
What the hell are you filming?
What the hell are you filming?!

834
01:30:27,594 --> 01:30:30,013
Try and take some.

835
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:33,183
Where do we go from here, Dr Mengers?

836
01:30:33,517 --> 01:30:37,312
I'm personally going to head
a full-scale investigation into this incident,

837
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:42,401
to discover who was responsible, and
to ensure this could never happen again.

838
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:45,404
As an expert in tropical species,
what danger is there

839
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:48,490
in the possibility of
the piranha reaching the ocean?

840
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:52,286
Oh, none. Most of them will have
been destroyed by pollution at the lake.

841
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:56,206
If any did get through, there's no way
they could survive the salt water.

842
01:30:57,499 --> 01:31:00,419
There's nothing left to fear.
