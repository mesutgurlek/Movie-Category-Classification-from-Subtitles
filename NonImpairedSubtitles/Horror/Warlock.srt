1
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:30,444
Sadie, come on.

2
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,615
Being this day, year
of our Lord 1691,

3
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:41,737
Colony of Massachusetts,

4
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,403
Township of Boston,

5
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,761
and such like, and such like.

6
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,031
There is a minister,

7
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:51,173
one who will come.

8
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:57,391
Confession may better your
chances in the hereafter.

9
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,438
It is doubtful,

10
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,778
but it may, by some
twist of fate.

11
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,894
A wealth of evidence
has convicted thee

12
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:05,810
of trafficking with the devil.

13
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,168
Thou art to be hanged...

14
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:13,269
And then burned over a
basket of living cats.

15
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,791
There is no question
left but one.

16
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:19,914
Do you choose to
admit your crimes

17
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,817
before man and God?

18
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:29,305
You'll get nothing from him.
'Tis as I said.

19
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:32,790
That's the whole of it, then.

20
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,313
Let the record show that
this obscene wretch,

21
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,295
though afforded opportunity,

22
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:41,253
did fail to confess his crimes.

23
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:44,802
Sentence shall be carried
out in timely fashion.

24
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:46,323
We stand adjourned.

25
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:06,575
Terrified, were they not?

26
00:06:06,595 --> 00:06:10,078
Bold words for a man
but hours from death.

27
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:13,582
Much can happen in a day.

28
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:16,104
Yet here have you hung for 3.

29
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:22,743
Would not Satan have saved
you were he thus inclined?

30
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,926
Perhaps he'll save
us both, Redferne.

31
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,235
I've tracked you my last.

32
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:34,737
Tomorrow shall you die.

33
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:37,259
Never was there a
brute more deserving.

34
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:41,244
Believe it upon seeing it.

35
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:42,765
Tomorrow.

36
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,767
Tomorrow.

37
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,261
The thumb locks, they
shall be kept in place

38
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:01,264
even after he is hanged,
even while he burns.

39
00:07:01,284 --> 00:07:02,765
When there is naught but ash,

40
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,787
only then should they be...

41
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,775
Only then can they be dug free

42
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:13,296
and returned to me.

43
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,086
My dear God!

44
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,092
...downed power lines
and blown-out windows.

45
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,576
Another report claims a tornado
touched down in the Malibu area,

46
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,077
but that's, as yet, unconfirmed.

47
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,580
What is certain is that
this Santa Ana condition,

48
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,582
unpredicted by forecasters,

49
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,583
is quickly living
up to its namesake

50
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,084
of the Devil's Wind.

51
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,105
Now back...

52
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,282
Was that you?

53
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,282
He's breathing.

54
00:09:59,302 --> 00:10:01,303
Watch out for the glass.

55
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:04,305
It's a wonder he didn't
cut himself worse.

56
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:08,290
Canyon Country.

57
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,311
Gets 'em all.

58
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,795
Think he's just drunk?

59
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:15,798
Hate to think he does
this kind of thing sober.

60
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:19,302
So what the heck are these?

61
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:20,323
Hey, don't touch him.

62
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:22,825
Let the cops do that stuff.

63
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:25,308
Yeah.

64
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:26,329
Right.

65
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,207
Oh, the winds.

66
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,692
Well, come on.

67
00:10:42,712 --> 00:10:44,194
Let's get him up.

68
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:45,696
Yeah, let's stick
him on the porch.

69
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:48,198
A little compassion
wouldn't hurt, Kassandra.

70
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:49,200
Or some smarts, Chas.

71
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,721
You just can't take in
every stray that you meet.

72
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,224
I took you in, didn't I?

73
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,348
No, no, no. Not the sofa.

74
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:06,370
It's over a hundred years old.

75
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:08,852
Where?

76
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:10,354
Your room.

77
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:11,355
Mine?

78
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,377
Everything's plastic.

79
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:53,899
Miraculous recovery you made.

80
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,903
Let me make a suggestion...
lose the booze, huh?

81
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:00,156
Phones are workin'.

82
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:02,525
Got someone you can call?

83
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:05,778
Could this somehow be the year?

84
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:07,780
Hey, Chas, he talks english.

85
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,301
English english.

86
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:14,420
3 centuries.

87
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,692
Oh, brother.

88
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:19,292
Look, just lie down here.

89
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:23,816
Let your big, gray
Delco recharge.

90
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,251
Jeez!

91
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,133
Oof.

92
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,156
Don't ever let me get old.

93
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,932
Jeez Louise, you scared me.

94
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,928
I'm headin' out in
a little while.

95
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,316
I'll give you a lift downtown.

96
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,961
What are you looking at?

97
00:13:57,964 --> 00:13:59,465
Oh, my ring.

98
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:01,564
I'm a Scorpio.

99
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:03,586
Or I was.

100
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:07,070
I don't believe in
astrology much anymore.

101
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,072
Truly?

102
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,593
I don't think anyone does.

103
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:14,097
I mean, it's just so Sixties.

104
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:17,580
You hungry?

105
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,602
I got plenty of extras.

106
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:24,088
Look... I'd let you try it on,

107
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,090
but, see, I broke
this little finger,

108
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,591
and now it's pretty much...

109
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:28,111
stuck.

110
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:33,097
Did I hear Kassandra say
something about England?

111
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:34,349
I was over there in '86.

112
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:37,351
I did this package thing
with, like, some friends.

113
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:40,374
We included England, Scotland...

114
00:14:51,518 --> 00:14:53,500
Help!

115
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,638
Help!

116
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:57,622
Help!

117
00:14:57,642 --> 00:14:59,124
Somebody!

118
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,645
Please!

119
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,032
Help!

120
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:08,633
Help!

121
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:10,154
No.

122
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:13,638
Please.

123
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:14,659
No!

124
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:52,178
Private clubs, ads.

125
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,202
Really, he's just a guy
I rented a room from.

126
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:58,819
If he was coming, I
was always going.

127
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,590
Did he frequent public parks?

128
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:03,573
He didn't dick little boys
through bathroom walls.

129
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:04,942
You said your roommate was gay.

130
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:08,328
Not queer. Big difference.

131
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,350
Can you give me the
names of his lovers?

132
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:16,356
Coroner's notes...

133
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:19,339
"Victim was found with
tongue severed from mouth

134
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,842
"in such a manner as to
suggest it was bitten out.

135
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:24,344
Bite marks on the back of the neck.
Evidence of..."

136
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:27,849
you about done?
I forgot my insulin.

137
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:29,967
We'd like to find this guy

138
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:31,989
before he makes an omelet out
of somebody else's tongue.

139
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,561
I'll see you!

140
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,063
Thank you.

141
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,066
Don't thank me, thank Treshar.

142
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,587
Bye-bye.

143
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:48,569
Bye-bye.

144
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:49,590
Bye, Fern.

145
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,990
You are a spiritualist?

146
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:09,725
I'm sorry.
I thought everybody left.

147
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:12,114
You hail spirits, do you not?

148
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,347
I channel them.

149
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,369
Were you at the session?

150
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,490
Then channel me a spirit.

151
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,631
Well, I really only do
grope... group sessions.

152
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,634
Group sessions.

153
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,253
Channel me a spirit.

154
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,622
Who did you have in mind?

155
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,125
Like a relative?

156
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,627
Like a father.

157
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,129
What's his name?

158
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,150
He has many.

159
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,767
I'll need one.

160
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:51,904
Zamiel.

161
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,542
Zamiel.

162
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,911
I have come...

163
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:19,413
Zamiel.

164
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:25,553
Ask me what you will.

165
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:28,055
I would ask that we wait.

166
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:31,559
For what do we wait?

167
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:34,583
For the true Zamiel to appear.

168
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:39,568
I am Zamiel...

169
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:43,572
And only when you
have cast aside

170
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:48,076
all doubts will you be able

171
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:51,599
to ask... me...

172
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,723
Able to... to...

173
00:19:03,228 --> 00:19:06,212
To... ask...

174
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,714
ask me...

175
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:09,735
ask...

176
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:27,233
Ask me what thou will.

177
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:30,236
How comes it that you
have brought me here?

178
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:35,375
Bring together that
which has been thirded.

179
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:40,380
Bring together my bible.

180
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,385
The Grand Grimoire? Here? Now?

181
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:48,889
By a resourceful witch,

182
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:52,913
it could be retaken.

183
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,762
My efforts...

184
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:57,764
How might they be rewarded?

185
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:01,170
Service to Satan is reward!

186
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,270
For others surely,

187
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,795
but for that most cunning witch
who steals back your bible,

188
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:10,778
the book that can
thwart creation itself,

189
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:12,299
what for him?

190
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:17,669
Do what I demand.

191
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:21,172
Bring together all 3 parts,

192
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:24,676
and you shall be him.

193
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:26,678
Him?

194
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:31,703
The one begotten son.

195
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,552
It shall be me.

196
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:39,828
Let mine eyes guide thee.

197
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:07,146
Did he bleed?

198
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,148
The one who wore these,
did he bleed whatsoe'er.

199
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:16,657
No. No.

200
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,291
Stop.

201
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:22,546
Get off.

202
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:25,048
He was here.

203
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:27,030
His signature I know.

204
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,053
But I can find the beast
only if his blood was spilt.

205
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,682
He came through this
window, did he not?

206
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:43,183
Landing here.

207
00:23:44,184 --> 00:23:45,667
The blond-haired guy?

208
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:46,801
Him?

209
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:47,822
Was he cut?

210
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:52,827
Show me where.

211
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,853
This may do.

212
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:43,108
Police emergency.

213
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:46,111
Yeah. Some guy's in
the house with me.

214
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,114
I don't know how
dangerous he is,

215
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:50,116
but he's got a thing for blood.

216
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:52,118
You know.
Draw your own conclusions.

217
00:24:52,138 --> 00:24:54,120
I've got your address
on the screen.

218
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,121
3237 Woodburn.

219
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:56,623
Can I have your name?

220
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:58,124
Kassandra with a "K."

221
00:24:58,144 --> 00:25:00,126
We'll have a car there
in a few minutes.

222
00:25:00,146 --> 00:25:02,128
Don't expect me to be
waiting around for you

223
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:04,150
'cause I'm skating right now.

224
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:07,654
Your well, where would it be?

225
00:25:08,021 --> 00:25:09,502
My whale?

226
00:25:09,522 --> 00:25:11,004
Your well... the place
you draw water.

227
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:12,525
Oh, sure.

228
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:15,027
My well.

229
00:25:46,394 --> 00:25:49,898
Now, brute, one last time
will we play the game out.

230
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:55,384
What is it?

231
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:57,270
Please, do not even
breathe on it.

232
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,770
Some kind of compass?

233
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,272
Witch compass.

234
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,773
This one here?

235
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:02,794
What of it?

236
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,276
What is it?

237
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,278
As I say, 'tis a witch compass.

238
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,279
Ohh.

239
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,781
You mean witch...

240
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,283
Not which.

241
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,785
Like Samantha, Tabitha witch.

242
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,306
Like the warlock.

243
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,312
Th-that guy was a warlock?

244
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,815
The rudest that ever
troubled daylight.

245
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,819
And this little jobber's
going to find him, right?

246
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,303
The needle shall point
up his direction.

247
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,325
The quicker it swings,
the closer is he.

248
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,326
The slower, the more distant.

249
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,829
Way cool.

250
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,712
What a cup of shit.

251
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:54,695
This isn't gonna work.

252
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:55,696
Give it time.

253
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:57,718
The blood was thin.

254
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,221
Time's something you
ain't got, Buddy.

255
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,103
Though first I did think
this was Newcastle

256
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:21,105
or a township of the Carolinas,

257
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:23,608
I think I'm farther removed.

258
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:24,629
Much farther.

259
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:32,233
Hey, somebody's coming out.

260
00:27:32,253 --> 00:27:34,235
Freeze, police!

261
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:35,737
Watch his hands.

262
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:37,258
Watch it!

263
00:27:44,015 --> 00:27:45,516
He lays waste to
all in his path.

264
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:48,500
The place matters not.

265
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,021
Hear me when I say he's evil.

266
00:27:50,522 --> 00:27:51,503
Evil absolute.

267
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:53,525
We'll run him down
to the station,

268
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:54,640
but in the meantime,
here's some advice.

269
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,142
Get away from this house.

270
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:57,510
You got a watch?

271
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,511
Yeah.

272
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,532
Time me.

273
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,282
You've reached 911
police emergency.

274
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:41,284
Please stand by.

275
00:29:41,304 --> 00:29:43,285
Your call will be handled

276
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:45,190
as soon as an operator
becomes available.

277
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:48,310
Ohh!

278
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:06,004
Tout, tout, through and about,

279
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:08,006
your callow life in dismay.

280
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:12,010
Rentum oscillum tormentum.

281
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,782
A decade twice over a day.

282
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:04,263
This guy put some kind of
hoodoo hex spell on me.

283
00:32:04,283 --> 00:32:06,286
He made me 40 instead of 20.

284
00:32:07,287 --> 00:32:08,769
Is that what this guy did?

285
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:10,791
There's no crime of
which he's incapable.

286
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:17,911
Hey, hey, uh... ahem.

287
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:19,933
Other door, ok?

288
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,051
Other door.

289
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:32,195
Not a local product, are you?

290
00:32:36,317 --> 00:32:37,318
Too late!

291
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:38,820
The evil one is back!

292
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:42,303
It's too late!

293
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:45,576
16 hundred and 91?

294
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:46,327
Aye.

295
00:32:46,828 --> 00:32:49,310
Like almost 300 years ago?

296
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,333
As queer it seems to you,
'tis even more so to me.

297
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:58,839
He did this?

298
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,323
20 fuckin' years,
and not one party.

299
00:33:02,343 --> 00:33:03,844
What a total ass-burn.

300
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:06,828
The altar table, he broked it?

301
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:08,330
Yeah, he broked it.

302
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,734
Hey, look, I didn't spring you

303
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:11,834
so you could come fix furniture.

304
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:13,238
What about me?
How do we fix my face?

305
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:14,721
What was it he took from you?

306
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:16,742
20 years.

307
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:17,840
An object.

308
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,341
What kind of object?

309
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:22,364
Something small.
Something personal to you.

310
00:33:22,748 --> 00:33:23,729
My bracelet.

311
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:24,730
Like that?

312
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,251
He took my charm bracelet.

313
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:27,369
Then you must reclaim it.

314
00:33:28,871 --> 00:33:30,873
Only then can the
spell be countered.

315
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:33,355
Reclaim it?

316
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,358
This I spied earlier.

317
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:38,380
'Tis yours? The whole of it?

318
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:40,383
Just salt.

319
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:41,885
We'll take your coach.

320
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:44,888
We'll take a minute here.

321
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:51,374
Do you mean I gotta
get my bracelet back

322
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:52,876
to break the spell?

323
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,897
Back from that warlock...

324
00:33:54,397 --> 00:33:55,879
the guy who finger-paints
with body fluids?

325
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:57,380
'Tis the one way.

326
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,882
This you must do.

327
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:00,884
There is no question of it.

328
00:34:00,904 --> 00:34:02,019
You see this? Insulin.

329
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,520
It's the one thing I must do.

330
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,159
I hate it 'cause
I have to do it!

331
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:09,545
I'll just cut and
dye my hair again.

332
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:13,030
Hey, 40 ain't so bad.

333
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,282
I'll buy a little tennis skirt

334
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,783
and prance around town

335
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,304
like those bitches
in their BMWs.

336
00:34:19,306 --> 00:34:20,286
Sorry, Redferne,

337
00:34:20,306 --> 00:34:22,290
but if you're nuts enough
to wanna find this guy,

338
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,791
you're on your own.

339
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,313
You realize not.

340
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:29,296
Realize?

341
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:30,297
What?

342
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:32,299
What the spell has done.

343
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:34,301
It's aged me 20 years.

344
00:34:34,321 --> 00:34:35,803
Not aged.

345
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,824
Aging.

346
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,307
Are you saying that tomorrow

347
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:43,311
I'm gonna wake up...60?

348
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,813
I say this.

349
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,816
Unless you find the warlock
and thereby your bracelet,

350
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,337
you shall die in
but half a week.

351
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:51,820
Die?

352
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,841
Of old age.

353
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,950
That didn't help.

354
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,971
Let's tarry not.

355
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,975
Hey, let's get things straight.

356
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,980
All I want is the bracelet.

357
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,463
I don't give a sailing
shit what he did to you.

358
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,348
Look...

359
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,870
Soon as I'm 20 again,
you are on your own,

360
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,372
got that, Bud?

361
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,536
Look, if you're hungry,
we'll just stop.

362
00:36:14,926 --> 00:36:17,929
Ok, what are you doing?

363
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,912
Salting the leather.

364
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:22,433
No kidding.

365
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:25,416
How come?

366
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:27,919
Witches loathe salt.

367
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:30,421
Don't blame 'em.
Salt, sugar, sulfites.

368
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:32,443
All that shit will kill you.

369
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,181
Tell me...

370
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,203
Must we travel on just
one side of the roadway,

371
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:44,205
or is it whichever we choose?

372
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:45,938
Yeah. It's just one side.

373
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,940
Which side might that be?

374
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,461
The right side.

375
00:36:51,463 --> 00:36:53,312
Let your attention
lie before you,

376
00:36:53,332 --> 00:36:54,833
not beside you.

377
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:57,816
Check this.
Some guy from the 17th century

378
00:36:57,836 --> 00:36:59,838
teaching me how to drive.

379
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,340
How quick they learn.

380
00:37:06,345 --> 00:37:08,327
He's gotta go deep.

381
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:10,329
He's gotta go deep.

382
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:12,831
He needs 10 yards. It's fourth.

383
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:14,333
It's fourth and 10.

384
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:15,834
He's going!

385
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:17,337
He hikes the ball,

386
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:18,338
throws it.

387
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:19,839
Good!

388
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,341
Gets it again.

389
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:23,343
Gets it again. Makes a pass!

390
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:24,364
Throws it up.

391
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,484
When you pass,

392
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:33,486
you can't let those
little stick guys

393
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:34,988
get between you
and the receiver,

394
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:36,509
or else they'll keep
intercepting, ok?

395
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,858
Yeah! 6 points!

396
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:41,380
Now I kick off to you.

397
00:37:45,385 --> 00:37:47,500
You can't punt on first down.

398
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,023
Nobody does that,
not even Tampa Bay.

399
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:54,258
Don't you watch football?

400
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:56,260
Whence comes it?

401
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,397
Huh?

402
00:37:57,898 --> 00:37:58,879
The music.

403
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:01,401
Oh, there's a church over there.

404
00:38:04,155 --> 00:38:05,656
And how is it you're not there?

405
00:38:06,157 --> 00:38:07,158
Oh, I never go.

406
00:38:07,658 --> 00:38:09,140
My dad hates all that stuff

407
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,661
about Jesus and the
12 apostrophes.

408
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:12,527
Aw! Intercepted.

409
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:14,548
Your turn.

410
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:17,531
How come you're not there?

411
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:18,532
Church?

412
00:38:18,552 --> 00:38:20,035
Yeah. It's Sunday.

413
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:23,038
No witch can set foot
on church ground.

414
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:25,040
Ha. You're telling
me you're a witch?

415
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,042
You ain't no witch.
Witches are girls.

416
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:29,044
Some are men.

417
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:32,047
Yeah?
So where's your broomstick?

418
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:34,049
Witches fly on broomsticks.

419
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:36,551
Didn't you never see
the Wizard of Oz?

420
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:39,054
I need no broomstick to fly.

421
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:40,555
Yeah?

422
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:42,076
What do you need?

423
00:39:09,939 --> 00:39:11,440
You take Mastercard?

424
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:14,040
With plenty of I.D. We do.

425
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,541
20th century money. Great shit.

426
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,043
Spend as much as you want

427
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,564
till you hit your limit.

428
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,569
Then you've got
50 bucks a whack.

429
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:43,954
What was that?

430
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:45,976
Fellas up in the hills
hunting coyote.

431
00:39:51,231 --> 00:39:53,233
You eat coyote around here, huh?

432
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:55,236
Well, a boy over at
the trailer park

433
00:39:55,737 --> 00:39:56,738
was killed by one.

434
00:39:57,238 --> 00:39:58,239
They do that sometimes.

435
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,241
A coyote will come down,
drag off a small child.

436
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:02,224
Boy was fairly well
chewed up, so I hear.

437
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:03,744
Skin taken clean off.

438
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,384
Pray, wait.

439
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:29,888
It was your son...
the boy killed?

440
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:33,893
For your loss I grieve...

441
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,877
But I have need
to ask one thing.

442
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:39,879
Had he been baptized?

443
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:40,630
Who are you?

444
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,150
Why are you asking me this?

445
00:40:42,535 --> 00:40:44,537
Was the boy baptized?

446
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:46,385
No.

447
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,407
His father wouldn't allow it.

448
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:53,392
So...

449
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:54,393
Clue me.

450
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:56,396
The warlock will
travel swifter now.

451
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:57,917
I'm not tracking here.

452
00:40:58,418 --> 00:40:59,900
You think he killed the kid?

453
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,902
Of all ingredients
used by a witch,

454
00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:03,403
the most coveted is human fat.

455
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:05,906
If that fat is cut from
an unbaptized male child,

456
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:08,408
there is but one purpose,
one thing it will beget.

457
00:41:08,428 --> 00:41:10,410
I'm listening.

458
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,931
Flying potion.

459
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:05,467
You got KKTY, Tucson,

460
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:06,969
ridin' shotgun and
keepin' you company...

461
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:08,971
No little people inside.

462
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:10,472
Oh, I gathered.

463
00:42:10,492 --> 00:42:11,974
Wanna know how it works?

464
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:13,976
If 'twill help find the warlock.

465
00:42:13,996 --> 00:42:15,497
Highly doubtful.

466
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:17,980
Hey, you know the
earth is round?

467
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,482
For some years now.

468
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:21,984
Ask me anything.

469
00:42:22,004 --> 00:42:24,486
I took 2 years of high school.

470
00:42:24,506 --> 00:42:27,008
Come on. Ask me something.

471
00:42:30,013 --> 00:42:31,995
Why is it you paint your face?

472
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:34,497
Nothing wrong with
a little makeup.

473
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:35,999
Especially now.

474
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:38,501
Satanists paint their
faces, not goodly women.

475
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:40,136
Are you saying in 1691

476
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:41,638
gals didn't wear any makeup?

477
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:42,659
If my Marion had but...

478
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,143
nay, goodly women do
not paint themselves.

479
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,665
You married way back there?

480
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:54,150
Well, you just said "my Marion."

481
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,652
Who's she?

482
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:57,153
We need new bearing.

483
00:42:57,173 --> 00:42:58,154
Your sister?

484
00:42:58,174 --> 00:42:59,656
Pray, stop the coach.

485
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:01,158
Some squeeze? Stop here.

486
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,160
Who the shit's Marion?

487
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,047
Stop!

488
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:17,060
Ohh, think then
talk, banana brain.

489
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,568
God.

490
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,073
Oh, God.

491
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:34,079
Ohh...

492
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,080
God.

493
00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:52,347
Ohh.

494
00:44:00,605 --> 00:44:03,222
Go on. Go without me.

495
00:44:03,242 --> 00:44:05,224
I don't wanna know
how bad it is.

496
00:44:05,244 --> 00:44:06,726
Please.

497
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:07,728
Please, don't look.

498
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:09,749
Please. No.

499
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,732
Oh, my...

500
00:44:12,752 --> 00:44:15,254
Why couldn't he just kill me?

501
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:19,605
Nothing could be
worse than this.

502
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,760
His very thought.

503
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:25,840
The cream's gone bad.

504
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,841
Couldn't be.

505
00:45:26,861 --> 00:45:28,342
I brought it in just yesterday.

506
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:29,363
Want to taste it?

507
00:45:29,864 --> 00:45:31,346
Nah, I got a lot of
work to do, dad.

508
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,847
If you're done helping Elsie,

509
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:35,119
maybe you can turn out
the horse for me.

510
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:47,265
Hey.

511
00:45:47,766 --> 00:45:49,267
Hey.

512
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,034
Come on, hurry up!

513
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:09,539
I'm gonna beat you!

514
00:46:31,177 --> 00:46:33,159
Can I ask you a question?

515
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:35,662
Will you please not have
a meltdown this time?

516
00:46:35,682 --> 00:46:36,683
Ask.

517
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:38,434
Who's Marion?

518
00:46:40,938 --> 00:46:43,921
That's why you're after
the warlock, isn't it?

519
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:46,924
Yesterday, you cared not
to know such things.

520
00:46:46,944 --> 00:46:49,446
Yesterday was 20 years ago.

521
00:46:51,448 --> 00:46:52,429
She...

522
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:54,431
She was...

523
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:55,933
Your age...

524
00:46:55,953 --> 00:46:57,454
your true age.

525
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:00,958
What a blessed vision.

526
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:04,441
A soul as pure as God's own,

527
00:47:04,461 --> 00:47:05,962
my Marion.

528
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:09,466
She was my good wife.

529
00:47:09,717 --> 00:47:11,200
I thought you said
you weren't married.

530
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,585
'Twas long ago,

531
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:15,086
even before here I came.

532
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:17,608
What happened to her?

533
00:47:21,613 --> 00:47:23,615
The warlock happened.

534
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:44,150
Pray, stop the car.

535
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,150
What's the matter?

536
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,172
Pray, I bid you,
stop the car, girl!

537
00:47:52,178 --> 00:47:53,659
Redferne. The compass.

538
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:54,660
Leave it!

539
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,046
If God stands with us,
we'll need it no more!

540
00:47:57,066 --> 00:47:59,068
We didn't find him yet, did we?

541
00:48:02,688 --> 00:48:04,690
Well, would you look at this?

542
00:48:05,191 --> 00:48:05,691
Hmm?

543
00:48:06,192 --> 00:48:07,193
The bread. Didn't rise.

544
00:48:07,693 --> 00:48:08,694
Browned, but it didn't rise.

545
00:48:09,195 --> 00:48:10,676
Must've forgotten to...

546
00:48:10,696 --> 00:48:12,581
tell me your woes.

547
00:48:12,948 --> 00:48:14,450
You are bewitched.

548
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:15,952
Who are you?

549
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:18,068
The hex mark, is it
yours, or is it not?

550
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:19,320
Hex mark? What?

551
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,321
I haven't seen a hex
mark in 30 years.

552
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:22,342
The mark is mine.

553
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,941
Amish?

554
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:26,345
Mennonite.

555
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:30,851
And we are bewitched.

556
00:48:36,223 --> 00:48:37,224
From there.

557
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:39,589
Hither has he come.

558
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:40,610
Hammer, nails.

559
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:57,475
Dad, what the devil do
you think you're doing?

560
00:48:57,495 --> 00:48:58,746
Who are these people?

561
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:00,862
If there are children
present, make them absent.

562
00:49:00,882 --> 00:49:02,383
Take them and leave.

563
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,482
Leave? Wait a minute.
I got a schedule to keep.

564
00:49:04,502 --> 00:49:06,984
I can't just traipse off
and turn this place over...

565
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:08,486
listen to me.

566
00:49:08,506 --> 00:49:10,488
The horse that sweats
in the morning,

567
00:49:10,508 --> 00:49:11,989
cream that sours overnight.

568
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:13,510
You know the signs.

569
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:16,264
We both know.

570
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:27,776
Fix these pennies here.

571
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:31,780
'Twill ward off
any errant magic.

572
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:33,762
On my word,

573
00:49:33,782 --> 00:49:35,264
close and brace the stairs.

574
00:49:35,284 --> 00:49:38,267
You must open them
only when I say.

575
00:49:38,287 --> 00:49:40,269
And should ever
your eyes meet his,

576
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:41,770
never show him no fear.

577
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,792
'Tis the air he breathes.

578
00:50:03,313 --> 00:50:04,314
Hey.

579
00:50:06,316 --> 00:50:08,201
Careful.

580
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:39,879
He was here.

581
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:23,925
"Mortes datoris antipueris."

582
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:39,440
He's come for it.

583
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:42,924
Blessings of heaven,

584
00:52:42,944 --> 00:52:44,445
'tis the Grand
Grimoire he's after!

585
00:52:46,948 --> 00:52:48,546
The spell book.

586
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:51,549
All witches keep grimoires,
yet one is indestructible.

587
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:53,551
One is the bible of black magic.

588
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,554
The Grand Grimoire.

589
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:57,523
Always witches have
lusted for it.

590
00:52:57,543 --> 00:52:59,525
And now here I find a page.

591
00:52:59,545 --> 00:53:01,527
One lone page.

592
00:53:01,547 --> 00:53:04,029
'Twas last held by
a Boston church.

593
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:05,531
The West End Church.

594
00:53:05,551 --> 00:53:07,533
I had urged them
to third the book,

595
00:53:07,553 --> 00:53:09,535
thus thirding the chance
of a witch thieving it.

596
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:11,538
But the pages were to be
kept on hallowed ground,

597
00:53:11,558 --> 00:53:13,559
not scattered about
the landside like...

598
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:14,559
where's the warlock?

599
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:15,560
He's fled.

600
00:53:16,061 --> 00:53:17,062
I don't get it.

601
00:53:17,563 --> 00:53:19,545
If thing is so
bitchin' to witches,

602
00:53:19,565 --> 00:53:21,046
why would he leave a page?

603
00:53:21,066 --> 00:53:22,567
Even just a page.

604
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:27,573
He would not.

605
00:53:29,075 --> 00:53:30,076
The steps!

606
00:53:45,792 --> 00:53:48,294
Of all the curiosities
here I've seen,

607
00:53:48,795 --> 00:53:51,277
none have surprised
me more than this.

608
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:52,298
The brace!

609
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:59,807
Forgotten witches fly?

610
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:04,194
I forget nothing.

611
00:54:06,197 --> 00:54:09,700
Who appointed you
executioner, Redferne?

612
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:11,702
'Twas you yourself...

613
00:54:12,203 --> 00:54:14,205
When one life too many

614
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:15,706
you did steal.

615
00:54:32,224 --> 00:54:35,727
It seems even 2 thirds
can work marvels.

616
00:55:47,668 --> 00:55:49,169
Why'd you let him go?

617
00:56:14,445 --> 00:56:15,696
Yes!

618
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:45,944
Remove his boots! His boots!

619
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,822
Where's my goddamn bracelet?

620
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:01,076
Ew!

621
00:57:02,578 --> 00:57:04,581
Hold his toe.

622
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:12,589
Where's my goddamn bracelet?

623
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:15,539
Nay. Look not in his eyes!

624
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:17,060
Nay!

625
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,574
Oh.

626
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,565
He's getting away!

627
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:42,567
Keys. Find me brass keys.

628
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:44,068
With them I can remove this hex.

629
00:57:44,088 --> 00:57:45,937
The warlock. You can't just
let him blow out of here.

630
00:57:45,957 --> 00:57:47,959
He'll die should I leave!

631
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,462
The hammer!

632
00:57:51,712 --> 00:57:52,693
Take it.

633
00:57:52,713 --> 00:57:55,098
Where you find his tracks,
nail the earth deeply.

634
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,081
A nail. Shitty little nail!

635
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:58,583
Give me a shotgun, then I'll...

636
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:00,084
take the blessed hammer!

637
00:58:00,104 --> 00:58:01,605
He can be crippled!

638
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:24,879
Nails.

639
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,918
Help you?

640
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,288
No, no.

641
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:31,718
Feel.

642
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:35,971
Mmm.

643
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:39,956
The keys should be spun
once each hour, clockwise.

644
01:02:39,976 --> 01:02:41,457
Meddle not with the dressing.

645
01:02:41,477 --> 01:02:44,460
By morn' the blood shall stop.

646
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,481
How's he doing?

647
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:53,490
I have no excuse.

648
01:02:53,991 --> 01:02:56,974
Safe to say that having
seen so many die

649
01:02:56,994 --> 01:02:57,995
by the warlock's hand,

650
01:02:58,495 --> 01:03:00,978
the chance to spare just
one life with mine own...

651
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:01,999
forget it.

652
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:03,347
I understand.

653
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:04,348
Besides...

654
01:03:04,368 --> 01:03:06,370
I got it back.

655
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,371
Then let's tarry not.

656
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,010
We'll rebuild the compass.

657
01:03:15,512 --> 01:03:17,514
Brass, copper, glass.

658
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:21,019
'Tis this, his blood,
that matters most.

659
01:03:27,142 --> 01:03:28,623
Here.

660
01:03:28,643 --> 01:03:30,144
And here.

661
01:03:30,645 --> 01:03:32,127
You've watched me long enough.

662
01:03:32,147 --> 01:03:33,127
The gas is on the right,

663
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:34,128
the brake's on the left.

664
01:03:34,148 --> 01:03:35,631
It's more than I knew
when I started to drive.

665
01:03:35,651 --> 01:03:37,132
Drive, me?

666
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:38,633
And take this. It's for gas.

667
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:40,135
When they give you
the slip of paper,

668
01:03:40,155 --> 01:03:41,137
just scribble a name.

669
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:43,158
Any name. They never check.

670
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,273
You're not coming?

671
01:03:44,293 --> 01:03:45,774
Look, you got my car, my money...

672
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:49,297
My best wishes.

673
01:03:49,414 --> 01:03:51,397
Later days, Redferne.

674
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,032
We had a deal, remember?

675
01:03:53,052 --> 01:03:55,034
Just till I got
my bracelet back.

676
01:03:55,054 --> 01:03:56,535
That was it, man.

677
01:03:56,555 --> 01:03:57,556
That was it.

678
01:03:57,807 --> 01:03:59,288
You know what he's capable of.

679
01:03:59,308 --> 01:04:00,790
You've seen.

680
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,541
Why do you think I'm not going?

681
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:04,679
What are you called?

682
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:07,663
It's a little late for
introductions, ain't it?

683
01:04:07,683 --> 01:04:09,165
Your name.

684
01:04:09,185 --> 01:04:10,666
Kassandra with a "K."

685
01:04:10,686 --> 01:04:11,666
Then hear me well,

686
01:04:11,686 --> 01:04:12,802
Kassandra with a "K."

687
01:04:12,822 --> 01:04:15,805
The warlock holds 2
parts of the book.

688
01:04:15,825 --> 01:04:17,326
This much he confessed.

689
01:04:17,827 --> 01:04:20,810
Know you what happens
should he gain all 3?

690
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:23,083
I don't want to know.

691
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,431
I don't.

692
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:26,933
Hidden within that book
is the name of God.

693
01:04:26,953 --> 01:04:28,435
The lost name of God.

694
01:04:28,455 --> 01:04:30,957
The lost name of...

695
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,961
Uh-uh.

696
01:04:35,462 --> 01:04:36,943
I don't want to hear this.

697
01:04:36,963 --> 01:04:39,446
'Tis the name invoked
during creation.

698
01:04:39,466 --> 01:04:42,949
Witches charge that
should this name,

699
01:04:42,969 --> 01:04:45,952
this true name of God, be
uttered back to front...

700
01:04:45,972 --> 01:04:47,454
I'm not listening.
LA LA LA LA LA...

701
01:04:47,474 --> 01:04:49,456
Should this name be
uttered in reverse,

702
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:53,481
all creation will undo.
'Twill reverse.

703
01:04:55,483 --> 01:04:57,465
We'll uncreate?

704
01:04:57,485 --> 01:04:58,966
That what you're telling me?

705
01:04:58,986 --> 01:04:59,968
The whole world just...

706
01:04:59,988 --> 01:05:03,221
all worlds, Kassandra. All.

707
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:04,242
Ohh.

708
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:11,112
He scares the crap out of me,

709
01:05:11,132 --> 01:05:12,133
and he knows it.

710
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,982
I'll not let him harm you.

711
01:05:15,002 --> 01:05:17,985
Next time there won't
be any spells.

712
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:19,487
No hexes, no potions.

713
01:05:19,507 --> 01:05:22,009
Next time he's gonna kill me.

714
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:25,013
I'll not let him harm you.

715
01:05:35,858 --> 01:05:36,973
We travel north?

716
01:05:36,993 --> 01:05:38,474
Trust me on this, ok?

717
01:05:38,494 --> 01:05:40,476
But if all along the
warlock has borne east...

718
01:05:40,496 --> 01:05:42,477
we're not going to play tag
with this guy anymore.

719
01:05:42,497 --> 01:05:43,499
What would you have us do?

720
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:45,481
Did kids in 1691
ever play a game

721
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:47,503
where they jump over
someone else's back?

722
01:05:48,003 --> 01:05:48,984
Leaping frog?

723
01:05:49,004 --> 01:05:50,986
There you go.
Instead of tag, we play leapfrog.

724
01:05:51,006 --> 01:05:52,488
When we get to that
church in Boston

725
01:05:52,508 --> 01:05:53,989
they got to have records, right?

726
01:05:54,009 --> 01:05:54,991
Forget the warlock.

727
01:05:55,011 --> 01:05:57,494
We'll find the last part
of the book instead.

728
01:05:57,514 --> 01:05:59,883
But what happens if the
church is no longer standing?

729
01:06:01,885 --> 01:06:02,886
I didn't shoot your
plan full of holes.

730
01:06:05,388 --> 01:06:08,004
Is that, like, the
old West End Church,

731
01:06:08,024 --> 01:06:09,525
or is that the new
West End Church?

732
01:06:11,394 --> 01:06:12,876
The one on Somerset Avenue?

733
01:06:12,896 --> 01:06:14,377
Nay. 'Twould be Somerset Road.

734
01:06:14,397 --> 01:06:15,898
Oh! Close enough.

735
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,401
Thanks, operator.

736
01:06:22,906 --> 01:06:24,908
Still got that knife?

737
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,391
Give me it.

738
01:06:27,411 --> 01:06:28,392
My bodkin?

739
01:06:28,412 --> 01:06:30,394
No, your knife.

740
01:06:30,414 --> 01:06:33,898
Come on. We'll check it with my bag.
It's ok.

741
01:06:33,918 --> 01:06:34,899
Ok.

742
01:06:34,919 --> 01:06:35,920
Um...

743
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:38,403
Ok, how about that whip?

744
01:06:38,423 --> 01:06:39,403
What of it?

745
01:06:39,423 --> 01:06:40,905
They're not going to let
you on board with that.

746
01:06:40,925 --> 01:06:42,426
On board what?

747
01:06:42,676 --> 01:06:45,178
Just give me the whip, ok?

748
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:50,818
That comes to $596.36.

749
01:06:51,318 --> 01:06:52,800
Cash, check, or charge?

750
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:53,801
Charge...

751
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:55,322
I think.

752
01:06:58,326 --> 01:06:59,808
Excuse me. Gate 40?

753
01:06:59,828 --> 01:07:01,579
Sure. Just go down the
hall, turn right,

754
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,178
then through the double
doors on your left.

755
01:07:03,198 --> 01:07:04,199
Thanks.

756
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:08,202
Oh, no.

757
01:07:09,704 --> 01:07:11,186
The computer must be down.

758
01:07:11,206 --> 01:07:12,840
Timing, huh?

759
01:07:14,843 --> 01:07:15,710
You know, we better hurry,

760
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:19,214
or we're going to
miss this plane.

761
01:07:22,217 --> 01:07:23,218
Redferne?

762
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:25,220
Come on, let's tarry not.

763
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,701
What...

764
01:07:26,721 --> 01:07:28,703
these winged machines...

765
01:07:28,723 --> 01:07:30,206
the ones that thunder...

766
01:07:30,226 --> 01:07:31,207
Planes.

767
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:33,709
But men travel inside them...

768
01:07:33,729 --> 01:07:34,711
Through the air?

769
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:36,732
Men like us. Come on.

770
01:07:37,233 --> 01:07:38,714
Oh, no, no.

771
01:07:38,734 --> 01:07:40,216
Look, you...

772
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:41,716
In my day, those even
endeavoring to fly

773
01:07:41,736 --> 01:07:42,717
are accused of witchery.

774
01:07:42,737 --> 01:07:43,739
No, no, look yourself, ok?

775
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,721
The book is in Boston.

776
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:46,723
That means we got
to beam out there

777
01:07:46,743 --> 01:07:48,224
and find someone who knows.

778
01:07:48,244 --> 01:07:50,226
My boots work best with
ground beneath them.

779
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:51,226
Directly beneath.

780
01:07:51,246 --> 01:07:52,729
What am I going to
have to do here?

781
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:54,730
Hold your...

782
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,732
oh, shit.

783
01:07:56,752 --> 01:07:57,753
Where did you get this?

784
01:07:58,254 --> 01:07:59,235
The farmhouse.

785
01:07:59,255 --> 01:08:00,757
I know, but you're going
to have to leave it here.

786
01:08:01,008 --> 01:08:02,489
I'll not abandon
my every weapon.

787
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:03,490
Look...

788
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:04,492
We're going to miss our plane.

789
01:08:04,512 --> 01:08:05,492
Give it to me.

790
01:08:05,512 --> 01:08:06,493
I'll not.

791
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:07,878
Look, Buster,

792
01:08:07,898 --> 01:08:08,880
I'm in charge of
this safari now,

793
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,401
and if I say you're going to...

794
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:16,023
keep it. Keep it?

795
01:08:16,523 --> 01:08:19,025
Quit arguing with me
and just keep it!

796
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:24,914
Boston.

797
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:47,168
Looks like you just made it.

798
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:48,670
You're telling me.

799
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:49,672
Can I take that for you?

800
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:51,693
Over my rotting corpse.

801
01:08:54,195 --> 01:08:55,677
Family heirloom.

802
01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:56,698
Ah.

803
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:18,386
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

804
01:09:18,887 --> 01:09:19,868
Hey.

805
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:20,889
Like this.

806
01:09:23,892 --> 01:09:25,874
Get passive, huh?

807
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:29,397
You can actually get
some sleep here.

808
01:10:00,547 --> 01:10:02,028
What now?

809
01:10:02,048 --> 01:10:03,530
There's a witch among us.

810
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:04,531
Set me free.

811
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:06,033
The vane.

812
01:10:06,053 --> 01:10:07,035
Where did that wench
put the vane?

813
01:10:07,055 --> 01:10:09,036
Wait. Take a minute here, huh?

814
01:10:09,056 --> 01:10:10,538
We're, like, 39 million
feet in the air.

815
01:10:10,558 --> 01:10:12,560
There's no way he
could be on board.

816
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,042
Cream that spoils,

817
01:10:14,062 --> 01:10:15,543
a flame that burns pure blue...

818
01:10:15,563 --> 01:10:17,545
there's no way, Redferne.

819
01:10:17,565 --> 01:10:19,046
I know all the signs!

820
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:21,048
Look, I know he's not here.

821
01:10:21,068 --> 01:10:23,551
How?

822
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:25,573
How is it you're so sure?

823
01:10:27,074 --> 01:10:28,055
You saw him.

824
01:10:28,075 --> 01:10:30,057
We're after the book now.
Remember?

825
01:10:30,077 --> 01:10:32,059
You saw him, and
you told me not!

826
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:34,061
We left him behind, Redferne.

827
01:10:34,081 --> 01:10:36,565
Look, we're halfway to Boston.

828
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:38,067
He's back there beeping
the X-ray machines.

829
01:10:38,087 --> 01:10:39,587
Forget him, ok?

830
01:10:39,721 --> 01:10:41,339
He's with us still.

831
01:10:42,841 --> 01:10:45,323
Now I'll search thither.

832
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:46,825
You, thither.

833
01:10:46,845 --> 01:10:48,326
Keep your wits about you...

834
01:10:48,346 --> 01:10:50,348
Such as they are.

835
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:49,542
Excuse me.

836
01:11:52,546 --> 01:11:54,027
Well?

837
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:55,529
I cannot reason this.

838
01:11:55,549 --> 01:11:57,030
There is witchery afoot.

839
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:00,033
I draw breath and taste it.

840
01:12:00,053 --> 01:12:03,036
Maybe there's another
witch afoot.

841
01:12:03,056 --> 01:12:04,538
Could be, like, Glenda,

842
01:12:04,558 --> 01:12:05,559
Good Witch of the West.

843
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:07,060
A good witch?

844
01:12:09,062 --> 01:12:10,564
Sweet dreams, Redferne.

845
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:16,070
Good witch.

846
01:13:19,052 --> 01:13:21,034
Let me guess...
California, right?

847
01:13:21,054 --> 01:13:22,555
How'd you know?

848
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:25,539
Bear to your left.

849
01:13:25,559 --> 01:13:26,540
What?

850
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,542
'Twas Boston common
we just now passed?

851
01:13:28,562 --> 01:13:29,543
Yeah.

852
01:13:29,563 --> 01:13:32,045
And we travel north
on Tremont Road?

853
01:13:32,065 --> 01:13:33,047
Yeah, we're on Tremont.

854
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:34,915
Then bear west.

855
01:13:34,935 --> 01:13:36,917
The church lies not far off.

856
01:13:36,937 --> 01:13:38,418
Think I'll keep going this way,

857
01:13:38,438 --> 01:13:39,920
loop around onto Cambridge.

858
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:40,920
Nay, turn here. Here!

859
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:41,923
Hey, look, pal,

860
01:13:41,943 --> 01:13:43,423
I know this town pretty good.

861
01:13:43,443 --> 01:13:45,927
I've lived here since 1958.

862
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:47,428
How about you?

863
01:13:47,448 --> 01:13:48,930
Don't answer that.

864
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:52,433
Lest you favor throttlings
to the ears and face,

865
01:13:52,453 --> 01:13:53,935
bear west here.

866
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:57,458
They wonder why we
hate the Lakers.

867
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:08,853
Pray, might we speak inside?

868
01:14:09,353 --> 01:14:10,835
Speak?

869
01:14:10,855 --> 01:14:11,605
It's important.

870
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:13,087
It really is.

871
01:14:13,107 --> 01:14:15,841
Maybe you could come back
tomorrow in the morning.

872
01:14:15,861 --> 01:14:18,210
Any time after 8:30 or
call the church office.

873
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:20,232
Regarding the Grand Grimoire.

874
01:14:40,252 --> 01:14:41,734
Some of the other clergy
know about it, too.

875
01:14:41,754 --> 01:14:43,735
I'm not the only one
who's seen the records,

876
01:14:43,755 --> 01:14:46,739
but nobody seems to
recall how or why

877
01:14:46,759 --> 01:14:48,741
it came into church hands.

878
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:51,244
Some sort of witches'
book, isn't it?

879
01:14:51,264 --> 01:14:53,746
Can we see those records...
Tonight?

880
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:55,748
Church papers wouldn't
be for sale...

881
01:14:55,768 --> 01:14:57,250
At any price.

882
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,252
You are document collectors,

883
01:14:59,272 --> 01:15:00,253
isn't that it?

884
01:15:00,273 --> 01:15:02,755
We aren't here to buy anything.

885
01:15:02,775 --> 01:15:05,258
We just have to find that book.

886
01:15:05,278 --> 01:15:07,260
It's not here, if that's
what you're hoping.

887
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,262
It was broken up long ago

888
01:15:09,282 --> 01:15:10,783
and divided into...

889
01:15:18,042 --> 01:15:19,523
he's here.

890
01:15:19,543 --> 01:15:22,026
The wretch is on us
like a tail on a hound.

891
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:23,028
No, he's not here.

892
01:15:23,048 --> 01:15:24,548
He is. He's not.

893
01:15:31,055 --> 01:15:33,037
Can I ask what your interest is

894
01:15:33,057 --> 01:15:34,058
in finding such a book?

895
01:15:35,693 --> 01:15:36,675
Our interest lies

896
01:15:36,695 --> 01:15:40,177
in stopping those who would
see all good falter.

897
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:42,179
It lies in stopping
the powers of misrule

898
01:15:42,199 --> 01:15:43,681
from coming of age.

899
01:15:43,701 --> 01:15:45,703
It lies in finding
that damned book

900
01:15:46,203 --> 01:15:47,685
and thwarting a
vile beast of a man

901
01:15:47,705 --> 01:15:50,188
who shall not rest until
God himself is thrown down

902
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,190
and all of creation becomes

903
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:53,711
Satan's black-hell-besmeared
farting hole.

904
01:15:56,715 --> 01:15:57,716
You asked.

905
01:16:03,088 --> 01:16:04,569
Here.

906
01:16:04,589 --> 01:16:06,571
"Chronicled in the
year of the Lord

907
01:16:06,591 --> 01:16:08,573
"sixteen hundred ninety and two,

908
01:16:08,593 --> 01:16:10,094
"Township of Boston,

909
01:16:10,595 --> 01:16:13,078
"some few remarks upon
a book most dire...

910
01:16:13,098 --> 01:16:16,581
"called by some the
book of shadows,

911
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:18,083
"by others, the Key of Solomon,

912
01:16:18,103 --> 01:16:19,584
"and named by others still

913
01:16:19,604 --> 01:16:20,587
the Grand Grimoire."

914
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,088
Aye, that's the one.

915
01:16:22,108 --> 01:16:24,090
"...the need for exquisite caution.

916
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:27,093
Many-faced lieutenants
of Lucifer."

917
01:16:27,113 --> 01:16:28,593
Well, the language
gets pretty thick,

918
01:16:28,613 --> 01:16:29,615
but I remember something about

919
01:16:30,116 --> 01:16:31,098
how the book was distributed.

920
01:16:31,118 --> 01:16:32,098
Like, where?

921
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:33,619
Let's see, uh...

922
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,102
"One part was placed

923
01:16:35,122 --> 01:16:37,103
"within the slender
hollow of a table

924
01:16:37,123 --> 01:16:38,604
used in the taking
of communion."

925
01:16:38,624 --> 01:16:39,605
Chas' table.

926
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:41,607
"Another part was
given to a vicar

927
01:16:41,627 --> 01:16:43,128
"who had recently
founded a ministry

928
01:16:43,629 --> 01:16:44,611
west of the Carolinas."

929
01:16:44,631 --> 01:16:46,112
The farmhouse.

930
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:47,114
"And the third part..."

931
01:16:47,134 --> 01:16:48,614
Yeah? Yeah?

932
01:16:48,634 --> 01:16:50,116
Well, if I'm reading
this correctly,

933
01:16:50,136 --> 01:16:52,619
the third part might
still be here in Boston.

934
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:55,122
Oh, was this a plan or what?

935
01:16:55,142 --> 01:16:56,623
Ok, where?

936
01:16:56,643 --> 01:16:58,125
A graveyard?

937
01:16:58,145 --> 01:16:59,626
A burial ground... one I know.

938
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:01,628
Now we're going to
go dig up graves?

939
01:17:01,648 --> 01:17:02,630
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?

940
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:04,651
If luck looks upon us,
there'll be no digging.

941
01:17:05,152 --> 01:17:06,134
For should the earth
there be hallowed,

942
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,135
then the pages lie safe.

943
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:09,636
Never can no witch set foot

944
01:17:09,656 --> 01:17:11,157
on consecrated ground.

945
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:14,661
Whose idea was this?

946
01:17:15,162 --> 01:17:17,144
So much has changed,

947
01:17:17,164 --> 01:17:19,666
yet at times, I spy a
familiar stretch of park

948
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:22,650
or turn of the road.

949
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:23,671
Over there.

950
01:17:34,682 --> 01:17:36,164
Did you hear that?

951
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,166
Hear what?

952
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,168
I don't know. It was a soft...

953
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:42,170
Sort of like...

954
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,691
A soft...

955
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:29,102
I'll say good evening...

956
01:18:29,122 --> 01:18:32,125
Even though it does
seem unwarranted.

957
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:46,619
The two who were here
earlier this night...

958
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,140
what was told them?

959
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:52,645
The man Redferne.

960
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:55,628
Well, we...

961
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,150
Talked about many things.

962
01:18:57,651 --> 01:19:00,134
Then talk to me of pages...

963
01:19:00,154 --> 01:19:03,387
of pages and places most secret.

964
01:19:03,407 --> 01:19:05,639
Pages?

965
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:07,141
I'm afraid I don't know

966
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:08,912
what you're referring to.

967
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:10,414
Sit you down!

968
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:22,293
And let you sit, too.

969
01:19:38,059 --> 01:19:40,061
I feel them.

970
01:19:41,563 --> 01:19:42,564
Them?

971
01:19:44,065 --> 01:19:47,549
How could you know that?

972
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:49,551
A boy child...

973
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:51,072
And a girl.

974
01:19:52,574 --> 01:19:54,556
Both shall be born well-favored,

975
01:19:54,576 --> 01:19:58,079
providing he tells
me what I need know.

976
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:02,584
Please tell him, Stewart.

977
01:20:04,587 --> 01:20:06,569
Tell me, Stewart,

978
01:20:06,589 --> 01:20:08,070
lest your children be born

979
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:11,093
slugs of cold flesh.

980
01:20:11,594 --> 01:20:13,095
Tell me now.

981
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,411
How do we know if
it's holy ground?

982
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:30,914
We'll know.

983
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:52,436
Is that good?

984
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:55,919
The ground has been consecrated.

985
01:20:55,939 --> 01:20:57,921
Well, that's it, right?

986
01:20:57,941 --> 01:20:58,923
The pages are safe.

987
01:20:58,943 --> 01:21:00,945
Should they still be here.

988
01:21:01,446 --> 01:21:03,928
The pastor, he spoke of a tomb

989
01:21:03,948 --> 01:21:05,430
carved with a hex mark.

990
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:07,952
I'll search thither,
you thither.

991
01:21:08,453 --> 01:21:09,434
A hex mark?

992
01:21:09,454 --> 01:21:10,455
Aye.

993
01:21:11,956 --> 01:21:13,958
A hex mark.

994
01:21:51,113 --> 01:21:52,114
Redferne.

995
01:21:55,117 --> 01:21:56,098
Like this?

996
01:21:56,118 --> 01:21:57,119
Like this.

997
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:02,624
The bolts are sound.

998
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:06,109
There has been no meddling
in all this while.

999
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:07,611
You mean we're not
going to open it?

1000
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,612
Nay.
We'll leave it as we found it.

1001
01:22:09,632 --> 01:22:11,614
Good call. Trust me.

1002
01:22:11,634 --> 01:22:15,137
We don't want to open this
unless we really... really gotta.

1003
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:34,889
Come on, Redferne.

1004
01:22:34,909 --> 01:22:37,411
I think Giles is a nice name.

1005
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:42,416
What, you expected
to live forever?

1006
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:45,419
Well, at least we
didn't have to open it.

1007
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,902
I mean, we didn't have to stare

1008
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:49,924
at your putrefied
corpse or anything.

1009
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:04,688
Uh-oh.

1010
01:23:06,942 --> 01:23:08,944
What's the deal here?

1011
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:22,373
Redferne!

1012
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:25,357
Get back here! Redferne!

1013
01:23:25,377 --> 01:23:26,858
They're moving graves!

1014
01:23:26,878 --> 01:23:29,361
That sign says something
about a landfill,

1015
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:30,362
about condos!

1016
01:23:30,382 --> 01:23:31,864
They're moving people
from this side

1017
01:23:31,884 --> 01:23:33,365
of the graveyard to that side.

1018
01:23:33,385 --> 01:23:34,866
And so?

1019
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:36,520
I had this awful thought.

1020
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,623
What if that side of the wall...

1021
01:23:40,643 --> 01:23:43,646
Wasn't part of the
real graveyard?

1022
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:26,753
You know, I bet you're
aren't even in here.

1023
01:24:26,773 --> 01:24:28,755
The pages maybe, but not you.

1024
01:24:28,775 --> 01:24:31,258
Are you daft?
'Tis mine own casket.

1025
01:24:31,278 --> 01:24:32,260
Yeah, but you're not dead.

1026
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:33,760
You're right here.

1027
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:36,263
Look, before you died, you
came to the 20th century.

1028
01:24:36,283 --> 01:24:37,265
Think of it that way.

1029
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:41,269
How could there be tomb
and casket but I died?

1030
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:43,291
Guess we find out the hard way.

1031
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:50,798
Hey. I'll do it.

1032
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,284
Now, don't look till I
say it's ok to look, ok?

1033
01:24:56,304 --> 01:24:57,805
Just be quick about it.

1034
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:06,294
Well?

1035
01:25:06,314 --> 01:25:08,796
Better not look.

1036
01:25:08,816 --> 01:25:11,300
Is there a body inside mine own?

1037
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,801
Better not look.

1038
01:25:12,821 --> 01:25:14,303
Can I look now?

1039
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:15,824
No. Better not.

1040
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:18,941
Oh, blessings of heaven.

1041
01:25:18,961 --> 01:25:19,943
What'd you expect?

1042
01:25:19,963 --> 01:25:22,945
I said better not
look, and you looked.

1043
01:25:22,965 --> 01:25:23,947
How dumb can you be?

1044
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:26,468
The pages... take them and hurry.

1045
01:25:28,971 --> 01:25:29,972
Hurry!

1046
01:25:52,495 --> 01:25:53,977
Oh, yuck.

1047
01:25:53,997 --> 01:25:55,498
I said hurry, did I not?

1048
01:26:01,504 --> 01:26:03,987
Doesn't hurt a bit.

1049
01:26:04,007 --> 01:26:06,509
Just a couple more.

1050
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,003
All that remains is to
see the pages back to...

1051
01:26:19,023 --> 01:26:20,024
Hallowed ground.

1052
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:33,851
Redferne?

1053
01:26:33,871 --> 01:26:34,872
Aye.

1054
01:26:35,373 --> 01:26:36,374
I think he's here.

1055
01:26:41,746 --> 01:26:43,130
The pages.

1056
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:53,872
Take off.

1057
01:26:53,892 --> 01:26:54,873
Take off!

1058
01:26:54,893 --> 01:26:56,895
Go!

1059
01:27:46,813 --> 01:27:48,816
No!

1060
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:53,801
Come out, Redferne.

1061
01:27:53,821 --> 01:27:55,322
Show yourself!

1062
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:08,065
God!

1063
01:28:08,085 --> 01:28:10,087
Virtuous idea.

1064
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:14,091
Stop!

1065
01:28:15,592 --> 01:28:19,077
What you hold for what I hold.

1066
01:28:19,097 --> 01:28:20,731
A straight swap of goods.

1067
01:28:21,099 --> 01:28:22,600
Your offer seems light.

1068
01:28:23,101 --> 01:28:25,083
All will die should
I give these up.

1069
01:28:25,103 --> 01:28:26,584
The uncreation?

1070
01:28:26,604 --> 01:28:29,087
Only the daft believe
such a thing.

1071
01:28:29,107 --> 01:28:31,089
The pages, Redferne.

1072
01:28:31,109 --> 01:28:32,090
Give them up.

1073
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:34,092
No! Don't you dare!

1074
01:28:34,112 --> 01:28:35,593
Believe it, Redferne.

1075
01:28:35,613 --> 01:28:37,595
Her death will make all others

1076
01:28:37,615 --> 01:28:39,597
seem like a pet tea party.

1077
01:28:39,617 --> 01:28:42,600
And you, you who
stand there cow-like

1078
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:43,758
on hallowed earth,

1079
01:28:43,921 --> 01:28:45,978
shall hear every whimper,

1080
01:28:45,998 --> 01:28:47,605
every cry,

1081
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:49,608
every gasping gush I can bring

1082
01:28:49,628 --> 01:28:52,130
from her slow-dying body.

1083
01:28:54,133 --> 01:28:55,134
See her...

1084
01:28:55,634 --> 01:28:58,617
the mouth, the
legs, the breasts.

1085
01:28:58,637 --> 01:29:02,621
So much like those of
someone once you knew,

1086
01:29:02,641 --> 01:29:05,624
of someone both we knew.

1087
01:29:05,644 --> 01:29:08,627
Well, Redferne, shall she live,

1088
01:29:08,647 --> 01:29:12,651
or shall she join sweet
Marion in the hereafter?

1089
01:29:14,153 --> 01:29:15,654
Take the pages.

1090
01:29:26,616 --> 01:29:28,899
But take them by hand.

1091
01:29:28,919 --> 01:29:30,901
How's this?

1092
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:34,905
No spells, no flying, no magic.

1093
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:36,907
Take them, if you're able.

1094
01:29:36,927 --> 01:29:39,659
Now who makes the hollow offer?

1095
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,181
You give up nothing.

1096
01:29:48,071 --> 01:29:51,074
Take the pages, if you're able.

1097
01:29:54,078 --> 01:29:56,080
So, you fear me.

1098
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:02,086
'Tis I who others fear.

1099
01:30:02,587 --> 01:30:05,570
Not you. The magic.

1100
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:07,572
Having waited so long,

1101
01:30:07,592 --> 01:30:11,596
it could prove wonderfully
good to linger on it.

1102
01:31:01,514 --> 01:31:04,517
Fear... tell me how it feels.

1103
01:31:18,531 --> 01:31:21,534
Feels as if the
rules have changed.

1104
01:32:18,093 --> 01:32:22,827
I am he of empty crib
and stillborn foal.

1105
01:32:22,847 --> 01:32:26,831
I am he whose coming the
stars hath foretold.

1106
01:32:26,851 --> 01:32:31,837
I am he with heart
forged by blackest coal.

1107
01:32:31,857 --> 01:32:35,841
I am he who makest whole
the glorious goal

1108
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:38,864
of Satan's unborn soul!

1109
01:32:50,509 --> 01:32:55,263
Now reveal unto me
the name of God.

1110
01:33:01,138 --> 01:33:02,772
Oh, no. No.

1111
01:33:31,803 --> 01:33:33,785
I know thee!

1112
01:33:33,805 --> 01:33:36,174
I know your name!

1113
01:33:37,675 --> 01:33:42,543
I know the word that can
undo all you have wrought!

1114
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:45,682
Yea, I know thee!

1115
01:33:45,817 --> 01:33:47,435
Nay, nay, say it not!

1116
01:33:58,196 --> 01:34:01,199
Try saltwater, fuckbrain.

1117
01:35:48,059 --> 01:35:51,042
You are owed a debt greater
than any we'll know,

1118
01:35:51,062 --> 01:35:53,044
save one.

1119
01:35:53,064 --> 01:35:58,049
From me, then, a world
of thanks, Kassandra.

1120
01:35:58,069 --> 01:36:00,071
Kassandra with a "K."

1121
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:19,572
Had our 2 lives

1122
01:36:19,592 --> 01:36:21,880
been not so out of joint...

1123
01:36:22,406 --> 01:36:23,773
Had we...

1124
01:36:26,098 --> 01:36:27,599
What I mean to say is...

1125
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:54,628
Redferne.

1126
01:37:21,406 --> 01:37:22,907
Oh.

1127
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:30,110
Oh.

1128
01:37:31,697 --> 01:37:33,050
Shoot.

1129
01:38:34,731 --> 01:38:37,714
Whoo ho!

1130
01:38:37,734 --> 01:38:38,735
Yeow!
