1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:07,707
Juon - A curse born of a strong grudge held by someone
who died.

2
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,380
The place of his death gathers his grudge.

3
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:16,052
Anyone who comes into contact with this curse shall lose
his life and a new curse is born.

4
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:02,856
JUON

5
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:12,732

Room# 205 Kobayashi Shunsuke Manami

7
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,433
-I'm home. 
-Welcome back.

8
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,314
Just a few minutes.

9
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,619
Baby, iiiss okkaaay foor yoou to mooove liiike thaaatt??

10
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,755
Itchuu ok, Papa.

11
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,678
What's wrong?

12
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,682
Is there a problem?

13
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:39,686
Are you done with visiting students' homes?

14
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,690
One more family to go.  
Their kid hasn't been coming to school.

15
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,292
Have you contacted his parents?

16
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,727
No.

17
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,597
Can't you get in touch with them?

18
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,601
No, I can't.

19
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,737
Being a teacher is tough work, huh?

20
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,675
Yes, it is.

21
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:12,686
Father: Saeki Takeo
Mother: ( Maiden Name: Kawamata)  Kanako   
Son: Toshio

22
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,560
Mr. Kobayashi.

23
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:40,747
Hey, do you remember a girl from college named Kawamata?

24
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:45,618
Kawamata? Kayoko Kawamata?

25
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:51,458
-She was... 
-Kind of Creepy girl, wasn't she?

26
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,362
-What's wrong, all of a sudden? 
-Oh no, nothing.

27
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,264
Strange.

28
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:04,104
-Is it all right to eat this much? 
-Of course, it's ok.

29
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,459
Hello?

30
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,463
Anybody home?

31
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,250
Toshio?

32
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,620
Oh, you are home.

33
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,624
Mr. Koooobaaaayaaaashiiii...

34
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:51,438
I am here today, because you never go to school. 
 Everybody has been worrying about you.

35
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:05,018
Toshio... Isn't your mother home?

36
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,262
Toshio!

37
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,807
Hello?

38
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,811
Hello?

39
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,649
I am coming in now.

40
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,355
Toshio?

41
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,523
Toshio?

42
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,059
Toshio!

43
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,780
What's wrong?

44
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,327
Are you okay?

45
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,664
Can I check you?

46
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,342
No Fever....

47
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,753
I know...

48
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,757
Toshio, Do you remember your drawing?

49
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,301
Here it is.

50
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:07,073
You drew the picture very well. 
The other teachers thought so, too.

51
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,214
Is you mother out shopping?

52
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,417
Together.

53
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:22,355
Together? Your mother went out with your father?

54
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,625
-Yeah. 
-I see.

55
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,064
What were you doing in the bathroom?

56
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:45,038
Yuki

57
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,568
Yes.

58
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:21,741
Sorry to bug you.  I am going out for a little while, so here's a snack for when you take a break.

59
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,078
Thank you.

60
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,284
-The cat is back. 
-There are a lot of cats around here.

61
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:35,288
I wonder if it's the same cat that came a few days ago?

62
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:40,326
It is ok, Yuki.  I will chase them away.

63
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:46,666
-Thank you. 
-Kanna please do your best to learn. 
Yuki, I leave Kanna in your hands.

64
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,502
Hurry up and leave!

65
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,440
I will be back early, so Yuki why don't you eat with us.

66
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,108
Thank you.

67
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,278
-You are so noisy! 
-Ok. Ok.

68
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:06,419
Let's begin.

69
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:15,228
Let's begin now.

70
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,627
Say, is there one?

71
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:52,165
-One what? 
-You know, a boyfriend?

72
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,402
We don't have to talk about that right now.

73
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:58,238
Come on, tell me.

74
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,210
No way... We will study until here and then we will take a break.

75
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,214
Then can we talk about your boyfriend?

76
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,053
OK.

77
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,656
Promise me.

78
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,526
It's a promise.

79
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:42,615
Ok, tell me about him.

80
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:48,154
-What are you talking about? 
-You are so sly.  You promised me.

81
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:56,329
-Wait a minute. 
-No. It's not that. Don't you hear it a little?

82
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:00,266
-What is that noise? 
-Darn you, you promised.

83
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:04,270
No!  You can't really hear that?

84
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:13,780
Ok, I will tell you. I don't have a boyfriend now.

85
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:19,586
-Serious? 
-It's true.

86
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:24,124
-That's no good. 
-I really don't have a boyfriend.

87
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:27,394
Alright, what about your ex-boyfriend?

88
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,163
Wait. Be quiet.

89
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,767
You don't hear that sound?

90
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,803
What is it?

91
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,673
That is a strange sound.

92
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,680
I don't hear it.

93
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,618
It is just me?

94
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,257
It's a cat!

95
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:00,060
Knock it off!

96
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,474
-What? 
-What time is now? I have to go to school today.

97
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,211
-What? Go to School? 
-I have to feed the rabbit.

98
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:22,215
Rabbit? How can you forget something like that?

99
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,526
-Miiiizuuuhoooo. 
-Kanna!

100
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:37,030
What?  What? What? What?

101
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,368
He's got a girlfriend.

102
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:45,238
Tsuyoshi?  Have you met her yet?

103
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,575
-He only brought her home once. 
-Really.  What kind of girl is she?

104
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,610
She is cute.

105
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,613
Hey!  Quit talking about my girlfriend!

106
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,617
Miiiizuuuuhoooo.

107
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,554
Take Care!

108
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,324
Tsuyooooshiiii

109
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,331
Tsuyoshi!

110
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,734
-What? 
-Do you have a picture of your girlfriend?

111
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,170
No.

112
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:04,758
Mizuho

113
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,008
Tsuyoshi!

114
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:10,076
Tsuyoshi!

115
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,270
Tsuyoshi!

116
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,083
Tsuyoshi!

117
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,152
Oh, Tezuka.

118
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,421
Did you come with Tsuyoshi?

119
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:12,425
Huh, no I didn't.  But his bike is over there.

120
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,761
yeah. I know.

121
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:18,164
He is probably still inside of school.

122
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:24,270
-Did you call him? Did you get a hold of him? 
-No.  Yesterday, Mr. Nakumuea took his cell phone.

123
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,806
Damn.

124
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:31,344
-Is that it? 
-Yeah, I found it over there.

125
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:36,249
I wonder if he came with someone?

126
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:39,419
Well if you wait for him, you will see him.  Later.

127
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,722
Wait a minute. Please help me look for him.

128
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,538
Hey!

129
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:03,510
What are you doing? I am locking up the school so hurry up and go home.

130
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:07,080
But um I am waiting for my friend.

131
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,216
Friend? What are you talking about?

132
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:14,754
There is nobody inside. I just checked.

133
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,490
But um...

134
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,393
But his bike is over there and uh that is also his bag.

135
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,364
He is probably still here.

136
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:26,700
What is your class and name?

137
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,769
-huh? 
-Your class and name?

138
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:33,239
I am in the 2nd year 4th class.  My name is Tamura Mizuho.

139
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,675
Come to the teacher's room.

140
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,243
OK.

141
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,557
What are you doing?

142
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:53,560
Who is your teacher?

143
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,329
I am going to tell your teacher about this.

144
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,666
Hurry up.

145
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:16,116

Well, I check inside of the school again.

152
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,812
You should wait here.

153
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:54,788
If he comes here, don't go home until I get back.

154
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:58,358
-Do you understand? 
-Yes.

155
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,212
Hello.. This is Tamura.... I wonder if Tsuyoshi had come back home.

156
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,449
Yes.

00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:05,191

Hello?

162
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,465
Hello?

00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:54,507
Are you still there?

164

Hello?

166
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:06,459
Kanna

167
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,273
Doctor, you found something?

168
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:26,413
There was a dead rabbit's body mixed in the body's blood and tissues.

169
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:30,150
Yes, I saw it at the scene.  Anything else?

170
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,285
There are no signs that anybody else had a hand in this.

171
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:39,225
The body appears to have been twisted and broken.

172
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:45,632
What is that?

173
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:50,103
It was found in the dismembered body.

174
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:00,213
A jaw?

175
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:05,285
Yes. It is a human's jaw.

176
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,728
It is somebody else's.

177
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:18,732
There was another person at the scene?

178
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,501
Perhaps.

179
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:26,172
They didn't find the body that the jaw was from.

180
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:31,378
We have sent samples to the lab to try to match the DNA.

181
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:34,214
The body missing the jaw is gone.

182
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:38,218
What is the cause of death of this person?

183
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:42,789
Actually, I don't understand that very well.

184
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:49,829
The body is so badly broken and twisted we can't say the cause of death was heart failure.

185
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,437
This is my first time seeing a body like this.

186
00:33:58,772 --> 00:34:00,674
Excuse me. Excuse me.

187
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:07,013
We talked to the teacher who is a witness and it appears a little after 2 pm...

188
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:11,651
...the two third year girls went to the middle school to feed the rabbits.

189
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:15,655
This is Hisae Yoshia and this is Kanna Murakami.

190
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:40,680
-Say, Kamio. 
-Yes.

191
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:49,055
Is it possible for a person who lost a jaw like 
that to still be alive? What do you think?

192
00:34:52,325 --> 00:34:55,395
Impossible.

193
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:23,289
I am home.

194
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:28,261
Wrong address again.

195
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:36,736
Kanna! I got ice cream, do you want some?

196
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:50,116
Hello, this is Murakami. Ok, please wait a minute.

197
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:53,319
Tsuyoshi!

198
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,588
Tsuyoshi!

199
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,726
Tsyoshi!

200
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,298
Kanna!

201
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:08,335
Where is Tsuyoshi?

202
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:31,424
Hello.  He hasn't came back home yet.

203
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:35,428
Perhaps he is still on his way here.

204
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,732
Do you know his cell number?

205
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:42,736
Why don't call his cell phone?

206
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:46,740
Just a minute, it looks like he just got back.

207
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,410
Tsuyoshi?  Are you back?

208
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,480
You have a phone call.

209
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:11,197
Kanna?

210
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,204
Kanna?

211
00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:20,240
You?

212
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:52,439
Who are you?

213
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:40,920
Kayako

214
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,681
Yes. Yes. Yes.

215
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:10,750
No.  I will be late.

216
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:16,423
That is right.

217
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:24,264
His parents still haven't came back yet. 
The child?   He is sleeping?

218
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:28,668
Yes. Somebody came.

219
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:35,075
Yes.  I will call you later.  OK.

220
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:53,646
Toshio.

221
00:41:53,646 --> 00:41:56,249
Toshio.

222
00:41:56,616 --> 00:41:59,452
Toshio.

223
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,192
Toshio.

224
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:14,067
Toshio.

225
00:42:22,676 --> 00:42:24,010
Toshio.

226
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:38,291
-Mother, did I do good?  
-Toshio! 
-You did good. Really good.

227
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:44,497
Mother, Where Are you going?

228
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:48,501
My teacher is here.

229
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:50,503
I see.

230
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:54,741
Teacher said that he came to meet you,  Mother.

231
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:25,271
Toshio!

232
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:27,640
Its true.  Father and I.

233
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,043
I am opening the door.

234
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:40,520
Toshio.

235
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:11,284
Toshio, were you talking to somebody?

236
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:21,428
Your parents are late, aren't they?

237
00:44:21,594 --> 00:44:24,464
Kobayashi

238
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:12,232
Today, I had eyes with Kobayashi.

239
00:47:12,232 --> 00:47:15,735
My heart began to fill and beat rapidly.

240
00:47:15,735 --> 00:47:19,172
Thoughts of him are inside of my head.
Kobayashi today again...

241
00:47:19,205 --> 00:47:21,775
And then he read manga while standing

242
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:25,779
Kobayashi didn't come to school today...
Kobayashi often reads while standing

243
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:29,349
Every week ...
But tomorrow, Kobayashi will certainly get better

244
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:33,353
Every night ... 
 That girl is acting too familiar with Kobayashi and is following my Kobayashi

245
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:37,357
She is always with my Kobayashi 
I worry about Kobayashi because has a weakness for alcohol

246
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:14,000
and he always drinks to much 
 Kobayashi threw up along the road.

247
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:45,365
but because I am better than that woman

248
00:47:45,365 --> 00:47:49,369
Because I know where Kobayashi lives

249
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:53,373
In Kobayashi's room,  probably his favorites are...

250
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:57,644
I took drunk Kobayashi to his apartment.  I went to his apartment many times

251
00:47:57,644 --> 00:48:01,614
The two of us rode a taxi.  Kobayashi drank too much sake

252
00:48:02,082 --> 00:48:04,684
Sleeping Kobayashi...
Painful Kobayashi...

253
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,083
Toshio!  Toshio!

254
00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:46,052
Lets not stay here.

255
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:59,532
Wait here.

256
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,476
Tsuyoshi, let's go!

257
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:18,118
Hello.

258
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:22,122
So this is Mr Kobayashi.

259
00:50:24,257 --> 00:50:28,762
I am Saeki.  Tokeo Saeki.

260
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:33,533
I'm Kayako's husband.

261
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:39,439
Have you met with Kayako?

262
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:46,513
After today, please take care of Toshio.

263
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:48,782
What are you saying?

264
00:50:50,321 --> 00:50:57,590
I took care of Toshio instead of you,
 now take your turn.

265
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:57,457
Lets take turns.

266
00:50:57,457 --> 00:51:01,394
Instead of me?  Take turns?

267
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:11,404
Oh, Mr Kobayashi, your baby was born.

268
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:16,309
Born?

269
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:29,689
You baby is here, it's a girl.

270
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:10,597
Hello, mother?

271
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:19,105
Yes. Yes. I understand.

272
00:54:10,316 --> 00:54:13,153
Kobayashi.

273
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:56,656
Kyoko

274
00:56:12,605 --> 00:56:17,610
-Good afternoon. 
-Good Afternoon.  You are busy as usual.

275
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:21,614
No No.  Please sit.

276
00:56:27,687 --> 00:56:31,257
-I am leaving.
-Okay, see you Later.

277
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:41,735
Keiko, you done with work?

278
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:44,537
Yes.

279
00:56:44,537 --> 00:56:47,307
How about a little bit?

280
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:50,610
-What's wrong? 
-Thank you, but no thank you.

281
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:55,448
Nobuyuki is probably waiting at home. 
 You are the only one for your son.

282
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:59,452
Ok. Ok. Ok.  I understand.

283
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:12,298
What was that?  You said you wanted to talk?

284
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:16,736
Yea,  Sis, I would like you to see one house.

285
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:20,740
-You want me to look? 
-Yea, just one house that is for sale.

286
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,744
It won't be unpleasant.

287
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:29,516
-What do you mean?
-Yea, we have one house now.

288
00:57:29,516 --> 00:57:31,751
The house has had a past.

289
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:34,120
A past?

290
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:40,093
Previously there was a family who live there. 
 They died and their bodies became missing.

291
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:46,700
Well the way I look at it, it will be okay 
 for me if somebody buys it sooner.

292
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:52,472
But nobody has bought it, yet. 
I think having an exorcism is a little excessive, though.

293
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,344
I am afraid that will scare more people off.

294
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:02,048
Sis, I want your unique opinion and insight.

295
00:58:02,048 --> 00:58:06,052
My opinion.  You want me to do it today?

296
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:10,056
Well just a little, it is only looking around the house.

297
00:58:11,725 --> 00:58:14,194
It was a complete failure.

298
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:20,200
Well originally we got the house cheap because of 
 the incident.  It is a nice house.

299
00:58:20,233 --> 00:58:25,071
It is still pretty.  I don't know where people 
heard about the house and the incident.

300
00:58:25,071 --> 00:58:28,708
There is even a rumor about the house on the Internet.

301
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:32,712
I am surprised that you are worried about that, 
 because normally this kind of stuff doesn't affect you.

302
00:58:32,712 --> 00:58:39,119
I am being a little superstitious. 
If we can't sell the house we will lose money.

303
00:58:39,786 --> 00:58:43,723
I have to pay Shinobu alimony.

304
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:49,496
It is nice and quiet around here.

305
00:58:50,196 --> 00:58:53,500
Here it is.

306
00:59:18,224 --> 00:59:21,294
Hey, what's wrong?

307
00:59:33,473 --> 00:59:35,475
After the deaths the police investigated,
 and left everything inside the house.

308
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:41,348
I hope the buyers will buy the house with 
 everything left inside of it.

309
00:59:53,526 --> 00:59:57,163
Hey, you are already feel something?

310
00:59:58,264 --> 01:00:01,434
The incident that was here, you said Murashimi?

311
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:04,571
Yea.  Well the father is alive.

312
01:00:04,571 --> 01:00:08,575
There was only one person left?  Where is he now?

313
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,511
According to the police statements, he is in the hospital.

314
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:15,515
-I see.  
-His wife and her daughter died at the same time.

315
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:22,756
That's wrong! There wasn't only two people that died here!

316
01:00:24,491 --> 01:00:28,628
-What? 
-I don't understand this very well.

317
01:00:28,628 --> 01:00:32,632
Well. Go inside.

318
01:00:51,384 --> 01:00:54,721
Saeki.  Who is this person?

319
01:00:55,455 --> 01:00:56,122
They lived here before Murakumi did.

320
01:00:58,658 --> 01:01:02,328
As I say the cheap things left here comes with trouble.

321
01:01:02,328 --> 01:01:10,136
It is quiet around here, and the station 
is also close so I thought I could sell this place.

322
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:58,084
Kyoko.

323
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:16,536
This house... It's too much for me.

324
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:20,540
Wait a minute!

325
01:02:24,044 --> 01:02:26,746
Is there sake here now?

326
01:02:26,746 --> 01:02:30,750
-Japanese Sake? 
-Bring it!

327
01:03:03,316 --> 01:03:06,619
Is this OK?

328
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:35,482
Promise me you will do what 
I what I say from now.  OK?

329
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:39,486
-What are you saying? 
-OK?!

330
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,222
Yes.

331
01:03:42,222 --> 01:03:46,726
Before somebody buys this house, 
make them drink this sake.

332
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,063
-Huh? 
-Promise me!

333
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:58,471
If the customer says that sake isn't any good 
or spits it out, never sell the house to them.

334
01:03:58,805 --> 01:04:01,174
What a minute.  What are you saying?

335
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:06,144
Sake reacts naturally to the presents of spirits.

336
01:04:06,146 --> 01:04:09,616
During ancient times it was often used to 
bless everything on ceremony alters.

337
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:15,221
-OK. 
-A person will be able to taste a difference 
in sake that has been touched by spirits.

338
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:23,162
So if a person who drinks the sake and the taste is
strange, the house is too dangerous for that person.

339
01:04:23,196 --> 01:04:25,298
Ok.

340
01:04:25,298 --> 01:04:31,736
Leave the sake in this room for a long time.  Promise before 
somebody buys this house you will make them drink this sake.

341
01:04:32,672 --> 01:04:36,576
-I have to go! 
-Hey, Kyoko!

342
01:04:41,348 --> 01:04:45,518
-Kyoko! 
-I am sorry. I need to leave this house as soon as possible.

343
01:05:12,145 --> 01:05:16,149
What?  You sold the house?

344
01:05:16,149 --> 01:05:18,218
Why didn't you call me before you sold the house?

345
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:24,320
Is that so?

346
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:28,695
Did you do what I asked you to do?

347
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:32,332
Yea, the sake.

348
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:36,469
Yes, it was okay.  They tried to drink it.

349
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:41,041
They were ok when they drank it.

350
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:44,210
They loved the house.

351
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:48,214
It's okay.  Don't worry

352
01:05:48,214 --> 01:05:52,218
Can you come to my house in a couple days?

353
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:56,222
What for?

354
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:04,264
Nobuyuki has been looking and acting strange lately.

355
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:08,268
I haven't said anything to anybody.

356
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:12,272
Can you see what is troubling him?

357
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:16,276
Yes.  I will come.
