1
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,670
What the fuck is that?
- What?

2
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,117
Is that an egg?

3
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,872
Looks just like you.

4
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,872
Yeah, they made me paint that
when I signed up.

5
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,632
Some stupid clown thing.

6
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,830
Fuck me, clown! Fuck me, clown!

7
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,153
Fuck me, clown! Fuck me, clown!
Come on, clown. Fuck me, clown!

8
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,673
Fuck me, I'm late.

9
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,269
I've gotta do some little bastard's party.
I need to kit up.

10
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,950
Close the door, asshole!

11
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,517
Here comes the cake.

12
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,515
Here's your cake. Are you ready?
Blow out the candles.

13
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,673
Nine, ten! Yes.

14
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,031
Yeah look, I'll be back in about an hour.
Keep yourself on the boil. Aye.

15
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,636
What are you talking about, love? Yeah.
There's some biscuits under the sink.

16
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,952
Hey, you two. Not in the house.
- Go to hell.

17
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,317
Gimme here.
- You stop it.

18
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,073
Stop. Will you stop!

19
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,792
Gimme that.

20
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,233
You can see my house from here.

21
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,350
Happy birthday.

22
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,110
Tom and Kate sitting in a tree...

23
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,917
Get out of the way, you little bastards.

24
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,911
How do?
- You're late.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,753
And you're fucking ugly.
Just kidding, love.

26
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,838
Right, it's cash up front.
No dough, no show.

27
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,679
Right, here he is, Stitches the Clown.
Whoo-hoo.

28
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,197
Everybody happy?

29
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,756
Is everybody happy?
- You're an asshole, you big dumb clown.

30
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,276
Get on with the show, you loser.

31
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,794
Yes.

32
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,033
Bastards.

33
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,997
Right, who's the birthday boy?

34
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,071
It's a clown.
- That's gonna be worth nothing.

35
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,673
That's plastic.

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,834
Right, the hat of mystery.

37
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,038
Who, empty hat. Empty...

38
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,796
Now that's what I'm talking about.

39
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,715
What you want to see?
- A stegosaurus.

40
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,469
The balloons for the dinosaurs
are extinct. You can have a dog.

41
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,597
I don't want a dog. I want a stegosaurus.
- Shut it you.

42
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,518
You shut it. You're not my dad. Shut up.
- I might be.

43
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,675
Right, here we go.
- What is that even supposed to be?

44
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,754
It's a bloody velociraptor, isn't it?
Look, there's a bit there.

45
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,755
Bastard.

46
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,197
Fall in, men, fall in. At ease.
Attention.

47
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,559
You're rubbish.
- I hate this trick.

48
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,351
Can this guy juggle?

49
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,789
How could your mother get this guy?

50
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,957
Right, kids.
Now it's time for Funny Bones.

51
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,349
Are you serious?

52
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,876
Say hello, Funny Bones.
"Hello Funny Bones."

53
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,553
Goodbye, Funny Bones.

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,195
Nice one.
- You are so violent.

55
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,714
Here it is. Juggling.

56
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,313
Throw it at him.

57
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,160
Finally this clown does something good.

58
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,794
You bastard.

59
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,197
OK, anybody want...

60
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,995
Get out of my way, bitch.

61
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,155
Try and get some sleep.

62
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,072
You are not our charge.

63
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,871
But hear this. A clown that doesn't finish
a party can never rest in peace.

64
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,196
And the joke is never as funny
the second time round.

65
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,272
Six o'clock in the morning? Couldn't you
have found an earlier flight, Denise?

66
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,318
I don't know how I'm gonna
stay awake in the meeting.

67
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,916
No, don't worry.
I know my way around London.

68
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,279
Yeah, happier times.
Anyway, I better go. All right, bye.

69
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,151
Well, all under control.

70
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,993
Looks good.

71
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,149
You OK?

72
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,556
Yeah, just homework.
I got a maths test on Friday.

73
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,155
And you're not gonna be here
for my birthday.

74
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,913
Oi, you little shit.

75
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,354
Tom, I'm sorry, but if I don't go,
they'll send Bernie,

76
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,318
and I can't loose any more hours
to that cunt.

77
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,437
If you're worried about being on your own,
call one of your friends?

78
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,909
Ask them to come over.
- I'll think about it.

79
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,358
What's the matter?

80
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,672
I don't like the look of it.

81
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,189
Happy birthday.

82
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,159
Do you have your lunches, honey?
- Yes, Mom. Just shut up.

83
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,357
How's it going? You all right?
- Don't bother.

84
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,958
Yeah, gagging for it.
- Yeah, gagging for nothing. Get a grip.

85
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,234
Cock-fucking bitch.

86
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,436
Wanker.
- Twat.

87
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,714
Prick.

88
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,515
Kate, you should've been there.
Jammed four hours straight last night.

89
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,388
Fintan described one of my solos as
"brainal penetration".

90
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,159
I played so hard you couldn't
hear the rest of the band.

91
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,272
I'm thinking of changing
our band name to 'Dan'.

92
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,319
Fintan was so moved by a solo
that he wept four hours.

93
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,269
We had to play without a drummer.
I just worked the bass drum on my foot.

94
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,639
Still, I wish my number one groupie
could've been there.

95
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,190
Hey, not in school.
And I'm not your groupie.

96
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,039
So you gonna get a phone? Ring me maybe?
- I've got three phones.

97
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,395
You were supposed to ring about eight.
- I was busy.

98
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,316
Yeah, obviously listening to your solos.
- And working a bass drum with my foot.

99
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,433
I'm really sick of you not calling,
so maybe you should sit that out.

100
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,235
OK, I'll just see you later.
- I'll...

101
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,833
Kate?

102
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,669
Hey, Tom, can I have that homework?
English class, five minutes. Please.

103
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,354
I haven't done it.

104
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,433
Come on, baby, you scratch my back,
I'll scratch your back.

105
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,111
If that's OK with you?
- I'd really rather you didn't.

106
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,116
I think, Tom,
we're still mates, aren't we?

107
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,476
Sorry there, fuck-face.
I mean apologies, old bean.

108
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,357
Ta-ra for now, love.

109
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,548
OK, settle down.
Page 36.

110
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,434
Try and answer a couple of them
on your own this time.

111
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,717
Who's the new chick?
- She's not new. That's Marry.

112
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,751
Mary? You're fucking shitting me.

113
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,394
What the fuck?
- You seen Monster Munch Mary?

114
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,553
Yeah, she hasn't been Monster Munch Mary
since last summer.

115
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,076
She went to boot camp
or took a massive shit or something.

116
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,116
Hey, are you doing anything this weekend,
on Saturday?

117
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,474
No.

118
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,757
Maybe you could come around.
We could have a couple of beers.

119
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,035
I've got a box set of Vin Diesel movies.

120
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,271
Hold on. You have a free house?
- But not like that.

121
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,430
Who's coming?
- No one, just you.

122
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,548
What about Richie and Bulger?
- No, two's company. Three's a party.

123
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,072
Did someone say "party"?
- Party? Will there be cake?

124
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,720
There's not fucking party.

125
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,756
No talking.

126
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,958
No talking in class.

127
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,879
Oh fuck!

128
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,752
And here we have
the male reproductive organ.

129
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,793
Presto.
- Oh my God, look how small that is.

130
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,558
Give me back my dick.

131
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,318
Give me it back.

132
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,158
Your time is up, Tom.

133
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,191
Your time is up. Please hand in
your papers, ladies and gentlemen.

134
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,634
Thank you again for your sterling efforts.
That will be all for today.

135
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,876
Blondie, more of a stretch here.
Lose those pounds. You've put too many on.

136
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,794
Scarecrow, come on. Do something there.
You in the pink, you sissy, move.

137
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,916
Betty Boo, more of an effort into that.

138
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,628
Come on, Fatso.
Get a move on there, Specky.

139
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,554
Here, what are you doing standing?
Get a move on it. That's very good.

140
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,191
You do that. Hey Magic, get rid of
that fucking ball and start stretching.

141
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,999
Yeah. What the...

142
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,712
Are you ordering food online again?
- No.

143
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,790
Of all the people to have a free house
and he doesn't wanna have a party.

144
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,916
Vinny, give him a break.
- Why?

145
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,276
Because it's his birthday this weekend.

146
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,276
It's his birthday this weekend?
- Yeah.

147
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,958
Like this weekend coming?

148
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,157
Yes, this weekend coming.
It's his birthday.

149
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,068
And garlic bread.

150
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,676
I was thinking, this weekend,
total surprise party for Tom.

151
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,753
Dude, that's like flashing a strobe light
at an epileptic. Can't do it.

152
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,592
Let's get it on.

153
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,354
Bulger, gimme the ball.

154
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,229
Earth to Tom.
Wake up, you lazy bastard.

155
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,476
Dude, you should have this party.
- No.

156
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:23,078
Kate and Dan are at breaking point.
You can put that six year boner to use.

157
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,549
Don't say anything.
Just think about it.

158
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,710
You're a legend, Tom.

159
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,548
Shoot it, Tom.
- Shoot it. Come on.

160
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,756
Wait, wait, wait.

161
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,152
Vinny. Richie. Bulger.

162
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,672
Holy shit. It's on.
- It's on.

163
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,988
It's actually happening?
- Yep.

164
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,230
Oh my God. This is amazing.

165
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,555
There'll be cake and everything, Bulger.
- Whatever.

166
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,677
Tom, are we doing presents?
You know I don't do that sort of thing.

167
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,357
You, Kate. What did I tell you about
wearing those boots in school?

168
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,351
Not to.
- Not to.

169
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,000
Footwear is supposed to be black or brown.

170
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,832
How's it a uniform if there's a choice?

171
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,913
This isn't a conversation. I'm not asking
you. What are you now? Emo?

172
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,992
You'll dye you hair pink next,
and a nose ring.

173
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,435
And then there'll be the drugs.
And five years down the line...

174
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,910
you're in a bedsit by yourself
eating your own hair.

175
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,629
Oh, it's funny. Laugh it up.
That tickled you, did it?

176
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,679
4a. Four o'clock. Detained.
I'll be in to check on you.

177
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,472
You're not laughing now.
And here.

178
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,439
If I catch you with those boots again,
it'll be a letter home.

179
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,912
Hey!

180
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,310
He's such an asshole.

181
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,670
Hi, Kate.
- Oh, hi.

182
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,479
How you doing?
- I just got detention.

183
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,076
Remember that time in Mrs Burke's class
when she gave us detention for laughing?

184
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,672
I've got something for you.

185
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,114
Having a party?
- Yeah.

186
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,954
I don't know about this Saturday yet.
I might be going out.

187
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,511
Oh right, with friends.

188
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,311
Yeah, just some of the girls.
- Well, you can invite them, too.

189
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,874
There's plenty of room.
- Yeah?

190
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,158
Sure.
- OK. I'll say it to them and see.

191
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,837
Dress code for Saturday is smart casual,
so I don't want to see those shoes,

192
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,592
or I'll be sending a
letter home to your mammy.

193
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,116
7B. Mr Cliffords, maths, yeah?

194
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,634
Yes, sir.
- Chop chop, yeah?

195
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,517
You little fucker, you.

196
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,799
It was completely off-key.
Why are you still here?

197
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,792
Jesus, didn't mean to scare you, Tom.

198
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,719
Looking very sharp.
Any plans for the weekend?

199
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,918
None yet.
- Are you gonna play that card?

200
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,678
Well, we saw the event page.
You invited everyone to come on My Face.

201
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,918
No, I didn't do that.

202
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,956
Are you lying to me?
- No.

203
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,953
I can see it in your beady fucking
posh eyes. You're lying, Tom.

204
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,113
Me and the ATB will come to your house.
Do you know who the ATB are?

205
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,994
All the boys. All the fucking boys.

206
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,875
Come on, Sarah. Give 'Thomas the
Tank Engine' his birthday present.

207
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,829
Birthday bashings.
- You're OK, Tommy. See you Saturday.

208
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,315
I bet you wouldn't even know
how to kiss a girl.

209
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,359
If you saw a girl's gash,
you'd put a plaster on it.

210
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,797
All right, man?
- What have been saying about my party?

211
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,792
Spreading the word.
You have 32 friends already.

212
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,079
I don't even know 32 people.
- You will. Trust me. It's gonna be good.

213
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,435
Yeah?

214
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,436
Not the same shitty bike again.

215
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,239
Bring on the chuck.

216
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,750
Hey! Hurry up, Bulger, you fat fuck.

217
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,270
Party. Woo-hoo!
- Someone's got a bit of drink.

218
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,794
This place brings back memories.

219
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,388
Nice.
- Yeah.

220
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,516
There's Bulger.
- There he is.

221
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,637
Hurry guys. Let's go. We've work to do.
- Nice.

222
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,269
Three hours to go. Let's get to work.
- Relax. We just got in the door.

223
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,114
Richie, where's the peanuts?
You forgot them, didn't you?

224
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,158
Richie, shut up.
Get you head in the game.

225
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,599
Tom, this is easy.
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

226
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,112
Richie, that needs to go higher.
You have it arse ways.

227
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,668
Fuck off.
- No, you fuck off, Richie.

228
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,633
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

229
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,833
What are you doing?

230
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,589
Blow these up. Can someone cover up
those bins? They look terrible.

231
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,110
Did you get the crepe paper?
- I bought skins.

232
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,395
You bought skins?
- That what you meant?

233
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,799
No, I meant crepe paper.

234
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,509
But don't worry. It's only been
his first party in like six years.

235
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,475
Good work.
- Now all we need is some bodies.

236
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,835
Bring on the fanny fest.

237
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,074
Oh, sorry. Sorry, ladies.
You having a good night?

238
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,357
Uh, yes. Thanks.
- I'm Richie. What's your name?

239
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,396
Wanker.

240
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,914
It's OK. Aside from the random nobodies
and all the ugly people.

241
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,993
Well, no, I look fierce,
but the rest of them, please.

242
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,675
Oh my God. Just a random uglier
in the shortest dress ever.

243
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,274
You can practically see her thing.

244
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,317
Lots of people here.
- It's deadly.

245
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,198
Is it?
- Yeah.

246
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,589
Have you seen Kate?
- No. Oh my God, there she is.

247
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,351
What's going on?
- She's too good for you.

248
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,836
No, no. When she's had a few drinks,
I'm telling you... - Whatever.

249
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,394
Those blow-job lips
will be gagging for mickey.

250
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,638
Here, lads, group shot.
Let me see those fuck faces.

251
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,639
Bulger, that's a fuck face?

252
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,558
Did you get the fairy lights?

253
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,677
Oh God. Delete that.
I've such a double chin.

254
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,955
Fuck's sake, Tom.
You need to relax, man.

255
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,032
Sorry. Relax.
- Chill.

256
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,472
It's time to party.

257
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,672
Nice shot.

258
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,519
I picked up a sniper and took all three of
their heads off. Boom, straight away.

259
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,637
It was incredible.
I'd never done that before.

260
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,315
I ran into the pit,
and one picked up the over shield.

261
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,552
And I jumped on his head three times.
Assassinated him. It was incredible.

262
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,200
Hash cookie?
- No. They give me the shits.

263
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,717
Up the lift, spin around, get the other in
the head. You're not listening, are you?

264
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,513
Dude, gimme that cookie.

265
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,269
I ate it.
- You ate the whole thing?

266
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,833
Jesus, man, that's like
the equivalent of like 40 joints.

267
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,070
You're gonna be so fucked up.

268
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,755
You better hope Kate doesn't arrive
in the next hour. Seriously.

269
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,233
Shit.

270
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,394
Tom, are you OK?
- I can't. What?

271
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,313
Kate's here, by the way.
- Where?

272
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,469
She's coming now.

273
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,669
Hey, guys.
- Hey.

274
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,990
I have to go do stuff.

275
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,236
Hi, Kate. I love your hair.
- Come on, Bulger. Let's dance.

276
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,959
It's a great party.

277
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,795
I ate a cookie.
- Tom, are you stoned?

278
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,313
High? Me? No.

279
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,318
Yeah. But you made it. That's great.
- I didn't know you knew so many people.

280
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,678
Yeah. Thanks for coming.
- Fuck you.

281
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,514
That's Jeff. Funny guy.

282
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,390
I need some water.

283
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,676
Oh, I missed you.

284
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,436
Kate, I missed you, too.
- I meant with the drink.

285
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,595
I can't stand him. He sits beside me
in English. He's such a fucking idiot.

286
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,636
And that pubic beard.
He needs to shave.

287
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,395
White socks with black shoes.
I don't fucking think so.

288
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,629
It ain't '92, aye?

289
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,116
Oh, man, look. Here she is.

290
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,994
Oh, she's so fucking hot.
Look, look, look.

291
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,435
Shake it, baby. Yeah. Shake it.

292
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,836
Working it.
- She's gonna get it tonight.

293
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,390
There's more a chance
of me going on a diet. Seriously.

294
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,559
Things are about to get romantic.

295
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,791
Vinny, you're as romantic
as a wank in Funderland.

296
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,996
Lads, I need a wing man.

297
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,234
Go.

298
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,950
Hey.
- This is Tom. It's his party.

299
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,315
Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, thanks.

300
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,793
Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

301
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,748
You want your picture taken?
Yeah, you do. Come on.

302
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,550
Just a little over this way.
Ok? Yeah. Nice.

303
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,030
He's taking her picture.
- I see.

304
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,872
How are we?
- Hi, Dan. Thanks for coming.

305
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,188
Wouldn't have missed this.

306
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,790
Would not have missed it.
Nice decorations.

307
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,951
Quite a little shindig you got here.
You pulled out all the stops, didn't you?

308
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,917
Well done.
- Yeah.

309
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,914
Look. There are some of
your friends over there.

310
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,313
You want me to go?
- No, don't be silly.

311
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,678
Yeah, Tom, don't be silly.
You don't have to go.

312
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,548
Don't be silly.
- Fine.

313
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,877
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

314
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,750
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

315
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,030
Look at the face on him.
- It's only Paul, you dope.

316
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,032
I'm gonna kill you, Tommy boy.
- Cop on, you dick.

317
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,439
Fuck off.

318
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,833
Tom, are you OK?

319
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,709
Nice one, guys.
- Not our fault he can't take a joke.

320
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,236
I'll slap that smile off your face,
you knacker bitch.

321
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,510
Fight! Fight! Fight!

322
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,440
Oh babe, come over here. We'll have
a bit of a cat fight. OMG, little pussy.

323
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,435
Babe, your just a pigeon in a tacky frock.
- Bitch, I don't wanna talk, poodle face.

324
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,990
Babe, you're easier to get into than
community college, so leave.

325
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,798
Fuck you.
- Fuck you, Sarah.

326
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,115
Wait, the whole party already has.

327
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,428
That's enough, Bulger.

328
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,911
You and the prick just leave
because no one likes you.

329
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,711
Where's the first aid kit?
- In the pantry.

330
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,155
You have a pantry?
I'm on it.

331
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,793
Tom!

332
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,119
He went that way, love.

333
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,275
Kate! Where did you put
that bottle of vodka?

334
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,750
Is it in your bag? Kate?

335
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,954
All right, I'll see you later.

336
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,359
Bingo.

337
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,234
My favourite.

338
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,514
Are you OK?

339
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,512
How's your head?
- It's fine.

340
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,950
Remember we used to come up here?

341
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,998
This is the crows nest.

342
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,037
Do you still use it?

343
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,710
Tom, what the fuck?
- What?

344
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,670
Why is the telescope pointing at my house?

345
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,153
Pervert.
- No.

346
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,391
I was up here the other night
looking at the graveyard,

347
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,556
and I saw your light come on.

348
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,229
I turned the telescope around
and saw you in your room.

349
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:29,077
You were a bit mad about something.

350
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,188
You were wearing clothes anyway.
That's all I saw. I swear.

351
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,110
Why were you looking at the graveyard
in the first place?

352
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,996
Open up before I fucking piss
in clown pants. Fuck's sake!

353
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,071
Go upstairs, you clown.
- Fuck you.

354
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:09,359
I know how this sounds, but the night of
Stitches' funeral I went to the graveyard,

355
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,268
and I saw this ancient ritual thing
in the clown crypt.

356
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,034
It freaked me out.

357
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,753
You think I'm nuts, don't you?

358
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,388
No.
- Anyway, I'm not a peeping Tom.

359
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,152
I'm just a mental Tom.

360
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,472
You're not the only one who's screwed up.
All of us turned out odd.

361
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,835
Where's the fucking zip?

362
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,799
Not again.

363
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,076
No one would believe me, so I started
researching everything on clowns.

364
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,508
I thought if I found something out about
that ritual, I could prove it happened.

365
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,511
Clowns have been around for centuries.
I've got stuff on Mediaeval jesters,

366
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,992
Pueblo lndian Delight Makers, ancient
Egyptian rib tickling ceremonies,

367
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,516
the Feast of Fools,
the right of Osseous Humours...

368
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,276
I never found anything.
It was all in my head.

369
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,119
What are these?

370
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,193
When a person becomes a clown,
they have to paint their face on an egg.

371
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,317
They call it the Spiritus Singularum,
the Uniqueness of Spirit.

372
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,120
Nobody knows
where the tradition comes from.

373
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,192
It's been around
for as long as the clowns have.

374
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,357
Paul.

375
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,153
He just can't compete. She's with you.
She feels sorry for him. That's all.

376
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,992
Aw, tastes like piss.

377
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,434
Is there any more?

378
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,549
Up to your old tricks again, Paul?

379
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,556
Who the fuck are you?

380
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,352
Maybe this trick will jog your memory.

381
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,315
My fucking ear!

382
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,878
You're a lucky boy, Paul.

383
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,518
You've got a front row seat
to my comeback show.

384
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,111
Please. No. Please.

385
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,318
That doesn't sound good.

386
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,879
You must have a hair in your throat.
Allow me.

387
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,997
Something. It wasn't a hair.
It was a little fluffy bunny.

388
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,949
It was our fault he died.
- It wasn't.

389
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,828
Just for the record,
not every party ends with a dead clown.

390
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,349
This party is really kicking now.

391
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,158
So, photography is your hobby, is it?

392
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,155
Pretty much, kind of.
You get some good results.

393
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,870
Let me see.
- I'm trying to see where the lads are.

394
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,312
Great.
- OK.

395
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,075
I really like this one. This one is...

396
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,917
Yeah, that's of you.
It's a nice picture, I guess.

397
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,435
Hey, Kate. Kate.

398
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,239
Oh, excuse me.
What's your problem, pale face?

399
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,437
My problem is you pulling that shit
with Tom, you ginger fuck.

400
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,398
Fuck off. That boy needs to lighten up.

401
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,119
How is pissy pants anyway?

402
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,839
Up in his layer crying,
drying himself off?

403
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,430
It was a joke. He needs to get over that.
- It wasn't a very funny joke.

404
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,272
It was pretty hilarious.
I was laughing.

405
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,438
Have you seen Paul floating around?
- Your asshole boyfriend?

406
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,556
Oh.
- No.

407
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,351
Kate. If you wanna get to me, you're gonna
have to do better than slag Paul.

408
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,955
Speaking of boyfriends, what lead singer
are you sleeping with nowadays?

409
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,349
Changes so often.
- Keeping tabs, are you?

410
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,750
Well, it is difficult.
It's not a one man job.

411
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,470
Speaking of jobs, I do hear you're
more partial to the old blow job.

412
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,997
What? - How else would you acquire
the name 'Blow Job Kate'?

413
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,354
Fuck!

414
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,198
Sniff 'em out.

415
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,359
Goodbye, Funny Bones.

416
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,790
Look's like you've eaten too much, fatso.

417
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,710
Paul, you dick.

418
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,432
I'm not Paul.
He had to head off.

419
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,509
Let's see if we can find
room in there for desert.

420
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,635
Oh, Jesus.

421
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,758
Help! Help!

422
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,631
I'm being raped by a clown!

423
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,634
Help!

424
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,556
Now, that's food for thought.

425
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,557
You feeling a bit peckish, fat boy?

426
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,959
Do you want me to call someone?

427
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,949
You're fucking disgusting.

428
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,831
Paul!

429
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,713
Ice cream and crisps,

430
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,594
and people would say
I was fat all the time.

431
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,069
Everything was just so...

432
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,350
Anyway, tell me something about you.

433
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,159
I can make a girl's nipples hard
without touching.

434
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,069
Bet you five quid.
- What's going on here?

435
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,799
He said he could make my nipples hard
without touching.

436
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,314
He's not messing. I've seen him practise
on Bulger's moobs.

437
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,750
OK, I need to concentrate.

438
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,716
Vinny! Oh my God!
- Worth every penny.

439
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,639
For fuck's sake, you little prick.

440
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,832
Vinny.

441
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,838
What a perfect pair, a dick and a cunt.

442
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,156
Vinny, you dickhead.

443
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:26,711
Paul?

444
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,108
Paul?

445
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,758
Paul, is that you?

446
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,951
Are you trying to be funny?

447
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,112
This clown's not funny.

448
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,112
Not anymore.

449
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,158
Pick up the phone, Vinny.

450
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,957
Brace yourself. Here it comes.

451
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,988
Bastard.

452
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,399
Taken from behind.

453
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,110
Sniff 'em out.

454
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,952
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

455
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:27,195
Guys, you need to get out
of here right now!

456
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,637
There's a clown who died and he came back,
and he's in my house right now!

457
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,915
You need to get out of here!

458
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,598
Clown?
- You're a fucking clown.

459
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,915
I'm not joking.
We need to go right now.

460
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,072
Oh my God, you are being serious.
- Piss off.

461
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,319
Vinny!
- Vinny!

462
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,233
Vinny, I love you.
- Tom, what the fuck?

463
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,198
You need to get out of the house now!
- What are you talking about?

464
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,068
The clown's back. Get everyone together.
Get dressed and get out of there.

465
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,675
Calm down. It's OK.
I'll be out in about five minutes.

466
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,752
It's not safe, Vinny.
We have to go right now!

467
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,516
Shut up for a second, please.
- Six minutes.

468
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,308
He's ready for you, Vinny.
- Listen to me!

469
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,356
Go for it.
- I need you, man.

470
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,154
You're in there.
He's ready for you, Vinny.

471
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,073
He says he'll give you a hand job
for a fiver.

472
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,631
Vinny!
- Just tell him you love him.

473
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,510
Let's see how many lives you've got left.

474
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,399
One, two, three,

475
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,517
four, five, six,

476
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,712
seven, eight, nine.

477
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,071
Dead.

478
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,519
Kate. It's Stitches.
- What are you talking about?

479
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,835
The clown from my party, he's back.
- That clown died at your party.

480
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,115
No, serious.
- Tom, it's Paul dressed up.

481
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,873
It's not Paul. I know what I saw.
Come on.

482
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,076
Paul, no.
- Fuck off.

483
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,478
Guys, there's a killer in the house!

484
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,870
Vinny's upstairs. He needs our help.
- Help him get it up.

485
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,795
Has anyone seen Paul, Richie or Bulger?

486
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,475
So do you wanna go upstairs?
- No. I don't want to encourage this shit.

487
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,758
No, I mean do you want to go upstairs?

488
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,118
Don't worry about her, man. She doesn't
know a winner when she sees one.

489
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,269
Chicks.

490
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,149
Vinny?

491
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,395
Prick.

492
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,437
We have to go now.

493
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,037
Vinny, the clown is back.
If you don't come now, he could kill us.

494
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,431
We need to get out of here.
- I'm trying to bang this chick.

495
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,670
Vinny, tell the little prick to piss off!

496
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,795
You don't look happy to see me.
I know what'll cheer you up.

497
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,315
I saw him upstairs. You have to come now.
- Vinny. Vinny.

498
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,510
I'll be back in two minutes.

499
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,320
Can you tell what it is yet?

500
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:16,829
Woof. Woof.

501
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,598
Dickhead.

502
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,159
Say cheese. Oh, that's not my best side.

503
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,716
What's happening to me?
- Stop talking, big head.

504
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,479
Let's get the fuck out of here.

505
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,073
Put your knickers on. We're leaving.

506
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,351
Vinny. Vinny.

507
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,556
Mary, come on.
There's a killer clown in the house.

508
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,519
Is there? I'd like to meet him.
Sounds like a fun guy.

509
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,157
You are 16, right?
I don't want to go to prison.

510
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,193
Long time no see.

511
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,230
Bastard!
- Step on his head!

512
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,711
Oh, for fuck's sake.

513
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:22,070
Vinny, I'm not leaving here
without Kate and the others.

514
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:45,160
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

515
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:50,030
Where are you?
Right, where are you?

516
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,317
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

517
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:59,512
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

518
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:06,278
Come on.
- No.

519
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,510
Toughen up.
- No.

520
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,916
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

521
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:21,717
Here, Tommy, Tommy.
Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

522
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:27,636
We'll be OK in the crowd. He's not going
to attack us in front of everyone.

523
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,278
OK? OK.

524
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,194
Where do you think you're going?
- Get out of my way, you wanker.

525
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,158
You're so fucking sued.
My dad's a lawyer!

526
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,236
Richie!

527
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,631
Richie!

528
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,397
Richie!

529
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,115
Oh my God!

530
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:28,148
Why you screaming, chunky?
You clearly got the stomach for it.

531
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,678
Everybody happy?

532
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,991
We have to go.

533
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,908
Blow Job Kate, get your mouth around this.

534
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,989
Vinny, Kate.
Kate.

535
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,832
Kate, wake up.
- Kiss her, Tom. Now's your chance.

536
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,553
Kate!

537
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,993
Come on!

538
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,556
Deja-motherfucking-vu.

539
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,955
Where do you think you're going?

540
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,272
Where are we going?
- To the graveyard.

541
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,432
Stitches' egg. If we can find it
and break it, I think we can kill him.

542
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,795
You little bastard.

543
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,391
Oh, for fuck's sake.

544
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,398
Come on. Hurry up.

545
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,837
I can't stop it.

546
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,997
Where are you?

547
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,917
Where are you?

548
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,313
Let's go.

549
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,633
OK. One of us needs to stand guard.

550
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,320
Inside, you'll see big shelves
with hundreds of eggs on them.

551
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,510
Tom...
- Stitches' egg has his face on it.

552
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,189
Tom, I don't know what's there. Just go.
- Yes.

553
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,840
Looks like there's a party at my house.

554
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,948
Where are you?

555
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,429
Tom, righty tighty, lefty loosey.

556
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,038
Happy birthday, Tommy.

557
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,395
It's time to cut the cake.

558
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,353
Now which is funnier...

559
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,228
the look on your face watching her die...

560
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:14,030
or the look on her face watching you die?

561
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,349
How about we flip a coin?

562
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,197
Heads it's me. Tails it's her.

563
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,118
That's really sick, Tom.

564
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,430
I like it.

565
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,437
Well, fuck me sideways.

566
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:14,198
I never thought I'd end up
with egg on my face.

567
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,513
What is it?
- Open it. It's a moving house gift.

568
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,990
We're only moving down the road.
- Just open it.

569
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,438
You'll need a stronger lens
if you wanna keep an eye on me.

570
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,195
Not that you're in to that sort of thing.
- Yeah.

571
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:04,112
Steady.

572
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,748
Steady.

573
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:26,115
Yes. Yes.

574
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,514
Everybody happy?
