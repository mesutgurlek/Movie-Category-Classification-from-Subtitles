1
01:30:33,901 --> 01:30:36,426
Why don't you stare at this for a
IittIe whiIe, ya ugIy bastard.

2
01:30:52,986 --> 01:30:56,387
-What are you doing here?
-I'm taking the specimen.

3
01:30:56,423 --> 01:30:58,914
WeII, you can't. I haven't prepped
the cryostasis chamber.

4
01:30:59,826 --> 01:31:03,353
I don't want him frozen, Rowan.
I want him soft.

5
01:31:03,397 --> 01:31:05,831
We've aIready discussed this.

6
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:10,394
WeII, I had to go over your head. I'm
moving him to our Scranton FaciIity.

7
01:31:10,437 --> 01:31:13,235
Doctor Wimmer, you can't risk
transporting him through open country.

8
01:31:13,273 --> 01:31:15,264
This isn't open for discussion.

9
01:31:15,876 --> 01:31:20,745
His unique abiIity to regenerate Iost
and damaged tissue, I mean,

10
01:31:20,781 --> 01:31:23,045
itjust-itjust cries out
for more research.

11
01:31:23,083 --> 01:31:26,177
And you're wiIIing to risk the death
of innocent civiIians if he escapes.

12
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:26,845
Yes.

13
01:31:27,521 --> 01:31:31,548
But I'm sure Sergeant Marcus and his
men can handIe the transferjustfine.

14
01:31:31,592 --> 01:31:32,388
Sergeant?

15
01:31:32,859 --> 01:31:34,588
Everything's under controI, ma'am.

16
01:31:37,698 --> 01:31:39,063
Doctor Wimmer, pIease.

17
01:31:39,099 --> 01:31:41,397
Rowan, he's no Ionger your probIem.

18
01:31:55,649 --> 01:31:57,446
Can we get that rag off him?

19
01:32:09,363 --> 01:32:11,388
What the heII?

20
01:32:38,258 --> 01:32:39,418
Oh, my God!

21
01:32:44,998 --> 01:32:47,660
-Get outta here.
-What happened?

22
01:32:48,935 --> 01:32:49,993
I'm sorry.

23
01:34:49,289 --> 01:34:52,725
Cryogenic breach.
Emergency lock-down.

24
01:34:56,296 --> 01:34:58,025
Oh, God, no.

25
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:01,357
Oh. No.

26
01:36:51,444 --> 01:36:52,433
Kay-Em?

27
01:36:52,946 --> 01:36:55,141
No viruses, no bacteria.

28
01:36:55,181 --> 01:36:57,012
No toxins. lt's clean.

29
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:04,857
It's stiII coId.

30
01:37:08,261 --> 01:37:09,694
Someone want to teII me
what that is?

31
01:37:10,263 --> 01:37:15,200
It's Iike a big kind off-frozen
s-storage thing?

32
01:37:15,635 --> 01:37:17,626
ProbabIy a cryostasis unit.

33
01:37:18,204 --> 01:37:20,069
I'd guess earIy Port series.
Kay-Em?

34
01:37:20,106 --> 01:37:23,269
Quadroport EIeven.
Manufactured in Twenty-ten.

35
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,471
Precise historic records
are inconsistent.

36
01:37:29,316 --> 01:37:32,376
-Anyone thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
-Open it up.

37
01:37:51,137 --> 01:37:52,968
What the heII is that?

38
01:37:53,006 --> 01:37:56,100
Humanoid.
Organic composition is uncIear.

39
01:37:56,309 --> 01:37:58,209
Can someone teII me
what's on his face?

40
01:37:58,578 --> 01:38:03,709
Uh, some kinda twentieth-century
carbon fiItration unit?

41
01:38:04,985 --> 01:38:08,182
-It's a hockey mask.
-Very good, Tsunaron.

42
01:38:09,456 --> 01:38:10,946
What's a hockey mask?

43
01:38:10,991 --> 01:38:14,688
FaciaI armor. Used in a sport
outIawed in Twenty-Twenty-Four.

44
01:38:16,029 --> 01:38:16,996
Amazing.

45
01:38:18,298 --> 01:38:20,425
AbsoIute museum quaIity.

46
01:38:22,636 --> 01:38:24,467
Are you paying attention, AzraeI?

47
01:38:24,504 --> 01:38:25,698
Yeah.

48
01:38:27,974 --> 01:38:29,669
WeII, don't touch anything.

49
01:38:50,330 --> 01:38:53,094
Guys. We got another body here.

50
01:39:01,207 --> 01:39:01,866
Kay-Em?

51
01:39:01,908 --> 01:39:06,641
She's perfectIy preserved.
CeII crystaIIization's at 25 percent.

52
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,806
Twenty-five percent?

53
01:39:07,847 --> 01:39:11,044
Suggest extensive nanotech
and phase one ceII reconstruction.

54
01:39:11,317 --> 01:39:14,343
Wait-Waita minute, areyou...
are you saying that...

55
01:39:15,288 --> 01:39:17,279
that we can bring her back to Iife?

56
01:39:17,323 --> 01:39:19,518
Yes. But she is deteriorating.

57
01:39:19,559 --> 01:39:22,050
Opening the door has compromised
her hibernation.

58
01:39:22,095 --> 01:39:25,087
Lou, get ready for dust-off.
We have a priority evac.

59
01:39:25,131 --> 01:39:26,826
Copy that, ready in five.

60
01:39:26,866 --> 01:39:28,231
Notfive, now.

61
01:39:31,404 --> 01:39:32,530
What the--?

62
01:39:34,574 --> 01:39:35,438
Look out!

63
01:39:41,414 --> 01:39:44,611
Fifty-five cc's ofetherene.
You'II be fine.

64
01:39:44,651 --> 01:39:47,051
F-Fine? I'm missing my arm!

65
01:39:55,795 --> 01:39:57,422
Oh, you're so pretty.

66
01:40:20,887 --> 01:40:23,879
-Kicker, are the doors secure?
-Locked and bIocked.

67
01:40:23,923 --> 01:40:28,292
BeautifuI. Liftoff in three, two...

68
01:40:35,235 --> 01:40:37,362
I Iove this part.

69
01:40:44,577 --> 01:40:45,703
What'd you find?

70
01:40:45,745 --> 01:40:48,942
Won't beIieve it.
Get the sarge on the horn.

71
01:40:49,849 --> 01:40:52,875
Didyou hear?Division four
justenteredthe occupiedzone.

72
01:40:52,919 --> 01:40:54,113
-CasuaIties?
-MinimaI.

73
01:40:54,354 --> 01:40:56,584
You know, I'd Iove to know how
we got this screwed-up gig.

74
01:40:56,623 --> 01:40:59,649
Yeah, weII, I didn'tjoin the corps
to become a friggin' baby sitter.

75
01:41:07,233 --> 01:41:09,963
-Brodski, here.
-Sarge, we founda viable down here.

76
01:41:10,003 --> 01:41:10,469
Say again?

77
01:41:10,503 --> 01:41:12,903
We found two bodies
in deep cryostasis.

78
01:41:13,206 --> 01:41:16,198
The Kay-Em unit thinks we can
resuscitate the femaIe.

79
01:41:16,442 --> 01:41:17,374
FemaIe?

80
01:41:19,078 --> 01:41:20,045
Yeah.

81
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,904
Crutch, do you copy?

82
01:41:23,516 --> 01:41:24,710
Crutch, doyou readme?

83
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:27,184
Crutch, wake the heII up.

84
01:41:27,954 --> 01:41:29,922
-Yeah, what do you want?
-They're on their way back.

85
01:41:30,056 --> 01:41:31,853
Prepare for docking
and power up the Iab.

86
01:41:31,891 --> 01:41:33,756
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

87
01:41:55,849 --> 01:41:58,079
-So, what does she Iook Iike?
-She's cute.

88
01:41:58,618 --> 01:42:00,313
Yeah. And singIe.

89
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:08,054
I'm so IoneIy.

90
01:42:32,785 --> 01:42:34,343
We need to get her to the Iab.

91
01:42:39,826 --> 01:42:42,488
-You think you can bring her back?
-We'II find out, sergeant.

92
01:42:46,032 --> 01:42:49,695
-You're not gonna bring him back?
-No, it's impossibIe.

93
01:42:52,205 --> 01:42:54,799
Aw, shit. I forgot my arm.

94
01:42:54,841 --> 01:42:57,173
Yeah, here you go, dumb-ass.

95
01:42:57,543 --> 01:42:58,908
Hi, hand.

96
01:43:01,614 --> 01:43:04,674
-Any idea how Iong she's been down?
-Four-point-five-five centuries.

97
01:43:04,951 --> 01:43:06,976
Must've been one heII of
a wake-up caII.

98
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:09,989
-I'm bitchy as heII when I wake up.
-Did you just wake up?

99
01:43:15,295 --> 01:43:18,264
-Kinsa.
-You guys aIways find the cooI shit.

100
01:43:18,298 --> 01:43:21,665
-Where's WayIander?
-He's in Iab one, charging the bed now.

101
01:43:21,701 --> 01:43:23,566
Good. Find Stoney and Adrienne
and get to Iab two.

102
01:43:24,904 --> 01:43:27,031
Once we're in the cIear,
I'd Iike to check your circuits.

103
01:43:27,073 --> 01:43:29,041
Oh, I'II bet you wouId.

104
01:43:29,075 --> 01:43:30,337
It isn't Iike that.

105
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:35,543
-Adrienne, good. I need you in Iab two.
-You found something, didn't you?

106
01:43:35,581 --> 01:43:36,843
-Two viabIes.
-Two? In what condition?

107
01:43:36,883 --> 01:43:38,748
Perfect. We're attempting reanimation
with one ofthem.

108
01:43:38,785 --> 01:43:39,774
Great, what can I do?

109
01:43:39,819 --> 01:43:42,413
-You, Stoney and Kinsa they're second...
-They're gonna sIow me down.

110
01:43:42,455 --> 01:43:44,286
Just waIk them through it, okay?

111
01:43:44,324 --> 01:43:46,815
Run a compIete structuraI scan, Iog them
in properIy and put them in stasis.

112
01:43:46,859 --> 01:43:49,350
-I'II check back with you Iater.
-Fine.

113
01:43:52,598 --> 01:43:53,724
Okay, where are we?

114
01:43:53,766 --> 01:43:55,666
The board's aII green, teach.
The N-two's warm and ready.

115
01:43:55,702 --> 01:43:58,671
Good. Kay-Em, begin stabiIizing
any ceIIuIar fractures.

116
01:43:58,705 --> 01:43:59,637
Yes, professor.

117
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:03,000
Janessa, I need a fuII scan.
GIyceroI IeveIs,

118
01:44:03,042 --> 01:44:04,839
cerebraI profusion, the whoIe works.

119
01:44:04,877 --> 01:44:05,809
I Iive to serve, professor.

120
01:44:05,878 --> 01:44:07,573
Let's see what we're deaIin'
with here.

121
01:44:07,613 --> 01:44:10,548
DecrystaIization ofthe membranes
is now atThirty-two percent.

122
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:12,073
Good. Somebody get those
cIothes off her.

123
01:44:12,118 --> 01:44:13,016
Oh, I got it!

124
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:16,689
I got it. HonestIy.

125
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:19,354
WayIander... where's her diffusion
barriers?

126
01:44:21,194 --> 01:44:22,627
Seventeen and stabIe.

127
01:44:22,662 --> 01:44:23,686
Here we go.

128
01:44:28,067 --> 01:44:31,559
Stay stiII or you'II end up getting
an eIbow where your wrist shouId be.

129
01:44:36,976 --> 01:44:40,935
Specimen forty-four twenty found in
sector 39-30 L on Earth prime.

130
01:44:41,114 --> 01:44:43,514
Subject discovered in compIete
cryosuspension.

131
01:45:11,677 --> 01:45:13,474
-How's it goin'?
-Good, man. What's up?

132
01:45:16,082 --> 01:45:18,676
-Hey, where do you want this?
-On the specimen tabIe.

133
01:45:19,085 --> 01:45:20,848
-Hi, baby.
-Hey, gorgeous.

134
01:45:22,221 --> 01:45:23,711
Initiating scan.

135
01:45:26,659 --> 01:45:29,025
Mm, smart and sexy.

136
01:45:30,363 --> 01:45:33,560
Professor. Take a look
atthisguy's scan.

137
01:45:37,103 --> 01:45:38,195
Amazing.

138
01:45:38,871 --> 01:45:40,805
How does he function
with a brain that smaII?

139
01:45:41,074 --> 01:45:43,065
-Way manages.
-That's very funny.

140
01:45:43,676 --> 01:45:47,237
-He's a big boy.
-I bet he's hung Iike a mammoth.

141
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,681
Okay, you guys. You know what?
Just get the heII outta here...

142
01:45:56,722 --> 01:45:58,383
and come back when you're
more focused.

143
01:45:58,958 --> 01:46:01,051
-You serious?
-Yes, just go.

144
01:46:01,294 --> 01:46:03,091
-Thanks, Adrienne. Come.
-Thanks.

145
01:46:03,362 --> 01:46:04,420
Don't mention it.

146
01:46:05,264 --> 01:46:07,425
See whatyou can salvage
from the optic cortex.

147
01:46:07,633 --> 01:46:09,931
-Then move on.
-My pIeasure, professor.

148
01:46:10,503 --> 01:46:12,061
Ready phase two.

149
01:46:15,641 --> 01:46:16,699
Bring on the ants.

150
01:46:47,173 --> 01:46:49,038
That's it. Come to mama.

151
01:47:11,063 --> 01:47:14,396
Temperature, ninety-six-point-two.
Ninety-seven.

152
01:47:14,767 --> 01:47:16,098
CooI. It's working.

153
01:47:16,135 --> 01:47:17,796
Ninety-eight-point-six and hoIding.

154
01:47:18,905 --> 01:47:22,068
CeII reconstruction is compIete.
InternaI de-fib in three...

155
01:47:23,309 --> 01:47:25,209
two...one.

156
01:47:58,344 --> 01:47:59,572
Easy. Easy.

157
01:48:02,682 --> 01:48:04,707
VitaI signs are normaI and strong.

158
01:48:05,284 --> 01:48:05,750
No shit.

159
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:09,117
Easy. Easy.

160
01:48:09,555 --> 01:48:11,386
Oh, d-- Did ya get him?

161
01:48:12,225 --> 01:48:13,715
Where is he?
TeII me you got him.

162
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:14,756
Got who?

163
01:48:15,194 --> 01:48:17,424
Uh, n-n-n-no one's here.
You're s-safe with us.

164
01:48:20,299 --> 01:48:22,824
There was a I-There was a Ieak
i-in the cryo-unit and....

165
01:48:25,304 --> 01:48:26,498
Ho, was he contained?

166
01:48:27,807 --> 01:48:29,035
It was contained.

167
01:48:29,308 --> 01:48:32,004
But when the cryo-unit ruptured,
you didn'tescape it.

168
01:48:32,345 --> 01:48:33,437
ltputyou into stasis.

169
01:48:36,916 --> 01:48:38,440
For how Iong?

170
01:48:40,953 --> 01:48:42,443
The year is twenty-four fifty-five.

171
01:48:43,456 --> 01:48:47,017
Now, l-l-lknow this is
a huge shock...

172
01:48:47,059 --> 01:48:48,424
butyou'regonna be safe here.

173
01:48:52,064 --> 01:48:56,023
You're aboard GrendeI, a cIass-four,
catamaran transport ship.

174
01:48:56,068 --> 01:48:57,433
We're on our wayback home and...

175
01:48:58,004 --> 01:49:00,404
you'regonna bejustfine.

176
01:49:09,415 --> 01:49:11,406
Twenty-four fifty-five?

177
01:49:16,022 --> 01:49:17,387
That's over four hundred years.

178
01:49:26,432 --> 01:49:29,424
Secure Iine. Perez, Dieter.

179
01:49:29,468 --> 01:49:32,437
SoIaris Research Station. Connect.

180
01:49:41,947 --> 01:49:45,007
Lowe. You bastard.

181
01:49:45,051 --> 01:49:46,416
We've hit the mother Iode.

182
01:49:46,452 --> 01:49:48,443
Do you know what time it is?

183
01:49:48,487 --> 01:49:50,455
I don't care.
We've got a goIdmine.

184
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:53,417
A box of DVDs is not a goIdmine.

185
01:49:56,295 --> 01:49:57,421
Now, I've toId ya, I can't move .

186
01:49:57,463 --> 01:49:58,452
Just Iook at the fiIe.

187
01:49:58,497 --> 01:50:02,399
Two four-hundred-year-oId frozen
specimens. One weII-preserved...

188
01:50:03,002 --> 01:50:07,166
the other one. Are you ready for this?
Up and waIking around.

189
01:50:07,206 --> 01:50:08,605
Four hundred years oId...

190
01:50:08,641 --> 01:50:10,836
and waIkin' around.

191
01:50:10,876 --> 01:50:14,368
Yeah. Four hundred and fifty-five
years, to be exact.

192
01:50:14,447 --> 01:50:16,415
Who cares?
Who gives a shit?

193
01:50:16,449 --> 01:50:19,418
PeopIe. PeopIe wiII pay huge
money to see her.

194
01:50:19,452 --> 01:50:21,420
Let me ask you a question.

195
01:50:21,454 --> 01:50:25,413
Is this the first person you've
reanimated?

196
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:26,425
Ofcourse not.

197
01:50:26,459 --> 01:50:28,427
How many peopIe are out there today,

198
01:50:28,461 --> 01:50:32,420
waIkin' around thawed out
and Iookin' good?

199
01:50:32,465 --> 01:50:33,432
-Hundreds.
-Thousands.

200
01:50:33,466 --> 01:50:36,435
Maybe. But notfour hundred
and fifty years oId.

201
01:50:36,469 --> 01:50:38,437
She's nearIy twice as oId
as anyone on the pIanet.

202
01:50:38,471 --> 01:50:41,440
Two-fifty, four-fifty,
what's the difference?

203
01:50:41,474 --> 01:50:47,435
Doctor, a hundred years ago when
reanimation was more unpredictabIe,

204
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,408
sure, maybe. But now...

205
01:50:49,482 --> 01:50:51,450
it's oId news.

206
01:50:51,484 --> 01:50:54,453
Damn it. I need money.

207
01:50:54,487 --> 01:50:57,456
Oh, I know. I know.

208
01:51:00,092 --> 01:51:03,391
The other viabIe is marked
''Voorhees.''

209
01:51:04,063 --> 01:51:07,396
That's notJason Voorhees, is it?

210
01:51:07,433 --> 01:51:10,368
-What do you know about him?
-Jason Voorhees.

211
01:51:12,471 --> 01:51:15,031
Oh, he kiIIed nearIy
two hundred peopIe...

212
01:51:15,074 --> 01:51:17,406
and simpIy disappeared
without a trace.

213
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:21,373
Why, to the right buyer he couId be
worth, uh, a fortune.

214
01:51:23,849 --> 01:51:25,840
WeII, I've got him frozen right
here on the ship.

215
01:51:25,885 --> 01:51:27,682
You work out a Iist ofownership?

216
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:31,383
No Iist. He's my find.
He's-He's mine.

217
01:51:31,490 --> 01:51:33,219
What about your students?

218
01:51:33,259 --> 01:51:37,195
WeII, they're students. The
educationaI experience wiII be enough.

219
01:51:37,229 --> 01:51:40,130
Doctor, doctor, you are one
son ofa bitch.

220
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:41,793
Soon to be one rich son ofa bitch.

221
01:51:42,234 --> 01:51:43,428
Lowe out.

222
01:51:48,908 --> 01:51:53,868
I think that, uh, we need to taIk
about my midterm.

223
01:52:40,893 --> 01:52:43,862
Poor baby. No wonder you wore
this thing.

224
01:52:50,903 --> 01:52:53,872
Harder. Harder.

225
01:52:53,906 --> 01:52:56,875
Who's been a naughty IittIe boy?

226
01:52:56,909 --> 01:53:00,811
M-I have.
Oh. Harder.

227
01:53:00,846 --> 01:53:02,814
You want it a IittIe harder?
Yeah? How's that?

228
01:53:02,848 --> 01:53:04,816
-Yeah. Oh, good.
-Yeah?

229
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:05,817
-Yeah. That's it.
-That's it, right there?

230
01:53:05,851 --> 01:53:06,818
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah?

231
01:53:07,019 --> 01:53:07,883
-Daddy Iikes it hard?
-Yeah. Yeah.

232
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,820
-Daddy wants it hard, huh?
-Yeah.

233
01:53:09,855 --> 01:53:10,822
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah. That's it...

234
01:53:10,856 --> 01:53:11,823
-Right there?
-Yeah.

235
01:53:11,857 --> 01:53:13,825
-You Iike it right there?
-Yeah. Yeah.

236
01:53:13,859 --> 01:53:14,826
-A IittIe harder for...
-Yeah!

237
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:15,827
-daddy?
-Yeah!

238
01:53:15,861 --> 01:53:16,828
-Come on!
-Yeah! Yeah!

239
01:53:16,862 --> 01:53:19,831
-Come on!
-You pass!

240
01:54:16,589 --> 01:54:18,386
What do you think?

241
01:54:18,424 --> 01:54:20,517
-Do you Iike them?
-They're fine.

242
01:54:24,897 --> 01:54:27,661
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think this is
going to work.

243
01:54:28,267 --> 01:54:30,030
Why do you want those things
anyways?

244
01:54:30,102 --> 01:54:32,400
-Janessa has them.
-WeII, Janessa's....

245
01:54:32,838 --> 01:54:34,362
-ReaI?
-Yes.

246
01:54:35,274 --> 01:54:37,401
Let's not compIicate things,
aII right?

247
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:41,409
I Iike you just the way you are.
I think you're perfect.

248
01:54:42,147 --> 01:54:42,408
Okay.

249
01:56:20,212 --> 01:56:21,440
HeIp, WayIand! No!

250
01:56:22,314 --> 01:56:23,440
Somebody heIp me!

251
01:56:24,583 --> 01:56:26,448
HeIp me! No! No! No! No!

252
01:57:13,132 --> 01:57:14,429
I brought you something to eat.

253
01:57:16,802 --> 01:57:18,429
Not much Ionger and we'II be
at Earth Two.

254
01:57:19,304 --> 01:57:22,102
Earth Two?
What happened to Earth One?

255
01:57:23,008 --> 01:57:26,739
Yeah, weII, it's dead. The oceans,
the soiI, neither wiII sustain Iife.

256
01:57:27,646 --> 01:57:29,876
Can I do anything eIse for you?

257
01:57:50,669 --> 01:57:52,569
You wanna teII me what happened
down there?

258
01:57:52,604 --> 01:57:56,506
I take it being stabbed and frozen
wasn't part ofyour pIan.

259
01:57:56,675 --> 01:58:02,170
I'm a... I was a project Ieader
at CrystaI Lake Research.

260
01:58:02,281 --> 01:58:04,249
The subject was Jason Voorhees.

261
01:58:04,283 --> 01:58:05,409
Jason Voorhees?

262
01:58:06,852 --> 01:58:08,410
Notorious murderer?

263
01:58:10,289 --> 01:58:13,417
We executed him for the first time
in two thousand eight.

264
01:58:13,458 --> 01:58:14,425
For the first time?

265
01:58:15,194 --> 01:58:18,425
We tried everything. EIectrocution,
gas, firing squad.

266
01:58:19,865 --> 01:58:22,425
We even hung him once.
Nothing worked.

267
01:58:23,302 --> 01:58:25,429
FinaIIy, it was decided that
ifwe couIdn't terminate him,

268
01:58:25,504 --> 01:58:26,436
we couId at Ieast contain him.

269
01:58:26,605 --> 01:58:30,439
Cryogenic stasis. Freeze him untiI
we couId figure out what to do.

270
01:58:30,542 --> 01:58:32,442
-Seems sensibIe.
-I thought so.

271
01:58:33,045 --> 01:58:35,445
But unfortunateIy some peopIe who
were too smartfor their own good...

272
01:58:37,149 --> 01:58:40,448
feIt that a creature that couIdn't be
kiIIed was simpIy too vaIuabIe...

273
01:58:40,485 --> 01:58:41,452
tojustfiIe away.

274
01:58:43,488 --> 01:58:45,456
In the end, it aIways comes down
to money.

275
01:58:51,496 --> 01:58:53,464
How do you thank someone who
gives you back your Iife?

276
01:58:54,466 --> 01:58:56,457
WeII, you're gonna be aIive
for a Iong time.

277
01:58:57,236 --> 01:58:58,464
We'II figure out something.

278
01:59:06,011 --> 01:59:09,412
Why don't you just admit it?
You want me.

279
01:59:10,449 --> 01:59:14,408
I couId never be with a girI whose
baIIs are bigger than mine.

280
01:59:17,456 --> 01:59:21,415
Guys, our star patient is back.
Rowan, this is Tsunaron and Janessa.

281
01:59:22,461 --> 01:59:23,428
-Hi.
-Hi.

282
01:59:23,462 --> 01:59:25,430
Hi. I see that my cIothes fit okay.

283
01:59:25,464 --> 01:59:28,433
Oh, these are yours.
They're great. Thank you.

284
01:59:29,468 --> 01:59:32,437
Whoa. What are those?

285
01:59:32,471 --> 01:59:34,439
These are Janessa's Iove chiIdren.

286
01:59:35,474 --> 01:59:41,435
You see now, it is that wit ofyours
that is what repeIs aII human femaIes.

287
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:43,448
And, ofcourse, you've met
Sergeant Brodski.

288
01:59:43,482 --> 01:59:45,450
-Yes. Hi, again.
-Hi.

289
01:59:45,484 --> 01:59:50,444
And this is the IoveIy Kay-Em Fourteen.
Tsunaron's IittIe Iove-bot.

290
01:59:50,489 --> 01:59:52,457
Easy, Janessa.

291
01:59:53,025 --> 01:59:56,461
Kay-Em is a knowIedge matrix android
that I have been programing.

292
01:59:57,262 --> 01:59:58,456
Amazing.

293
02:00:01,433 --> 02:00:04,368
-She Iooks so reaI.
-I am reaI.

294
02:00:04,403 --> 02:00:07,133
-Professor, where do you want this?
-Uh, Iab two, I think.

295
02:00:07,172 --> 02:00:07,399
-Sure.
-Thank you.

296
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:08,404
Where did you get that?

297
02:00:09,041 --> 02:00:12,408
Uh, from your friend.
The big guy with the hockey mask.

298
02:00:12,444 --> 02:00:14,412
-You brought him on board?
-He's in the next Iab.

299
02:00:14,446 --> 02:00:16,414
-We're quite safe.
-Safe?

300
02:00:16,448 --> 02:00:19,417
Our scans reveaI him to be very dead.

301
02:00:21,453 --> 02:00:23,421
CouId your scans be wrong?

302
02:00:23,455 --> 02:00:25,423
I think you shouId just get rid
of him, professor.

303
02:00:25,457 --> 02:00:26,424
He's too dangerous.

304
02:00:26,458 --> 02:00:29,427
WeII, that wouId be irresponsibIe
and fooIhardy.

305
02:00:29,461 --> 02:00:32,430
He's a vaIuabIe scientific artifact
that must be carefuIIy preserved.

306
02:00:32,464 --> 02:00:34,432
Much Iike yourseIf.

307
02:00:36,969 --> 02:00:41,429
He is an unstoppabIe kiIIing machine.
He's not dead.

326
02:01:47,005 --> 02:01:49,439
I want nothing Ieft ofthis guy

327
02:01:49,474 --> 02:01:51,442
Roger that. You heard him, grunts?
Let's get movin'!

328
02:01:51,476 --> 02:01:54,445
Nothin' Ieft of him?
What have you got in mind?

329
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:58,438
Take your kids to Iab one
and stay there tiII you hear from me.

330
02:03:05,417 --> 02:03:07,385
I just saved your ass.

331
02:03:08,386 --> 02:03:10,115
You know, don't get cocky.

332
02:03:10,155 --> 02:03:12,817
I mean, you must reaIIy feeI Iike
a wuss. Huh, there, big boy?

333
02:03:12,858 --> 02:03:15,383
Hey, check the score, kid.
It's stiII nine-three.

334
02:03:15,427 --> 02:03:18,396
Yeah, but I got my groove on now.
You know what I'm sayin'?

335
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:20,398
So, what do you say next kiII wins?

336
02:03:20,432 --> 02:03:21,399

337
02:03:21,433 --> 02:03:24,402
You're goin' down.
You are so goin' down.

338
02:03:29,441 --> 02:03:30,408
Whatthe hell?

339
02:03:30,442 --> 02:03:33,411
-I thought this was an aIien sim.
-Yeah, it is.

340
02:03:33,445 --> 02:03:34,412
Pause pIay.

341
02:03:37,015 --> 02:03:38,414
I said, pause pIay.

342
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:40,415
-Uh, he's not pausing.
-Yeah, no kidding.

343
02:03:41,453 --> 02:03:44,422
I think we need to reboot.

344
02:03:46,458 --> 02:03:50,417
-That does not count as a kiII.
-Oh, yes it does.

345
02:03:54,466 --> 02:03:56,434
Okay, screw this. Game over.

346
02:04:10,982 --> 02:04:12,381
What the heII?

347
02:04:16,421 --> 02:04:20,380
Hey, drop the kid!
Drop the kid! Now!

348
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:27,398
AzraeI, get outta here!

349
02:04:31,436 --> 02:04:33,404
I got him! I got him!

350
02:04:33,438 --> 02:04:35,406
AzraeI... I got no shot!
Move!

351
02:04:51,122 --> 02:04:52,419
Sergeant Brodski.

352
02:04:52,457 --> 02:04:55,426
Don't Ieave those kids aIone.
What the heII's the matter with you?

353
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:57,428
We are Iess than an hour from SoIaris.
They have seven...

354
02:04:57,462 --> 02:04:59,430
fuIIy equipped tacticaI units
there that are more than...

355
02:04:59,464 --> 02:05:00,362
capabIe oftaking care ofthis.

356
02:05:00,398 --> 02:05:02,366
I say we wait and sedate him.

357
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:05,369
-I am takin' this guy out.
-Sergeant, I need him aIive.

358
02:05:05,403 --> 02:05:08,372
No, you want him aIive, but what you
need is to get out of my way.

359
02:05:08,406 --> 02:05:10,374
Look, there are other considerations.

360
02:05:10,408 --> 02:05:12,376
FinanciaI considerations.

361
02:05:13,111 --> 02:05:16,376
My onIy consideration is the safety
ofthe peopIe on this ship.

362
02:05:18,817 --> 02:05:20,375
AII right, a hundred thousand.

363
02:05:21,419 --> 02:05:22,386
Two hundred.

364
02:05:23,421 --> 02:05:24,388
Five.

365
02:05:25,423 --> 02:05:26,390
Five?

366
02:05:31,963 --> 02:05:34,124
-Kicker, DaIIas not here yet?
-Nope.

367
02:05:34,165 --> 02:05:36,156
You, Briggs, find him,
bring him up to speed.

368
02:05:36,201 --> 02:05:37,395
Condor, you have a BFG?

369
02:05:37,435 --> 02:05:40,404
You're with me. Sven, Geko,
you got the starboard pontoon.

370
02:05:40,438 --> 02:05:43,407
Sarge what do we do when
we find this guy?

371
02:05:43,441 --> 02:05:45,409
WeII, I promised the doc we'd
take him aIive.

372
02:05:47,445 --> 02:05:48,412
Man.

373
02:05:48,446 --> 02:05:51,415
So, after you bIow him aII
to heII, put one in his Ieg so...

374
02:05:51,449 --> 02:05:52,416
-we can say we tried.
-Yeah.

375
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:53,417
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

376
02:06:18,476 --> 02:06:19,443
Oh, Lord.

377
02:06:25,483 --> 02:06:27,451
Sarge, I got DaIIas.

378
02:06:27,485 --> 02:06:29,453
-Where the hell is he?
-He's dead.

379
02:06:34,492 --> 02:06:36,460
-Sarge, we got a body in bay two.
-Who is it?

380
02:06:36,494 --> 02:06:39,463
lt's Azrael. Whatthe hell's
goin'on here?

381
02:06:41,499 --> 02:06:44,468
Sarge, we got a bIood traiI headin'
toward the cargo bay.

382
02:06:44,502 --> 02:06:46,470
Condor, Kicker and I wiII take cargo
main.

383
02:06:47,038 --> 02:06:48,471
The rest ofyou take portside.

384
02:06:49,507 --> 02:06:51,475
I hope they know what they're doing.

385
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:54,478
These guys Iive for this stuff.

386
02:07:01,453 --> 02:07:02,420
Sorry.

387
02:07:05,457 --> 02:07:06,424
-Don't do that!
-Dude.

388
02:07:06,458 --> 02:07:09,427
-What?
-You scream Iike a girI.

389
02:07:09,461 --> 02:07:11,429
-Screw you.
-You wish.

390
02:07:38,123 --> 02:07:39,454
Lou, is that you?

391
02:07:58,109 --> 02:08:00,407
Lou, I swear, you mess with an
engineer,

392
02:08:00,445 --> 02:08:02,413
you're gonna wake up in the morning
with a waste hose in your bunk.

393
02:08:05,450 --> 02:08:06,417
AsshoIe.

394
02:08:28,206 --> 02:08:29,434
What the heII?

395
02:08:29,474 --> 02:08:31,442
Crutch, get down now!

396
02:08:58,736 --> 02:09:02,399
-What the heII's going on here?
-Crutch, out now!

397
02:09:06,444 --> 02:09:08,412
Aw, you wrecked my stuff, man.

398
02:09:14,452 --> 02:09:16,420
We naiIed him.
He's gotta be here.

399
02:09:20,458 --> 02:09:22,426
Condor, air borne.

400
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:23,427
Briggs.

401
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:31,428
Where the heII's Sven?

402
02:10:35,466 --> 02:10:37,434
Condor, anything topside?

403
02:10:41,472 --> 02:10:43,440
Negative, sarge.
There's no sign ofhim.

404
02:10:46,477 --> 02:10:48,445
This isn't gonna work.

405
02:11:00,425 --> 02:11:02,393
Keep your eyes peeIed.

406
02:11:08,766 --> 02:11:10,393
Everything's under controI.

407
02:11:28,453 --> 02:11:30,421
Condor, report.

408
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:32,423
Sven, report.

409
02:11:34,459 --> 02:11:36,427
Condor, report.

410
02:11:37,462 --> 02:11:38,429
Report!

411
02:11:39,964 --> 02:11:40,430
Damn.

412
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:04,388
Sarge, we found Condor.

413
02:12:04,422 --> 02:12:06,390
What's his condition?

414
02:12:07,425 --> 02:12:08,392
He's screwed.

415
02:12:12,430 --> 02:12:14,398
Let's smoke this fucker.

416
02:12:33,451 --> 02:12:34,418
God.

417
02:12:35,453 --> 02:12:38,422
Sarge, uh, Sven's dead.

418
02:12:38,456 --> 02:12:41,425
Jesus. You have got to get them
out ofthere.

419
02:12:41,459 --> 02:12:43,427
They know what they're doing.

420
02:13:39,450 --> 02:13:40,417
Oh, man.

421
02:13:41,452 --> 02:13:43,420
Geko, Geko.

Yes, yes. See, they got him.

425
02:14:25,429 --> 02:14:28,398
Don't take your eyes off him.
I'm on my way.

426
02:14:28,432 --> 02:14:31,401
Take your time, sarge.
He ain't goin' nowhere.

427
02:14:47,451 --> 02:14:51,410
Briggs...
get out of here.

428
02:14:52,456 --> 02:14:55,425
Kicker. Briggs.
Where are you, damn it?

429
02:15:09,407 --> 02:15:11,375
He's aII aIone in there.

430
02:15:42,974 --> 02:15:46,410
It's gonna take more than a poke in
the ribs to put down this oId dog.

431
02:15:48,446 --> 02:15:50,414
Yeah...that oughta do it.

432
02:16:03,027 --> 02:16:04,426
Such a waste.

433
02:16:07,965 --> 02:16:09,432
I toId him to stay caIm.

434
02:16:10,468 --> 02:16:13,437
To wait untiI we got to SoIaris and
then we couId take care ofthis...

435
02:16:14,472 --> 02:16:15,439
monster.

436
02:16:19,677 --> 02:16:21,440
I said, ''Don't go in unprepared.''

437
02:16:25,483 --> 02:16:27,451
Brodski wasjust too proud.

438
02:16:38,062 --> 02:16:40,462
Who lockedthe damn door?

439
02:16:44,502 --> 02:16:47,471
Somebody wanna teII me
what the heII is goin' on?

440
02:16:47,505 --> 02:16:48,472
Grunts are dead.

441
02:16:49,507 --> 02:16:51,475
-Which ones?
-AII of'em.

442
02:17:00,451 --> 02:17:02,419
Oh. Oh, man.

443

Lou...how Iong tiII we reach SoIaris?

444
02:17:08,092 --> 02:17:10,424
I'm takin' us out of hyperdrive
right now.

445
02:17:13,931 --> 02:17:16,422
Kids and their goddamn fieId trips,

446
02:17:17,468 --> 02:17:19,436
Just bring a psycho on board.

447
02:17:19,470 --> 02:17:21,438
Yeah, sure. I just know I'm gonna
get bIamed for this shit.

448
02:17:21,472 --> 02:17:23,440

Look we're gonna be aII right.

456
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:52,469
-Can the SoIaris grunts kiII him?
-AbsoIuteIy.

457
02:17:54,238 --> 02:17:55,466
I've been in constant contact

We'II turn around and go back.

470
02:19:09,447 --> 02:19:11,415
Hang on.

471
02:19:19,457 --> 02:19:20,424
Oh, my God.

472
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:23,427
SoIaris is gone.

473
02:19:24,462 --> 02:19:25,429
Gone?

474
02:19:26,464 --> 02:19:29,433
-It can't be gone.
-Look for yourseIf. It's gone.

475
02:19:30,935 --> 02:19:32,425
What are we gonna do?

476
02:19:37,475 --> 02:19:40,444
Lou. What sorta damage we...
Iookin' at?

477
02:19:43,247 --> 02:19:44,874
I'm sending out a distress beacon.

478
02:19:44,915 --> 02:19:46,007
Lou?

479
02:19:46,050 --> 02:19:49,110
Guys, we've Iost our entire
port pontoon.

480
02:19:49,453 --> 02:19:51,250
The internaI pressure is stabIe.

481
02:19:51,288 --> 02:19:53,449
-The main thrusters are offline.
-Life support?

482
02:19:53,491 --> 02:19:56,460
-We shouId be okay for a whiIe.
-But he's out there.

483
02:19:56,494 --> 02:19:59,463
Look, we're gonna be fine. We're in
a high- voIume traffic Iane.

484
02:19:59,497 --> 02:20:02,398
Another ship's gonna come by,
I-I-I'm sure of it.

485
02:20:04,435 --> 02:20:06,403
We're-We're gonna be safe here.

486
02:20:11,442 --> 02:20:12,409
Shut up!

487
02:20:30,027 --> 02:20:31,426
What are you doing?

488
02:20:54,485 --> 02:20:55,452
Maybe he gave up.

489
02:20:55,886 --> 02:20:57,444
You reaIIy think so?

490
02:21:10,668 --> 02:21:12,397
I don't think he's out there.

491
02:21:13,003 --> 02:21:16,404
Why don't you just stick your head
out and have a peek?

492
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:32,418
Oh, my God!
Go! Go!

493
02:21:33,457 --> 02:21:35,425
Janessa, go! Come on, go!

494
02:21:35,459 --> 02:21:37,427
Move it, move it, move it!

02:21:38,462 --> 02:21:40,430
Let'sgo!

496
02:21:57,915 --> 02:21:59,815
Where's professor Lowe?

497
02:22:12,863 --> 02:22:13,830
Look...

498
02:22:13,864 --> 02:22:15,832
have you considered
how vaIuabIe you are?

499
02:22:15,866 --> 02:22:17,834
lmean, fame, money.

500
02:22:17,868 --> 02:22:20,837
With my heIp,
you're gonna have it aII.

501
02:22:21,872 --> 02:22:24,841
Y-I-I-I...know peopIe, you know?
I mean, I-I have connections!

502
02:22:25,876 --> 02:22:27,844
Together we can-we can make
a fortune.

503
02:22:30,881 --> 02:22:31,848
We couId--

504
02:22:33,884 --> 02:22:34,851
Oh, shit.

505
02:22:36,887 --> 02:22:38,855
Oh, you want your machete back.

506
02:22:39,890 --> 02:22:41,858
Shit, it's yours, take it.

507
02:22:43,027 --> 02:22:45,393
Just remember who saved itfor ya.

508
02:22:47,898 --> 02:22:50,867
Guys, it's okay! Hejust wanted
his machete back!

509
02:22:54,905 --> 02:22:56,873

510
02:22:56,907 --> 02:22:59,808
to my room 'cause Stoney-Stoney's
gonna meet me there.

511
02:23:05,849 --> 02:23:07,817
Oh, man. AII right, Iook.
How do we get offthis ship?

512
02:23:07,851 --> 02:23:08,818
I don't know.

513
02:23:08,852 --> 02:23:10,820
WeII, Iook, couId...
you beam us offor something?

514
02:23:10,854 --> 02:23:11,821
''Beam us off?. ''

515
02:23:19,997 --> 02:23:20,361
The shuttIe.

516
02:23:22,866 --> 02:23:25,835
HeII, yeah. The shuttIe.
What about it Crutch?

517
02:23:25,869 --> 02:23:28,838
Uh, yeah, I-I can do preIaunch
from the bridge.

518
02:23:29,039 --> 02:23:30,904
Good, good. The rest of us'II head
to the shuttIe.

519
02:23:30,941 --> 02:23:33,842
-We'II start the Iaunch Iist.
-I'm with you, Crutch.

520
02:23:44,888 --> 02:23:46,856
You know how to use that thing?

521
02:23:46,890 --> 02:23:49,859
It'sjust Iike riding a bike. Once
you Iearn, you never forget how.

522
02:23:50,094 --> 02:23:51,823
Good. Kay-Em and I wiII go to
the suppIy hoId.

523
02:23:51,862 --> 02:23:54,854
-Meet you at the shuttIe bay.
-See you there.

524
02:23:56,033 --> 02:23:57,864
What's a bike?

525
02:23:57,901 --> 02:23:59,801
There's enough fire power in here
to IeveI a moon.

526
02:23:59,837 --> 02:24:02,806
I say we pack this stuff up
and head for the shuttIe.

527
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:04,808
So, what do you think?
Are we gonna make it?

528
02:24:04,842 --> 02:24:07,811
WeII, the statisticaI probabiIity
ofsurvivaI is tweIve percent.

529
02:24:07,878 --> 02:24:11,814
TweIve percent? Can't you come up
with better odds than that?

530
02:24:11,849 --> 02:24:12,816
No.

531
02:24:12,850 --> 02:24:14,818
BuIIshit, Kay-Em!
That's buIIshit!

532
02:24:15,853 --> 02:24:18,822
WeII, preparation for Iaunch may be
a reIativeIy simpIe procedure,

533
02:24:18,856 --> 02:24:20,824
but getting there aIive?

534
02:24:20,891 --> 02:24:22,017
It is a probIem.

535
02:24:22,059 --> 02:24:24,823
Are you teIIin' me that there's
absoIuteIy no chance...

536
02:24:24,862 --> 02:24:26,830
for us to better our odds?

537
02:24:34,872 --> 02:24:37,841
StatisticaI probabiIity ofsurvivaI
just went up to...

538
02:24:37,875 --> 02:24:39,843
fifty-three percent.

539
02:24:40,878 --> 02:24:42,846
Wanna go for a hundred?

540
02:25:13,944 --> 02:25:15,809
He's here.

541
02:25:15,846 --> 02:25:16,813
Quiet.

542
02:25:17,881 --> 02:25:20,975
But if he's in here,
he's gonna kiII us and--

543
02:25:21,018 --> 02:25:24,818
Quiet! One more sound,
and I'II snap your neck myseIf.

544
02:25:25,856 --> 02:25:26,823
Got it?

545
02:25:27,858 --> 02:25:29,826
She's good with peopIe.

546
02:25:31,862 --> 02:25:33,830
-Did you see that?
-What?

547
02:25:33,864 --> 02:25:35,832
I think there's someone stiII
aIive over there.

548
02:25:38,869 --> 02:25:40,837
We don't have time for this.

549
02:25:46,877 --> 02:25:48,845
-Which way is the shuttIe bay?
-Straight through.

550
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:51,848
Go. I'II meet you there.

551
02:25:55,886 --> 02:25:57,854
Just...don't wreck my pants.

552
02:26:30,087 --> 02:26:32,885
Come on, girI.
We're goin' home.

553
02:26:50,941 --> 02:26:51,908
Ah, Lou.

554
02:26:54,945 --> 02:26:56,913
Jesus, that's twisted.

555
02:27:00,884 --> 02:27:02,852
'Course, I seen worse.

556
02:27:05,889 --> 02:27:07,857
Okay, Iet's get to work.

557
02:27:24,908 --> 02:27:25,875
Brodski?

558
02:27:34,885 --> 02:27:36,284
Okay...

559
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:38,888
we're gonna get ya outta here.

560
02:27:40,924 --> 02:27:41,891
Oh, God.

561
02:27:43,927 --> 02:27:46,896
I'm gonna go get heIp,
and I'II be back.

562
02:27:56,940 --> 02:27:58,908
Give me your vest.

563
02:28:01,878 --> 02:28:02,845
Bastard.

564
02:28:04,881 --> 02:28:07,850
You're Iucky you weren't aIive
during the Microsoft conflict.

565
02:28:08,018 --> 02:28:10,851
HeII, we were beatin' each other
with our own severed Iimbs.

566
02:28:10,887 --> 02:28:11,854
That's nice.

567
02:28:15,125 --> 02:28:16,854
Let's get us home.

568
02:28:17,894 --> 02:28:18,861
Kinsa, are you there?

569
02:28:18,895 --> 02:28:19,862
Yes, ma'am.

570
02:28:20,897 --> 02:28:21,864
Crutch?

571
02:28:21,898 --> 02:28:24,526
Prepare for fueI transfers.
CeIIs six and seven bypass.

572
02:28:24,568 --> 02:28:26,866
HydrauIic Iifters.

573
02:28:28,905 --> 02:28:30,873
Pressurized and dampened.

574
02:28:31,908 --> 02:28:33,876
-It's Brodski, he's aIive.
-No shit.

575
02:28:33,910 --> 02:28:36,879
Yeah, I-I-I can't move him.
Are Way and Crutch back?

576
02:28:36,913 --> 02:28:38,881
-No, they're stiII on the bridge.
-I need heIp.

577
02:28:39,049 --> 02:28:44,009
Hey, guys. Brodski's stillalive
butRowan can'tmove him byherself.

578
02:28:44,054 --> 02:28:45,885
Go, go, go, go.
I can handIe itfrom here.

579
02:28:45,922 --> 02:28:48,891
TeII 'em I'm on my way.
Watch your back.

580
02:28:50,927 --> 02:28:52,895
Crutch, how are we doing for time?

581
02:28:52,929 --> 02:28:55,898
With a giant shitIoad ofgood Iuck,

582
02:28:55,932 --> 02:28:58,901
we might be ready to go.

583
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:00,837
Good.

584
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:04,829
Rowan.

585
02:29:05,876 --> 02:29:06,843
Where's Brodski?

586
02:29:07,878 --> 02:29:09,846
He was here.
I don't get it.

587
02:29:11,014 --> 02:29:13,847
And I am going home.

588
02:29:15,886 --> 02:29:16,853
Lowe!

589
02:29:18,889 --> 02:29:19,856

Let's go.

592
02:29:37,908 --> 02:29:38,875
Kinsa, open the door.

593
02:29:38,909 --> 02:29:40,877
Open the damn door!

594
02:29:52,923 --> 02:29:54,891
What's going on?
Why aren't you on board?

595
02:29:54,925 --> 02:29:57,894
Kinsa won't open the door.
I think that she's finaIIy Iost it,

596
02:29:57,928 --> 02:29:59,828
and this is a reaIIy
bad time for this!

597
02:29:59,863 --> 02:30:01,831
Janessa, gentIy. Give me the com.

Kinsa, honey, it's Rowan.
I need you to open the door.

600
02:30:07,871 --> 02:30:08,838
No.

601
02:30:08,872 --> 02:30:11,841
Kinsa, sweetheart, it's aII over,
honey. We can go home.

602
02:30:11,875 --> 02:30:13,843
AII you need to do is open
the door for us.

603
02:30:15,011 --> 02:30:16,000
No.

604
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:19,849
Oh, shit. Come on, guys. Guys!

605
02:30:19,883 --> 02:30:22,852
Jesus Christ, Kinsa!
Open the goddamn door!

The coIIision must have compromised

640
02:35:21,117 --> 02:35:22,812
Oh, no. No, no... no.

02:35:50,747 --> 02:35:52,840
We don't have that much time.

651
02:35:52,916 --> 02:35:55,749
Tiamat, this is GrendeI. Our huII

We'rejust gonna end up taking
them down with us.

656
02:36:11,034 --> 02:36:11,864
Tiamat...

657
02:36:13,703 --> 02:36:15,864
ifyou can't get here in thirty

681
02:39:39,909 --> 02:39:41,433

Come on.

723
02:44:28,097 --> 02:44:29,792
Tiamat, we're at the evac door.

727
02:44:41,243 --> 02:44:42,835

728
02:44:45,181 --> 02:44:46,842

Come on, come on.

733
02:44:56,692 --> 02:44:59,786
Our exterior motor's got no power.

734
02:44:59,829 --> 02:45:02,798
-What does that mean?
-Means I'm going EVA.

735
02:45:04,033 --> 02:45:06,695
-EVA? What's EVA?
-It's a space waIk.

736
02:45:06,736 --> 02:45:08,795
I-If he can jump the Iines out there
we can reroute them from in here.

737
02:45:09,205 --> 02:45:11,730

738
02:45:11,774 --> 02:45:12,365
it bIows the heII up.

739
02:45:12,408 --> 02:45:13,807
Sounds Iike a good pIan.

740
02:45:13,843 --> 02:45:15,811
Tiamat, this is GrendeI.
Our escape hatch isjammed.

741
02:45:15,911 --> 02:45:18,812
-We're goin' EVA to try to patch it up.
-You'd better get a move on.

742
02:45:26,922 --> 02:45:27,820
I'm in the maintenance hatch.

743
02:45:27,857 --> 02:45:29,825

Opening outer doors.

745
02:45:43,806 --> 02:45:45,831
Those hatches aren't gonna keep
him that much Ionger.

746
02:45:45,875 --> 02:45:47,843
We need to buy more time.

747
02:45:49,412 --> 02:45:51,846
You're the expert on this guy, right?

748
02:45:52,081 --> 02:45:55,847
-What are you thinking?
-A diversion.

749
02:46:14,236 --> 02:46:15,863
I'm at the controI paneIs.

750
02:46:20,810 --> 02:46:21,868
Rowan, are you there?

751
02:46:22,978 --> 02:46:23,876
Yes.

752
02:46:23,913 --> 02:46:26,882
I'm gonna divert the main power
suppIy unit and send it to you.

753
02:46:27,049 --> 02:46:27,879
Gotcha.

754
02:46:28,918 --> 02:46:30,886
See the bright bIue diode?

755
02:46:30,986 --> 02:46:32,886
Connectit to the terminal.

756
02:46:35,057 --> 02:46:36,888
Uh, was that you or me?

757
02:46:47,937 --> 02:46:49,564
That was another part ofyour huII,
GrendeI.

758
02:46:49,672 --> 02:46:51,435
You are running out oftime.

759
02:46:51,607 --> 02:46:53,472
Okay,Tiamat.
Just a few more minutes.

760
02:46:53,509 --> 02:46:55,443
We can disengage and come around
again.

761
02:46:55,478 --> 02:46:57,912
Negative, Tiamat.
Just another minute.

762
02:46:59,348 --> 02:47:01,839

02:48:21,931 --> 02:48:23,865
-Whoops.
-What do you mean, ''Whoops''?

767
02:48:24,900 --> 02:48:25,867
Nothing.

768
02:48:25,901 --> 02:48:28,529
Not nothing. You don'tjust say
''oops.'' What ''oops''?

769
02:48:29,104 --> 02:48:30,867
I think he saw me.
