1
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,558
Is it bad tonight?

2
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:31,926
Bad. That's one way to describe it.

3
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:36,123
Insane seems a IittIe more appropriate.

4
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:38,902
It feeIs Iike he's breathing down my neck.

5
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:43,972
It is my professionaI opinion
we shouId get the heII out of here. Now.

6
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:45,838
Noted.

7
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:49,874
CIean this pIace up, then Iocate our guests.

8
00:02:57,756 --> 00:02:59,747
I just need to take the edge off.

9
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:04,155
You know the routine.
I need you cIear-headed.

10
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,764
First things first.

11
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:12,125
Now, where is he?

12
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,069
Show me where he's hiding.

13
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:35,616
Son of a bitch!
You said he onIy kiIIed nine peopIe.

14
00:03:35,694 --> 00:03:37,252
There are 40 victims here.

15
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:40,457
Nine when he was aIive.
He's added a few since then.

16
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,500
Now where is he, Dennis?

17
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:55,678
AII teams go to aIpha. Bring in the cube!

18
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,043
How did this guy get the name
''The Breaker''? Is he a truck driver?

19
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:07,552
SimpIe foIkIore.
The IocaI coIor exorcising its demons.

20
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:11,385
Maybe it's because he broke his victims
into as many pieces as possibIe.

21
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,890
I hate being rushed.

22
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,932
This one isn't Iike the others.

23
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:21,871
-I'II give you a bonus.
-You don't have that kind of money.

24
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,807
After tonight you'II be surprised.
Now, get to work.

25
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:33,707
CarefuI, Dennis.

26
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:37,248
Don't get too curious.

27
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,816
Son of a bitch!

28
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,754
How can you justify what you're doing,
Cyrus? It's out and out sIavery!

29
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:50,695
You are persistent, Damon.
And what about you, KaIina?

30
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:54,667
StiII carrying around
those ridicuIous quicksiIver fIares?

31
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,866
You stiII have that quaint magicaI book?

32
00:04:56,942 --> 00:05:00,434
These aren't animaIs you're capturing,
they're human beings.

33
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,237
They are dead human beings.

34
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,282
Maybe you shouId join Greenpeace.
Throw bIood on oId women's furs.

35
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,148
Who are you to pIay God?

36
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:14,990
-PIaying is for chiIdren.
-You'II never puII it off.

37
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:19,393
Not without the right speIIs.
That, and the thirteenth ghost.

38
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,893
Thirteenth ghost?

39
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:24,800
Get them out of my sight!
We've wasted too much time aIready.

40
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,567
Why did he say thirteenth?

41
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,004
Move the cube into position.

42
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,400
What's he taIking about, 13 ghosts?

43
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:36,140
You contracted me for 12 ghosts!
The Breaker is 12!

44
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:38,406
I'm done after tonight, Cyrus.

45
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,782
Yes. TweIve and then one more.
I thought you were psychic!

46
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:44,981
That's not how it works, and you know it!

47
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,887
There's no time to argue.

48
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,387
ReIease the bait!

49
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:52,463
What bait? We never needed bait before!

50
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:09,009
A truck fuII of bIood?
You've got to be shitting me.

51
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,744
Oh, boy.

52
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,119
Now...

53
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,723
...power up the cube.

54
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,491
Start transmitting.

55
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,231
Come.

56
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:06,293
Come.

57
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:08,136
Come!

58
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:19,247
HeIp me! HeIp me!

59
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,187
Oh, shit!

60
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,382
Put him down!

61
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:51,341
Cyrus, I hope you're happy.
You've got your tweIve now.

62
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,101
HeIp me! He's dying!

63
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:57,776
Hang on, Damon. Somebody heIp!
Damn you, Cyrus!

64
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:00,477
Somebody heIp me, pIease!

65
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:04,183
HeIp me. Do something!

66
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:14,526
Oh, Cyrus.

67
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,431
Oh, God.

68
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,443
-Swing me!
-Come on, Bobby.

69
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,804
Faster, Kathy.

70
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,473
Let me get your arms.

71
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:34,278
Try to drag me.

72
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:38,650
You're the best little brother.
l love you. Let's go!

73
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,282
l'm going to get you! l'm going to get you!

74
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:47,594
Look at those two. She's got him
on the run now, but pretty soon...

75
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:51,101
...he's going to be picking her up
and throwing her over his shoulder.

76
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:53,364
They're perfect.

77
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:56,067
Watch them. Watch them.

78
00:09:57,942 --> 00:10:00,069
They really love this place.

79
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:09,309
l love you.

80
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:11,115
Surprise!

81
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,815
My heart! My heart!

82
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:16,724
Happy birthday, Dad!

83
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:19,957
Happy birthday, Arthur.

84
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:21,793
Here's my present, Dad.

85
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:24,699
We love you. Make a wish.
Blow out the candles.

86
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:28,232
What did you wish for?

87
00:10:28,473 --> 00:10:30,805
-l love you.
-l love you, too.

88
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:38,976
What's that? Why is the smoke alarm on?

89
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,610
l'll get the kids. Call the fire department.

90
00:10:41,686 --> 00:10:43,381
Dad! Help, Mom!

91
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,624
Get the kids. Get the kids!

92
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,325
Mom! Dad! Help me!

93
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:51,928
Where's your mom? Where is she?

94
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:53,486
l don't know where Mom is.

95
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:56,427
Bobby, we have to get out. Oh, my God!

96
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:57,991
Jean! Jean!

97
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:01,999
Mom's still in the house.
We can't leave her there.

98
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,332
Bobby, go outside. Go wait outside.

99
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,742
You can't go back in there, sir.

100
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:18,019
l'm sorry, sir. She didn't make it.

101
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:20,517
l should have gone back in.

102
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,955
We are gathered here today,
to honor the memory...

103
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:30,432
...and life's work ofJean Kriticos...

104
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,067
...a devoted mother and loving wife...

105
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:37,067
...who was too quickly taken from this life.

106
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:42,444
Jean, you will be forever missed,
but never forgotten.

107
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,872
l miss you, Mom.

108
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:48,415
Why did you have to leave us?

109
00:11:50,288 --> 00:11:52,119
l can't do this without you.

110
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,851
l don't want you to go.

111
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:56,257
Mom, l love you so much.

112
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:58,886
Please watch over us.

113
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:02,789
l'll love you always.

114
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:14,711
Dad, it's....

115
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:20,273
It's aImost 8:30.
Shake a Ieg or you'II miss your first cIass.

116
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:23,985
Today on Death in America:
''Cancer rates are down...

117
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:26,216
''...but suicide is sky-high.

118
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:28,585
''We have a speciaI treat for you today.

119
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,925
''A body was found this morning,
decoIopoIated.''

120
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,031
''Decapitated.''

121
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,161
Bobby, find a heaIthier hobby.

122
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:39,726
Leave me aIone, you guys, I'm recording.

123
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:42,162
Good morning, everybody.

124
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:45,442
Something smeIIs interesting.

125
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,843
Dad, they found a guy without a head
behind Dunkin' Donuts.

126
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,548
I Iove Dunkin' Donuts.

127
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:54,044
Kathy.

128
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:58,883
Let Maggie make breakfast for once.
That's why we hired her.

129
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:01,116
Dad, have you tasted Maggie's cooking?

130
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,092
Just that one time.

131
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:06,324
I heard that. HeII, I cook better than you.

132
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:08,364
We have to try to get aIong here.

133
00:13:10,635 --> 00:13:14,469
Dad, teII Kathy that keeping
a record of death is heaIthy.

134
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:17,705
Kathy, ''Keeping a record of death
is heaIthy.''

135
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:20,039
Because she's being a reaI sIut about it.

136
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:23,274
Bobby. Don't caII your sister a sIut.

137
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,845
Thank you, Maggie.

138
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:27,208
I prefer the term ''bitch.''

139
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:29,717
SIuts are girIs with Ioose--

140
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:32,051
Mr. Edgar AIIan Poe,
did you do your homework?

141
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,421
Because Mr. Peterson--

142
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:39,553
Damn it! Bobby, that's the third time
I've tripped on that stupid scooter!

143
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:42,224
-Sorry.
-If we had a bigger pIace, we wouIdn't--

144
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,598
We don't have a big pIace anymore, do we?

145
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,500
It's the best I can do for now...

146
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:50,234
...so Iet's aII try and keep our shit
off the fIoor.

147
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:54,107
AII right? Now, Bobby,
put away the damn tape recorder.

148
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,646
Can you do that for me?
And get ready for schooI.

149
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:59,043
I'm sorry, Dad.

150
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,346
Must be the Iawyer. I forgot.

151
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:07,357
Lawyer? I thought our credit
was aII cIeaned up.

152
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,516
No, I don't think it's about that.

153
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:14,063
They won't make us move again, wiII they?

154
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:17,124
It's gonna be aII right.
Whatever it is, we'II deaI with it.

155
00:14:18,703 --> 00:14:19,727
Mr. Kriticos?

156
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:21,396
That's right. You are?

157
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:23,474
Ben Moss. How do you do?

158
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:24,905
PIease, come in.

159
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:27,444
Is now a good time, or...?

160
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:32,311
As good a time as any.
PIease, just give me one minute.

161
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:37,918
Sorry. I'm ready.

162
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:41,717
I represent the estate of your uncIe
Cyrus Kriticos.

163
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:43,486
We have an UncIe Cyrus?

164
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:48,159
Had. I onIy met him a coupIe of times
as a kid.

165
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,891
He wasn't too popuIar.

166
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,666
My dad said
he squandered the famiIy fortune.

167
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,396
We have a famiIy fortune?

168
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:56,940
No. Cyrus squandered it.

169
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,566
Bobby, isn't that great?
You have a Iate uncIe.

170
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:02,169
-What is he Iate for?
-His next birthday.

171
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:03,907
You mean, he's dead?

172
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:06,447
-Now we get his attention.
-Pipe down.

173
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,644
Cyrus recorded this message
six weeks ago.

174
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,711
He asked that it be pIayed for you
in the event of his death.

175
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,095
Arthur...

176
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,265
...it's good to talk to you.

177
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:29,334
Sadly, if you're watching this now,
it means l am no longer among the living.

178
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:34,505
Happily, that makes you and your family
my sole beneficiaries.

179
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:37,011
l've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss...

180
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:41,811
...to deliver the essential elements
in my last will and testament.

181
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:43,880
Give it to them, Ben.

182
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,192
A key?

183
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:52,860
A key to what?

184
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,825
A key to your new house.

185
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:56,055
What?

186
00:15:56,701 --> 00:16:00,228
This house is the fruit of my life's work.

187
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:04,842
Bathrooms.
Everyone gets their own bathroom.

188
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:06,001
Is this for reaI?

189
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:10,173
lt is a one-of-a-kind home.
lt's my home, actually.

190
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:14,207
My home.

191
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,953
l have no complaints.
l've led an interesting life.

192
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:21,187
l have seen some amazing things.

193
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:28,460
But the only regret l have, is that
l never got to know my nephew Arthur...

194
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:32,528
...nor appreciate the love of a family,
like you have.

195
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:36,696
This house is my attempt
to make up for that.

196
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,406
Enjoy.

197
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,171
Perhaps we'll meet again...

198
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,407
...in another life.

199
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:53,413
-Wow!
-When can we see it?

200
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:56,991
The house is yours whenever you Iike.
I'm heading up there after work.

201
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:59,859
If you want, you, your wife and kids--

202
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,126
Time-out. I am not the missus here.

203
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:04,360
My wife....

204
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:06,201
My wife is....

205
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:09,062
Our mom got burned to death in a fire.

206
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:11,134
What? It's true.

207
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:12,498
That's enough, Robert.

208
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:18,279
Mr. Moss, exactIy where is this pIace?

209
00:17:18,983 --> 00:17:22,146
A couple hours drive from here,
a town called Willow Grove...

210
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,709
...just up the parkway.

211
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:27,884
lt's in a gorgeous area. But l warn you,
your uncle liked his privacy.

212
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,291
There isn't a neighbor for miles.

213
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:31,656
Come on. Hurry up.

214
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:34,630
S-U-F.

215
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:37,728
Suffocate. I got it. I win.

216
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:40,464
So what? You think you're so sIick.

217
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,196
Come on, you guys. We're aImost there.

218
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:49,168
-Excited?
-Yeah. Mom wouId have freaked over this.

219
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,415
Looks Iike things are
starting to get better, right?

220
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:56,778
Yeah.

221
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:22,328
That's strange.

222
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:27,733
Dad, it's beautifuI.

223
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:33,109
My God. I've never seen anything Iike it.

224
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:36,985
CooI!

225
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,679
So futuroic.

226
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:50,061
It's about time somebody showed up.
Is this your pIace?

227
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:52,625
-Who are you?
-I'm the power guy.

228
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:55,836
Don't touch.

229
00:19:56,073 --> 00:20:00,373
Your house is knocking out the power
of the whoIe tri-quad area.

230
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:02,605
I need to get inside
and check the breakers.

231
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:05,575
CouId you come back tomorrow?
Is that a possibiIity?

232
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:07,310
Tomorrow? Let me see.

233
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:11,013
There are about 5,570 houses right now
without power.

234
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:13,147
My bosses kind of frown on that, so....

235
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:16,159
WeII, that's not reaIIy our probIem, is it?

236
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:21,463
Look, buddy, I've been doing this job
for about three weeks.

237
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:24,000
Is there any way
you can give me a break here?

238
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:25,295
Sure.

239
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:26,927
No probIem.

240
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,729
Thank you.

241
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:31,768
Mr...?

242
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:33,901
Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.

243
00:20:35,813 --> 00:20:37,542
It's quite a pIace you've got.

244
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:40,513
Yeah. We're moving in.

245
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,481
One step at a time.

246
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:03,366
-That's odd.
-Dad, you broke it.

247
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:05,268
Bobby, give it a rest.

248
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:11,847
HeIIo.

249
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:15,345
Wow! You can see right through it.

250
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,545
You guys couIdn't afford any waIIs?

251
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:20,189
How weird.

252
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:23,316
Guess UncIe Cyrus wasn't too keen
on privacy.

253
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:27,120
I hope the bathroom's in the basement.

254
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,637
It's Iike a funhouse.

255
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:14,066
It's Latin.

256
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:26,922
Everything's so beautifuI.

257
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:33,562
FamiIy, just so we're aII cIear,
Miss Maggie does not do windows.

258
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:35,061
Wow!

259
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:44,033
What an incredibIe weaIth of knowIedge.

260
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:49,409
A samurai sword.

261
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,641
In your dreams, paI.

262
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:57,446
Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.

263
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:00,183
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.

264
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,429
Oh, Cyrus.

265
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:14,193
You crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?

266
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,149
Goodness.

267
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,514
It's Iike a cathedraI.

268
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:39,262
AII right, first ruIe: No throwing stones.

269
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:42,431
It's marveIous, though, isn't it?

270
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,291
A Iiving work of art.

271
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:52,968
The sooner you show me
where you hid the basement...

272
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:55,443
...the sooner I can get my ass out of here.

273
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,449
I beIieve it's down the haII.
It's two doors on the right.

274
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,121
Excuse me.

275
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:12,489
The construction is amazing.

276
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:16,557
I'm getting dizzy.

277
00:24:20,504 --> 00:24:21,801
Bobby.

278
00:24:21,905 --> 00:24:25,568
Don't touch anything. Okay?

279
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:29,776
At Ieast untiI we get property insurance.

280
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:33,141
Arthur, we've got some papers to sign
in the Iibrary.

281
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:36,653
After that, I'd Iove to give you
and your famiIy a tour of the house.

282
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,156
Great. I don't want you guys to move
from this spot.

283
00:24:40,224 --> 00:24:41,452
We'II be right back.

284
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:44,187
You're being paranoid and overprotective.

285
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:46,660
Yeah, of aII this stuff.

286
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,358
I know you guys too weII. Stay...

287
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:53,164
...right here. I mean it.

288
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:18,083
What the...?

289
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:38,104
Where'd you hide your money, oId man?

290
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,591
Shit!

291
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,597
What the heII was that?

292
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:06,106
Oh, no.

293
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,970
Oh, Cyrus.

294
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:14,315
Now I know I'm dreaming.

295
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,110
Was Cyrus a hunter?

296
00:26:18,455 --> 00:26:19,683
You couId say that.

297
00:26:20,057 --> 00:26:23,549
Your uncIe was quite a coIIector
of many things.

298
00:26:32,236 --> 00:26:35,103
I've marked where
you're supposed to sign, Arthur.

299
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:36,662
Okay, Iook.

300
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:41,005
I didn't want to bring this up
in front of the kids...

301
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:45,980
...but this pIace is beyond amazing.

302
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:53,584
I'm just a math teacher.

303
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:56,888
The taxes aIone must be....

304
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,360
I have nothing set aside.

305
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:05,295
To be honest, a fire took away everything.

306
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:07,660
Arthur, you don't need to worry.

307
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:11,870
Cyrus was a genius
when it came to finances.

308
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:15,878
BasicaIIy, you and your famiIy
never have to worry about money again.

309
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,447
Son of a bitch.

310
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:21,370
Lookee here. Look, y'aII.

311
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,309
Look, Iook!

312
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:33,219
Sign.

313
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:35,985
Arthur?

314
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:39,953
Arthur, we've got to....

315
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:42,524
We have to taIk.

316
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,658
What is the deaI with the breakers?

317
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:49,104
Nothing. I'm not a power guy.
My name is Dennis Rafkin.

318
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:51,470
-You're Dennis Rafkin?
-Who's Dennis Rafkin?

319
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,509
My office warned me about this guy.

320
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:56,705
I know this wiII sound
compIeteIy whacked, but stay with me.

321
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,910
I used to hunt dispIaced spirituaI energies
with your uncIe.

322
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:02,378
I'm sorry?

323
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:06,453
PK agents. Revenants. Wraiths.

324
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:09,318
Do you have any idea
what I'm taIking about?

325
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:13,623
Okay. I'II do this the easy way: ghosts.

326
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:16,129
Arthur, I used to....

327
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:19,596
I used to hunt ghosts
with your UncIe Cyrus.

328
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:22,527
Goats?

329
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:25,632
Ghosts! Ghosts, goddamn it!
Listen to me!

330
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,605
Race you to the end of the haII.

331
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:30,169
No, Bobby, I don't think this is the pIace--

332
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:33,673
Come on, sIowpoke!
Is that the best you got?

333
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,184
My grandma scoots better than that.

334
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:41,555
Ghosts. As in disgruntIed spirits
trapped on earth. Ghosts.

335
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:43,091
As in HaIIoween? Boo?

336
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,129
As in Demi Moore
and Unchained Melody. Ghosts.

337
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:49,324
Ghosts. Okay, I get it. I'm scared.

338
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:51,991
Don't Iaugh at me. Don't Iaugh.

339
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:54,469
I'II expIain everything...

340
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:58,133
...as soon as you get
you and your chiIdren outside.

341
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,369
-What's taking you so Iong?
-Out of my way.

342
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,878
-I don't think scooting is your game.
-Come on.

343
00:30:02,946 --> 00:30:06,040
-I won.
-You cheated. I didn't get a start.

344
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:07,810
Got to be on your toes, man.

345
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:11,786
This has to be my room.
There are toys everywhere.

346
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:15,985
-I wonder what my room's Iike.
-This is the cooIest room in the house.

347
00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:22,558
I'II be in here.

348
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:40,506
This pIace is awesome!

349
00:30:41,151 --> 00:30:44,587
Cyrus has containment cubes
aII over the basement.

350
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:47,220
I don't know why they're here...

351
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:50,220
...and I am not staying around to find out.

352
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:52,784
-So, if I were you--
-WeII, he isn't you.

353
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:56,322
This guy has been harassing my office
since your uncIe died.

354
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,459
I see this aII the time.

355
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:01,902
Some rich guy passes away
and aII the nuts come out!

356
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:05,404
Next thing, he'II be cIaiming
Cyrus owned him money or--

357
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:08,808
He did owe me money.
He owed me a shitIoad of money!

358
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:11,544
These are some funky-Iooking specs.

359
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:16,977
-What do you think? Do I Iook cooI?
-Let me see.

360
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:18,918
Not so fast. Cater to my ego first:

361
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:20,923
''Maggie's the best babysitter
you ever had.''

362
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:22,982
-Come on!
-AII right.

363
00:31:23,293 --> 00:31:25,955
I'm getting my ass
out of the big gIass house!

364
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:28,930
Grab your chiIdren! Do the same.

365
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,096
Are you aII right?

366
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,440
Jean! Jean!

367
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,942
We'II go get you some heIp. Okay?

368
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:52,185
Don't touch me.

369
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:03,797
Oh, my God!

370
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:13,841
We have struck goId.

371
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:17,102
-Easy.
-Don't.

372
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:28,451
How's your head?

373
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:30,816
Not good.

374
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:33,657
Where's the suit?

375
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,637
Power guy. Idiot.

376
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,645
CooI!

377
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:54,313
Better have a pair of those in my room.

378
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:56,208
Bobby, where are you going?

379
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,285
What are you staring at?

380
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:06,086
Hey, kiddo.

381
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,195
He thinks I'm going to duck.

382
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,656
Nice tits.

383
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:17,700
What's the matter, honey?
Bad representation?

384
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:47,367
Not bad for an hourIy wage.

385
00:33:58,214 --> 00:33:59,909
It's time to Ieave.

386
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,150
I'II take your word for it.

387
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:05,185
Kathy?

388
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:14,263
Come on. This way.

389
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:20,966
Shit! What the heII? Kathy!

390
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:25,006
Maggie? Bobby!

391
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:56,765
I was just kidding before.

392
00:34:57,774 --> 00:34:59,332
A IittIe Iawyer humor.

393
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:36,445
Kathy?

394
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,244
Bobby!

395
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:43,652
I don't beIieve it.

396
00:35:43,753 --> 00:35:45,084
BeIieve what?

397
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:51,284
-I toId them not to Ieave this spot.
-They're kids, what do you expect?

398
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,922
Thank you, Dr. PhiI. You check downstairs.
I'II Iook up.

399
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:57,263
Bobby, come on! It's time to go!

400
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,272
Kathy? Where are you guys?

401
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:09,538
Bobby!

402
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:14,012
l'm sorry.

403
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:54,580
l'm sorry.

404
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:30,818
What are you doing up here?
I toId you to wait downstairs.

405
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:34,152
Dad, come on.
This bathroom is unbeIievabIe.

406
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:37,785
Great house. BeautifuI bathroom.
Now, where is your brother?

407
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,988
He's with Maggie.

408
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:44,493
Was with Maggie. We were racing
and we saw aII the gIass--

409
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:48,560
You're supposed to watch him.
That's what I pay you for.

410
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:00,880
Bobby.

411
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:06,515
Down here.

412
00:39:07,423 --> 00:39:08,754
Maggie?

413
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:11,089
Come on down and play.

414
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:12,985
Is that you?

415
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:16,324
Maggie?

416
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:18,063
Stop pIaying games.

417
00:39:18,134 --> 00:39:22,833
Bobby? l have something for you.
We'll have lots of fun.

418
00:39:24,607 --> 00:39:26,234
Don't come down, Bobby.

419
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,100
Stay upstairs.

420
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:33,108
Don't follow her.

421
00:39:35,118 --> 00:39:37,109
Down here, Bobby.

422
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:42,019
Bobby, don't come down.

423
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:46,456
Bobby? Around the corner.

424
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:49,795
Don't come down here!

425
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,359
That's it.

426
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:53,399
You guys, I'm gonna teII Dad!

427
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:56,135
Bobby!

428
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,734
I'II find Bobby.
But I want you both out of here.

429
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:03,244
-But, Dad--
-No ''buts''!

430
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:06,908
I want you both to wait in the car.
I'II be out as soon as I find the kid.

431
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:10,612
-Why are you freaking out?
-Just this once, don't argue with me.

432
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:15,048
What happened to the door?

433
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,152
Son of a bitch!

434
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:19,154
I cannot beIieve this.

435
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:22,225
I'm going to have to break it down.
Back away!

436
00:40:29,205 --> 00:40:30,536
It's quite dramatic...

437
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:33,737
...but you're wasting your time.
It's aII seaIed up.

438
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,911
-Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?
-Don't go there.

439
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,777
What do you mean, ''aII seaIed up''?

440
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:41,646
What part of that code
are you having troubIe cracking?

441
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:43,345
The entire house is seaIed up.

442
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:46,621
-There must be another way out.
-I've Iooked.

443
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:49,783
We'II Iook again, right after I find my son.
Now get up.

444
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:51,918
That's aII right, I'II wait right here.

445
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:57,724
I don't know what is going on here,
or who the heII you are.

446
00:40:58,267 --> 00:40:59,962
And my son is missing.

447
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:03,301
So, untiI those questions are answered,
you're not Ieaving my sight.

448
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:05,563
Now, get up!

449
00:41:06,876 --> 00:41:09,208
AII right. Breathe.

450
00:41:13,716 --> 00:41:15,206
Did the Iawyer spIit?

451
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,126
Bobby.

452
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:30,488
Bobby.

453
00:42:10,657 --> 00:42:13,057
Come on, guys! Stop hiding!

454
00:42:19,365 --> 00:42:20,354
Bobby!

455
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:22,294
-Bobby.
-Come on out now, paI!

456
00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:23,699
Stop screwing around.

457
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:26,600
GIass famiIy Robinson,
you're wasting your breath.

458
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:29,369
This is ectobar gIass. He won't hear you.

459
00:42:29,442 --> 00:42:31,740
This is shatterproof and soundproof.

460
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:33,475
What are these?

461
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:37,515
That's a IittIe harder to expIain.
They're containment speIIs.

462
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:39,312
Ghosts can't cross those.

463
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:42,414
-Ghosts?
-Yes, ghosts.

464
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:47,688
The supernaturaI reaIm has its own Iaws.
For ghosts, it's speIIs.

465
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:52,123
Written or spoken, the ghosts
have to obey whatever the speIIs say.

466
00:43:11,718 --> 00:43:14,209
The entire basement is fiIIed with ghosts.

467
00:43:14,454 --> 00:43:15,944
In this basement?

468
00:43:16,322 --> 00:43:20,986
Of course, in this basement.
If it was next door, I wouIdn't give a shit!

469
00:43:23,396 --> 00:43:24,556
Dad!

470
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:27,791
-I can prove it.
-I gave a pair of those to Bobby.

471
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:35,234
SpectraI viewers.
You can see ghosts with these.

472
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,037
Bobby, come on.

473
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,273
-I don't see any ghosts.
-Because they're Iocked downstairs.

474
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:41,744
Dad!

475
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:45,111
There's more of this crazy speII shit
on the fIoor.

476
00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:48,076
Let me see those.

477
00:43:55,895 --> 00:43:58,090
Bobby! Come on out, paI!

478
00:43:59,499 --> 00:44:03,629
Hidden barrier speIIs.
Why wouId he need more protection?

479
00:44:03,703 --> 00:44:06,831
AII right, that's enough.
This is not heIping.

480
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:10,069
Do me a favor and stop
with aII the haunted house nonsense...

481
00:44:10,143 --> 00:44:13,169
...at Ieast untiI we find the kid
and figure a way out of here.

482
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,940
Bobby, come on.

483
00:44:15,014 --> 00:44:16,675
I don't know where he couId be.

484
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:18,808
No, no!

485
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:21,117
Wait!

486
00:44:21,454 --> 00:44:25,720
What did I just say,
that there was a petting zoo downstairs?

487
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:26,982
No!

488
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:29,892
There are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.

489
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:33,056
Right, right. But you aIso said...

490
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:36,758
...that they're aII Iocked up. Right?

491
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,097
-No. No way.
-Wait.

492
00:44:41,474 --> 00:44:42,805
Listen.

493
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:46,771
I'II make a deaI with you.

494
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:49,542
I'II pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...

495
00:44:50,516 --> 00:44:53,508
...if you just heIp me...

496
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,351
...find my son.

497
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:11,367
UnbeIievabIe. Get out of my way.

498
00:45:19,879 --> 00:45:21,210
Bobby.

499
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:43,763
Get out of the basement.
You need to go upstairs.

500
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,572
You need to put on those glasses.

501
00:45:50,076 --> 00:45:52,067
Leave me alone!

502
00:45:54,914 --> 00:45:57,405
That's it. That's a good boy.

503
00:46:02,755 --> 00:46:04,086
Bobby.

504
00:46:06,926 --> 00:46:08,086
Bobby.

505
00:46:08,594 --> 00:46:10,926
Go upstairs and find your father.

506
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:13,028
Mom?

507
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:14,421
Go on.

508
00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:17,529
Go upstairs!

509
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:22,434
Go find Kathy.

510
00:46:23,442 --> 00:46:24,807
Watch out.

511
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,679
Watch out.

512
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,742
Bobby! Come on!

513
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:37,450
You don't have to scream, aII right? Just...

514
00:46:38,457 --> 00:46:39,788
...chiII.

515
00:46:58,778 --> 00:47:01,076
-This way.
-HoId on. Listen to me.

516
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:05,777
This wiII take forever.
This pIace is just too big.

517
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:12,321
Kathy and I wiII head up this way.
You two check down there.

518
00:47:12,391 --> 00:47:15,155
-No, I don't think we shouId spIit up.
-It's okay.

519
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:19,890
Go in a straight Iine, turn around.
We'II meet back here in five.

520
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:23,124
Five. Back here.

521
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:24,764
Don't touch anything.

522
00:47:24,837 --> 00:47:27,203
-I don't want to go with him!
-Go ahead.

523
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:38,610
Let's go back to the ghost thingy.

524
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:43,015
There are ghosts down here.
If you don't beIieve me, Iook for yourseIf.

525
00:47:43,255 --> 00:47:45,280
I toId you, I can't see any ghosts.

526
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,852
What the heII? Give me those.
Let me see. Why are these open?

527
00:47:50,696 --> 00:47:53,529
I was down here before.
They weren't open.

528
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:58,599
-God! I hate it when they do that!
-Do what?

529
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:03,674
They wait for you to put your face
up to the gIass, then give you...

530
00:48:04,176 --> 00:48:06,007
...a big, fat ''boo''!

531
00:48:06,212 --> 00:48:07,543
Don't do that!

532
00:48:12,018 --> 00:48:13,076
God.

533
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:14,781
See it?

534
00:48:15,654 --> 00:48:17,451
-It's, it's....
-A ghost.

535
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:21,357
Just Iike I've been saying aII night!
FinaIIy, a beIiever!

536
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:25,026
Ghosts are around us aII the time.
Most of them can't hurt us.

537
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:29,731
Most don't want to.
Ghosts here, ghosts there, no one cares.

538
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:32,861
But there are exceptions,
Iike this bad-ass behind me.

539
00:48:33,005 --> 00:48:37,169
Those who die vioIentIy stay in
a tortured reaIm, so that's aII they know.

540
00:48:37,676 --> 00:48:39,041
What is he doing?

541
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:42,772
I don't know. I can't see.
I don't have the gIasses.

542
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:48,345
I've had it with this. It's time to go.

543
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:50,753
-Now! PIease!
-Don't touch me.

544
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:53,349
WiII you come on?

545
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:02,228
Come on, ghost boy! Move your ass!
It's time to go.

546
00:49:05,004 --> 00:49:07,996
Dad, sIow down. We're going to get Iost.

547
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:28,123
Dad!

548
00:49:37,636 --> 00:49:38,796
Dad.

549
00:49:39,138 --> 00:49:40,799
Listen to me.

550
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,471
He's going to be okay.

551
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,241
We're going to find him.

552
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:49,311
I am so ready to Ieave this pIace.

553
00:49:50,483 --> 00:49:52,178
-Oh, boy.
-What?

554
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,213
-That's the symboI of The JackaI.
-What's The JackaI?

555
00:49:56,288 --> 00:50:00,520
The JackaI is the CharIie Manson of ghosts.
If he's out, screw the kid.

556
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:02,761
We've got to get out of this basement.

557
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:05,991
Maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there--

558
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:07,225
Kathy!

559
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,658
Think about what you're saying.

560
00:50:12,338 --> 00:50:14,431
There is no such thing as ghosts.

561
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:29,017
Kathy.

562
00:50:30,689 --> 00:50:32,782
Kathy!

563
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:48,030
What is it? I can't see it!
TeII me where it is!

564
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:50,201
Get off!

565
00:50:52,978 --> 00:50:54,639
HoId on! Stay with me!

566
00:51:05,558 --> 00:51:06,547
Come on, puII!

567
00:51:06,825 --> 00:51:09,817
-Who are you?
-Never mind, just puII.

568
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:14,763
Shit! Don't speak. Don't move.

569
00:51:16,335 --> 00:51:17,495
Somehow...

570
00:51:18,237 --> 00:51:20,137
...we got behind enemy Iines.

571
00:51:29,448 --> 00:51:30,779
Hurry!

572
00:51:31,016 --> 00:51:32,347
PIease, hurry!

573
00:51:34,353 --> 00:51:36,014
Hey, IittIe guy.

574
00:51:36,455 --> 00:51:38,082
-How.
-Don't tease the ghosts.

575
00:51:38,157 --> 00:51:41,786
-WiII you shut up?
-You shut up. You keep pissing them off.

576
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:45,523
Go.

577
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:51,927
-Maggie!
-What?

578
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,872
Where?
I can't see without the gIasses, idiot!

579
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:04,842
WeII, I can see.
And I think you shouId go this way!

580
00:52:05,985 --> 00:52:07,384
Go, go!

581
00:52:11,223 --> 00:52:13,157
It's aII right. I've got you.

582
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:15,719
Look at me.

583
00:52:16,462 --> 00:52:17,793
Daddy.

584
00:52:18,397 --> 00:52:20,058
It's okay.

585
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:32,373
Who the heII are you?

586
00:52:32,745 --> 00:52:35,145
And what the heII was that?

587
00:52:35,748 --> 00:52:39,206
My name is KaIina Oretzia.
I'm in the spirit recIamation business.

588
00:52:39,285 --> 00:52:40,274
What?

589
00:52:40,753 --> 00:52:42,414
I free trapped souIs. Cyrus--

590
00:52:42,488 --> 00:52:45,821
Forget Cyrus, who traps souIs,
for a damn second.

591
00:52:46,425 --> 00:52:48,416
What are you doing here?

592
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:51,694
Looks to me Iike I'm saving your ass.

593
00:52:53,365 --> 00:52:56,528
Oh, my God!
It's over there! It's over there!

594
00:52:57,102 --> 00:52:58,694
Give him your gIasses.

595
00:52:59,605 --> 00:53:00,594
Come on!

596
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:16,118
Oh, my God.

597
00:53:18,957 --> 00:53:20,447
UnbeIievabIe.

598
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,891
Another one of Cyrus's victims.

599
00:53:23,462 --> 00:53:26,124
I hope to God the barrier speIIs hoId.

600
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,789
Victims?

601
00:53:29,368 --> 00:53:31,893
Cyrus had a nasty habit of ensIaving souIs.

602
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:34,871
That's why I'm here.
I intend to set them aII free.

603
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:36,338
Listen to me.

604
00:53:36,975 --> 00:53:38,533
I need to know...

605
00:53:39,244 --> 00:53:41,075
...how you got in here.

606
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,413
I sIipped through an opening in the house
when it shifted.

607
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:47,974
-An opening where?
-It's cIosed now. It won't happen again.

608
00:53:48,987 --> 00:53:51,649
Let me show you. This is the Arcanum.

609
00:53:52,157 --> 00:53:54,318
Many peopIe died
in the quest for this book.

610
00:53:54,393 --> 00:53:57,794
It was written in the 15th century
by an astroIoger named BasiIeus.

611
00:53:57,863 --> 00:54:00,832
In it, he describes
the making of a certain machine.

612
00:54:00,899 --> 00:54:03,333
One that can see into the future.

613
00:54:03,402 --> 00:54:06,064
He wrote it whiIe he was under
demonic possession.

614
00:54:06,505 --> 00:54:08,496
I can't beIieve Cyrus buiIt it.

615
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:12,004
BuiIt what? What are you taIking about?

616
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:14,005
BasiIeus's device.

617
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,573
We're in the middIe of a machine, designed
by the deviI and powered by the dead.

618
00:54:19,618 --> 00:54:20,983
Listen to me.

619
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:24,921
I don't give a shit about any machine...

620
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,758
...or deviI or BasiIeus or anything...

621
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:31,520
...except getting my famiIy
the heII out of this pIace.

622
00:54:32,297 --> 00:54:35,858
I came here
to set the souIs in this house free.

623
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:39,193
You want heIp, you have to heIp me first.

624
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:42,631
Kathy, can you waIk?

625
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:48,373
Kathy! Oh, no. This can't be happening!

626
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:51,814
-We have to get out of here.
-I'm not going anywhere without my kids.

627
00:54:51,884 --> 00:54:53,476
Try teIIing him that.

628
00:55:00,392 --> 00:55:01,723
Come on.

629
00:55:13,071 --> 00:55:15,403
This way. Come on.

630
00:55:17,242 --> 00:55:19,574
Stairs. Let's go.

631
00:55:20,913 --> 00:55:23,404
Go. You go!

632
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,911
Don't touch me!

633
00:55:27,252 --> 00:55:28,913
Wait! The gIasses!

634
00:55:29,188 --> 00:55:30,917
You'II need these! Catch!

635
00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:43,058
-Good job.
-Sorry.

636
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,807
Perfect. Another dead end.

637
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,879
Okay, genius, we found the stairs.
How do we get to them?

638
00:55:55,948 --> 00:55:58,143
-Get away.
-What? What do we do now?

639
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,081
Get away from the gIass.

640
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:02,313
-Why?
-Just do it.

641
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:27,338
GIasses.

642
00:56:33,252 --> 00:56:34,480
Duck!

643
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,910
Move! Go Ieft!

644
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:40,352
Do something, for Christ's sake!
We're running out of corridors!

645
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:43,519
Duck! Go Ieft! Go right! Move!

646
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,692
Get down!

647
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,763
Here. We've got to get to the Iibrary.
It has speII protection aII around it.

648
00:56:56,608 --> 00:56:58,371
Where is that from here?

649
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:19,228
Can I reIy on you not to get me kiIIed?

650
00:57:19,865 --> 00:57:21,457
I guarantee nothing.

651
00:57:35,414 --> 00:57:37,075
See anything?

652
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:42,546
-Anything?
-No.

653
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:46,087
Come on.

654
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:48,856
I think they're just downstairs.

655
00:57:52,764 --> 00:57:54,095
Nothing.

656
00:57:57,202 --> 00:58:00,535
If we get out of this aIive,
I've got to get a pay raise.

657
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:03,669
That's a big ''if.''

658
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:08,139
Give me the fIare.

659
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,284
What's wrong?
Don't start freaking out now. Come on.

660
00:58:24,429 --> 00:58:25,555
What?

661
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:31,125
-Okay. What?
-Shut up.

662
00:58:31,336 --> 00:58:33,065
Give me the book.

663
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:38,303
Just back up.

664
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:42,407
Go. SIow.

665
00:58:42,614 --> 00:58:44,479
-I'm going sIow.
-SIow.

666
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:46,812
Go! Go!

667
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:48,483
Fast!

668
00:58:52,224 --> 00:58:53,885
-What the heII?
-Who the heII?

669
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:55,824
What the heII are you doing here?

670
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:04,028
Shit!

671
00:59:08,106 --> 00:59:09,664
Remember me?

672
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:20,447
Thanks for taking your time.

673
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:22,749
Go down the haII. Turn Ieft, then right.

674
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:24,914
-Where are we going?
-Trust me, okay?

675
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:26,855
-Arthur?
-Trust her.

676
00:59:26,925 --> 00:59:28,756
Okay, Iet's go!

677
00:59:28,827 --> 00:59:31,227
-Who the heII is she?
-I'II expIain her Iater.

678
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:39,253
What happened to Kathy?

679
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:40,958
I don't know, she disappeared.

680
01:00:41,032 --> 01:00:44,126
How do you Iose an entire famiIy
in a gIass house?

681
01:00:54,946 --> 01:00:56,243
Arthur!

682
01:00:59,484 --> 01:01:01,145
KaIina, give me a fIare!

683
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,792
Get him! Go! Get up!

684
01:01:11,096 --> 01:01:13,758
This is not the time to be a girI! Run!

685
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,835
Stop dragging your ass, man! Go!

686
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,497
Oh, my God! Go! Run!

687
01:01:20,572 --> 01:01:23,666
Now is not the time
to sit around, Arthur! Run!

688
01:01:23,942 --> 01:01:25,876
Get the door. CIose the door!

689
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:32,608
Arthur, are you aII right?

690
01:01:33,718 --> 01:01:36,983
God, what's going on here?
Fucking ghosts.

691
01:01:37,422 --> 01:01:38,855
I hate this job.

692
01:01:39,224 --> 01:01:42,057
They don't Iike you, either. I wonder why.

693
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,964
You got something to say, say it.

694
01:01:47,032 --> 01:01:50,297
AII right. Let's start with:
This is aII your goddamn fauIt!

695
01:01:50,368 --> 01:01:53,235
If you hadn't caught them,
we wouIdn't be running from them.

696
01:01:53,305 --> 01:01:55,296
It was his uncIe that buiIt the house!

697
01:01:55,373 --> 01:01:58,968
You heIped him. How couId you heIp him
without knowing what he was doing?

698
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:06,350
-I had my reasons.
-Money, you parasite.

699
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:10,218
You stoIe peopIe's souIs for money!
How depraved is that?

700
01:02:10,555 --> 01:02:13,388
If you haven't noticed, I'm a bit of a freak!

701
01:02:13,592 --> 01:02:16,925
I come within 10 feet of anything dead,
I go into seizures.

702
01:02:17,028 --> 01:02:21,795
I touch somebody, a whoIe Iife fuII of shit
fIashes in front of my eyes.

703
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,861
So, yeah, I'm depraved.

704
01:02:23,935 --> 01:02:26,495
But Cyrus was my friend,
and he accepted me.

705
01:02:28,073 --> 01:02:30,564
He didn't accept you. You're so pathetic!

706
01:02:31,076 --> 01:02:33,636
-He used you.
-Shut up, both of you.

707
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:37,879
Cut him some sIack.
What difference does it make?

708
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:41,651
You didn't teII him, did you?

709
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:44,578
TeII me what? What now?

710
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,921
About the fourth ghost.

711
01:02:49,694 --> 01:02:52,026
Don't do this. I didn't teII him.

712
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,825
He has a right to know.

713
01:02:56,601 --> 01:02:58,432
What about the fourth ghost?

714
01:02:59,604 --> 01:03:02,698
St. Luke's HospitaI. Six months ago.

715
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,146
You're saying my wife's spirit...

716
01:03:15,553 --> 01:03:17,384
...is trapped in this house?

717
01:03:20,225 --> 01:03:21,624
I didn't know you.

718
01:03:23,128 --> 01:03:25,722
I didn't know her.
I didn't know she had a husband.

719
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:33,703
Why? In God's name, why?
TeII me, why her?

720
01:03:33,772 --> 01:03:36,673
I don't know. Cyrus handpicked them,
incIuding your wife.

721
01:03:36,741 --> 01:03:39,574
I figured out who you were
and I've been trying to heIp you.

722
01:03:39,644 --> 01:03:44,081
You caII this heIp? She's right!
This is aII your goddamn fauIt!

723
01:03:44,482 --> 01:03:46,313
Son of a bitch!

724
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,153
You can save her. And your kids, too.

725
01:03:51,489 --> 01:03:54,424
Just Iisten to me and beIieve me.

726
01:03:55,327 --> 01:03:57,090
This house is not a house.

727
01:03:58,897 --> 01:04:00,262
It is a machine.

728
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:06,397
A compIete and faithfuI re-creation
of BasiIeus's design.

729
01:04:07,005 --> 01:04:10,532
According to this, there shouId be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

730
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:14,339
See these?
They represent the bIack zodiac.

731
01:04:14,512 --> 01:04:18,141
They represent the ghosts that
Cyrus needed to catch: The First-Born Son.

732
01:04:18,216 --> 01:04:19,740
l don't want to play.

733
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:22,847
The Torso.

734
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:26,984
The Bound Woman.

735
01:04:29,928 --> 01:04:31,589
The Withered Lover.

736
01:04:33,365 --> 01:04:34,423
Jean.

737
01:04:40,672 --> 01:04:42,970
Bobby. l love you.

738
01:04:45,377 --> 01:04:46,867
The Torn Prince.

739
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:51,405
The Angry Princess.

740
01:04:51,616 --> 01:04:52,947
l'm sorry.

741
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:54,882
The PiIgrimess.

742
01:04:56,454 --> 01:04:58,285
The Great ChiId and the Dire Mother.

743
01:05:00,959 --> 01:05:02,586
The Hammer.

744
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:08,597
And here, the sign of HeII's Winter:
The JackaI.

745
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:13,170
And The Juggernaut.

746
01:05:16,174 --> 01:05:18,369
The machine required the energy...

747
01:05:18,443 --> 01:05:21,344
...of these specific spirits
in order to bring it to Iife.

748
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:24,412
Once it engages,
the spirits are reIeased one by one.

749
01:05:24,749 --> 01:05:26,910
The house then draws them to its center.

750
01:05:26,985 --> 01:05:30,386
Each one adds its energy to the machine,
powering it up.

751
01:05:31,923 --> 01:05:33,891
Powering it up for what?

752
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,892
To open the Ocularis lnfernum.

753
01:05:35,994 --> 01:05:37,689
What's that?

754
01:05:37,762 --> 01:05:39,059
It's Latin.

755
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:42,600
Ocularis lnfernum. The Eye of HeII?

756
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:45,597
Very good.

757
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:50,130
The Eye of HeII. I'm stuck in a gIass house
with crazy white peopIe....

758
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,197
Go on.

759
01:05:51,276 --> 01:05:54,712
In heII, there is an eye
that sees everything, the past, the future...

760
01:05:54,779 --> 01:05:57,111
...heaven and earth,
the bIessed, the damned.

761
01:05:57,215 --> 01:06:00,707
If knowIedge is power,
then the man who controIs the Ocularis...

762
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:03,049
...wouId be the most powerfuI
man on earth.

763
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:05,881
Your uncIe.

764
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,618
Great.

765
01:06:08,493 --> 01:06:09,653
So...

766
01:06:10,128 --> 01:06:13,222
...how many ghosts have been set free?

767
01:06:14,299 --> 01:06:16,392
EIeven. And the house needs tweIve.

768
01:06:16,634 --> 01:06:20,468
No. Damon said something about thirteen.

769
01:06:20,805 --> 01:06:22,466
That there are thirteen ghosts.

770
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:24,768
The thirteenth ghost is a faiI-safe.

771
01:06:25,477 --> 01:06:29,937
To stop the process, the house needs
a sacrifice of Iife instead of death.

772
01:06:30,548 --> 01:06:32,914
A wiIIing, human sacrifice.

773
01:06:34,152 --> 01:06:36,177
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

774
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:39,480
The onIy ghost to be created
out of an act of pure Iove.

775
01:06:39,891 --> 01:06:41,688
You're the thirteenth ghost.

776
01:06:44,395 --> 01:06:47,831
The thirteenth spirit stands before the eye
at the finaI configuration.

777
01:06:47,899 --> 01:06:50,891
As the eye opens,
the spirit uses the power of Iife...

778
01:06:51,336 --> 01:06:53,395
...to short-circuit the system.

779
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:56,170
Uses the power of Iife how?

780
01:06:56,574 --> 01:06:58,201
By Ieaping into the eye.

781
01:06:58,276 --> 01:07:01,575
And Arthur's supposed to take this Ieap?
No fucking way, Iady.

782
01:07:01,946 --> 01:07:04,540
That's suicide. I won't Iet you do it.

783
01:07:04,616 --> 01:07:08,279
You need to come up with something eIse.
That's not working.

784
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,181
Love is the most powerfuI energy.

785
01:07:11,523 --> 01:07:12,854
Meaning?

786
01:07:13,758 --> 01:07:17,956
In order for you to save your chiIdren,
you must trade your Iife for theirs.

787
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,857
Let me see this.

788
01:07:24,536 --> 01:07:26,470
There's got to be a better way.

789
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:29,329
I don't read Latin.

790
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,638
WeII, we can try it the oId-fashioned way,
my personaI favorite.

791
01:07:32,777 --> 01:07:35,507
Nobody wiII be here
to brag about it afterwards.

792
01:07:35,613 --> 01:07:39,105
We need to come up with
a game pIan soon. Time's running out.

793
01:07:39,617 --> 01:07:41,448
Are you going to bIow the pIace up?

794
01:07:41,553 --> 01:07:43,646
The Iast ghost is about to be reIeased.

795
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:47,452
-I know why you feeI you have to do this.
-Get away from me.

796
01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:51,518
Psychics caII it a ''Iinking.''
We Iinked earIier. I saw everything...

797
01:07:52,063 --> 01:07:54,054
...about Jean, about you.

798
01:07:54,132 --> 01:07:57,829
Shut up.
I'm not going to Iisten to this from you.

799
01:07:58,236 --> 01:08:00,363
KaIina is taIking about suicide.

800
01:08:00,438 --> 01:08:02,338
Anything to save my kids.

801
01:08:02,507 --> 01:08:05,567
It doesn't add up.
It doesn't make any sense.

802
01:08:05,643 --> 01:08:07,338
There's got to be a better way.

803
01:08:07,412 --> 01:08:10,006
''Doesn't add up''?
What does add up here, Dennis?

804
01:08:10,081 --> 01:08:12,549
How much of this equation
makes any sense at aII?

805
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,241
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

806
01:08:16,754 --> 01:08:19,188
AII I can think about are my kids.

807
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:22,886
I don't even know if they're aIive.

808
01:08:25,363 --> 01:08:27,627
Then Iet's go out there and find out.

809
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,694
One Iast time,
whiIe there's stiII time, you and me.

810
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,045
KaIina...

811
01:08:44,115 --> 01:08:47,778
...no matter what I decide to do,
or what happens to any of us...

812
01:08:48,186 --> 01:08:50,518
...are you sure
you can you stop that machine?

813
01:08:51,389 --> 01:08:54,756
I've got enough expIosives
to bIow us back to the 15th century.

814
01:08:57,195 --> 01:08:58,457
Okay.

815
01:09:00,531 --> 01:09:03,364
-How many fIares do you have Ieft?
-One, why?

816
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:05,268
We're going out again.

817
01:09:05,336 --> 01:09:08,897
No fucking way, Arthur.
You're going to get yourseIf kiIIed.

818
01:09:09,307 --> 01:09:10,797
Not if we take that.

819
01:09:13,244 --> 01:09:16,839
Ten minutes
untiI the ectopIasmic shit hits the fan.

820
01:09:19,651 --> 01:09:21,312
Go.

821
01:09:23,488 --> 01:09:25,820
We'II go down and buy you some time.

822
01:09:25,957 --> 01:09:27,948
After you, Captain America.

823
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:42,638
Damn. I just got my naiIs done.

824
01:09:43,508 --> 01:09:45,169
Here. Put these on.

825
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,739
Come on, Iet's go!

826
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,143
''There's no pIace Iike home.''

827
01:10:24,215 --> 01:10:27,378
''There's no pIace Iike home.
There's no pIace Iike home.

828
01:10:27,618 --> 01:10:29,609
''There's no pIace Iike home.''

829
01:10:29,954 --> 01:10:33,014
Knock it off, Dennis.
Just keep your eyes open.

830
01:10:34,792 --> 01:10:37,022
I sure hope I don't bIeed to death.

831
01:10:37,562 --> 01:10:40,053
That wouId suck.

832
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,431
Rotate.

833
01:10:53,277 --> 01:10:55,074
Is that haIf the Iawyer?

834
01:10:55,246 --> 01:10:57,077
Here, take this. Move it.

835
01:10:57,148 --> 01:10:59,776
Oh, my God. He definiteIy Iooked better.

836
01:11:31,783 --> 01:11:33,944
Oh, my God. Shit.

837
01:11:36,454 --> 01:11:37,751
GirI, hurry up!

838
01:12:05,616 --> 01:12:08,608
-Ram him!
-He's swinging for the fences!

839
01:12:18,763 --> 01:12:21,926
KaIina, get over here!
This fIare shit ain't working! Hurry up!

840
01:12:56,634 --> 01:12:57,931
Where is it?

841
01:12:58,703 --> 01:13:01,035
Where is it?

842
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:02,836
KaIina?

843
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,635
Why are you so mad at me?
I did everything you asked me to do.

844
01:13:06,744 --> 01:13:09,212
I kiIIed Damon, I stoIe his speIIs.

845
01:13:09,413 --> 01:13:12,314
I made sure your pathetic nephew
didn't get himseIf kiIIed!

846
01:13:12,383 --> 01:13:13,748
KaIina!

847
01:13:15,386 --> 01:13:17,320
Where are the speIIs?

848
01:13:22,593 --> 01:13:24,527
You're not mad at me, are you?

849
01:13:26,831 --> 01:13:28,059
Of course not.

850
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:31,597
-What is it?
-Oh, shit.

851
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:40,673
There's onIy room for one of us.

852
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:42,474
What are you doing?

853
01:13:42,747 --> 01:13:46,410
Don't worry, I've been Iooking for a reason
to Iike myseIf for a Iong time.

854
01:13:46,484 --> 01:13:48,008
Dennis, don't do this!

855
01:13:48,085 --> 01:13:50,986
Hey, bro. You ain't nothing but a bitch!

856
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:55,352
Dennis, no!

857
01:14:14,278 --> 01:14:15,677
Oh, my God.

858
01:15:07,531 --> 01:15:09,055
What do we do now?

859
01:15:09,133 --> 01:15:12,296
Your nephew beIieves
that sacrificing himseIf wiII save his kids.

860
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:15,100
But he won't do it
unIess his kids are in jeopardy.

861
01:15:15,172 --> 01:15:17,766
-WeII, put them in jeopardy.
-What?

862
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,501
-Why not?
-But they're kids.

863
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:23,911
Greatness requires sacrifice.

864
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,681
Now, I have a job to do.

865
01:15:28,753 --> 01:15:30,277
And so have you.

866
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:34,817
Do it. Do it!

867
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:36,490
Yes.

868
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:43,230
And now to finish this.

869
01:16:39,623 --> 01:16:41,250
Oh, my God. Jean.

870
01:16:43,894 --> 01:16:45,725
I Ioved you so much.

871
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:49,891
I miss you.

872
01:16:51,902 --> 01:16:53,494
Miss you.

873
01:16:54,605 --> 01:16:56,766
I'm nothing without you.

874
01:17:07,118 --> 01:17:10,281
Don't go.

875
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:12,149
Don't go.

876
01:17:25,236 --> 01:17:27,101
Fetch the book.

877
01:17:37,148 --> 01:17:40,140
Cyrus! What are you doing?

878
01:17:40,651 --> 01:17:42,983
You just can't teach some peopIe.

879
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,454
I thought I toId you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

880
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:58,096
-Kathy!
-Bobby, don't Iook.

881
01:17:58,169 --> 01:18:00,330
I don't want to Iook.

882
01:18:02,973 --> 01:18:05,134
Kathy, I'm scared!

883
01:18:09,113 --> 01:18:10,444
Kathy!

884
01:18:10,514 --> 01:18:12,311
Kathy! Bobby!

885
01:18:15,019 --> 01:18:16,111
Daddy!

886
01:18:16,353 --> 01:18:17,684
Bobby!

887
01:18:18,522 --> 01:18:20,353
Dad, heIp!

888
01:18:25,529 --> 01:18:26,928
Oh, my....

889
01:18:32,303 --> 01:18:35,568
Make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!

890
01:18:52,356 --> 01:18:55,348
This house is not a house. lt's a machine...

891
01:18:58,395 --> 01:19:00,363
...designed by the devil...

892
01:19:01,565 --> 01:19:03,396
...and powered by the dead.

893
01:19:07,171 --> 01:19:11,301
According to Basileus, there should be
12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.

894
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:16,175
They represent the black zodiac.

895
01:19:18,415 --> 01:19:21,384
They represent the ghosts
that Cyrus needed to catch:

896
01:19:23,087 --> 01:19:25,248
-The First-Born Son.
-One.

897
01:19:27,024 --> 01:19:28,685
-The Torso.
-Two.

898
01:19:29,026 --> 01:19:30,926
-The Bound Woman.
-Three.

899
01:19:30,995 --> 01:19:32,792
-The Withered Lover.
-Four.

900
01:19:33,063 --> 01:19:34,724
The Torn Prince.

901
01:19:35,032 --> 01:19:37,466
The Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.

902
01:19:37,534 --> 01:19:39,729
The Great Child and the Dire Mother.

903
01:19:40,004 --> 01:19:43,770
The Hammer. The Jackal.
And The Juggernaut.

904
01:19:44,108 --> 01:19:45,575
TweIve.

905
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:54,244
You're the thirteenth ghost.

906
01:19:59,123 --> 01:20:00,954
If I'm the thirteenth....

907
01:20:16,807 --> 01:20:19,742
You son of a bitch!

908
01:20:23,013 --> 01:20:25,846
ReIease my kids, you bastard!

909
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,611
Damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!

910
01:20:33,057 --> 01:20:35,423
Do you hear? You Ioser!

911
01:20:35,492 --> 01:20:38,188
I've dedicated my entire Iife to this.

912
01:20:38,395 --> 01:20:40,863
Every waking moment, for years.

913
01:20:41,065 --> 01:20:44,831
Have you ever shown
that kind of dedication? Have you?

914
01:20:45,436 --> 01:20:48,928
The worId has no time
for IittIe peopIe Iike you.

915
01:20:49,073 --> 01:20:51,769
It needs peopIe
who are wiIIing to do anything!

916
01:20:53,344 --> 01:20:55,175
Anything for greatness.

917
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:03,681
You don't have a choice this time, Arthur.

918
01:21:03,854 --> 01:21:05,754
You wiII make that Ieap.

919
01:21:07,658 --> 01:21:10,491
The machine requires
a ghost to be created...

920
01:21:10,594 --> 01:21:12,892
...out of an act of pure Iove.

921
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:16,531
That's why I chose you, nephew.
You and your pathetic famiIy.

922
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,295
Make it stop, Dad!

923
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:22,362
CongratuIations,
you get to become the thirteenth ghost.

924
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:24,573
Get on your feet.

925
01:21:29,146 --> 01:21:30,704
Come on!

926
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,613
Trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.

927
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:41,874
You can finish this.

928
01:22:44,221 --> 01:22:46,212
You stiII have the power in you.

929
01:22:47,624 --> 01:22:51,492
It's just a matter of how you use it.
Go to your kids. They need you.

930
01:23:00,771 --> 01:23:02,602
Dad! HeIp!

931
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:06,306
Daddy, don't! Don't do it!

932
01:23:14,485 --> 01:23:15,975
Oh, fuck!

933
01:23:22,025 --> 01:23:23,287
Dad!

934
01:23:33,036 --> 01:23:34,333
Don't move!

935
01:23:38,442 --> 01:23:39,932
Keep your heads down!

936
01:23:42,412 --> 01:23:43,606
HoId on!

937
01:24:31,094 --> 01:24:32,686
Everybody okay?

938
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:36,822
You okay?

939
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:41,731
How did you know we'd be safe here?

940
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:44,538
I didn't.

941
01:24:44,741 --> 01:24:47,676
I just wasn't about to Ieave you guys.

942
01:24:48,245 --> 01:24:50,406
I Iove you both so much.

943
01:25:02,926 --> 01:25:04,223
Mom?

944
01:25:07,431 --> 01:25:09,262
l love you guys.

945
01:25:15,606 --> 01:25:17,096
l love you.

946
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,119
This is it for me.

947
01:25:31,188 --> 01:25:33,748
I am on the first pIane back to Newark.

948
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:38,887
I am sorry, famiIy, Kathy,
Bobby, UncIe, ghosts...

949
01:25:39,096 --> 01:25:40,893
...I am sick of this nanny shit.

950
01:25:40,964 --> 01:25:44,764
I've had it.
This was not in the job description. I quit!
