319
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,563
I know you are.

320
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,192
All right.

321
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,801
Got it?

322
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,305
Hey.

323
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,875
Scooch, scooch, scooch.

324
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,076
[All]
Yay!

325
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,817
All right, guys. I just want to say sorry
for the mix-up out there.

326
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,123
I know things could have
turned out really bad...

327
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,222
but I'm glad we're all okay.

328
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,529
Don't worry about it, dude.
It could have happened to anyone.

329
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,003
[Kenia] It's fine. We're all fine.
We'll go to the cabin in the morning.

330
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,903
I think the weather
should be clear by then.

331
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,498
Let's just try to get some rest.

332
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,772
No way! Have you seen this place?
It's fucking fantastic.

333
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,846
[Laughter]

334
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,710
Let's check it out.
Do a little exploring.

335
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,841
Trespassing?

336
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,549
God, Daniel.

337
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,680
[All Laughing]

338
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,690
[Man]
Wow.

339
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,283
- All right. All right. I'll go with you.
- Yeah, me too.

340
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,058
You girls gonna be okay alone?

341
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,689
- Don't get lost again.
- Thanks.

342
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,736
Wait. You expect us girls
to cook dinner?

343
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,330
It's hot dogs.

344
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,568
I think you ladies can handle that.

345
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,702
Well, maybe I don't want to.

346
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:04,475
That's right, Bridget.
You don't do hot dogs, do ya?

347
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,051
- [Laughter]
- Fuck you, Vincent.

348
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,712
[Kyle]
Let's go.

349
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,814
- Wait. I'll go with you.
- [Woman] Yeah, me too.

350
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,529
[Claire]
Hey, wait up. I'm coming too.

351
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,561
[All Chuckling]

352
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,759
- Wake up.
- [Sighs]

353
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,435
Hey, check this out.

354
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,632
It looks like somebody's
been here recently.

355
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,404
Hunters probably use this
to hold up in during the spring runoff.

356
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,518
Do you guys think anyone would
actually be here right now?

357
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,917
I mean, that would be
really creepy.

358
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,751
No. No one's hunting
in this weather.

359
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,253
[Daniel]
Ax murderers do.

360
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,693
- Just saying.
- [Laughs]

361
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,330
Hey, this must be
the head honcho's office.

362
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,070
"Dr. Brendan Ryan, Chief of Staff."

363
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,374
Well, let's see if the chief
had any good stuff.

364
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,416
Oh. What the hell
happened in here?

365
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,455
Hey, check out this coat
and stethoscope.

366
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,188
Hey, Jenna, hop on my desk.
We're gonna do a porn scene.

367
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,059
- Oh, God.
- Me doctor, you nurse.

368
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,893
- Vince, you mind?
- Do her.

369
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,523
I'm busy with my patients.

370
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,262
Hey! Hey! Get away from me!
[Laughs]

371
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,134
[Vincent]
So, Miss Perrin.

372
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,334
How long have you been having
these reoccurring nightmares?

373
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,468
Well, it all started
when I was 12.

374
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,809
I-I felt this presence
in my room at night.

375
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,405
Was this about the time
of your first period?

376
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,508
You're a fucking pervert.
You know that?

377
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,487
Violent dreams are a direct result
of menstruation in young women.

378
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,923
- Had you masturbated yet?
- Ew!

379
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,927
You're fucking disgusting.

380
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:00,554
Oh! Jackpot.

381
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,828
Looks like the good doctor was a boozer.
Anyone for a snort?

382
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,835
Please tell me
you're not gonna drink that.

383
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,564
It's a 30-year-old bottle of scotch.

384
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,368
Thirty years ago, Jenna. Unopened.

385
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,744
Mmm. That is smooth.

386
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,906
- To pussy.
- [Kyle Chuckles]

387
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,280
Ooh!

388
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,020
- Holy shit.
- What?

389
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,284
That's some fucked-up shit.

390
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,087
[Kyle]
What the fuck is that?

391
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,094
A person.

392
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,720
What the hell happened to him?

393
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,959
- [Daniel] Born that way.
- Poor son of a bitch.

394
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,968
- Oh! That is so wrong.
- [Chuckles]

395
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,197
[Scoffs]

396
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,404
- [Claire] Jesus!
- What was this place?

397
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,241
According to the records,
it was the Glenville Sanatorium.

398
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,407
- Isn't that where crazy people
are locked up?
- No, that's a sanitarium.

399
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,645
A sanatorium is a hospital that isolates
sick people from the rest of the population.

400
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,881
What was wrong with these people?

401
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,184
I don't know.

402
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,556
They're all deformed
from what I can tell.

403
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,129
I'm gonna take some of these
and read them.

404
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,824
I just hope it wasn't contagious.

405
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,097
- All right.
- Come on. We should
get back to the others.

406
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,670
[Jenna]
Yeah.

407
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:17,232
[Daniel]
That's a great idea.

408
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,986
[Claire] He's kind of cute
when you're stoned.

409
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,418
You know, in like an E. T. kind of way.

410
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:39,224
[All Chuckling]

411
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,992
Wow, babe.

412
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,296
You know, you're a lot more fucked up
than I thought you were.

413
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,597
- [Exhales, Chuckles]
- Thank you.

414
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,673
Mm-hmm.

415
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,537
Hey, I found a patient ward
that's got beds and shit.

416
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,612
Oh, gross. I don't want to sleep
on a filthy mattress.

417
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,510
We'll lay our sleeping bags
over the top.

418
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,051
It's better than sleeping on the hard floor.
Plus, we get a little privacy.

419
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,051
- Ooh.
- Okay.

420
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,179
[Chuckling]
We'll be back, guys.

421
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,224
- All right.
- Night.
- So long.

422
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,123
Hey.

423
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,532
- You wanna come check it out?
- Sure.

424
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,162
[Jenna]
I'm not enough?

425
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,967
Ah, you are mine.

426
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,939
[Groans]

427
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,164
See? It's not so bad.

428
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,964
Okay.

429
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,938
Okay, I say we all pick a room.

430
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,100
And then everyone puts
their keys in a bowl...

431
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,609
and we pick to see
who sleeps with who.

432
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,408
- You just don't stop, do you?
- It's what I do best.

433
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,813
- [Sighs] You got that right.
- [Chuckles]

434
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:12,584
[Gasps]
Hey! I think I just saw somebody.

435
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,556
Ghosts. Awesome.

436
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,253
No, it wasn't a ghost.
I think it was a person.

437
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,057
Well, there's nobody there now.

438
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,564
If you want me to take a look, I will.

439
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,004
No. Nobody here.

440
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,268
Whew.

441
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,969
- [Vincent Screams]
- [Body Thuds]

442
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,741
[Whispers]
Oh, my God.

443
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,577
Vincent?

444
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,986
This isn't funny, Vincent!

445
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,282
Vincent, answer me!

446
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,460
- I'm going. This isn't cool. No.
- No, no, no!

447
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,498
- No!
- Don't leave me alone. Come.

448
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,971
[Whispers]
Vincent.

449
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,152
Vincent.

450
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,119
Vincent.

451
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,219
Vincent?

452
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,469
- Whoa!
- [Screams]

453
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,733
You fucking asshole!

454
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,900
Calm down. Trying to have some fun.

455
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,944
Oh, I can't believe you!

456
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,206
- [Chuckles]
- [Kenia] God! He's such a jerk.

457
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,475
Ohh!

458
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,042
Kenia?

459
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,814
[Jenna Scoffs]

460
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,318
- [Low Growl]
- [Vincent Laughs]

461
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,932
- Move!
- Hey, what's up?

462
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,564
He's a fucking jerk.

463
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,803
I scared the piss out of them.
You should have seen it.

464
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,245
You have the mentality of a 10-year-old.
You know that, right?

465
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,078
- Okay.
- I could have fallen in the dark.

466
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,653
You have no idea
of the consequences...

467
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,722
of your stupid,
incessant pranks.

468
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,654
[Chuckles]

469
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:31,388
Well, a place this big has gotta
have its own generator.

470
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,327
And since you two
are afraid of the dark...

471
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,865
I'll see if I can find it and get
some heat and lights started.

472
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,525
Finally, you're doing
something useful.

473
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,604
Hey, Vincent can be useful
in many ways, can't you, baby?

Guys, do you think we should wait
for the storm to blow over?

632
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:15,183
No. Look, I say we pack up,
we find Vincent, and we get going.

633
00:42:15,294 --> 00:42:17,319
[Kenia] Yeah. Let's split up
into two groups though.

634
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:20,796
Daniel, you take Bridget, Sara and Lauren
and check the upper floors.

635
00:42:20,899 --> 00:42:23,868
Everyone else come with me. We'll
check the first floor and the basement.

636
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:25,698
We'll meet up in the auditorium
in half an hour.

637
00:42:25,804 --> 00:42:27,203
I'm-- I'm not done eating.

638
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:30,571
Kyle, come on. Geez.

639
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:32,940
Does anyone not think
it's weird our stuff is gone?

640
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:35,275
You guys, the sooner we find him,
the quicker we can leave.

641
00:42:37,482 --> 00:42:38,608
Let's go.

642
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:40,412
Here you go, princess.

643
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,215
- I'm a princess. Thanks.
- [Chuckles]

644
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:45,290
You think it's funny?

645
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,882
Oh, wait! Yes.

646
00:42:48,994 --> 00:42:50,689
Let's move it.

647
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,594
[Kyle]
Yeah. He's dead for sure.

648
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,032
[Jenna]
Shut up, Kyle.

649
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:59,126
Come on, Vincent!

650
00:42:59,237 --> 00:43:01,034
[Kyle]
Vincent, we've got food!

651
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:04,108
- [Claire] Vince!
- [Jenna] I really don't like this anymore.

652
00:43:08,447 --> 00:43:10,005
[Kenia]
What is that?

653
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:17,416
- [Kenia] Oh, what is all this?
- [Kyle] Wow.

654
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,757
Well, we're definitely
checking this out.

655
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,851
[Door Squeaks]

656

[Electricity Humming]

657
00:43:34,272 --> 00:43:36,399
- Wow.
- Whoa.

658
00:43:41,947 --> 00:43:44,438
[Maniacal Laugh, Chuckles]

659
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:46,380
So, I guess if you
didn't follow the program...

660
00:43:46,485 --> 00:43:50,012
- they had some serious slice and dice--
- Get out of here!

661
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:51,953
We're looking for
Vincent, remember?

662
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:55,857
- [Jenna] Yes.
- Yeah. Let's go. Come on. Come on.

663
00:43:55,961 --> 00:43:58,395
- Quit goofing around.
- Let's get out of here.

664
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:07,401
[Kyle] Ward "C." Open the door.
Let's check this out.

665
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:18,377
They locked them up like animals.

666
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:20,383
They look like animals.

667
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:22,749
Come on. Let's keep moving.

668
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:27,657
What's that?

669
00:44:27,759 --> 00:44:29,317
It looks like a nurse's station.

670
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:33,825
Vincent definitely would have checked to
see if there were any drugs left behind.

671
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:36,332
- [Chuckles]
- Yeah, probably.

672
00:44:41,873 --> 00:44:43,807
It's blood.

673
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:46,469
[Lauren]
Oh, my God.

674
00:44:46,578 --> 00:44:48,910
All right, stay here, okay?
I'm gonna check it out.

675
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:53,651
Do you think it's Vincent's?

676
00:44:57,222 --> 00:45:03,024
Uh, I mean, he-he-- he could have
cut himself on something.

677
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:05,028
Vince?

678
00:45:07,632 --> 00:45:11,898
Well, I say we each take a hallway.
We can cover more ground that way.

679
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:14,198
- Mm-hmm.
- Sounds good to me.

680
00:45:14,306 --> 00:45:16,501
This way?

681
00:45:16,608 --> 00:45:19,202
- I guess we're going this way.
- I guess so.

682
00:45:38,964 --> 00:45:40,454

[Exhales]

695
00:47:19,931 --> 00:47:21,694
I'm really starting to get worried.

696
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,530
- He'll show up.
- I'm sure he just fell asleep somewhere.

697
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:26,263
He smoked pretty heavy last night.

698
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:28,931
He's probably stoned right now,
in a corner having a bad trip somewhere.

699
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,940
Yeah. Hey.

700
00:47:32,944 --> 00:47:34,741
- Did you guys find anything?
- Yeah.

701
00:47:34,846 --> 00:47:37,713
- What?
- A small amount of blood.

702
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:41,013
- [Sara] We are not alone here.
- What do you mean?

703
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,711
Somebody is fucking with us.

704
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:44,789
- What?
- I wanna get the hell outta here now.

[Kenia Gasps]

708
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:54,226
That looks like Porter's jacket.

709
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:56,300
That is Porter's jacket.

Shit.

the spark plug wires.

- They sabotaged the fucking snowmobiles!

What are we gonna do now?

745
00:50:06,765 --> 00:50:08,733
[Daniel]
We won't last on foot in this storm.

We don't even have fucking jackets.

747
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:13,395
I say we go back inside and figure out
a way to defend ourselves.

748
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:17,373
- Who the fuck are they?
- The cannibal hillbillies
my brother told me about.

749
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:18,499
Who else could it be?

- What are you doing?
- I'm going for help.

751

Baby, you'll freeze to death.

752
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:27,542
I'm the strongest skier.
I've got the gear.

753
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:30,280
I'll make it down the mountain,
and I'll call the police.

754
00:50:30,388 --> 00:50:33,414
- Baby, I really don't think you should go.
- I'm going.

755
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:35,959
If anybody can make it, it's Lauren.

756
00:50:36,061 --> 00:50:38,427
I'll come back for you.
Okay? I promise.

757
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:42,533
Be careful.

758
00:50:43,968 --> 00:50:45,595
What are we gonna do?

759
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,175
I'll see you soon.

760
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:09,291
[Sobbing]
And now what?

761
00:51:09,394 --> 00:51:12,761
Please, Sara, please!
We can't go back in there.

762
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,331
- We have to.
- No.

763
00:51:14,432 --> 00:51:17,492
The doctor's office--
It has a sturdy door and a lock on it.

764
00:51:17,602 --> 00:51:19,570
All right, it's right
near the entrance.

765
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:22,765
- I can't do that.
- We either freeze to death or we fight.

766
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,406
That's the plan.

767
00:51:40,158 --> 00:51:41,625
[Daniel]
Okay.

768
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:45,892
- [Kenia] We have to get weapons.
- I've got mine.

769
00:51:45,997 --> 00:51:47,555
The rest of us need them too.

770
00:51:47,665 --> 00:51:50,133
This is crazy. We need to get
the hell out of here!

771
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,669
As soon as the storm breaks,
that's what we're gonna do.

772
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,738
Guys? Guys, look at this.

773
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:56,830
This is the guy that attacked Claire
on the balcony.

774
00:51:56,941 --> 00:52:00,604
It says they were violent,
mentally, physically deformed...

775
00:52:00,712 --> 00:52:02,976
and showed signs of cannibalism.

776

[Moans]

777
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,551
- How did they survive out here?
- They're hunters.

778
00:52:07,652 --> 00:52:09,279
And now they're hunting us.
They'll eat anything.

779
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:11,446
Fuck! They probably turned Porter
into porterhouse by now.

780
00:52:11,556 --> 00:52:12,648
Just shut up!

781

The basement.

785
00:52:53,198 --> 00:52:55,723
- That cage thing.
- What?

786
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,266
Yes. Yes.

787
00:52:57,368 --> 00:53:00,269
That cage downstairs
with all the knives and saws in it.

788
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:02,532
- We should all go together.
