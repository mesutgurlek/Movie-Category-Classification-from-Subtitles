1
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:01,099
- H¡, Eddie.
- Hiya, Scotty.

2
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:04,763
- Cold enough for you?
- Well, I'm only faintly alive. It's 25 below.

3
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,341
- You know everybody?
- We haven't met.

4
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,499
- McPherson.
- Hi.

5
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:11,238
Ned Scott, Capt. Hendry.
Scotty just got in today.

6
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:12,540
Hi, care to join us?

7
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,377
Wait till I count my fingers.
I may have lost one.

8
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:20,012
Scotty's a warm-weather man. We met
at Accra. Quite a spot. 105 in the shade...

9
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,455
...and the women hardly wore
anything at all. Very intelligent of them.

10
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:26,595
You just lie there in a hammock
while three of them fan you.

11
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:28,424
- Remember, Scotty?
- I remember.

12
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:32,193
- Oh, boy. When I die I hope I go to Accra.
- I was there.

13
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:33,357
I'm in.

14
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:36,300
- What are you doing here, Mr. Scott?
- Looking for a story.

15
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:37,905
Scotty's a newspaperman.

16
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,735
- How many?
- Three.

17
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,205
- Cards?
- I'll play these.

18
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,813
- Caught from ambush.
- Check.

19
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,410
- Well, I'll bet a buck.
- And I'll fold.

20
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,611
Call.

21
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:54,313
- Pair of queens.
- I thought so. Aces.

22
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:58,187
You ought to know better than to try
fooling our captain. Only dames can do that.

23
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,352
- Lt. Dykes, I promise...
- Slip of the tongue.

24
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,990
- What do you hear from the general?
- Fogarty's nursing secrets like a June bride.

25
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,296
I got an idea. A guy in Seattle
knows a whole radar defense story...

26
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,098
...Ioves to talk.
General McLaren.

27
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,004
Tell General Fogarty you want to go
to Seattle, and Pat and I will fly you there.

28
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:15,474
I met General McLaren too.

29
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:19,103
It's warm in Seattle. They got girls
there without fur pants on.

30
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,477
- What about it, captain?
- That could be right.

31
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:24,620
You won't be able to shoo our captain
southward with his heart...

32
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,914
...wrapped around the North Pole.
- That'll do.

33
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,116
- What's going on up there?
- Scientists are holding a convention.

34
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,023
- Looking for polar bear tails.
- Ever hear of Dr. Carrington?

35
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:35,027
- The fellow who was at Bikini?
- The same.

36
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:38,031
They're holding about 2000 miles
north of here. A whole bunch.

37
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,965
- Botanists, physicists, electronic...
- Including a pin-up girl.

38
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,832
- Very interesting type too.
- Very.

39
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,201
Capt. Hendry can give
you any data on her.

40
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,105
- You probably shouldn't have said that.
- Well, after I read...

41
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:49,506
Now look!

42
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:53,705
Someday I hope to have a navigator and a
copilot who are at least dry behind the ears.

43
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,783
- Oh, captain.
- You mail-order...

44
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:59,752
Capt. Hendry, report to General Fogarty's
quarters at once please.

45
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:04,125
8:00 at night and the general yelling
for his troops. Sounds like the old days.

46
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,886
- Take my hand. Will you?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:09,463
Captain, if it amounts to anything,
bring me in on it. Will you, please?

48
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,156
Sure.

49
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,132
I gotta get a story someplace.

50
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,828
Come in.

51
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,605
- Close the door.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:30,043
- Good evening, sir.
- Didn't take you long.

53
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,652
Not many places to hide, sir.

54
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:36,315
Just got a queer message from your picnic
party up north, from Dr. Carrington himself.

55
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:39,950
"Believe an airplane unusual type
crashed in our vicinity.

56
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,825
Please send facilities to investigate.
Most urgent."

57
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:45,832
What would you find up there
besides a good-Iooking girl?

58
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:47,970
- I don't know, sir. Any ships missing?
- No.

59
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,105
- No Canadians either.
- Could be Russians.

60
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,833
- They're all over the pole like flies.
- You're going.

61
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,570
Take along a dog team or anything
you might need for rescue.

62
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:57,906
Come in.

63
00:04:58,414 --> 00:04:59,608
Close the door!

64
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:03,047
You suppose the Pentagon
could send us a revolving door?

65
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,813
Could be, sir. We got pith helmets
last week.

66
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:07,889
- Weather report, sir.
- Okay, that's all.

67
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:12,153
If any messages come in from Dr. Carrington,
I want to be notified personally.

68
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,057
- No matter what the time.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,460
Here's your weather.
There's a front moving in...

70
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,896
...but you ought to have time
to get there and back.

71
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,559
- General, that newspaperman, Scott...
- What about him?

72
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,673
- He'd like to go with us.
- It's all right if you maroon him up there.

73
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:27,139
Don't get me wrong
about who gets marooned.

74
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,972
I'd like it if you didn't smash
into the landing ski this time.

75
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,738
That was an unavoidable accident.

76
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,041
Well, look, I'll expect you back
tomorrow night.

77
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:37,744
- Yes, sir. And I'll close the door.
- Just tell me what you find up there.

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,684
No one tells me anything around here.

79
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:56,767
Want some coffee?

80
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,032
- Hey, thanks.
- Here you are, sir.

81
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:10,748
Mr. Scott. Coffee.

82
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,888
- Are we there?
- No, sir. Hot coffee up front, sir.

83
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:20,254
- Lieutenant? Coffee, sir.
- Thank you, stewardess.

84
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:24,224
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

85
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,934
How far are we from camp?

86
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,594
Three hours. We've slowed down.
A little headwind.

87
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,741
A little headwind?
Close to 40 miles.

88
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,400
Our captain has some funny ideas
about the North Pole.

89
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:38,206
He thinks it's a garden spot.
Come and bring the kiddies.

90
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,246
Now look, don't you two guys start.

91
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:45,080
You know, Perry went to the North Pole
once. He retired with a sack full of medals.

92
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,310
Hey, Pat.

93
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,287
We go there every three weeks
just like it was lover's lane.

94
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,326
Mr. Scott, some people
seem to think... Wait a minute.

95
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:57,489
Hello, Air Force 191 from
Polar Expedition 6. Can you read me?

96
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,534
Air Force 191. Hear you fine, Tex.
Go ahead.

97
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:03,399
- What's your position?
- Three hours out.

98
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:07,339
Captain, switch over to your radio compass.
Check it against your magnetic heading.

99
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:09,639
What's on your mind, Tex?

100
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:13,213
We've got some disturbance up here.
It's whacking away at everything.

101
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:16,681
- What do you figure it's from?
- Don't know. We noticed it last night.

102
00:07:16,886 --> 00:07:20,083
- Six to eight degrees difference.
- We're quite a bit off here, Tex.

103
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,451
You better home in on me.
I'll leave the key open.

104
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,958
- Or would you rather have me sing to you?
- Leave the key open.

105
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,620
I was afraid you'd say that.

106
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:48,641
Hey, the taxpayers ought to see this.

107
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,334
Hello, doctor, professor.

108
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:20,907
- Still the same game?
- Yes.

109
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,408
Hello, boys.

110
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:26,878
- Doctor, professor. Here's your mail.
- You're just in time for lunch.

111
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,842
- Ken, I bet you forgot my hairpins.
- Don't tell me I'm nearly at the North Pole.

112
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,614
- Looks more like my Kentucky home.
- Mr. Scott, Mrs. Chapman.

113
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:36,223
- A pleasure, Mrs. Chapman.
- Hi, nice to see you.

114
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:38,587
- Dr. Chapman, Mr. Scott.
- Dr. Chapman.

115
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,457
- Scotty's a newspaperman.
- You've come at an opportune time.

116
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,533
I happened to be in Anchorage when your
message came. I hope you have a good story.

117
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:47,931
- No more than you know already.
- Nothing more at all?

118
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:51,232
Just discussions as to what it might be.
We all have different ideas.

119
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,841
- There's been arguments about it.
- Where's Dr. Carrington?

120
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,307
- In the lab.
- See you later.

121
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:57,309
Does that mean you've seen the plane?

122
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,811
- Coffee, captain?
- No, thanks.

123
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,710
Our captain seems in a hurry, Lee.

124
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:02,783
- Where are you two going?
- We're with you.

125
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:06,682
- We want to tell her she treated you badly.
- Lf you don't want us to go...

126
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,825
- I'm gonna get even with you two someday.
- We got up in there.

127
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,193
Come in.

128
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,767
Hi, Pat. Welcome to our igloo.
How was your...?

129
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,099
Well...

130
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:32,403
- How was your trip?
- All right. About usual.

131
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,075
Well, that's fine.

132
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,346
- I think Dr. Carrington wants to see you.
- He can wait. I wanna talk to you.

133
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,546
- What about?
- That was a dirty trick you played.

134
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,817
- Don't lose your temper.
- Why did you do it? Just tell me why.

135
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,223
Well, your legs aren't very pretty.

136
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,421
You didn't have to write a note
and put it on my chest.

137
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:50,587
I'm sorry, Pat...

138
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,929
Six people read it before I woke up.
Now the whole Air Force knows.

139
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,333
- Not so loud. They'll hear.
- They already heard.

140
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,473
The only place it hasn't been
is on a billboard.

141
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:02,236
I didn't know you had
such a nasty temper.

142
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,936
Now, Pat, just be careful.
Now take it easy.

143
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,877
Now wait a minute.

144
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,615
We had a lot of fun
when you were up here.

145
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,754
Then when you asked me down
to Anchorage, you deliberately fed me...

146
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,117
Tell me, did you really drink
all those drinks?

147
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,691
- You didn't throw any away? Not one?
- No.

148
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,191
Holy cat. I thought I was good.

149
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,354
And another thing, why did you leave?

150
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,522
When I woke up in the morning
you were gone.

151
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,134
I told you I had to take
that cargo plane back here.

152
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:28,964
- You told me?
- Don't you remember?

153
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:30,696
No.

154
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:35,473
Right after dinner. You were telling
me all about a night in San Francisco...

155
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:37,305
Did I tell you that?

156
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,781
What else did I do?

157
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,351
Well, you had moments
of kind of making like an octopus.

158
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,581
- I never saw so many hands in all my life.
- All right. All right.

159
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,452
Look, my only excuse
is that I liked you...

160
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,324
...right away.

161
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:58,558
- So I started wrong. Can't we begin again?
- How would you begin?

162
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:02,102
- Well, I can think of several...
- Never mind.

163
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,499
We don't have time for that now anyway.

164
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:07,335
I know Dr. Carrington's waiting
to see you.

165
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:16,276
- What about this business of starting over?
- We'll talk about that later.

166
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,955
- Hello, captain.
- Hi, professor.

167
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:37,066
- Dr. Carrington, Capt. Hendry is here.
- Yes, I know.

168
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,070
- How do you do, captain?
- Doctor.

169
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,640
Miss Nicholson, would you add
a note to the others?

170
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:42,903
Surely.

171
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,139
November 2, 11:30 a.m.

172
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:52,286
Deviation in sector 19 continues
12 degrees, 20 minutes east.

173
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:56,016
No lessening or wavering
of disturbing element.

174
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,716
That's all.

175
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:01,495
- Captain, can we start now?
- Mind telling me where we're going?

176
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:02,995
48 miles due east from here.

177
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:06,430
Your message said an airplane crashed.
Is that what we're looking for?

178
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:07,660
I don't know, captain.

179
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:09,771
- I think you better explain.
- I'm sorry.

180
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:12,703
Miss Nicholson, would you read
Capt. Hendry my first notes?

181
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,312
I was thinking only of the vagueness
of my information. I dislike being vague.

182
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:19,242
- "November 1 st...
- Yesterday.

183
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:24,443
...6:15 p.m. Sound detectors and
seismographs registered explosion due east.

184
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,647
At 6:18, magnetometer revealed deviation
12 degrees, 20 minutes east."

185
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:32,055
- That deviation has been constant.
- We ran into it before we got here.

186
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,197
"Such deviation possible only
if a disturbing force equivalent...

187
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:38,765
...to 20,000 tons of steel or iron ore...
- 20,000 tons?

188
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:41,835
...had become part of the earth
at about a 50-mile radius."

189
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:44,598
You're getting a bit beyond me,
but it sounds like a meteor.

190
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,537
Yes, very much. Except for one thing.

191
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,338
- Will, show it to Capt. Hendry.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:53,573
We have some special telescopic cameras.

193
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,775
On the appearance of radioactivity,
a Geiger counter trips the release...

194
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,613
...and the cameras function.

195
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:02,279
They were working last evening.
This is the result.

196
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:08,652
This first picture was taken
three minutes before the explosion...

197
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:09,923
...or 6:12.

198
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,000
You can see the small dot
below there in the corner.

199
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,133
On the next picture, one minute later,
that dot is moving from west to east...

200
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:21,071
...fast enough to form a streak.
- What shutter speed is it?

201
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:24,303
- 1000th of a second.
- Moving pretty fast. Wasn't it?

202
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:28,380
Here, at 6:14, it's moving upward.

203
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:33,687
6:15, it drops to the earth
and vanishes.

204
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:38,015
A meteor might move almost horizontal
to the earth but never upward.

205
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,058
- Then it isn't a meteor.
- That's obvious.

206
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:42,094
How'd you find the distance of impact?

207
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:44,164
- By computation...
- Dr. Carrington?

208
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,528
- Ready?
- It's quite simple, captain.

209
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:50,297
We have the time of arrival
of the sound waves and detectors.

210
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,930
And also the arrival time
of the impact waves on the seismograph.

211
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:58,637
By computing the difference, it becomes
obvious they were caused by the object.

212
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:02,113
- The distance from here is 48 miles.
- I'll take your word for it.

213
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:06,311
One thing, doctor. 20,000 tons of steel
is a lot of metal for an airplane.

214
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,582
It is for the sort of airplane
we know, captain.

215
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:13,861
- Yeah, we'd better be going.
- Redding will check every quarter-hour.

216
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,793
- Will you want me, doctor?
- It won't be necessary.

217
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,833
- You come with us, Bill.
- Yes, doctor.

218
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,249
We'll be there pretty soon now, Pat.

219
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:39,348
Bob, get Carrington up here.

220
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,485
Doctor!

221
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:49,026
We're almost 50 miles out, doctor.

222
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,031
With your compass deviation,
how are you navigating, captain?

223
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,465
That peak ahead is practically due east.

224
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:56,434
We got the wind before we left camp.

225
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:59,472
- Very good, captain.
- We should be there about now, Pat.

226
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:04,204
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.

227
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,780
Picking up something
on the Geiger counter, sir.

228
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:11,147
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

229
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:12,684
Look there.

230
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:19,892
- Pat, the compass is in a spin.
- Geiger's up to the top.

231
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,824
Yeah, that's it, all right.

232
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,236
- You see someplace to set down?
- Looked smooth about a half a mile back.

233
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,841
We'll take a look. Bob!
Get them ready. It might be rough.

234
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:35,271
Right, sir.

235
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,072
Fasten your seat belts, gentlemen.
We're gonna land.

236
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,578
Sit down and hold on back there.

237
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,988
All set for landing, sir.

238
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,590
Half flaps.

239
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:59,061
- Full rich.
- Full rich.

240
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:00,258
Half flaps.

241
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:51,514
There we are.

242
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:54,349
Holy cat! What a weird-Iooking thing.

243
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:57,117
Let me get a picture
before you track up the whole place.

244
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:58,919
This Geiger counter is going crazy.

245
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:02,427
Something's melted that surface crust.
It's frozen over again into clear ice.

246
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:05,965
The bottle shape apparently was caused
by the craft first making contact...

247
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,126
...with the earth out
at the neck of the bottle...

248
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:11,795
...sliding toward us and forming
that larger area as it came to rest.

249
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:16,638
With the engines generating enough heat
to melt that path through the crust...

250
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,246
...then sink beneath the surface.
- What could melt that much ice?

251
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,279
Let's go down and see. Barnes.

252
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,479
Take the dogs over on that side.

253
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:38,258
Dr. Chapman, could an airplane
melt that much ice?

254
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:41,994
One of our own jets generates enough heat
to warm a 50-story office building.

255
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:57,808
- It's part of an airfoil. Probably a stabilizer.
- It's an airplane, all right.

256
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:00,614
- Can you tell what metal that is?
- I'll need some tools.

257
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:03,087
Barnes, bring some tools!

258
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:10,689
Hey, it's down pretty deep over here.
I can't see anything but a dark mass.

259
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:11,992
It's deeper over here.

260
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:16,467
Captain, may I suggest that we spread out
and try to determine the size and shape.

261
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:20,938
Right. Spread out, everybody! We're gonna
try to figure out the shape of this thing.

262
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,041
Here's the tools, sir.

263
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:39,557
Holy cat!

264
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:41,127
Hey...

265
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:43,995
It's almost...

266
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,363
Yeah. Almost a perfect...

267
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:50,596
It is. It's round.

268
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:54,899
- We finally got one.
- We found a flying saucer!

269
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,409
Can anybody see anything
through the ice?

270
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,843
- Only an outline.
- Nothing but a dark shape.

271
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:02,313
Seems perfectly smooth.
No doors or windows.

272
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:05,817
- I can't see any engine.
- I doubt we find anything we call an engine.

273
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:09,719
Dr. Carrington, this isn't
any metal I know.

274
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,723
Probably some new alloy.

275
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:15,159
- Get some filings for analysis.
- Right.

276
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:19,500
Captain, I don't think we have a chance
of chopping through the ice with axes.

277
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,694
I know. We think so too.
We'll try to melt it out with thermite bombs.

278
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:25,032
- Oh, excellent.
- Where do you figure it's from?

279
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,401
I don't know, Mr. Scott.

280
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,236
- Well, from this planet?
- I doubt it.

281
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,140
- Well, do you...?
- The answers will be much easier...

282
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,043
...after we've examined the interior
of the aircraft...

283
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:38,152
...and its occupants, if there are any.
- Occupants? Why, I never...

284
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,311
What a story!
Where's the radio? Hey, Barnes!

285
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,083
- Hold it. No private messages.
- What do you mean private?

286
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,250
- I'm sending it to the whole world.
- This is Air Force information.

287
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,362
We'll have to wait for authority
to let you file it.

288
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,899
You got your authority in the Constitution!
It's called freedom of the press.

289
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:55,002
- I'm sending a story!
- Not from our ship.

290
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,468
- Where do you want the bombs?
- One by the stabilizer...

291
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:00,039
...another over in the far side
if we need it.

292
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:03,700
It's the biggest story since the parting
of the Red Sea. You can't hide it!

293
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,439
- Think what it means to the world.
- I don't work for the world.

294
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:08,276
- Look...
- No, Scott. I'll take that.

295
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,681
- Here's the detonator.
- Get back to the ship and call the camp.

296
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:17,155
Have Tex radio we've found a flying saucer
in the ice. We're gonna try to get it out.

297
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:19,886
- What about me?
- Also, ask if Scott can send his story.

298
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:23,463
- That's all I can do.
- You're gonna grow up to be another Fogarty.

299
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:25,497
- Where we gonna touch this off?
- Over there.

300
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,158
Have you looked to the west?
That front's moving fast...

301
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:32,398
...and the temperature's dropping too.
- We don't have more than an hour.

302
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:35,709
- Where do you put those, Bob?
- Right on the surface.

303
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,902
- Tell Stone. Will you, sir?
- Right.

304
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,947
Say, what will this thermite do?

305
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:44,142
This is S-O-P, standard operating
procedure for removing ice.

306
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,049
Hook this wire up, will you, lieutenant?
It just melts it.

307
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,087
How fast does it work?

308
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:51,817
It'll uncover the whole saucer
in 30 seconds.

309
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,928
- All ready over here!
- Be right with you!

310
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:59,329
Better clear the field! Over near the dog
sled! Gonna get pretty hot here in a minute.

311
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,449
Hook her up. We'll try the stabilizer
first. Use the other one if we need it.

312
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:20,678
A few minutes from now
we may have the key to the stars.

313
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,950
A million years of history
are waiting for us in that ice.

314
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:26,492
- Say when. I wanna get a picture.
- All ready, sir.

315
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:29,255
- Ready here.
- Let her go, Bob.

316
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:41,403
- Okay, all clear.
- Wait a minute, everybody. Stay back.

317
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:46,405
- It's burning under the ice.
- Careful, captain.

318
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,176
What's happening?

319
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:52,820
Tell me, doctor.

320
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,220
Get down on the ground, everybody!

321
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,600
Everybody all right?

322
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:19,042
That last explosion was the engine.

323
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:21,580
Sergeant, will you try your Geiger counter?

324
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,480
- Only a trace.
- That's just residual.

325
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,553
It's all gone.

326
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:30,247
Secrets that might have
given us a new science.

327
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:32,791
- Gone.
- That's just dandy.

328
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:34,758
Standard operating procedure.

329
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,830
- I should've thought...
- You sure should.

330
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:39,430
Greatest discovery in history up in flames.

331
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:42,035
Turning a new civilization
into a 4th of July piece.

332
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:48,076
Captain, I'm getting something
over here.

333
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:51,974
- Probably a fragment from the saucer.
- We may salvage something yet.

334
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,945
Hold it, everybody.
I'm getting a reaction.

335
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:03,023
Let me get a reading.

336
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,655
Getting warm.

337
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:09,393
Hotter now.

338
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:19,106
Here's where it's coming from.

339
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,641
- What is it?
- Looks like a man.

340
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:27,213
It's got legs and a head.
I can see them.

341
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,816
Yeah! He must be over 8 feet long.

342
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:32,146
- Somebody got out of that saucer.
- Or was thrown out.

343
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,221
And frozen fast before he could get clear.

344
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,858
- Man from Mars.
- How do you propose getting him out?

345
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,584
- I don't know.
- Use more thermite.

346
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:42,059
Whatever's quickest.
We don't have much time.

347
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,791
Here's axes. You could chop around
and put the block on the plane.

348
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,025
- I agree.
- Get started.

349
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:50,535
- Give me room.
- Bob, clear the sled and bring it over here.

350
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,730
Eddie, get the ship warmed up.

351
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,672
And be ready to get out
of here in a hurry.

352
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,299
- Pat, I think we made a mistake.
- What do you mean?

353
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:27,964
You ever read this? "Department
of Defense, Office of Public Information.

354
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:31,306
Washington, D.C.
December 27, 1949.

355
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:34,937
Bulletin 629-49 regarding item 6700...

356
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,279
...extract 75,131.

357
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,219
The Air Force has discontinued investigating
and evaluating reported flying saucers...

358
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,756
...on the basis that there
is no evidence."

359
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:48,123
Probably make you a general
for destroying evidence that they're wrong.

360
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,356
"The Air Force said that all evidence
indicates that the reports...

361
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:53,763
...of unidentified flying objects
are the result of:

362
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:57,302
One: Misinterpretation of various
conventional objects."

363
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,303
Didn't look very conventional to me.

364
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,601
"Second: A mild form
of mass hysteria."

365
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:06,236
That'd be when General Fogarty got
to shaking hands with that thing in the ice.

366
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,883
What are the other reasons?

367
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,518
"Third: That they're jokes."

368
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,984
What did you say the number
of that bulletin was?

369
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:20,355
"629-49, item 6700,
extract 75,131."

370
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,957
Oh. Oh, that one.

371
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:15,348
- Get on that rope, professor.
- I need a hand over here.

372
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,678
Watch your feet.

373
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,517
Let me tie another rope
to go down.

374
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,420
- Hold it!
- Hold it back now.

375
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,922
Hold it!

376
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:29,723
Pull, back there!

377
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:35,226
Keep tight on those ropes!

378
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,700
- Easy.
- Here we go.

379
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,533
- Keep it going.
- Keep it going!

380
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:42,507
Whoa! Take it easy.

381
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:47,073
Can't see through the ice too good.

382
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,775
Good enough to know that where he came
from, they don't breed them for beauty.

383
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,386
Well, what do we do now, defrost him?

384
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:55,750
This ice will melt pretty soon.

385
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,325
- Can you control the heat in this room?
- No, captain. This is our storeroom.

386
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:01,223
The temperature's constant here.

387
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,864
We don't need to melt it.
We can chip it away.

388
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:07,229
We're not going to melt it
or chip it. Eddie, open that window.

389
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:10,064
- We're not allowed to examine it?
- I mean just that.

390
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,502
- This is stupid.
- We're scientists.

391
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:16,166
- And Dr. Carrington's in charge here.
- Hey, Pat, these windows don't open.

392
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:19,472
It's practically certain we'll be asked
by your superiors to study it.

393
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:22,548
- Probably, but we can't permit it now.
- We don't need permission...

394
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:25,242
- Eddie, break that window.
- All right.

395
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:30,449
Sorry. We already pulled one boner
out in the ice.

396
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,252
We may not know anything about this...

397
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:36,158
...but until I receive instructions from my
superior officer, we'll have to mark time.

398
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:39,232
- You have no authority...
- lf you want to talk, do it in the corridor.

399
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:43,861
- It's gonna get cold in here.
- At last a sensible suggestion, captain.

400
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,400
- Mac.
- Yeah?

401
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:49,134
Please stay here.
And take four-hour shifts.

402
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,335
- It's hands off for everyone.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:53,640
- Gonna be warm enough?
- Lf not, you'll hear me squawk.

404
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,613
- Bob will bring you dinner.
- I could use something to read.

405
00:28:56,785 --> 00:29:02,087
- A nice, quiet horror story.
- Might be kind of tame for you, sir.

406
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,227
- Well, gentlemen?
- Capt. Hendry...

407
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,192
- Excuse me, doctor. May I?
- Certainly.

408
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:12,663
In relation to removing the body
from the ice, I'd like to point out...

409
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,668
...there are organisms that survive
after death, but cold can destroy them.

410
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,362
- In view of that...
- I don't know...

411
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,705
But these organisms may be dangerous. They
may be carrying germs from another planet.

412
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:26,005
- Germs we couldn't cope with medically.
- Thank you.

413
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,445
- I can't agree with you, Dr. Chapman.
- I don't either.

414
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:31,676
Here's another: We don't know
what effect the air of our Earth...

415
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:36,051
...may have on this creature's remains.
- Sort of go up in smoke, like the saucer?

416
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:37,953
- Nonsense.
- Isn't that far-fetched?

417
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,822
- So is a man from Mars.
- We're getting nowhere.

418
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:44,931
I suggest that Capt. Hendry communicate
with his superior at once.

419
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:47,897
I'm getting senile.
We should have done that first thing.

420
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:53,096
I'm surprised, captain, that you didn't try
to reach your general on our way back here.

421
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:54,536
We did. Barnes.

422
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:58,543
I tried through your radio operator.
Couldn't get through. Too much interference.

423
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,080
- I see. My apologies, captain.
- Yes, doctor.

424
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:05,180
- Hi, captain.
- Hi, Tex.

425
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:07,184
You sure stirred up a lot of trouble...

426
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,482
- Did you send out my message?
- Sure did.

427
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:12,353
- Get an answer back?
- This came an hour ago. Can you read it?

428
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:14,654
- No, you'd better.
- "Fogarty to Hendry:

429
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:17,992
Withhold newspaper story
until permission from Air Force HQ."

430
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,260
- There you are, Scotty.
- Fine. Now somebody else will get the story.

431
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:26,396
"Remove aircraft from ice at once. Use
thermite bombs if necessary to melt ice."

432
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:30,670
Oh, that's what I like about the Army.
Smart all the way to the top.

433
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:34,212
- That lets you off the hook for the thermite...
- Take it easy. Go ahead.

434
00:30:34,382 --> 00:30:38,512
"Erect temporary structure to protect aircraft
until my arrival."

435
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:41,849
Here's another one. Came a few minutes ago.
Could only get part of it.

436
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:45,322
- Go ahead.
- "Everything grounded. Can't..." Something.

437
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:48,394
- "Want you..." Something or other...
- That sounds like Fogarty.

438
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:50,690
- Then it got fouled up.
- You're getting nothing?

439
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:53,857
Nothing. Static's knocking
it right out of the air.

440
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:57,095
- What about your stuff?
- Don't know if they're getting it. I doubt it.

441
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,365
I don't believe it.
Even the Pony Express got through.

442
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:01,702
- Well, doctor?
- In view of this new situation...

443
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:04,140
- Doesn't alter the old one.
- We disagree with you.

444
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:07,042
- There's no reason to delay...
- Sorry, gentlemen. That's it.

445
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,547
Tex, I'd like to leave Barnes
to help out all he can.

446
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,708
- Sure.
- Barnes, keep trying to get through.

447
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:13,513
I wanna get a message
to the general.

448
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:17,215
Tell him the aircraft was completely
destroyed by the thermite bomb.

449
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:20,054
- Tell him we found a passenger...
- A fellow from Mars? Where?

450
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:21,388
On ice, buddy.

451
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:24,361
Tell him the body's in ice
and Dr. Carrington wants permission...

452
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,864
...to remove the body
from the ice for examination.

453
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:29,697
We're standing by for instructions
before further action.

454
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:30,929
Yes, sir.

455
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:34,233
- You got anything to add, doctor?
- Yes, one very essential point.

456
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:37,207
That it's vitally important
that the examination be made.

457
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:39,471
- By all means. Yeah.
- Add that, Barnes.

458
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,377
Thank you, captain.
That's all that concerns me.

459
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,018
When you get your answer,
I expect you to let me know.

460
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:46,847
Yes, doctor.

461
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,316
Wait till I interview the doctor
about what he thinks of you.

462
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,860
- Probably be good.
- Lf it isn't, I'll make it good.

463
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,228
Tex, keep trying. Barnes, if he gets through,
ask again about clearing Mr. Scott.

464
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:03,029
Don't try to soft-soap me.
I don't like you any better.

465
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:06,332
- I'll eat with you, Eddie.
- I'll send you some chow.

466
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,905
Captain, I'm gonna check the ship
and tie her down. We'll need our gear.

467
00:32:10,078 --> 00:32:12,444
- This storm may blow for weeks.
- Get the Eskimos to help.

468
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:14,411
They took off
when they saw that ice.

469
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:16,709
They'll need a lot of coaxing
to get them back.

470
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:19,216
If Mr. Scott and the lieutenant
would give me a hand...

471
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:21,014
- I'm a guest.
- I'm an officer.

472
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,214
You can order me around
while carrying the other end.

473
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:25,825
That'll help a lot, sarge.

474
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:30,593
You know, Pat? I thought
we were gonna have a little trouble.

475
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:33,734
- So did I.
- The geniuses were ready to tear you apart.

476
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:36,495
They're like kids drooling over
a new fire engine.

477
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:40,368
Professor Vorhees, come
to the laboratory as soon as possible.

478
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:44,272
- Holding a meeting. Whole thing's weird.
- You know what it reminds me of?

479
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:48,074
The time I was stuck on Beulen Island
with the old 97th bomber group.

480
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:51,343
An Army nurse came ashore
and caused the same disturbance...

481
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,647
...as this guy from Mars has here.
- What happened to the nurse?

482
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:56,915
She liked it there.

483
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,591
- Scotty, what's new?
- What's new? What more do you want?

484
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:06,928
Biggest story ever to hit this planet,
and I run into this human clam.

485
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:09,296
Why are you getting pretty?
You'll never look good to me.

486
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,301
- That's not for you...
- Take it easy.

487
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:15,374
The captain here passes the buck to
General Fogarty, he takes it to Washington.

488
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:17,534
- Who will Truman ask?
- Margaret.

489
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:21,148
- I've got to find a way to get to civilization.
- How, for instance?

490
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:25,183
I don't know. Pogo sticks. Kiddie cars.
Gondolas. Dogsleds.

491
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:29,790
- Hey, Barnes, any word come from Fogarty?
- Plenty. Nothing about you, sir.

492
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:33,791
I think the old man's gone crazy.
Sorry, sir. Shouldn't have said that.

493
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:38,022
- Lf he hollers louder, we won't need a radio.
- What was the gist of the conversation?

494
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:43,466
- There's been a leak, and the newspapers...
- I knew it! Like water through a sieve.

495
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:46,334
Everyone wants information,
Congress, Secretary of State...

496
00:33:46,507 --> 00:33:49,101
...and especially General Fogarty.
He's having a fit.

497
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,302
- Isn't Anchorage picking us up?
- No, sir.

498
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:54,243
We're picking up them
because they have a stronger station.

499
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:58,351
A picture just came to me:
My editor climbing all over his office...

500
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,717
...yelling, stamping his feet.
He'll probably shoot himself by midnight.

501
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,189
- Take it easy, Scotty.
- Just a minute. I'm not sure you're ready.

502
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,794
You may have missed a spot.

503
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,397
Son, would you like
double guard duty tonight?

504
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:13,625
No, sir. I wouldn't.

505
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,166
- Oh, captain.
- Yes, sergeant?

506
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:19,204
- Could I see you for a minute, sir?
- Sure.

507
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,635
What is it, Bob?

508
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:31,751
It's about Lt. McPherson sitting in there
with that thing in the block of ice.

509
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:33,477
Getting nervous?

510
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,317
Well, he wouldn't want me to tell you, sir,
but he's having kittens.

511
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,824
I haven't heard him squawk like this
since Rechenberg.

512
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:40,983
Really?

513
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,098
You see, sir, the ice is clearing up,
and we can see that thing pretty good.

514
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:49,362
It's got crazy hands and no hair,
and the eyes...

515
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:53,371
- They're open and look like they can see.
- Bob, I haven't heard you...

516
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,408
It's got me too, sir,
and I wasn't in there very long.

517
00:34:56,577 --> 00:35:01,605
Besides that, it's pretty cold.
I got the lieutenant an electric blanket.

518
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:04,377
- Captain, I got a suggestion.
- Go ahead.

519
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:07,487
Instead of four-hour shifts,
we could cut them in half...

520
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:11,557
Okay. You tell Barnes to take over
at 2200.

521
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:14,820
You take over at 2400,
and I'll relieve you at 0200.

522
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:18,261
- I think you're right, sir.
- I think you are.

523
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:20,263
Thank you, sir.

524
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,547
- I want to talk to you.
- Sure.

525
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,276
Pat, what's really going on?

526
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:41,888
Nothing. I just can't agree with your pals.
I had to set a guard.

527
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,718
They'd have that thing
up waltzing with them.

528
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,382
No, that isn't what I meant.

529
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,688
What does that boogeyman
in ice really mean?

530
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:50,854
I don't know, Nikki.

531
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:56,060
Well, does it mean that we'll have visitors
from other planets dropping in on us?

532
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,831
Do we have to return the call, or...?
Oh, jeepers.

533
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:02,772
- I know. Yesterday I'd said it was crazy.
- I'd say it's crazy now.

534
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,107
Forget it. Tomorrow it'll all seem different.

535
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,512
I suppose so. I like the way
you handled this whole mess, Pat.

536
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:14,143
I'd just as soon not.
You know, it's funny. I'm glad I was here.

537
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:15,949
I am too.

538
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:17,920
You're much nicer when you're...

539
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,753
When you're not mad.

540
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,988
Sounds promising. How about that
business of beginning over again?

541
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:29,501
Well, I think I'll buy you a drink this time.
I think you've earned it.

542
00:36:30,738 --> 00:36:34,367
- That is, if you want one.
- You can tie my hands if you wanna.

543
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:37,375
- That might not be such a bad idea.
- You mean that?

544
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:40,776
- Well, you suggested it.
- All right. I'll bring a rope.

545
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:55,390
- You want another one, Pat?
- Don't you think you could untie me now?

546
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:57,690
I don't know. What's the matter?

547
00:36:57,865 --> 00:37:02,302
You gals. If a guy asks you to dinner and
buys you a drink and tries to kiss you...

548
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,700
- Why are you laughing?
- You never kissed me.

549
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:06,601
- I haven't tried.
- How do you know?

550
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:10,608
- Oh, stop bringing that up.
- Never mind. You haven't. Maybe if you'd...

551
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:12,746
- Go on with what you were saying.
- What?

552
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:14,609
About the dinner and the drink.

553
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:17,649
Well, if the same man asked you
to have 30,000 dinners...

554
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,719
Then he's not a wolf anymore?
That's fine philosophy.

555
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:25,552
So you really want your hands untied.
Just when everything was nice and peaceful.

556
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:30,493
You know, I'm glad we decided
to start over again. I like it.

557
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:34,666
- I like that too.
- Talk about Japanese tortures.

558
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,895
No, not at all. I think this
was a great idea.

559
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:40,006
Come here.

560
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,037
Well, look at you...

561
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:47,544
...sitting there like a civilized man instead
of grabbing around like a throwback.

562
00:37:47,715 --> 00:37:51,515
If you weren't tied up, I wouldn't dare
have told you how much I liked you.

563
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:56,851
You know, Pat, the trouble with you is that
you don't know anything about women.

564
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,685
What a woman wants is to...

565
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,656
Is to...

566
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:04,257
- How long have you been loose?
- Long enough.

567
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:08,133
It's been a very interesting evening.
Good night, Miss Nicholson.

568
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:13,604
- Pat, if you walk out on me like this...
- I wouldn't go, except I gotta check up.

569
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:22,381
Get a good night's sleep.

570
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,381
I'll see you in the morning.

571
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:28,822
It's the eyes being open that gets you.
Makes you feel so...

572
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:33,120
Hi, Pat. Barnes just got here. Sure glad
I'm not looking at that guy anymore.

573
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:34,693
- All set, Barnes?
- Yes, sir.

574
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:38,992
- Got an electric flying suit and coffee.
- Bob will relieve you at 2400.

575
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,260
- Take it easy.
- Yeah.

576
00:39:23,677 --> 00:39:25,542
That's better.

577
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:25,431
Capt. Hendry! Capt. Hendry!
Capt. Hendry.

578
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:27,437
What's the matter, corporal?

579
00:40:27,608 --> 00:40:31,442
Where's the captain? I've got to tell him
that thing's alive. I saw it.

580
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:34,012
It chased me. It's not dead. It's...

581
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:35,813
Capt. Hendry!

582
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:40,211
That thing's alive, sir.
I saw it. I shot at it. I hit it, I know it.

583
00:40:40,387 --> 00:40:44,551
Nothing happened. It kept coming at me,
making a noise like a cat meowing.

584
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:50,061
If you could have seen those hands and
those eyes! You've got to do something...

585
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,996
Mac, Bob, get some guns.
Now, Barnes, what happened?

586
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,971
I'm sorry, sir. I don't know exactly, but all of
a sudden it was alive and coming at me.

587
00:41:01,142 --> 00:41:04,634
I shot at it and hit it.
Nothing happened, so I ran...

588
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:06,177
- Easy, easy.
- I'm sorry, sir.

589
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:09,908
- Here, captain.
- Take care of him. Will you?

590
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,043
Get back to sleep.

591
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:20,723
Get back with the rest of them.

592
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:40,078
- What could've...?
- Kid said he was alive. I believe him.

593
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,977
I knew it. All the time I was here,
I could feel it.

594
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,450
Here's what did it.
This blanket was on. It's still warm.

595
00:41:52,693 --> 00:41:55,856
- He got out of here, all right.
- Get parkas, boots and a flashlight!

596
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,830
- Listen. They'll tear him to pieces.
- We must save him.

597
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,096
Hold it, doctor. You'll freeze to death
in five minutes. Use your head!

598
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:08,674
- I expect you're right. I was overanxious.
- Look over here, captain!

599
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:17,651
- I think I've got yours.
- May I have one, captain?

600
00:42:17,818 --> 00:42:19,285
Better let us go, doctor.

601
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:25,715
- Doc, can you see anything out there?
- Not much.

602
00:42:28,095 --> 00:42:30,723
- You all set?
- Let her go.

603
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:38,964
Captain, it would help if you, any of you,
would describe what you saw out there.

604
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:42,125
It was too cold to see well,
but the dogs had him down.

605
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:45,761
- He got up with three hanging on his arm.
- He threw one at the rest.

606
00:43:45,939 --> 00:43:48,601
- Two were dead.
- Looked like they'd been through a chopper.

607
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:51,711
- Where did you find the arm?
- Partly under one of them.

608
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,848
Could dogs tear off an arm?

609
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:57,677
This kind of an arm.

610
00:43:57,851 --> 00:44:02,311
- Be careful, doctor. Those barbs are sharp.
- Seems to be a sort of chitinous substance.

611
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:03,513
Speak English.

612
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:06,626
Something between a beetle's back
and a rose thorn.

613
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:08,489
- Thorn-fingered?
- Amazingly strong.

614
00:44:08,662 --> 00:44:10,493
- Very effective as a weapon.
- Very.

615
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:15,033
We don't have to worry about that. An arm
off and out in that cold, he's dead now.

616
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:17,636
Got along fine in a block of ice
for 24 hours.

617
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:21,206
- Pretty spry for a guy with 12 dogs on him.
- And for losing an arm.

618
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,401
- I'm losing my mind.
- Amazing, isn't it?

619
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,706
- Amazingly strong.
- Strange.

620
00:44:27,948 --> 00:44:31,247
- I'm sure of it.
- That is blood on the hand. Isn't it?

621
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,978
- Yes, but not his.
- Probably from one of the dogs.

622
00:44:34,154 --> 00:44:37,988
There's no blood in the arm,
no animal tissue.

623
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:42,857
Dr. Stern, would you have a look at this
under the microscope?

624
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:50,035
No, Mr. Scott. I doubt very much if it
can die, as we understand dying.

625
00:44:50,204 --> 00:44:53,503
- Holy cat!
- Yes.

626
00:44:53,707 --> 00:44:55,197
Well, doctor?

627
00:44:55,376 --> 00:45:01,679
No arterial structure indicated.
No nerve endings visible.

628
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,814
Porous, unconnected cellular growth.

629
00:45:05,986 --> 00:45:11,390
Just a minute, doctor. Sounds like
you're trying to describe a vegetable.

630
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:15,085
- I am. Are you getting all of this?
- Oh, for Pete's sake!

631
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:20,325
You know, doctor, that could be why
Sgt. Barnes' bullets had no effect.

632
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:23,470
- That's right.
- Merely holes drilled into vegetable matter.

633
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,605
This green fluid here.

634
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:28,606
- Like plant sap.
- We'll probably find it has a sugar base.

635
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:31,176
Please, doctor, I've got to ask this.

636
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:36,442
It sounds like, well... Just as though
you're describing some form of super carrot.

637
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:39,583
That's nearly right, Mr. Scott.

638
00:45:39,753 --> 00:45:45,919
This carrot, as you call it, has constructed an
aircraft capable of flying millions of miles...

639
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:48,994
...propelled by a force
as yet unknown to us.

640
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:53,099
- An intellectual carrot. The mind boggles.
- It shouldn't.

641
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:56,600
Imagine how strange it would have seemed
during the Pliocene age...

642
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:03,039
...to forecast that worms, fish, lizards that
crawled over the Earth would evolve into us.

643
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,371
On the planet from which our visitor came...

644
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:09,710
...vegetable life underwent an evolution
similar to that of our own animal life...

645
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:13,114
...which would account
for the superiority of its brain.

646
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:18,156
Its development was not handicapped
by emotional or sexual factors.

647
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:21,260
Dr. Carrington, you won the Nobel Prize.

648
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:24,920
You've received every kind of kudos
a scientist can attain.

649
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:28,829
If you were for sale, I could get a million
bucks for you from any foreign government.

650
00:46:29,002 --> 00:46:33,132
I'm not, therefore, gonna stick my neck out
and say you're stuffed full...

651
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:37,801
...of wild blueberry muffins. But I promise
you, my readers are gonna think so.

652
00:46:37,978 --> 00:46:43,143
Not for long, Mr. Scott. Not if they know
anything about the flora of their own planet.

653
00:46:43,317 --> 00:46:47,048
You mean there are vegetables
right here on Earth that can think?

654
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:51,681
A certain kind of thinking, yes.
You ever hear of the telegraph vine?

655
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:53,622
- Not recently.
- Or the...

656
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:57,225
- Is it the acanthus century plant, Dr. Stern?
- Yes.

657
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,297
Go ahead, doctor. That's your field.

658
00:46:59,466 --> 00:47:05,029
Well, the century plant catches mice,
bats, squirrels, any small mammals.

659
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:09,471
Uses a sweet syrup as bait,
then holds onto its catch and feeds on it.

660
00:47:09,643 --> 00:47:11,873
What's the telegraph vine?

661
00:47:12,045 --> 00:47:16,106
The vine, research has proven, can signal
to other vines of the same species...

662
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:19,218
...vines 20 to 100 miles away.

663
00:47:19,386 --> 00:47:22,844
Intelligence in plants and vegetables
is an old story, Mr. Scott.

664
00:47:23,023 --> 00:47:26,151
Older even than the animal arrogance
that has overlooked it.

665
00:47:26,326 --> 00:47:28,021
- That's one for Ripley.
- Look here.

666
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:32,791
I took this from under the soft tissue
in the palm of the hand.

667
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,100
- A seedpod.
- Seedpod?

668
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:40,832
Yes. The neat and unconfused
reproductive technique of vegetation.

669
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:44,171
No pain or pleasure as we know it.

670
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:46,369
No emotions...

671
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:47,878
...no heart.

672
00:47:48,048 --> 00:47:52,747
Our superior. Our superior in every way.

673
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:55,350
Gentlemen, do you realize
what we've found?

674
00:47:55,522 --> 00:48:00,619
A being from another world as different
from us as one pole from the other.

675
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,524
If we can only communicate with it...

676
00:48:03,697 --> 00:48:08,532
...we can learn secrets that have been
hidden from mankind since the beginning...

677
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,880
Holy cat. It's moving.

678
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:25,314
- Miss Nicholson.
- Yes, doctor?

679
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:29,512
At 12:10 a.m., the hand became alive.

680
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:36,452
The temperature of the forearm
showed a 20-degree rise.

681
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:40,031
Because of this rise in temperature,
I believe it was able to ingest...

682
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,964
...the canine blood with which
it was covered. I believe...

683
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:47,766
You mean...
You mean it lives on blood.

684
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:51,777
- This is the best we could find.
- This should work.

685
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:54,971
- Where are you going?
- To find our visitor, if we can.

686
00:48:55,148 --> 00:48:56,877
One moment, captain!

687
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:00,912
Check the storeroom again.
Bolt any outside doors.

688
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:03,488
Captain, when you find
what you're looking for...

689
00:49:03,657 --> 00:49:05,750
...remember it's a stranger
in a strange land.

690
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:08,417
The only crimes were those
committed against it.

691
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:12,998
It woke from a block of ice, was attacked
by dogs and shot by a frightened man.

692
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:19,105
- All I want is to communicate with it.
- Fine, provided it's locked up.

693
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:23,402
If we catch him, let me take his picture
before somebody makes a salad of him.

694
00:49:23,577 --> 00:49:25,943
Sure, Scotty.

695
00:49:28,782 --> 00:49:32,081
- Bob, get up on there.
- What's up? Looks like a lynching party.

696
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,345
- Have any visitors?
- Not a soul.

697
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:39,151
I got part of a message from the general.
He said to wait on Mr. Scott's story.

698
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:41,920
What's the difference?
Nothing's going out anyway.

699
00:49:42,095 --> 00:49:44,620
- What are you looking for?
- Couldn't come in here.

700
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:46,231
- Who?
- The man from Mars.

701
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,992
You mean he's alive and loose?

702
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:51,569
Keep your door locked. Use your axe
if you have to. Gun's no good.

703
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,536
What do you mean the gun's no good?
Now, look...

704
00:49:57,644 --> 00:49:59,441
Eddie.

705
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:03,449
Hold it, captain.

706
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:29,006
- There's something in here, all right.
- You're a little off base.

707
00:50:29,176 --> 00:50:32,373
That's the mineralogy lab.
Radioactive isotopes are in there.

708
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:36,277
Your Geiger's reacting to a roomful
of uranium ore samples.

709
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,281
Yeah.

710
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:52,493
- This door's locked.
- Dr. Stern has the key.

711
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,600
- Oh, yes.
- What's in here?

712
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:58,226
The greenhouse. The Eskimos have
a weakness for our strawberries.

713
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:02,068
- Strawberries at the North Pole.
- Excuse me.

714
00:51:07,114 --> 00:51:08,979
Mac. Bob.

715
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:11,508
Look under these tables.

716
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,353
Bob, check that outside door.

717
00:51:24,898 --> 00:51:26,695
- Door's locked, sir.
- Nothing up here.

718
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,300
We're still batting zero.

719
00:51:31,104 --> 00:51:32,935
- Well, doctor?
- Captain, l...

720
00:51:33,106 --> 00:51:36,041
- Nothing up that other corridor.
- Any suggestions, doctor?

721
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:39,007
- He's obviously not inside.
- We'll start looking outside...

722
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,113
- Close the door, please.
- Never mind.

723
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:45,775
Captain, half an hour outside now is all
we can stand. We'd better do it in relay.

724
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:50,514
- You're right, Dr. Chapman. We'll work out...
- Would you close the door, please?

725
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,885
We have to tell General Fogarty
what happened.

726
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:54,686
We're liable to become famous.

727
00:51:54,861 --> 00:52:00,766
So few people can boast they've lost a flying
saucer and a man from Mars all in one day.

728
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:05,064
Wonder what they'd have done to Columbus
if he'd discovered America, then mislaid it.

729
00:52:05,238 --> 00:52:07,035
Bunch of butterfingers.

730
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,073
Gentlemen, I just happened to notice...

731
00:52:10,243 --> 00:52:12,837
Look at these moles.

732
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,281
They're wilted.
The only thing that could...

733
00:52:20,453 --> 00:52:23,251
A blast of icy air
if that rear door was opened.

734
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,618
- Have a look at that lock, professor.
- Yes.

735
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:30,593
- 10 or 15 seconds of exposure would do it.
- Exactly.

736
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:33,391
What would that lead you to?

737
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,258
That it may have been...

738
00:52:36,436 --> 00:52:40,099
- In here.
- Without a doubt.

739
00:52:40,273 --> 00:52:44,141
Dr. Carrington, you were right.
The lock's been forced back into position.

740
00:52:44,311 --> 00:52:48,907
The key's gone. Someone has entered
and gone and locked the door from...

741
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,051
- From the outside.
- Look. See how it glistens in the light?

742
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:54,483
It's a smear of...

743
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:58,784
- Plant sap. From the wounded arm?
- You don't suppose...?

744
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:01,120
Open it, please.

745
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:15,536
- One of the sled dogs.
- Not even cold yet.

746
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:21,745
- Doctor, doesn't it seem kind of...?
- Shrunken. Is there any blood in there?

747
00:53:21,915 --> 00:53:23,678
- None.
- No blood.

748
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,943
- No blood?
- Its blood has been drained.

749
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,610
Everything falls right into line.

750
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:34,055
What could be more natural for such a being
than seeking out the only open earth nearby?

751
00:53:34,227 --> 00:53:38,721
It came here for refuge, heard us and ran.

752
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:41,993
- It's been here. It will come back again.
- We better tell...

753
00:53:42,168 --> 00:53:45,626
I don't agree. It's far better
if science rather than the Army...

754
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:50,538
- Are you sure this is the best thing to do?
- I'm sure we can communicate with it.

755
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:55,670
It's wiser than we are. It's our only chance
to talk to it, to learn so many things.

756
00:53:55,849 --> 00:53:59,012
- Dr. Carrington is right.
- Surely you understand that, Stern.

757
00:53:59,185 --> 00:54:02,177
Will you two stand guard
here with me tonight?

758
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:03,822
- Surely, doctor.
- All right.

759
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,289
Stern, tell Dr. Auerbach and Dr. Olson
what we've found.

760
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,157
Ask them to come back
and relieve us in the morning.

761
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:15,367
And tell them, please,
to confide in no one.

762
00:54:30,884 --> 00:54:34,513
- Any luck, captain?
- Lee, you better get some more coffee ready.

763
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,680
- Find anything, captain?
- Not a sign.

764
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,485
- Barnes flushed a polar bear.
- Sure did.

765
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,891
- Scare you?
- Not after I saw it was only a bear.

766
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:46,589
- Too cold out there for that.
- You didn't find anything.

767
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:49,758
I didn't think you would.
When we lose them, they stay lost.

768
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:54,066
Not that it makes much difference.
Nothing's coming in on the radio.

769
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,040
- Tex, you got something?
- General Fogarty's running a temperature.

770
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,044
This came in clear 10 minutes ago,
then it got fouled up again.

771
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:05,981
"Fogarty to Hendry: Take all precautions to
preserve aircraft carefully until my arrival."

772
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:10,179
Same to same. "Use same precautions
with corpses of any occupants."

773
00:55:10,357 --> 00:55:14,020
Same to same.
"Forward detailed description of aircraft.

774
00:55:14,194 --> 00:55:17,459
Measurements, approximate weight
and so forth. Important."

775
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:21,225
"Fogarty to Hendry: Why haven't
you answered? Want immediate answer."

776
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,770
Same to same. "Radio silence unnecessary.
Reference message Fogarty to Hendry.

777
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:27,839
Acknowledge immediately.

778
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:29,942
Waiting report. Silence confusing."

779
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,941
Same to same. "Acknowledge."

780
00:55:32,112 --> 00:55:34,012
- Same to same...
- Acknowledge at once.

781
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,674
- I gather he wants to hear from me.
- There's nothing for me? I don't believe it.

782
00:55:38,852 --> 00:55:41,082
How can a man get to be
a general without...?

783
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,482
In the greenhouse...

784
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:47,921
See...

785
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:51,963
- Barnes, watch that corridor.
- Bring the first aid kit.

786
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:56,125
- Captain, this is my job.
- Bob, better start warning the rest of camp.

787
00:55:56,302 --> 00:56:00,602
- Does that speaker system work from here?
- Yes. The left switch runs to all rooms.

788
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,470
Attention, everybody in camp.
Bolt your doors.

789
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:07,841
Our visitor has returned and is dangerous.
Stay where you are until notified.

790
00:56:08,014 --> 00:56:09,345
Stay where you are.

791
00:56:16,156 --> 00:56:19,489
- Easy. It'll be all right.
- What happened, doctor?

792
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:22,355
In the greenhouse,
I was working. I couldn't see.

793
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:25,965
Then a blast of cold air,
and I heard Olson scream.

794
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:29,568
- When I turned, the thing struck at me.
- Go on.

795
00:56:29,736 --> 00:56:33,433
I don't remember. My head...
I must have fallen.

796
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,066
When I came to, I saw Olson and Auerbach.
They were...

797
00:56:37,243 --> 00:56:41,407
Give him some more of that. Get those axes.
Go ahead, doctor.

798
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:47,109
They were both hanging from the beams
upside down, dead. Their throats were cut.

799
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:48,948
- I crawled...
- Was it there when you left?

800
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:50,851
I couldn't see.

801
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:55,359
- Here you are, sir.
- Wait, Pat! I want to get a picture.

802
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:07,205
Wait a minute. He could get out
of the greenhouse through the outside door.

803
00:57:07,373 --> 00:57:11,070
- We can get to it through the generator room.
- You two go with him.

804
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:14,577
- You mean go in?
- Seal the door with anything you can find.

805
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:16,681
That's better.

806
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:21,287
- Easy. Give them time to get in there.
- Pat, I want a picture.

807
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:24,617
- You get back with the rest.
- Don't be silly.

808
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:27,089
- It'll cost you a drink.
- I'll buy him a beer.

809
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:35,259
- Ready, Bob?
- No, but go ahead and open it.

810
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:53,144
Get something to prop this door, something
short enough to get under this bolt!

811
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:57,922
- Get your picture, Scotty?
- No. The door wasn't open long enough.

812
00:57:58,091 --> 00:58:00,321
- Want me to open it again?
- No!

813
00:58:00,493 --> 00:58:03,826
- Bring a hammer and some spikes!
- Hit that in, will you?

814
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:08,200
There. That ought to do it.

815
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:12,236
Doctor Chapman, you're sure
there's no other way out? No windows?

816
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,464
- Only the front and back doors.
- The walls solid?

817
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:17,166
- Corrugated iron.
- You don't think that...?

818
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:25,646
You found a dog in there, bled white
by our visitor. Why didn't you report it?

819
00:58:25,818 --> 00:58:29,185
- It wasn't necessary.
- It was necessary to leave friends to die?

820
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:30,947
I posted them as guards...

821
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:35,959
I looked in. They're hanging upside down
like in a slaughterhouse. Wish you'd seen it.

822
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:38,063
- Can't we do something?
- They're dead.

823
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:42,930
Let's see nobody joins them. Doctor, you're
limited to your room, lab and the mess hall.

824
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:46,629
You have no authority of any kind.
No right to assume...

825
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:48,967
You better move along.

826
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,914
We've got the rear door blocked.
If he gets out...

827
00:58:57,083 --> 00:59:00,246
...he'll have to dig through
oil drums and a couple tons of snow.

828
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,414
- Bob, next time raise the sights a little.
- I was too busy to think about that.

829
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:08,527
We're gonna have to set up
a guard here in the corridor.

830
00:59:08,695 --> 00:59:13,394
- Two-hour shifts. We'll need volunteers.
- Count me in, captain.

831
00:59:21,941 --> 00:59:24,136
You sent for us, doctor?

832
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,508
You said you had news for us, doctor.

833
00:59:31,684 --> 00:59:35,450
Yes, yes. I...

834
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,523
Gentlemen, we find ourselves in a battle.

835
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:44,629
I'm not referring to the minor argument
with Capt. Hendry...

836
00:59:44,797 --> 00:59:47,994
...but this creature from a new world.

837
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:51,792
Two of our colleagues have died,
a third is injured.

838
00:59:51,971 --> 00:59:54,565
Those are our losses,
and there may be more.

839
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:57,801
This creature is more powerful
and intelligent than we are.

840
00:59:57,977 --> 01:00:01,140
He regards us as important
only for his nourishment.

841
01:00:01,314 --> 01:00:07,480
He has the same attitude toward us
as we have toward a field of cabbages.

842
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,448
That is our battle.

843
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:16,152
Only science can conquer him.
All other weapons will be powerless, only...

844
01:00:17,463 --> 01:00:19,260
There must...

845
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:24,460
There must be a way. I've been trying to...

846
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:30,007
Sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept.

847
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:32,167
It's difficult...

848
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,112
Difficult to talk.

849
01:00:35,782 --> 01:00:39,718
- Will you read my notes, Miss Nicholson?
- Doctor, you need some rest.

850
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,218
Yes, I know, but...

851
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,715
Please read my notes.

852
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:49,692
"At 9:00 p.m., I placed the seeds taken from
the severed hand of X...

853
01:00:49,862 --> 01:00:51,591
...in four inches of earth.

854
01:00:51,764 --> 01:00:54,426
I saturated the earth...

855
01:00:55,635 --> 01:01:00,038
I saturated the earth with two units
of plasma taken from our blood bank.

856
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:03,539
The condition of the dog found
in the greenhouse indicated blood...

857
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,702
...was a primal factor
in the cultivation of the seeds.

858
01:01:06,879 --> 01:01:09,279
At 2:00 a. M...

859
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:13,885
At 2:00 a.m., the first sprouts
appeared through the soil."

860
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:18,683
- Five hours.
- Yes. I used another two units of plasma.

861
01:01:18,858 --> 01:01:24,023
At 4:00 a.m., the sprouts began
to take on definite form.

862
01:01:24,197 --> 01:01:26,688
I came to the conclu...

863
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:32,364
I see by your faces you don't believe me.

864
01:01:32,538 --> 01:01:37,066
Well, you may judge for yourselves.

865
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,154
Oh, no. It isn't possible.

866
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,561
- It reproduces itself.
- Amazing speed.

867
01:02:00,733 --> 01:02:04,066
This would bear out
Capt. Hendry's impression.

868
01:02:04,237 --> 01:02:07,934
When he saw the creature in the
greenhouse, it had grown a new arm.

869
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:11,975
- This pulsating, doctor?
- As though they were breathing.

870
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:16,309
- Yes. Human plants.
- Superhuman.

871
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:19,610
- All this because of the blood plasma?
- That's correct.

872
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:24,420
Notice these, closer to the source of
the plasma. While these, farther away.

873
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:28,048
- How many units have we?
- Enough, I hope.

874
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,357
Would you care to listen to them,
Professor Wilson?

875
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:34,091
Yes, thank you. I should.

876
01:02:52,452 --> 01:02:54,079
Well?

877
01:02:55,388 --> 01:02:59,381
Almost like the wail
of a newborn child that's hungry.

878
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:02,050
- That's the way I would have described it.
- Doctor?

879
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:05,061
- Yes, Miss Nicholson?
- Would you mind very much if l...?

880
01:03:05,231 --> 01:03:09,668
- Will you be needing me anymore?
- No. Just finish typing my notes.

881
01:03:09,836 --> 01:03:13,704
Return them to me.
Let no one see them.

882
01:03:14,273 --> 01:03:17,174
Doctor, I think you should
get some sleep.

883
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:19,072
There's too much to do.

884
01:03:19,245 --> 01:03:22,942
- Your mind can't work if you're exhausted.
- My mind's still clear.

885
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:27,643
No, it isn't, doctor. You aren't thinking
of what's happening in the greenhouse.

886
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:31,256
He's growing those seeds in there
using blood. Just as you are.

887
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:35,554
You've seen what one creature like that
can do. Just imagine a thousand.

888
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:38,196
- I have imagined it.
- Arthur...

889
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:41,863
...what if that aircraft came
not just to visit the Earth...

890
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:47,370
...but to conquer it? To start growing
some kind of horrible army?

891
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:51,874
- To turn the human race into food for it?
- Many things threaten our world...

892
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:55,309
...new stars, comets shooting...
- But those are theories.

893
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:58,416
- This is an enemy here.
- There are no enemies in science...

894
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:03,112
...only phenomena to study.
We are studying one.

895
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:16,934
Come in.

896
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:25,372
- Hello, Pat.
- Hi. Nikki, I want to ask you something.

897
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:29,572
Has anybody up here been hurt lately?
Anybody shot, stabbed or operated on?

898
01:04:29,749 --> 01:04:33,014
No. That what-is-it in the greenhouse
has been our first diversion.

899
01:04:33,185 --> 01:04:37,849
I brought up 35 units of blood plasma
two months ago. What's become of it?

900
01:04:38,024 --> 01:04:41,585
- Why do you want to know?
- Why are they not giving it to Dr. Stern?

901
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:46,061
They're giving him blood transfusions
instead of plasma. Two live donors.

902
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:49,395
What's Carrington doing with
35 units of blood plasma?

903
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:51,298
I guess...

904
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:56,100
I guess you'd better take a swing at
my chin and have a look at those notes.

905
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:59,040
I should be trying to stop you.

906
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:07,481
So that's what he's been doing.

907
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:11,448
Thanks. Thanks for not stopping me.

908
01:05:12,892 --> 01:05:16,885
Pat, would you remember something?
He's tired.

909
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:21,261
He hasn't slept since you found
that thing. And he's not thinking right.

910
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:24,335
I know him. And he doesn't think
the way we do anyway.

911
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:29,065
But he's found something no one can
understand. Until he can solve it, he'Il...

912
01:05:29,241 --> 01:05:33,200
- You know, like a kid with a new toy...
- Only this toy's liable to bite him.

913
01:05:33,379 --> 01:05:34,710
Thanks again.

914
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:44,646
Where's Dr. Carrington?

915
01:05:44,824 --> 01:05:47,759
I'm sorry. I have no authorization
to give you any...

916
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:50,794
- I'm very busy.
- I know you're busy, doctor.

917
01:05:50,963 --> 01:05:53,454
I understand you've been gardening.
Where are they?

918
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:56,158
- Why?
- This way to the nursery, Pat.

919
01:05:58,337 --> 01:06:01,636
I don't tolerate intrusions
into my laboratory. Don't touch.

920
01:06:01,807 --> 01:06:04,776
This is what your colleagues
are doing in the greenhouse.

921
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:07,879
- This is an improvement.
- What happened was not my fault.

922
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,845
We've read your notes.
You should have consulted us.

923
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:13,781
I have the help I need.
Your opinion has not been asked.

924
01:06:13,953 --> 01:06:18,253
It has by Capt. Hendry. And I've given
it to him. I'll repeat it for you.

925
01:06:18,424 --> 01:06:21,154
We're facing something
unpredictably dangerous.

926
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:24,694
The creature in the greenhouse
is obviously multiplying itself.

927
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:26,957
We have no way of finding out
how much.

928
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:29,897
It will need more blood
and will try to obtain what it needs.

929
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,630
- It's imprisoned and harmless.
- How can you be sure of our safety?

930
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:35,433
Or the safety of the world?

931
01:06:35,608 --> 01:06:40,204
Think of 1000 such creatures. 10,000. It
must be destroyed, this progeny with it.

932
01:06:40,379 --> 01:06:42,108
- No.
- We can burn these.

933
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:45,045
- What about that thing in the greenhouse?
- You're like frightened boys.

934
01:06:45,217 --> 01:06:49,347
- You're right. I am frightened.
- Any destruction would be an outrage...

935
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:51,513
...a betrayal of science.
- It may be.

936
01:06:51,691 --> 01:06:54,922
- But I'll sleep better if we get rid of it.
- Captain, Barnes finally...

937
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,755
...got a message through.
Here's the answer.

938
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,590
- Go ahead.
- "Fogarty to Hendry:

939
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:04,293
Carrington informs me Martian alive.
Keep it alive and protect it against injury.

940
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:08,133
Under no circumstances take action
against it until my arrival."

941
01:07:08,307 --> 01:07:13,006
You have your orders, Capt. Hendry.
I consider them sane and intelligent.

942
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:16,171
- But, Tex, what about me?
- Not a thing, Scotty.

943
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:20,818
- What do we do, Pat?
- Try changing the Army's mind.

944
01:07:30,996 --> 01:07:35,330
Hey! Hey, it's me, Eddie!

945
01:07:39,405 --> 01:07:42,203
- What are you doing here?
- We can't take it out there.

946
01:07:42,374 --> 01:07:44,842
Drop the idea of guarding
from the outside.

947
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:47,171
The wind's blowing so hard
you can't see.

948
01:07:47,346 --> 01:07:49,473
It can go through walls
as easy as doors.

949
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:52,981
- How could it get through iron walls?
- Use a can opener.

950
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:57,521
- We're dropping the outside guard.
- Put that hand in some ice water.

951
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,420
- Who's out in the corridor?
- Stone and Wilson, sir.

952
01:08:00,593 --> 01:08:04,427
Barnes, tell them they're the only ones
on guard. Tell them to watch it.

953
01:08:07,633 --> 01:08:10,397
- Tex?
- Here I am.

954
01:08:10,569 --> 01:08:13,333
You won't be long.
We're dropping the outside guard.

955
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,770
Come join the rest of them
in the mess hall.

956
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:20,002
I'll be all right. I've got the door braced,
and there's no outside windows.

957
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,670
All right. If you want to be brave.

958
01:08:23,883 --> 01:08:26,784
- Well.
- Pat, what are we gonna do?

959
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:31,389
Anybody around here
want some coffee?

960
01:08:31,557 --> 01:08:33,184
No, but you can come in.

961
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,920
That's the reason I brought it.
I was hoping you might ask me in.

962
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:40,797
- Who wants some?
- I could use a half.

963
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:44,763
- What were you saying, Scotty?
- I was wondering... That's enough. Thanks.

964
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:50,637
What happens if our boyfriend gets Ionely
and strolls around and ends up in here?

965
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:53,108
- I've been figuring that.
- Nothing hurts it.

966
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,476
- What do you do with a vegetable?
- Boil it.

967
01:08:56,649 --> 01:09:01,814
- What'd you say?
- Boil it. Stew it. Bake it. Fry it.

968
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:04,217
- That makes sense.
- Cold doesn't bother it.

969
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,484
Maybe Dr. Carrington will ask it
to crawl into a boiler.

970
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:11,426
- Maybe you could borrow a flamethrower.
- Captain, I got a crazy idea.

971
01:09:11,597 --> 01:09:14,065
We got lots of kerosene
and we could...

972
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:23,640
- Point three. Point four.
- Here's where we start cooking.

973
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:26,869
Point five. Point six.

974
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:30,147
That thing's out of the greenhouse.
Stay together.

975
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:34,343
Point nine. What about throwing
kerosene on it and setting it on fire?

976
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,181
- We can try.
- Here's a full can.

977
01:09:36,355 --> 01:09:38,880
I'll take it. We'll need
something to put it in.

978
01:09:39,058 --> 01:09:40,992
- Here's a pail.
- Here's another.

979
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,060
- One point two.
- We need one more.

980
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:45,459
- Pat, this one will work all right.
- Good.

981
01:09:45,631 --> 01:09:47,496
Watch that cigarette, lieutenant.

982
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:49,930
How we gonna set it on fire,
rub sticks together?

983
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,195
- There's a Veri pistol in my bag.
- I'll get it.

984
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:56,068
If it comes in, you wet it down.
Mac, touch it off. And don't miss.

985
01:09:56,242 --> 01:09:58,676
- You be ready if it needs more.
- You're right.

986
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:00,675
- Shut up.
- One point three now.

987
01:10:00,846 --> 01:10:04,282
- You know how to shoot that?
- I saw Gary Cooper in Sergeant York.

988
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,181
- One point four.
- Come here. Get in the corner.

989
01:10:08,354 --> 01:10:10,822
Hold this in front of you.
Stay by the light switch.

990
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:14,426
One point five. One point six.

991
01:10:15,027 --> 01:10:17,621
- What was that?
- It sounded like a window.

992
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:20,057
- One point eight.
- Turn off those lights.

993
01:10:20,232 --> 01:10:23,599
One point nine.
The needle's hit the top.

994
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,400
- Put the fire out!
- I am!

995
01:10:56,568 --> 01:10:58,559
Watch it, captain!

996
01:11:03,442 --> 01:11:06,434
- Block that window!
- Hey, Scotty!

997
01:11:20,759 --> 01:11:24,195
- This will make your hand feel better.
- Thank you.

998
01:11:27,066 --> 01:11:29,626
- This ought to be enough kerosene.
- Get it ready.

999
01:11:29,802 --> 01:11:31,599
- How's it coming, Barnes?
- It'll be okay.

1000
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:35,934
What makes me mad is he didn't do it.
I busted it falling over the bunk.

1001
01:11:36,108 --> 01:11:38,303
Listen, we want you all to stay here.

1002
01:11:38,477 --> 01:11:41,503
We found a way to fight this thing,
but burned out a room.

1003
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:45,810
- It's not hurt much, from the way it took off.
- About as much effect as a hot foot.

1004
01:11:45,985 --> 01:11:47,316
It's sure to come back.

1005
01:11:47,486 --> 01:11:51,183
We don't want to burn the whole place.
So we're going after it.

1006
01:11:51,357 --> 01:11:53,917
It probably went to the greenhouse.
We'll start there.

1007
01:11:54,093 --> 01:11:57,756
Meantime, stay here.
Watch the door into the hallway.

1008
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:01,331
- Keep your eye on the Geiger counter.
- Here are the fire extinguishers.

1009
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,298
- Who's your electrical expert?
- That's my line.

1010
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:08,167
- Can you hook into the intercom system?
- We can take one from any room.

1011
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,774
- I can help.
- Mac, we'll be in the radio room.

1012
01:12:10,943 --> 01:12:13,275
Let us know when you're ready.
You all right?

1013
01:12:13,445 --> 01:12:16,243
- Yeah. I'd like to tag along.
- Haven't you had enough?

1014
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,940
If I start burning up again,
who'll put out the fire?

1015
01:12:19,118 --> 01:12:21,609
We're very proud of our captain.

1016
01:12:23,188 --> 01:12:28,626
Now, look, put one of the intercoms
here. That'll take care of this end.

1017
01:12:28,794 --> 01:12:32,890
Put another down here at the junction.
See if they work through the mess hall.

1018
01:12:33,065 --> 01:12:35,363
You said you were gonna
use kerosene again.

1019
01:12:35,534 --> 01:12:39,664
- Know anything better?
- Something hotter. Why not use electricity?

1020
01:12:39,838 --> 01:12:43,865
- You mean your lighting system?
- No, we can hook in a new transformer.

1021
01:12:44,043 --> 01:12:46,807
- It will give us plenty of amps.
- Enough to burn him?

1022
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:50,176
- More than enough.
- Could you use leads to two poles?

1023
01:12:50,349 --> 01:12:52,715
- Lf you insulate the poles.
- Sounds good.

1024
01:12:52,885 --> 01:12:56,377
Bob, give him a hand.
Come on, Tex. You go to work.

1025
01:12:56,555 --> 01:12:59,353
Get Anchorage if you can.
Tell them the whole story.

1026
01:12:59,825 --> 01:13:03,454
Tell them we're in bad shape
and to bring hand grenades, mortars...

1027
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,096
...flamethrowers, anything.

1028
01:13:05,264 --> 01:13:08,529
Tell them if I don't send a story,
I'm gonna shoot myself.

1029
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:11,635
- Better comb your hair first.
- What hair?

1030
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,568
- Hey, say that again.
- Oh, Nikki, not you too.

1031
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:16,105
- He's sensitive.
- You too.

1032
01:13:16,275 --> 01:13:18,334
- I got hair.
- Doesn't make you prettier.

1033
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:20,375
- No, your breath.
- I'm sorry.

1034
01:13:20,546 --> 01:13:23,174
- He's sensitive about that too.
- I've been upset.

1035
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:28,445
- You ninnies. Look. That's what I mean.
- Hey, look. You too.

1036
01:13:29,054 --> 01:13:31,215
- It's getting cold.
- The heat must be off.

1037
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,789
It is off.

1038
01:13:33,892 --> 01:13:36,986
It's not getting oil.
See if it's the same across the hall.

1039
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:41,258
- Tex, where do these heaters get oil?
- Around behind. Outside.

1040
01:13:42,968 --> 01:13:45,300
- Pat, heat's off in the mess hall!
- No.

1041
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,962
- No more oil coming in.
- It's off in there too.

1042
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:50,973
- Could the tank be empty?
- Filled day before yesterday.

1043
01:13:51,143 --> 01:13:53,771
The main line could be plugged.
Better fix it.

1044
01:13:53,946 --> 01:13:56,540
Probably run into our visitor,
who'd be waiting for you.

1045
01:13:56,715 --> 01:13:58,342
We underestimate this guy.

1046
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:01,008
- Trying to freeze us out, huh?
- That isn't gonna be hard.

1047
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,780
- It's down to 40 degrees.
- It's 60 below outside.

1048
01:14:03,956 --> 01:14:06,322
- How long will these rooms hold heat?
- Half an hour.

1049
01:14:06,492 --> 01:14:09,017
- By then, we'll be stiff.
- Lf no one goes out...

1050
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,059
...won't it think of something else?

1051
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:16,429
It'll think that our only chance to keep
warm is electricity. Heaters, blankets.

1052
01:14:16,602 --> 01:14:19,799
It could break the circuit,
cut a line, except at the source.

1053
01:14:19,972 --> 01:14:21,769
- The generator room.
- Get them all in there.

1054
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:25,603
- I'll tell Tex.
- Bring food, medicine, blankets, clothes.

1055
01:14:25,777 --> 01:14:30,373
- Bring our flying clothes.
- Most got burned. I'll see what I can salvage.

1056
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:33,040
- Get the transformer hooked up to that.
- It's cold in here.

1057
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:34,947
- The thing's turned the heat off.
- What?

1058
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,712
- What'll we do?
- I don't know.

1059
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,620
The next thing's electricity,
so everybody's in the generator room.

1060
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:42,987
Did you do a good job
on the outside door?

1061
01:14:43,162 --> 01:14:46,097
- Houdini'd find it tough getting in.
- He'll come through here.

1062
01:14:46,265 --> 01:14:49,564
It's the only way. Got any fence wire
strong enough for the voltage?

1063
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,726
- Whole rolls of it.
- That'll work.

1064
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:53,428
- What?
- Lay it on the ground.

1065
01:14:53,605 --> 01:14:56,904
A lead overhead and on each side.
When it gets to the spot, juice him.

1066
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,542
- I don't get you.
- Where's the wire?

1067
01:14:58,710 --> 01:14:59,836
- Down here.
- Give me those.

1068
01:15:00,012 --> 01:15:03,379
- What are you doing?
- We'll rig an electric flytrap for him.

1069
01:15:03,549 --> 01:15:04,538
What do you mean?

1070
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:07,082
- Scotty, get me a hammer and nails.
- Sure.

1071
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,981
Better get out of the way.

1072
01:15:09,154 --> 01:15:14,285
- Looks as if the situation's well in hand.
- I've given all the orders I'm gonna give.

1073
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:17,895
If I thought that were true,
I'd ask you to marry me. Here's your coat.

1074
01:15:18,063 --> 01:15:19,428
I wanna keep my mind open.

1075
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,190
- Hammer and nails.
- Down there.

1076
01:15:21,366 --> 01:15:24,995
- Where do you want us?
- In the generator room. Move along.

1077
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:28,867
- Sorry, changed my mind. It's all off.
- Keep moving, everybody.

1078
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:32,306
- I want another word with you.
- No time now. Move along.

1079
01:15:32,477 --> 01:15:35,810
Make way. Clear this out.
Clear this place.

1080
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:37,505
- Where are those cutters?
- Here.

1081
01:15:37,683 --> 01:15:40,083
- Where's your Geiger counter?
- I got one too.

1082
01:15:40,252 --> 01:15:42,516
Go to the assembly room.
If you get anything, come running.

1083
01:15:42,688 --> 01:15:45,316
- Get me a pair of gloves.
- Use mine.

1084
01:16:01,873 --> 01:16:05,832
- Leave enough to hook the overhead wire.
- Got plenty.

1085
01:16:09,848 --> 01:16:13,841
- Here we are, lieutenant.
- Yeah, that ought to give us a ground.

1086
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:17,349
- There she is, captain.
- Down to five degrees now.

1087
01:16:17,522 --> 01:16:20,320
- Perfect for skiing.
- Better get rubber boots, Scotty.

1088
01:16:20,492 --> 01:16:22,926
- Why?
- Insulation when they turn the juice on.

1089
01:16:23,095 --> 01:16:25,063
- Oh, yeah.
- There's a pair back here.

1090
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:27,391
- Where?
- Wait. You won't need any boots.

1091
01:16:27,566 --> 01:16:30,330
When it comes, go back.
You don't belong out here.

1092
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:34,563
I didn't belong at Alamein or Okinawa.
I was just kibitzing.

1093
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:38,540
I also write a very good obituary.
Just ignore me, please.

1094
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,735
- Capt. Hendry.
- Go ahead.

1095
01:16:40,912 --> 01:16:43,312
Just hooked this up.
Checking if it works.

1096
01:16:43,482 --> 01:16:45,177
Fine. Watch your Geiger counter.

1097
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,410
- Mac, did you hear?
- Every word. I hope that's all I hear.

1098
01:16:48,587 --> 01:16:52,023
- So do I.
- Here's another message from Washington.

1099
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:57,787
"Use every means to protect lives,
but take no steps against your prisoner."

1100
01:16:57,996 --> 01:16:59,293
Our prisoner.

1101
01:16:59,464 --> 01:17:03,332
- You can't ignore orders.
- Testify to that at my court-martial.

1102
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:07,438
You're robbing science of the greatest secret
that's ever come to it.

1103
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:10,473
- Go back.
- Knowledge is more important than life.

1104
01:17:10,642 --> 01:17:14,100
We've only one excuse for existing.
To think. To find out. To learn.

1105
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:17,009
What can we learn from that,
except a way to die?

1106
01:17:17,182 --> 01:17:20,743
It doesn't matter what happens.
Nothing counts except our thinking.

1107
01:17:20,919 --> 01:17:23,513
We fought into nature.
We've split the atom...

1108
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:25,919
That sure made the world happy.
Didn't it?

1109
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:29,356
We owe it to the brain of our species
to stand here and die...

1110
01:17:29,528 --> 01:17:32,622
...without destroying a source of wisdom.
- Capt. Hendry.

1111
01:17:32,798 --> 01:17:35,392
- Civilization has given us orders.
- Get him out of here.

1112
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:37,933
Oh, you fools. You'll never hurt it.

1113
01:17:38,103 --> 01:17:41,402
- Go ahead.
- I'm getting a Geiger counter reaction.

1114
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:44,041
- What's your reading?
- Point two, but steady.

1115
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:47,201
Watch it. Tell us any change.
Mac, anything your way?

1116
01:17:47,379 --> 01:17:48,869
- Not a glimmer.
- Watch it.

1117
01:17:49,047 --> 01:17:50,776
Here's the operating switch.

1118
01:17:50,949 --> 01:17:54,851
- How can it get cold so quick?
- Keep moving around.

1119
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:58,721
- It must be zero.
- It was. Next stop, five below.

1120
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:02,986
Come on, Mr. Martian, and get some
nice Scotch blood. One hundred proof.

1121
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:06,619
- Nothing like it for babies.
- Tell him to cut it out.

1122
01:18:06,798 --> 01:18:11,428
No, no. Let him go on. I like
goose pimples. They keep me warm.

1123
01:18:12,404 --> 01:18:14,872
Did you get a picture of that thing
on fire?

1124
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,271
No. I shot one while I was
falling backward over the bed.

1125
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,638
Probably got the ceiling
and my big feet.

1126
01:18:20,812 --> 01:18:23,747
Capt. Hendry, going up a little.
Point four now.

1127
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:27,646
- Hang on. Mac, any change?
- Just the same. Only colder.

1128
01:18:28,353 --> 01:18:31,914
- Means he's coming by the mess hall.
- Excuse me. I got an idea.

1129
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,421
- What?
- Here we go again.

1130
01:18:33,592 --> 01:18:37,585
Your boy's pretty smart. He might see
these wires and think it over.

1131
01:18:37,763 --> 01:18:41,130
- Yeah.
- Lf he thinks too long, we're cold meat.

1132
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:45,133
- What if we met him by the junction?
- Let him see us there and chase us?

1133
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:46,998
The less light, the better.

1134
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:50,699
Turn off this light and this one here.
Don't tell me I'm right.

1135
01:18:50,876 --> 01:18:53,538
Capt. Hendry, going up.
Point eight now.

1136
01:18:53,712 --> 01:18:56,044
- I'm getting some too.
- It's showing here.

1137
01:18:56,214 --> 01:18:59,615
- Both of you, back here. Come running.
- Halfway there.

1138
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:02,549
If you speed up that generator,
can you get more out?

1139
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:06,350
- Certainly do no harm to try.
- Bill and Tex, go with him. Nikki too.

1140
01:19:06,525 --> 01:19:08,618
- No.
- Good luck to you.

1141
01:19:09,895 --> 01:19:11,157
What's the matter?

1142
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:15,265
- I was wishing we'd tested this thing.
- What if we haven't enough voltage?

1143
01:19:15,434 --> 01:19:17,334
- Keep swinging at its arms.
- One point two.

1144
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:19,299
- It's on its way.
- I got a worry.

1145
01:19:19,471 --> 01:19:22,065
Report from the front,
McPherson has a worry.

1146
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,673
- This is no joke.
- What?

1147
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:27,334
- What if he can read our minds?
- He'll be mad when he gets to me.

1148
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:30,276
- One point four.
- Keep moving around, you guys.

1149
01:19:30,449 --> 01:19:32,041
Keep it quiet.

1150
01:19:32,217 --> 01:19:37,519
I remember the first execution I ever
covered. Ruth Snyder and Judd Grey.

1151
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:40,487
- Did you get a picture?
- No. They didn't allow cameras.

1152
01:19:40,659 --> 01:19:43,685
- One point six and going up.
- Don't move till he sees us.

1153
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:47,161
Give him a chance to look.
Leave me room to reach that switch.

1154
01:19:47,332 --> 01:19:50,324
Stay away from the walls
when he hits the juice.

1155
01:19:50,502 --> 01:19:52,436
- Everybody got rubber boots on?
- Yes, sir.

1156
01:19:52,604 --> 01:19:54,367
One point eight.

1157
01:19:57,142 --> 01:19:58,473
I heard something.

1158
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,941
It's getting near the top.

1159
01:20:10,355 --> 01:20:11,947
Get your posts!

1160
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:19,329
All right. Ease back.

1161
01:20:34,145 --> 01:20:35,874
- What the...?
- The juice is off!

1162
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:37,708
Carrington's turned off the generator.

1163
01:20:37,883 --> 01:20:41,250
Bob, bring a flashlight. Eddie,
hold him off as long as you can.

1164
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:46,114
- Watch out. He's got a gun.
- Keep away. Keep away.

1165
01:20:46,291 --> 01:20:48,589
Keep away. I won't
allow you to destroy...

1166
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,888
Turn on that generator!
Get back here, Eddie.

1167
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:08,272
Eddie, get back!
Stay away from that wire!

1168
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:11,506
I'm your friend. I have no weapons.
I'm your friend.

1169
01:21:11,683 --> 01:21:15,278
You're wiser than I. You must understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

1170
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:18,786
Don't go farther. They'll kill you.
They think you'll harm us.

1171
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,619
But I want to know you,
to help you. Believe that.

1172
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,727
You're wiser than anything on earth.

1173
01:21:23,895 --> 01:21:27,194
Use that intelligence. Look
and know what I'm telling you.

1174
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:31,495
I'm not your enemy.
I'm a scientist who's trying...

1175
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,570
Hold it.

1176
01:21:36,107 --> 01:21:38,803
Wait until he gets right
in the middle of it, sir.

1177
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,908
He's gotta be on that walk, captain.

1178
01:21:52,757 --> 01:21:55,351
Wait till he gets right
in the middle, sir.

1179
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:32,824
- Oh, that's it. Stop. Turn it off.
- Let it go. We don't want any part left.

1180
01:22:57,922 --> 01:23:00,652
Well, you can get a picture now, Scotty.

1181
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,884
- This will take a minute to warm up.
- Okay.

1182
01:23:31,056 --> 01:23:34,457
Is there any reason now
why I can't send my story?

1183
01:23:34,626 --> 01:23:37,356
- Only take five minutes.
- I guess it's okay.

1184
01:23:37,529 --> 01:23:39,861
You're looking better to me
than you used to.

1185
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:41,862
- All done, Pat.
- Get everything?

1186
01:23:42,033 --> 01:23:45,002
Burned everything in Carrington's lab
and the greenhouse.

1187
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:47,934
- Burned the arm too.
- How is Dr. Carrington?

1188
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,097
He's got a broken collarbone
and a headache.

1189
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,175
I'm not getting enough voltage.

1190
01:23:52,343 --> 01:23:54,470
- I'll check the generator for you.
- Good.

1191
01:23:54,646 --> 01:23:57,706
- Anybody want some coffee?
- No, but you can come in.

1192
01:23:57,882 --> 01:24:01,215
- You better have some. You look tired.
- He should look tired.

1193
01:24:01,386 --> 01:24:04,253
- He's had two things on his mind.
- We've only had one.

1194
01:24:04,422 --> 01:24:07,687
- Our worries are over, while our captain...
- Shut up.

1195
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:10,054
Isn't there something you
can do about it, Nikki?

1196
01:24:10,228 --> 01:24:13,959
I don't know. You know, I'm getting
pretty fed up with the North Pole.

1197
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,396
- How much does a captain make?
- Not much.

1198
01:24:16,568 --> 01:24:18,160
That's a good start. Go ahead.

1199
01:24:18,336 --> 01:24:20,304
- Enough to support two?
- Not nearly.

1200
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,100
- Captain, you get flight pay.
- Some for each dependent.

1201
01:24:23,274 --> 01:24:25,834
- We can handle that.
- I won't be railroaded into anything.

1202
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,477
I've got an idea.

1203
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:30,876
- This is gonna work.
- You ought to settle down.

1204
01:24:31,049 --> 01:24:33,347
- There you are.
- It'd be much better for us.

1205
01:24:33,518 --> 01:24:36,419
Sure. Our captain always
getting into trouble.

1206
01:24:36,588 --> 01:24:39,648
- Remember that night in Honolulu?
- That was pretty bad.

1207
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:42,349
- I don't know what they're talking about.
- He should light somewhere.

1208
01:24:42,527 --> 01:24:47,555
- See, they know what's best for you.
- Here we are. Plenty of voltage now.

1209
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:53,928
Anchorage, from Polar Expedition 6.
Can you hear me? Over.

1210
01:24:54,105 --> 01:24:59,338
- Anchorage, reception clear. Stand by.
- Press the button and speak, Scotty.

1211
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:03,470
Tell General Fogarty we've sent for
Capt. Hendry. He'll be here in minutes.

1212
01:25:03,648 --> 01:25:07,607
- Roger. Over.
- Are there any newsmen there? Over.

1213
01:25:07,786 --> 01:25:11,119
- The place is full of them. Over.
- All right. Here's your story.

1214
01:25:11,289 --> 01:25:13,985
North Pole, November 3rd.
Ned Scott reporting.

1215
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:18,095
One of the world's greatest battles
was fought and won by the human race.

1216
01:25:18,263 --> 01:25:20,993
A handful of American soldiers
and civilians...

1217
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:23,634
...met the first invasion
from another planet.

1218
01:25:23,802 --> 01:25:27,397
A man by the name of Noah once saved
our world with an ark of wood.

1219
01:25:27,572 --> 01:25:31,633
Here, a few men performed
a similar service with an arc of electricity.

1220
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:35,405
A flying saucer, which landed here,
and its pilot have been destroyed.

1221
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:38,845
But not without casualties among
our own meager forces.

1222
01:25:39,017 --> 01:25:42,783
I'd like to bring to the microphone
the men responsible for our success.

1223
01:25:42,954 --> 01:25:49,291
But Capt. Hendry is attending
to demands over and above the call of duty.

1224
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:52,293
Dr. Carrington, leader
of the scientific expedition...

1225
01:25:52,463 --> 01:25:55,261
...is recovering from wounds from the battle.
- Good for you.

1226
01:25:55,433 --> 01:25:59,836
And now, before giving you the details
of the battle, I bring you a warning.

1227
01:26:00,004 --> 01:26:02,495
Every one of you listening to my voice...

1228
01:26:02,674 --> 01:26:06,906
...tell the world. Tell this to everybody
wherever they are:

1229
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:13,483
Watch the skies everywhere.
Keep looking. Keep watching the skies.

1230
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:19,478
.
