00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,469
Mrs. Thompson sent me over
to ask for some eggs, and then...

318
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,632
Your wife gave Peter the eggs,
but, unfortunately, they broke.

319
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,744
And then she gave me
another four eggs...

320
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:20,437
...but the dog jumped on me,
and now...

321
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:24,218
You had a dozen and you're going
shopping on Monday anyway.

322
00:24:24,385 --> 00:24:27,013
We just want the eggs, that's all.

323
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:29,952
Ann, can you tell me
what's going on here?

324
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:36,890
Honey, can you just tell
me what's going on?

325
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,958
Just give them to them.

326
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:42,996
- Can I have them now?
- Hold on a moment.

327
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:46,106
Ann, if it's just about some eggs,
why are you so angry?

328
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:48,674
ANN: Look, I'm not going
to justify myself in front...

329
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,242
I asked you to throw them out.
Maybe I have my reasons.

330
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,918
Do what you want. I've had enough.

331
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:00,679
Ann.

332
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:06,389
I'm sorry.

333
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:09,359
My wife's not feeling well, so...

334
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:11,192
Yeah.

335
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:13,734
Could you please leave?

336
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:18,399
I can hardly play the mediator
if I don't know the facts, now, can I?

337
00:25:18,573 --> 00:25:22,566
So could you just leave, please?

338
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:29,511
Please, the...

339
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:32,709
- What?
- Just give them to him.

340
00:25:34,155 --> 00:25:37,147
- What the hell is going on here?
- Nothing's going on, sir.

341
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:40,453
He asked for the eggs,
the dog attacked him, they broke.

342
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:44,655
Now he would like some more.
What is so difficult to understand?

343
00:25:44,832 --> 00:25:47,824
You better watch your tone,
young man.

344
00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:53,534
You better be careful, old man,
or I'll break your eggs.

345
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:59,078
Now, please leave, right now.

346
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:00,680
PAUL: Mr. Farber?
- What?

347
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:01,837
[YELLS]

348
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,278
GEORGIE:
Dad!

349
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:05,146
PETER:
Is it broken?

350
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:08,548
Hey, hey, come on, come on,
come on.

351
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:12,490
Hey. Come on. Behave yourself.

352
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:15,290
Behave yourself, okay?

353
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:17,954
Okay? I don't want to hurt you...

354
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,462
...so you have to behave yourself.

355
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:27,532
GEORGIE: Mom.
- What is it, baby?

356
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,973
PETER: Please, just, ma'am,
stay where you are, okay?

357
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:32,636
Please, stay.

358
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:38,109
- He slapped me in the face.
- Yeah, he started it.

359
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:43,390
PETER: You can help him,
just don't do anything stupid. Help him.

360
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:52,131
- You should bring him a chair.
ANN: What happened?

361
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,392
It's my knee.

362
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:56,661
PETER: You should take off his pants.
He should sit. Bring him a chair.

363
00:26:56,838 --> 00:26:58,965
Go get him a chair, honey.

364
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,099
Be careful.

365
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,346
PAUL: Peter is a... He's a medical student.
He can help you with it.

366
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,748
PETER:
Can you please take off your pants?

367
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:14,347
If you don't let me see
your wound, I can't help you.

368
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:17,491
I'm sorry I hurt you,
but you forced me to, you must admit.

369
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:22,556
PAUL: Come on, Mr. Farber,
be reasonable. Let him look at your leg.

370
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,698
He can help you with it.

371
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:29,235
Would you please...

372
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:32,735
...leave?

373
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:34,374
Please.

374
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:36,908
PETER:
We won't get anywhere like this.

375
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:44,507
PAUL: You have to let him help you,
you don't really have a choice.

376
00:27:44,686 --> 00:27:46,620
You're the ship's captain, sir.

377
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:52,158
You're aware that onboard,
the captain's word is law, aren't you?

378
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,953
So, what do you want to do?

379
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,726
You want to call someone?

380
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:00,891
An ambulance or the police?

381
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:03,060
I won't stop you.

382
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:06,305
Neither will Tom. Right, Tom?

383
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:13,238
Well, what are you waiting for?

384
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,042
He dropped the cell phone in the sink.

385
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:28,717
- Why are you doing this?
PETER: Why not?

386
00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:32,063
Okay, let's play another game.

387
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:35,194
It's a guessing game.

388
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:40,707
What is this?

389
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,145
Sir?

390
00:28:58,526 --> 00:29:00,357
It's a golf ball.

391
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:04,025
Correct. It's a golf ball.

392
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:07,366
But why do I have it in my pocket?

393
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:10,869
Hm? The lady knows why.

394
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:12,863
Because?

395
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,737
Well?

396
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:22,742
Well?

397
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:27,449
Because you didn't hit it.

398
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:31,782
Correct. Because I didn't hit it.
And why didn't I hit it?

399
00:29:32,326 --> 00:29:35,124
Because something stopped you.

400
00:29:35,296 --> 00:29:40,131
Correct. Because I had
to test the club in another way.

401
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:51,838
Where is he?

402
00:29:52,513 --> 00:29:53,878
PAUL:
Cold.

403
00:29:59,854 --> 00:30:01,651
Even colder.

404
00:30:07,295 --> 00:30:08,853
Cold.

405
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,490
Ice cold.

406

Warmer.

407
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,406
Warmer.

Little cold.

409
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,082
Warmer.

410
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:35,184
Warmer.

411
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:38,257
Warmer.

412
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:42,856
Cold.

413
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:47,528
Cold.

414
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:51,034
Warmer.

415
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,332
Warm, cold.

416
00:30:57,378 --> 00:30:59,073
Warmer.

417
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:01,605
Really warm.

418
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:25,002
Would you please go to the kitchen
and get me something to eat?

419
00:31:25,907 --> 00:31:27,898
That be possible?

420
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:43,184
Maybe there's some bananas or...

421
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:49,294
Please don't think about bringing back
a knife or anything like that...

422
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:51,363
...or I'd be sorry.

423
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:53,796
For you, I mean.

424
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:04,170
It's getting cloudy.

425
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:11,844
That's very nice of you, thank you.

Come on down to the water.

Today.

00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:14,674
We're still unpacking.

How long you staying?

00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:21,449

We're not sure yet.

Oh, wonderful. So nice to see you.

ANN: No.

448
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,359
Pleased to meet you.

00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:38,232
Hello, nice to meet you too.

450

Hello. Hi, Robert.

00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,575
ROBERT: Hi, how are you?
ANN: Fine.

452
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:48,142
This is Paul. He's staying
with the Thompsons next door.

453
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:51,375
- Hi, pleased to meet you.
- Hi, Paul. You cold?

- Oh, no, I have... I have eczema.
- Oh.

455
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:58,748
You should go swimming,
the water works wonders for that here.

456
00:33:58,926 --> 00:34:00,951
Thank you, that's good advice.

How's George?

Fine, thanks.

460
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:08,799
Where is he?

461
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:14,236
He pulled a muscle putting up the mast,
so he's lying down, resting.

462
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:17,844
BETSY: So sorry to hear that. That's what
happens when you try to do too much.

463
00:34:18,045 --> 00:34:21,139
Robert, on the other hand,
would never dream of launching a boat.

464
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:22,976
Right, Robert?

465
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:26,584
Tell your hubby to get better,
we're grilling every night.

466
00:34:26,754 --> 00:34:27,846
ANN:
I'll tell him.

467
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:31,752
I mean it, as soon as he's better,
swing by. Robert's son is here.

468
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:34,690
He brought his little girlfriend.
He'd like her for sure.

469
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:37,626
All right. Well, listen,
it's great to see you, darling.

470
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:41,529
Listen, if the weather stays like this,
you'll probably have to take the car.

471
00:34:41,702 --> 00:34:43,761
- It's supposed to be windy.
- For tomorrow...

472
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:46,634
PAUL: Where's your dock?
- Excuse me?

473
00:34:46,807 --> 00:34:48,638
PAUL:
Your dock?

474
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:52,108
Oh, it's just around the peninsula,
but on the other side.

475
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:54,645
The old cottage, with the red dock?

476
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:56,544
BETSY:

the slap in the face?
