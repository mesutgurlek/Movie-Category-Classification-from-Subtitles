1
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:32,206
What is a ghost?

2
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,561
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?

3
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:52,363
An instant of pain, perhaps.

4
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:04,160
Something dead which still seems to be alive.

5
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,682
An emotion suspended in time.

6
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:23,599
Like a blurred photograph.

7
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,676
Like an insect trapped in amber.

8
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:21,958
THE DEVlL'S BACKBONE

9
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:36,356
We'll be there soon.

10
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:37,236
What the...?

11
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,999
lt fell quite a while ago, but it never exploded.

12
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:57,956
They came...

13
00:04:58,767 --> 00:04:59,802
...they defused it...

14
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:03,600
...and they left it there. Nobody can move it.

15
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:11,956
Follow me, please.

16
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:17,238
Carlos...

17
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,837
Wait for me here. We won't be long.

18
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:23,676
Who are those people outside?

19
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,280
The caretaker and two men who help him.

20
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:31,958
They're from the town.
There's always work to do here.

21
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,085
They're building a ohicken coop.

22
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,156
What's going on out there?

23
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,956
-They've arrived.
-Ayala and Dominguez again?

24
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,246
Yes. Ayala's wounded.

25
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,319
They're always in trouble.

26
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,716
They've brought another boy.

27
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:11,998
As if we didn't have enough already.

28
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:17,516
Let's go.

29
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:36,516
Are you a new kid?

30
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,885
Got any candy? Or a bit of bread?

31
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:46,565
I'm Galvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he looks a lot.

32
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,036
I'm Carlos.

33
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,685
Got any fruit, even if it's soft?

34
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,725
No, but l've got some comics and toys.

35
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,963
-Want to see them?
-Yeah.

36
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:03,716
l can't do it.

37
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,519
l can't accept another boy.

38
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:08,562
l can barely feed the ones who are here.
l'm sorry.

39
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:13,439
He's the son of a comrade killed at the front.

40
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:15,916
The boy doesn't know.

41
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:17,836
He doesn't know.

42
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,878
Your husband was a leftist, a brave man.

43
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:20,916
Oh, no!

44
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,002
l'm the brave one.

45
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:25,885
Ricardo was a man of books of ideas.

46
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:29,641
He decided to die and leave me
here to defend his ideals.

47
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,800
The Nationalists will arrive any day
and what will they find?

48
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,486
Reds looking after the children of Reds.

49
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:40,276
Not to mention this!

50
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,603
l can't keep it anymore.
lf you want to leave the boy,...

51
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:45,676
...take the rest of the gold.

52
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:47,716
There are 10 ingots left.

53
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:50,640
At least you can buy guns.

54
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,561
l can't even buy bread with it.

55
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,156
Take it away.

56
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,556
We can't.

57
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:58,483
-We're crossing enemy lines.
-You decide.

58
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:00,879
The boy goes hungry here
or gets killed out there.

59
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:06,836
Class time!

60
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,156
Come on!

61
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,156
Look, Owl, a comic book!

62
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:19,116
I'll swap you.

63
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,399
Look at this marble. It's my favorite.
It's from China.

64
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:26,755
Or look at this one.

65
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,356
Owl made it himself.

66
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,925
All made from snot and mud.
lt's six months of snot.

67
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:35,920
Hey, you! That's mine!

68
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:38,280
-Are you here to stay?
-No.

69
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:41,125
Then why are you here?

70
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:43,519
I came with Mr Ayala, my tutor.

71
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:46,562
What's a tutor?

72
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:48,245
He looks after me while my father's away.

73
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:49,996
Shit, that's posh!

74
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:52,156
No one here has one of those.

75
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,678
Take the comic from me. Go on.

76
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,166
Take it away. C'mon.

77
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:05,636
Carlos, look!

78
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,160
Mr. Ayala.

79
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,283
Your tutor's leaving you, faggot!

80
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:50,126
Stay with him for a while.

81
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:51,836
He seems well behaved.

82
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:54,955
I'm sure you'll get along.

83
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:12,556
We'll have to fix it.

84
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,076
''The Count of Monte-Cristo.''

85
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:19,923
Has Edmond Dantes broken out of prison yet?

86
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,275
-Has he met Abbot Faria?
-They're digging a tunnel.

87
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:27,247
-Do they manage to escape?
-I don't know.

88
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,196
Why don't you read on and tell me?

89
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,996
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.

90
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:38,319
She teaches maths and reading.

91
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:41,636
And the elegant lady you saw, remember?

92
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,156
Her name is Carmen.

93
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,123
-ls she your girlfriend?
-She's the principal.

94
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:47,922
Why did they leave me here?

95
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:51,522
Why can't I be with my father?

96
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:52,756
Carlitos...

97
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:55,201
...you're staying with us for a while.

98
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:57,036
Just for a while.

99
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:58,756
So be patient.

100
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,000
Your soap has to last you all year.

101
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,042
Be careful with it...

102
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,836
...or you'll be punished with
two weeks of extra tasks.

103
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,601
You can play in the yard,
but never inside the building.

104
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,556
This is your bed.

105
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:36,156
Number 12.

106
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:40,245
Why are there so many empty beds?

107
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,362
Some boys run away, but I wouldn't advise it.

108
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:45,915
lt's a day's walk to town.

109
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:48,725
The nights are cold and the days...

110
00:12:57,687 --> 00:12:58,722
For your locker.

111
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,482
Do you understand?

112
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:05,041
There are no bars here. This isn't a prison.

113
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:25,679
See where they put the new kid?

114
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:29,846
-ln Santi's bed.
-Shut up!

115
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,967
Pig and I think that even though
you complain a lot...

116
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,356
...you're all right here.

117
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:45,917
Far away from the war, well hidden.

118
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:48,236
Well looked after.

119
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:51,245
-What could be better?
-Granada.

120
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,366
Why go to Granada?

121
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,002
We're getting married.

122
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,719
We want to buy a farm there.

123
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:02,636
Sure.

124
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:05,076
Granada!

125
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:10,039
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?

126
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,676
I don't need anyone.

127
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:15,999
I've managed fine on my own up to now.

128
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:17,676
Right.

129
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:20,042
And without parents.

130
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,637
Those Reds we saw were here for the gold.

131
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:29,203
-Yeah, the school's gold.
-That's why they eat so well here.

132
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:32,196
You don't believe me now...

133
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,436
...but you will.

134
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:37,356
I'll try these two tonight
and let you know what happens.

135
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:39,515
That's great, kid.

136
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:40,556
Got a smoke?

137
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,397
-No.
-All right, so long.

138
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,521
I don't like those two.

139
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:10,236
...I'd stand here...

140
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,396
...in the middle of the yard...

141
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:18,361
...and I'd look up at the sky.

142
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,646
I dreamed of getting out of here.

143
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:23,676
I prayed to become rich...

144
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:26,876
...so I could buy this dump and tear it down.

145
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:29,722
You're so complicated.

146
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:39,478
I don't want anyone to know
I spent 15 years here.

147
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:43,926
Well, l'm glad you came back.

148
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,203
Let's go to my room, it's getting oold.

149
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,681
San... ti...

150
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,195
Who are you?

151
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,676
What are you doing?

152
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,161
-Me? Nothing.
-What the hell's going on?

153
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,684
The fucking new kid spilled our water.

154
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:57,442
Come on.

155
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,200
You'll have to get more from the kitchen.

156
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:01,876
lsn't that off limits?

157
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:03,956
No one's ever been caught.

158
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,282
What about the ''one who sighs''?

159
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:10,483
What's it to be? Are you going or not?

160
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,476
Who's the ''one who sighs''?

161
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,076
You're chickenshit.

162
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:18,356
No, l'm not.

163
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:20,885
You're a shit, a queer.

164
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,156
All right, l'll go.

165
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,356
But you're coming with me.

166
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,200
We'll each fill a jug.

167
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,400
But if you're scared...

168
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:56,916
They say it's switched off.

169
00:19:59,007 --> 00:19:59,996
But l don't believe it.

170
00:20:05,047 --> 00:20:07,197
Put your ear against it, you'll hear ticking.

171
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:14,598
That's its heart. lt's still alive.

172
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,316
And it knows we're here.

173
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:23,116
Hide!

174
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:48,716
That one.

175
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:16,716
C'mon.

176
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:56,836
See you outside.

177
00:23:04,287 --> 00:23:05,879
''No one's ever been caught.'' Bastard.

178
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:06,916
Shit!

179
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:08,036
Hello.

180
00:27:19,727 --> 00:27:20,716
Who are you?

181
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:24,282
Do you live down here?

182
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,686
Many of you will die.

183
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,556
Jaime!

184
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:00,965
What are you up to?

185
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:15,076
''Out, out,...

186
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:17,722
...yearnings of mine. Let not respect bind you.

187
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:18,796
lt flatters pity...

188
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:24,362
lt flatters pity not to be able to hide.

189
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:31,525
Let your lips bear witness...
...to the blaze in your heart.

190
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:35,638
No one will believe the fire
if the smoke sends no signals.

191
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,484
He who cares for his wellbeing
keeps not his feelings silent.

192
00:30:41,727 --> 00:30:42,716
My grief is greater than l

193
00:30:44,687 --> 00:30:46,040
And that being so...

194
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:48,521
...it will be easier...

195
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,761
...it will be easier....

196
00:30:53,247 --> 00:30:54,646
...for it to defeat me...

197
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,920
...than for l to command it.

198
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:02,524
Consideration does not suffice
to prevent the cry.

199
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,842
He is not a brave prisoner.

200
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,325
Who dares not break down his gaol.''

201
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:39,846
A grain of strength.

202
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:49,043
Carlos, are you going to tell me
who was with you last night?

203
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:55,761
He's not going to tell.

204
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:00,356
He'll squeal in the end, just wait and see.

205
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:02,236
You understand?

206
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:06,126
Then, for the last time...

207
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,325
Who was with you last night?

208
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,876
l was alone.

209
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:17,322
That boy won't talk.

210
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:20,040
lf we want to know who was with him...

211
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:25,365
-What's for breakfast?
-Milk and bread.

212
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,516
Perfect.

213
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:28,516
Very well.

214
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:30,156
You may begin.

215
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:40,160
They think Carlos has told, but they don't care.

216
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,318
They're ravenous, look at how they're eating.

217
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:48,760
The first one to look up from his plate
is his accomplice.

218
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:54,760
Marcos,... ...Galvez, Jaime and Owl.

219
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:55,876
Come here.

220
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:02,200
l knew you wouldn't squeal.

221
00:33:02,687 --> 00:33:04,120
Dr. Casares tricked me.

222
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:05,956
That's what l said.

223
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:09,566
lt isn't your fault, we were punished.

224
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,766
Dr. Casares is real smart.

225
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:14,116
He sure is!

226
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:18,962
Careful.

227
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:20,676
Come on, Owl.

228
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,557
Shit, for a dead guy, he sure weighs a lot!

229
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:31,556
Well, well!

230
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:35,075
Christ in the yard and John the Baptist in here.

231
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,236
Are things that bad?

232
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,435
lf the new Spain is Catholic and apostolic...

233
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:46,476
Try it now.

234
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:55,476
l told you.

235
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:58,236
Dance with me.

236
00:33:58,607 --> 00:33:59,596
-No.
-Come on.

237
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:01,880
-No.
-Come on, dance with me.

238
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:04,316
l can't dance.

239
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:12,956
Ayala said so.

240
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,916
Catalonia is about to fall.

241
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:20,077
Then Madrid will fall, and then...

242
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:26,879
-There,s talk of a ghost. Have you heard?
-Yes.

243
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,242
Sometimes l think that we are the ghosts.

244
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,727
Galvez... Last night, you didn't shoot.

245
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:37,926
That's right.

246
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:41,956
Wow, that's great!

247
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:43,516
lt's for you.

248
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,036
Why are they laughing?

249
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:03,560
Go back to Argentina, while you still can.

250
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:05,406
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.

251
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:09,686
England or France might still intervene.

252
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,558
That's just wishful thinking.

253
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:15,845
-You're like Ricardo.
-No.

254
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:18,522
No, l'm not like him.

255
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,762
20 years ago, l found the place for me.

256
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:29,437
And l stayed. That's all.

257
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,640
Look at it jump!

258
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:40,402
Where's the new kid?

259
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:53,326
Are you the ''one who sighs''?

260
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:57,836
Do you live down there?

261
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:02,876
Listen...

262
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:13,636
What are you up to?

263
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:15,356
Go on, call Dr. Casares.

264
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,396
Ass-kisser!

265
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:22,004
Throw him down! Go on!

266
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:29,036
He can't swim!

267
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,923
-Over there!
-Over there, to your left!

268
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:17,196
There he is!

269
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:20,601
Grab him! Careful!

270
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:39,836
What's going on?

271
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:43,036
What have l told you?

272
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:45,755
And you, eh?

273
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,123
What the fuck are you doing down here?

274
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:53,476
Whose is this?

275
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:54,556
Whose is this?

276
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:56,996
lt's mine.

277
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,523
lf anything happens to you, l get the blame.

278
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,316
Get out!

279
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:11,676
Out!

280
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:26,120
Say a word about this and l'll cut you in half.

281
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:27,562
Got that?

282
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,316
There you go.

283
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:43,879
Our Carlos has been here five minutes...

284
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:45,846
...and he's in trouble already.

285
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:48,846
Have you read any more of ''Monte-Cristo''?

286
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:52,681
Do you believe in ghosts?

287
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:55,041
There aren't any in the novel.

288
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:00,363
l think l saw one, here.

289
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:04,598
Carlos, as you can see,...

290
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:07,115
...l'm a man of science.

291
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:10,357
But Spain is full of superstition.

292
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:11,396
Come here.

293
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:14,926
Europe is sick with fear now,
and fear sickens the soul.

294
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:17,404
And that, in turn, makes us see things.

295
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:18,716
in town...

296
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:21,316
...they call this...

297
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:25,002
...''the devil's backbone''

298
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:26,596
They say a lot of things.

299
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:29,482
That this happens to children
who shouldn't have been born.

300
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:32,282
''Nobody's children.'' But that's a lie.

301
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:34,639
Poverty and disease. That's all there is.

302
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:39,602
The liquid they're in is called ''limbo water''

303
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:43,685
ln the old days,
it was made with various spices...

304
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:45,684
...cloves, rum...

305
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:49,565
So this is very, very old rum.

306
00:39:50,727 --> 00:39:51,716
l sell it in town...

307
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:54,124
...and the money keeps the school going.

308
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:55,876
Do they drink it?

309
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,316
They say it helps...

310
00:39:58,087 --> 00:40:00,362
...to cure blindness, kidney ailments...

311
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:02,122
...and also, apparently,...

312
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:03,966
...impotence.

313
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:06,560
Rubbish, but you know...

314
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:09,522
After 60, men will pay anything just to...

315
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:11,356
You know.

316
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:15,718
So if you're going to believe in ghosts
and all that rubbish...

317
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:17,836
... you should have a sip of this...

318
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:20,116
...to heal your wound.

319
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:24,764
No, l'm not sure that l saw a ghost.
May l go now?

320
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:26,805
Yes, of course.

321
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:29,396
And be more careful?

322
00:40:59,567 --> 00:41:01,046
Calm down.

323
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:02,356
l'm not going to hit you.

324
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,156
So don't make any noise.

325
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,036
Carlos...

326
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:10,444
...get out your comics so we can look at them.

327
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:22,799
-That ring is pretty.
-lt's from a oigar.

328
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:24,715
l found it four summers ago.

329
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:26,396
lt's very pretty.

330
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:29,443
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.

331
00:41:30,807 --> 00:41:31,796
Look.

332
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:34,316
A naked woman.

333
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:36,046
lt's really well drawn, like a photo.

334
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:38,962
She's a looker! Who drew this?

335
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:41,196
Her pussy's the wrong way round.

336
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:43,126
lt looks like a mouth.

337
00:41:43,887 --> 00:41:44,922
What would you lot know?

338
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:49,166
Look, a slice of fig cake.

339
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:51,683
lt's a bit squashed but it tastes good.

340
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:54,125
No, give me back my comics.

341
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:55,356
l want it back.

342
00:41:56,087 --> 00:41:57,076
All right.

343
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:00,918
l'll give it to you later. lt's in my locker.

344
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:05,116
You're a real artist.

345
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:07,400
When l grow up, l want to draw comics.

346
00:42:07,727 --> 00:42:08,716
Like mine?

347
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,519
No, much better.
With more fights, more treasures.

348
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:14,846
And big ships with lots of cannons.

349
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,756
These bugs are disgusting. What do they eat?

350
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:21,116
Did you hear that?

351
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:23,596
A sigh.

352
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:25,756
l didn't hear it.

353
00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:28,356
l heard it too.

354
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:56,446
Don't kiss me.

355
00:43:00,607 --> 00:43:01,801
Right, l forgot.

356
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:09,076
This is the last time.

357
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,036
''This is the last time.''

358
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:14,442
Same old story.

359
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:28,042
Don't make any noise.

360
00:43:30,327 --> 00:43:31,601
Scared the old man will hear?

361
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:33,362
l've never been scared.

362
00:43:36,007 --> 00:43:36,996
l'm ashamed.

363
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:40,956
Yeah.

364
00:43:43,127 --> 00:43:44,355
You're ashamed of me.

365
00:43:44,647 --> 00:43:45,636
Not him.

366
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:47,276
He's a gentleman.

367
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:51,439
What a pity that isn't enough.

368
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,565
You need a hard cook as well.

369
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:01,041
And your husband and the doctor...

370
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:03,956
Tough luck.

371
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:14,240
The old man looks at you with love.

372
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,600
He did that even when your husband was alive.

373
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:18,516
l was 17.

374
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:21,676
By then, they took care of the poetry...

375
00:44:22,447 --> 00:44:23,562
...and l of the flesh.

376
00:44:28,727 --> 00:44:29,716
This leg...

377
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:34,085
l don't like to think about this leg.

378
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:37,316
lt hurts.

379
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,360
Some days l can't bear it.

380
00:44:44,407 --> 00:44:46,238
But l need it to stay on my feet.

381
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,520
l saw those lights again today,...

382
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:29,556
...in the sky.

383
00:45:30,087 --> 00:45:31,486
That's the war, it'll never end.

384
00:45:32,047 --> 00:45:33,162
The war's shit.

385
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:34,962
Well, like it.

386
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:37,041
You like it, dickhead?

387
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,286
Yeah, because you see the planes doing this.

388
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,724
My mother says that the earth's so dry here.

389
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:46,956
and the air's so hot...

390
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,158
...that the dead get stuck half way to heaven.

391
00:45:50,087 --> 00:45:53,079
-That's rubbish!
-lt's like the ''one who sighs''.

392
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:56,957
Not that again, you little shit!

393
00:46:03,087 --> 00:46:04,839
Even if it annoys him, there is a ghost.

394
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,479
The day the bomb fell, a boy disappeared. Santi.

395
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:11,123
Since then, no one has dared take Jaime on.

396
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:13,717
Santi slept in your bed, number 12.

397
00:46:14,127 --> 00:46:15,446
Shit, l'm telling the story.

398
00:46:17,047 --> 00:46:19,117
The teachers think that when the bomb fell...

399
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:20,756
...Santi got scared and ran away...

400
00:46:21,287 --> 00:46:24,757
...and maybe some shepherds found him
and he's alive.

401
00:46:25,287 --> 00:46:27,721
Or a cutthroat got him and took his blood.

402
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:28,836
Yeah.

403
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:32,404
They sell the blood to rich people
to cure their tuberculosis.

404
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:34,396
And where's the ghost?

405
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:36,316
lt came with the bomb.

406
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:38,755
Maybe if you ask it...

407
00:47:07,687 --> 00:47:08,676
Take that one.

408
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:16,836
Out of the way.

409
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:28,958
Put those in, but be careful!

410
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:30,916
Don't break them.

411
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,876
Miss...

412
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,440
Look, l found this.

413
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:13,916
l thought you'd like it.

414
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:17,796
Open the gate, Jaime.

415
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,682
lt's lovely.

416
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:26,198
lt looks like gold, but it isn't.

417
00:48:27,127 --> 00:48:29,357
Well, for me, it is.

418
00:48:31,447 --> 00:48:32,436
lt's beautiful.

419
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,156
Thank you.

420
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,556
What's that?

421
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,116
Kids' stuff.

422
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:09,036
Can anyone tell me...

423
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:11,916
...what these elegant gentlemen are hunting?

424
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:15,520
-Galvez?
-A pig.

425
00:49:17,807 --> 00:49:18,842
Well, a boar.

426
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:21,282
Why not a giraffe?

427
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:23,636
Carlos?

428
00:49:23,687 --> 00:49:24,676
A mammoth.

429
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,683
-Very good. And what's a mammoth?
-An ancestor of the elephant.

430
00:49:28,727 --> 00:49:29,716
Very good.

431
00:49:32,727 --> 00:49:33,796
Your tutor taught you that.

432
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,478
ln those days, men had to act in groups.

433
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:39,440
No one could give up.

434
00:49:41,927 --> 00:49:43,326
lmagine the death of a mammoth.

435
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:46,281
lt must have been terrible.

436
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,603
A mammoth steak, great!

437
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:53,715
When you get to draw your comics...

438
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,562
...l could help you write the stories.

439
00:49:59,447 --> 00:50:00,436
l don't need anyone.

440
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:03,198
My stories and my drawings are mine, got that?

441
00:50:04,647 --> 00:50:08,037
Tomorrow, we'll continue with
the second part of prehistory.

442
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:11,718
Leave your things in the dormitory.

443
00:50:14,567 --> 00:50:15,556
Then it's recess.

444
00:51:36,687 --> 00:51:37,676
Santi...

445
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:45,119
-Satisfaction guaranteed.
-l hope so.

446
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:47,756
Here you go.

447
00:51:49,127 --> 00:51:50,116
There isn't muoh.

448
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:53,881
Hey, you! Bastards!

449
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,476
What's going on?

450
00:51:57,287 --> 00:52:00,484
lnternational Brigade. 2 Spaniards,
6 Canadians, 1 Chinaman.

451
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:04,117
What the fuck's a Chinaman
doing in a Spanish war?

452
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:39,722
You, look at your damn feet!

453
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:57,481
Someone you know, doctor?

454
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:06,802
Bomb...

455
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:09,236
lf you're alive...

456
00:53:10,447 --> 00:53:11,516
...tell me where Santi is.

457
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:41,916
Santi...

458
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:46,556
Talk to me.

459
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:50,441
l don't want anyone to die.

460
00:53:57,487 --> 00:53:59,364
Many of you will die.

461
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:03,516
Please.

462
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:13,362
A grain of strength.

463
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:21,079
-You're up late.
-Please, give me a minute.

464
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,001
l need to talk to you,
but l don't want the boys to hear.

465
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:28,076
Things are very bad out there.

466
00:57:29,047 --> 00:57:30,639
-ls something wrong?
-Yes.

467
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:36,678
We have to leave. Today if possible.

468
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,044
-Ayala was taken prisoner...
-Ayala?

469
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:41,920
Yes, l'm sure they questioned him.
We have to go.

470
00:57:42,047 --> 00:57:43,036
Go where?

471
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,839
To Marseille, with the Ricards.

472
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:50,799
-We can't stay here another minute.
-But l can't leave the boys!

473
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,682
Very well, we'll take them, as many as we can.

474
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:56,401
-We'll use the gold.
-The gold belongs to the cause.

475
00:57:58,047 --> 00:58:00,003
fuck the cause, Carmen, fuck the cause!

476
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,884
l always thought there'd be an afterwards.

477
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:04,236
There is no afterwards!

478
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:09,436
Carmen...

479
00:58:09,807 --> 00:58:10,842
...if anything happened you...

480
00:58:11,847 --> 00:58:12,836
Doctor...

481
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:17,765
The boys are waiting for your permission
to have breakfast.

482
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:30,046
l'll need some papers.

483
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:32,802
But we'll go.

484
00:58:38,927 --> 00:58:41,202
Boys, you may start.

485
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:43,918
Come along. Get started, please.

486
00:58:44,527 --> 00:58:45,516
Get started.

487
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:47,682
My mother wrote to me.

488
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:49,076
She's a lot better.

489
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:51,886
She's coming for me soon.

490
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:54,840
Last night l saw the ''one who sighs''

491
00:58:55,127 --> 00:58:56,116
Last night?

492
00:58:57,607 --> 00:58:58,596
You're making it up.

493
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:02,956
lt's Santi.

494
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:04,676
l'm sure.

495
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,476
Are you leaving?

496
00:59:21,047 --> 00:59:22,036
Where are you going?

497
00:59:27,047 --> 00:59:28,241
What about me?

498
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,246
Fuck me, right?

499
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:42,636
Well, good.

500
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:47,200
l want you to finish breakfast,
but while you're doing so...

501
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:52,160
...listen very carefully because
l have to tell you something...

502
00:59:52,207 --> 00:59:54,198
You can go, but the gold stays here.

503
00:59:55,807 --> 00:59:56,796
The gold?

504
00:59:58,207 --> 00:59:59,560
ls that all you care about?

505
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:01,320
That's it.

506
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:04,436
What are you doing?

507
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,077
l hid you here so you wouldn't die outside...

508
01:00:13,407 --> 01:00:15,238
-...with no one to mourn you.
-Give me the key.

509
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:18,836
You know what?

510
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:21,764
Of all the orphans, you were always the saddest.

511
01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:23,716
The lost one.

512
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:25,596
A prince without a kingdom.

513
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:27,036
Shut up!

514
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:30,760
-The only one who was really alone.
-l said, shut up!

515
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:33,043
Get out of here, or l'll kill you!

516
01:00:37,207 --> 01:00:38,196
Look who's come to save you.

517
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:39,636
The old sage.

518
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:42,676
Will this weapon work?

519
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:48,845
You know that while you say sweet things
to this old hag...

520
01:00:50,287 --> 01:00:51,720
...l'm the one who screws her?

521
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:02,316
And now...

522
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:04,196
...get out.

523
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:46,956
What did you see?

524
01:01:48,207 --> 01:01:49,196
You know already.

525
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,045
l don't know anything. Tell me.

526
01:01:55,207 --> 01:01:56,196
Santi.

527
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,199
He's the ''one who sighs''.

528
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:02,756
He's dead, isn't he?

529
01:02:16,407 --> 01:02:17,396
Come on, boys.

530
01:02:18,327 --> 01:02:19,316
Conchita...

531
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,557
Would you bring me a few cans of gas
for the journey?

532
01:03:32,887 --> 01:03:34,002
Please, no!

533
01:03:49,527 --> 01:03:52,200
You'll all travel in the back of the truck.

534
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:54,596
lt'll be a long journey.

535
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:58,322
The older boys will have to
look after the little ones.

536
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:01,607
lf any of you are scared you can sit with me.

537
01:04:09,647 --> 01:04:10,716
What are you doing?

538
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:44,519
Are you all right, ma'am?

539
01:04:45,687 --> 01:04:47,006
lt's my bad leg.

540
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:49,316
lt's heavier than ever.

541
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:02,881
Did you think someone would
just give us a farm?

542
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:05,756
What are you doing with that?

543
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:09,516
You're crazy.

544
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:11,396
They're all inside.

545
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:14,156
You going to shoot me?

546
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:22,316
Please...

547
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:57,595
-What was that?
-The children!

548
01:05:58,127 --> 01:05:59,879
Get them out! lt's going to blow up!

549
01:06:00,287 --> 01:06:01,276
Get out!

550
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:16,276
Outside!

551
01:06:19,247 --> 01:06:20,236
Carmen?

552
01:06:24,287 --> 01:06:26,482
Alma, leave it be, come on!

553
01:06:29,967 --> 01:06:30,956
Get out!

554
01:06:31,767 --> 01:06:32,756
All of you!

555
01:08:59,687 --> 01:09:02,121
-l'm very cold.
-lt's all right.

556
01:09:03,007 --> 01:09:04,520
Don't move.

557
01:09:04,927 --> 01:09:06,246
Don't move, don't look.

558
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:07,916
ls it bad?

559
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,676
Fetch my bag from the lab. Quickly!

560
01:09:53,447 --> 01:09:55,438
They won't have heard the explosion in town.

561
01:09:56,207 --> 01:09:58,801
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.

562
01:10:01,607 --> 01:10:04,075
lf l walk all night,
l'll get to town by noon tomorrow.

563
01:10:17,287 --> 01:10:18,276
l've...

564
01:10:19,247 --> 01:10:20,885
l've got something to tell you.

565
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,880
-lf l don't tell you now...
-No, please, don't.

566
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:27,519
l couldn't...

567
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,559
l can't hear you. So, please...

568
01:10:31,367 --> 01:10:32,356
This time...

569
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:35,079
...let me do the talking.

570
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,961
-l've learned a new poem.
-Yes.

571
01:10:40,287 --> 01:10:41,640
A poem.

572
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:47,322
''Stay by my side as my light grows dim,...

573
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,646
...as my blood slows down...

574
01:10:51,327 --> 01:10:53,761
...and my nerves shatter with stabbing pain...

575
01:10:55,447 --> 01:10:57,039
...as my heart grows weak...

576
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,278
...and the wheels of my being turn slowly.

577
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:04,036
Stay by my side...

578
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:07,556
...as my fragile body is racked by pain...

579
01:11:08,807 --> 01:11:10,126
...which verges on truth...

580
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,160
...and manic time...

581
01:11:15,247 --> 01:11:16,726
...continues scattering dust...

582
01:11:17,887 --> 01:11:20,276
...and furious life bursts out in flames.

583
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:24,321
Stay by my side...

584
01:11:25,567 --> 01:11:26,716
...as l fade...

585
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,956
...so you can point to the end of my struggle...

586
01:11:35,647 --> 01:11:36,682
...and the twilight...

587
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:41,440
...of eternal days...

588
01:11:45,487 --> 01:11:48,285
...at the low, dark edge of life.''

589
01:11:57,407 --> 01:11:58,396
Miss...

590
01:12:06,647 --> 01:12:07,921
A grain of strength.

591
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:39,956
Carlos, look.

592
01:12:45,607 --> 01:12:46,596
Dr Casares...

593
01:13:04,647 --> 01:13:06,365
That son of a bitch...

594
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:15,118
l should have killed him when l had the chance.

595
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:16,916
But he'll be back.

596
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:19,556
And l'll be here...

597
01:13:21,207 --> 01:13:22,276
...waiting for him.

598
01:13:24,647 --> 01:13:25,636
Carlitos...

599
01:13:27,207 --> 01:13:28,196
...bring me...

600
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,597
...my records, my music.

601
01:13:33,527 --> 01:13:35,438
l need them. All right?

602
01:14:10,007 --> 01:14:10,996
Are you hungry?

603
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:14,637
''Eat beans, good for the heart.

604
01:14:14,927 --> 01:14:15,916
The more you eat, the more you fart.''

605
01:14:19,447 --> 01:14:20,482
My stomach's all upset.

606
01:14:21,327 --> 01:14:23,045
But the little ones might be hungry.

607
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:31,441
Could you kill someone?

608
01:14:35,007 --> 01:14:35,996
l could.

609
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:38,566
What you said about Santi is true.

610
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:40,116
He's dead.

611
01:14:41,887 --> 01:14:43,002
But l didn't kill him.

612
01:14:44,767 --> 01:14:46,962
-l thought...
-l was with him.

613
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:49,516
l saw everything.

614
01:14:51,607 --> 01:14:52,676
lt started in the pit.

615
01:14:54,247 --> 01:14:57,876
l dared him to come down with me
at night to gather slugs.

616
01:15:39,807 --> 01:15:41,286
Run, Jaime. Jacinto's here.

617
01:15:58,727 --> 01:16:00,126
-What did you see?
-Nothing.

618
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:01,356
-Did you see the safe?
-No.

619
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:08,556
Did you see the safe?

620
01:16:12,807 --> 01:16:13,796
Why the fuck are you in here?

621
01:16:16,087 --> 01:16:17,076
Who was with you?

622
01:16:32,447 --> 01:16:33,436
Get up.

623
01:16:35,727 --> 01:16:36,716
Get up.

624
01:19:25,607 --> 01:19:26,596
l was a coward.

625
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,485
l was always afraid of Jacinto.

626
01:19:33,287 --> 01:19:34,276
Very afraid.

627
01:19:35,807 --> 01:19:36,842
But not anymore.

628
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:42,204
The next time l see him...

629
01:19:43,127 --> 01:19:44,355
...l know l'm going to kill him.

630
01:20:17,807 --> 01:20:18,796
Look who's here.

631
01:20:23,367 --> 01:20:24,356
What'll he do?

632
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:35,360
Say you're sorry and get in the car.

633
01:20:38,607 --> 01:20:39,642
l'm not scared of you.

634
01:20:41,007 --> 01:20:42,520
You're making me look like a fool.

635
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:45,438
Say you're sorry, they're looking at us.

636
01:20:49,447 --> 01:20:50,436
l'm not afraid of you.

637
01:21:01,007 --> 01:21:01,996
Say you're sorry.

638
01:21:08,207 --> 01:21:09,242
You're an animal.

639
01:22:04,327 --> 01:22:06,557
Doctor, l did what you told me.

640
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:08,316
l did what you told me.

641
01:22:09,207 --> 01:22:10,845
But Owl's wound is still bleeding.

642
01:22:13,247 --> 01:22:14,236
Conchita...

643
01:22:18,247 --> 01:22:19,236
Someone's coming.

644
01:22:22,447 --> 01:22:23,516
Someone's coming, dootor!

645
01:22:25,647 --> 01:22:26,762
Help me on my feet.

646
01:22:27,807 --> 01:22:29,081
Jaime, put on the record.

647
01:22:30,167 --> 01:22:31,395
Turn the horn towards the window.

648
01:22:56,527 --> 01:22:57,676
Didn't you say he was dead?

649
01:23:00,167 --> 01:23:01,156
Bastard!

650
01:23:03,727 --> 01:23:05,922
Nobody knows anything. We're going to wait.

651
01:23:19,487 --> 01:23:20,886
They're leaving!

652
01:23:34,127 --> 01:23:35,401
All my life l've always stopped short...

653
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:38,160
...left things unfinished.

654
01:23:40,447 --> 01:23:42,836
l'm not going to leave you alone, l promise you.

655
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:48,681
l will never leave this place.

656
01:24:15,887 --> 01:24:17,002
We'll wait for you upstairs.

657
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:37,602
l'm not going to run away.

658
01:24:40,047 --> 01:24:41,241
l want to talk to you.

659
01:24:52,127 --> 01:24:53,116
Nothing.

660
01:24:54,087 --> 01:24:55,076
They must have driven on.

661
01:25:20,847 --> 01:25:22,997
Tell me, what do you want?

662
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:25,555
Jacinto.

663
01:25:30,447 --> 01:25:32,722
Bring him to me.

664
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:34,756
l understand.

665
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:39,841
l'm going to help you.

666
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:45,636
Jaime! l saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!

667
01:26:01,567 --> 01:26:02,920
l had to break the old man's fingers.

668
01:26:05,567 --> 01:26:06,556
Even dead, he's stubborn.

669
01:26:13,887 --> 01:26:15,240
Hurry up! Come on!

670
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:24,366
There's something here!

671
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:26,475
Marcelo! Out of the way!

672
01:26:33,407 --> 01:26:36,399
Fucking great.
lt wasn't a complete waste of time.

673
01:26:46,567 --> 01:26:47,716
This is yours, isn't it?

674
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:32,836
We have to get out of here.

675
01:27:40,087 --> 01:27:41,679
One of us has to climb through the window.

676
01:27:45,487 --> 01:27:46,602
And then open the door.

677
01:27:47,327 --> 01:27:48,316
And what then?

678
01:27:49,487 --> 01:27:50,476
What's wrong?

679
01:27:51,247 --> 01:27:52,236
You scared?

680
01:27:53,207 --> 01:27:54,196
Yea, l am, asshole.

681
01:27:54,927 --> 01:27:56,485
You're not wounded, like Owl is.

682
01:27:57,447 --> 01:27:59,517
You're not bleeding, you're not even hurt.

683
01:28:01,447 --> 01:28:02,436
Santi is dead.

684
01:28:03,567 --> 01:28:04,556
Jacinto killed him.

685
01:28:06,527 --> 01:28:07,880
lf we stay here, he'll kill us all.

686
01:28:10,647 --> 01:28:12,000
Do you want to sit and wait?

687
01:28:13,727 --> 01:28:14,921
You think that he'll let us go?

688
01:28:17,087 --> 01:28:18,805
That it'll all work out if we behave?

689
01:28:22,087 --> 01:28:23,122
They have the rifle.

690
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:25,877
They're bigger than us, and stronger.

691
01:28:33,007 --> 01:28:34,235
Yes, but there's more of us.

692
01:28:51,847 --> 01:28:52,836
Wait!

693
01:29:03,207 --> 01:29:05,402
Wait. Check if they're still working.

694
01:29:12,207 --> 01:29:13,435
Go on.

695
01:29:15,047 --> 01:29:16,366
All right.

696
01:29:31,447 --> 01:29:33,005
Galvez, did you hurt yourself?

697
01:29:35,367 --> 01:29:36,356
A bit.

698
01:29:50,727 --> 01:29:51,716
fuck!

699
01:29:52,647 --> 01:29:53,636
Look again!

700
01:29:55,407 --> 01:29:58,763
There,s nothing here but souvenirs,
photographs! Just crap!

701
01:30:01,367 --> 01:30:03,562
One of us has to go out and get Galvez.

702
01:30:04,487 --> 01:30:05,476
Who'll do it?

703
01:30:05,887 --> 01:30:06,876
l'll go.

704
01:30:07,607 --> 01:30:10,246
No, not you. l'll go, l'm skinnier.

705
01:30:28,567 --> 01:30:29,556
Who opened it?

706
01:30:45,887 --> 01:30:47,400
Dr. Casares opened the door.

707
01:30:51,327 --> 01:30:54,478
He said l'd be all right,
and that we should be brave.

708
01:31:04,767 --> 01:31:06,678
There's no fucking gold here! You hear me?

709
01:31:08,727 --> 01:31:09,716
You and your fancy ideas!

710
01:31:10,487 --> 01:31:11,476
fuck!

711
01:31:14,047 --> 01:31:15,116
Gold, gold... My ass!

712
01:31:22,487 --> 01:31:23,476
My father.

713
01:31:24,967 --> 01:31:25,956
He was from Canada.

714
01:31:28,407 --> 01:31:29,396
He was an accountant.

715
01:31:33,807 --> 01:31:34,796
My mother was from Toledo.

716
01:31:37,047 --> 01:31:38,036
And that's me.

717
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:40,836
lt's blurred, 'cause l moved.

718
01:31:42,487 --> 01:31:43,476
But that's me.

719
01:31:44,007 --> 01:31:45,360
We're leaving tomorrow.

720
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:50,237
Pig, do you think your brother in Portugal
could put us up?

721
01:31:51,407 --> 01:31:52,681
We don't have much time.

722
01:31:58,647 --> 01:32:01,115
''How lonely, the prince without a kingdom...

723
01:32:02,527 --> 01:32:03,516
...the man without warmth.

724
01:32:05,007 --> 01:32:07,043
Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga.''

725
01:32:16,887 --> 01:32:17,876
l saw that gold.

726
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:19,756
lt's here.

727
01:32:20,967 --> 01:32:22,036
We just have to look for it.

728
01:32:27,007 --> 01:32:28,759
We'll find it, and tomorrow we'll burn everything.

729
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:29,996
And the boys?

730
01:32:30,767 --> 01:32:31,756
They've got no parents.

731
01:32:32,807 --> 01:32:34,877
They've got no one. Who'll miss them?

732
01:32:38,047 --> 01:32:39,036
We're at war.

733
01:32:40,767 --> 01:32:42,405
A drop in the ocean.

734
01:32:46,727 --> 01:32:47,716
Look, Jacinto.

735
01:32:48,367 --> 01:32:50,676
Burn the place, kill the kids, l don't give a shit.

736
01:32:52,047 --> 01:32:53,719
But we're getting out of here tomorrow.

737
01:33:10,927 --> 01:33:13,839
-We need stuff from the car.
-Hurry up.

738
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:15,996
l'll need a hand.

739
01:33:18,487 --> 01:33:19,476
Come on, Pig.

740
01:34:05,407 --> 01:34:07,045
You're crazy, asshole!

741
01:34:07,647 --> 01:34:09,046
fuck you!

742
01:34:11,607 --> 01:34:13,757
No, fuck you! lt's all for me.

743
01:34:43,167 --> 01:34:44,282
Son of a bitch!

744
01:35:39,527 --> 01:35:40,562
What a joke!

745
01:35:56,407 --> 01:35:57,601
Calvez, you go over there.

746
01:36:09,167 --> 01:36:10,600
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle.

747
01:36:29,247 --> 01:36:30,236
Santi...

748
01:38:10,527 --> 01:38:11,721
What is a ghost?

749
01:38:12,967 --> 01:38:16,562
A tragedy condemned to repeat itself
time and again?

750
01:38:19,207 --> 01:38:21,118
A moment of pain, perhaps.

751
01:38:28,207 --> 01:38:30,846
Something dead whioh still seems to be alive.

752
01:38:35,487 --> 01:38:37,842
An emotion suspended in time.

753
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:47,840
Like a blurred photograph.

754
01:38:58,007 --> 01:38:59,998
Like an insect trapped in amber.

755
01:39:15,767 --> 01:39:16,756
A ghost.

756
01:39:18,607 --> 01:39:19,596
That's what l am.

757
01:39:30,167 --> 01:39:32,123
TO MY PARENTS
