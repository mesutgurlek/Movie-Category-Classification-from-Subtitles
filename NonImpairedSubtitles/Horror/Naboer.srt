1
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,113
Hi.

2
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,473
Hi.

3
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,194
Aren't you going to let me in?

4
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,834
Of course.
Come in.

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,196
Is someone here?

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,470
No, I'm all alone.

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,919
- Would you like something to drink?
- No. I'm just here for my things.

8
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,479
You won't find them there.

9
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,270
I've already packed them.

10
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,198
I'll get them.

11
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,755
How are you doing?

12
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,719
You can't go on like this.

13
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,914
- You need to get a life.
- I have a life, like everyone else.

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,352
- Don't smoke in here.
- You have to get a grip.

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,033
We were talking about you yesterday.

16
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,471
That's when I remembered
to pick up my stuff.

17
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,955
Why were you talking about me?

18
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,835
흆e wondered why we broke up.
I had to tell him.

19
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,637
- What did you say?
- I told him why.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,276
Told him about it.
How things were.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,550
Shouldn't I have?

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,799
- You had no right to do that.
- Sure I did.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,278
We have decided to share everything
in our relationship.

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,358
What?

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,713
Is he outside?

26
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,356
Yes. He didn't want me
to come up here alone.

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,430
We decided he could honk and
I would wave if everything was OK.

28
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,200
Was he worried I would hurt you?

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,996
I could never hurt you.
I only wanted what was best for us.

30
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,189
Ingrid?

31
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,995
NEXT DOOR

32
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,593
A film by
P휤 SLETAUNE

33
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,110
Excuse me.

34
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,754
Could you do me a favor?

35
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,076
What did you have in mind?

36
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,478
I live over here, and have
something heavy I need moved.

37
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,513
I can't do it myself.

38
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,598
No problem.
I'll be over shortly.

39
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,555
Can't you come right now?
Do you have anything else to do?

40
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,354
No, I just thought...

41
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,435
- My name is Anne.
- John.

42
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,631
I know.

43
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,671
Excuse me for disappearing.
I had to take care of something.

44
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,668
- What are those doing there?
- Don't you have it like that?

45
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,552
No.

46
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,793
Different strokes for different folks,
I guess. Do you mind?

47
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,474
- No, of course not.
- I need this cabinet moved over there.

48
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,796
You can do it.

49
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,354
You sure are strong,
to be able to move that.

50
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,720
I hope it's worth it.

51
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,553
I don't understand.

52
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,396
- I'm Kim.
- John, your neighbor.

53
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,318
I know.

54
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,189
- It goes in front of the door.
- But I have to get out.

55
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,359
I forgot. I'll do it afterward.
Come and have a drink.

56
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,994
I think I'll just head home.

57
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,478
Are you so busy you don't
have time for a glass of wine?

58
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,110
Have a seat.

59
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,190
That wasn't so hard, was it?

60
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,875
Excuse me.

61
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,512
Don't you wonder why we want
that cabinet in front of the door?

62
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,713
Different strokes
for different folks.

63
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,869
That was just something I said.
I don't think people are different at all.

64
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,071
What do you think, Kim?

65
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,034
People are pretty much the same,
or totally different.

66
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,038
See?
Go ahead and ask.

67
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,951
OK. Why do you do it? Why put
a cabinet in front of the door?

68
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,276
Why do you think?

69
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,072
I don't know.

70
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,233
Why do you think two women,
two attractive women. - 

71
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,353
- Have to put a heavy cabinet
in front of their door?

72
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,914
Is that so hard to understand?

73
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,315
No, not at all.

74
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,475
Who are they
protecting themselves against?

75
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,752
- A man?
- Not bad.

76
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,115
- What does this man want?
- To get in.

77
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,958
Excellent.

78
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,350
Why does he want to get in?

79
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,634
Because he is attracted to
one of them. Or both.

80
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,039
Do you find it strange
that he is attracted to them?

81
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,798
No.

82
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,594
Do you think it's mutual?

83
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,594
No.

84
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,713
What do you think, Kim?

85
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,152
Not bad.

86
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
No, not bad at all.

87
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,869
Some more wine?

88
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,236
- No, thanks. I think I'll head home.
- And do what?

89
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,718
You don't have anything to do there
since your girlfriend ran off.

90
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,440
What do you mean?

91
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,594
What do you know about that?

92
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,075
Your apartment is next door.

93
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,229
We can't avoid hearing
what goes on in there.

94
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,155
- You've been listening?
- Of course not.

95
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,635
Why would that interest us?

96
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,671
Calm down.

97
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,389
It wasn't our fault
that she left you.

98
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,559
She wasn't right for you. It was
embarrassing to see you together.

99
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,399
- You talked to her?
- Why would we do that?

100
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,833
- How could you know this otherwise?
- That's what it's like to live next door.

101
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,316
John?

102
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,191
John?

103
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,428
Could you do me one more favor?

104
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,315
No.

105
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,116
I need to pick up some medicine
and can't leave my sister alone.

106
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,756
This isn't my problem.

107
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,235
She was assaulted.

108
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,319
She was assaulted.

109
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,348
Out here.

110
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,033
By the man who lived
in your apartment before you.

111
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,390
The man who lived here?

112
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,390
He jumped her
and dragged her into his apartment.

113
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,712
He did terrible things to her.
Didn't let her go until the next day.

114
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,630
Since then she hasn't dared go out.

115
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,915
What happened to him?

116
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,237
We pressed charges,
but no one believed her.

117
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,557
- He wasn't arrested?
- He just disappeared.

118
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,797
No one knows what became of him.

119
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,833
That's why
she doesn't dare go anywhere.

120
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,077
Is that why
you have so many things...

121
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,558
Kim wants to be prepared
in case we have to isolate ourselves.

122
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,558
Can't you stay with her for ten
minutes while I run to the pharmacy?

123
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,190
Lock the door
and put the cabinet in front of it.

124
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,436
Is that really necessary?

125
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,839
She'll panic if she sees it's
not there. We don't want that, do we?

126
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,598
Go on in.
I'll be back shortly.

127
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,350
The cabinet.

128
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,917
- I thought you had left.
- Your sister had to...

129
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,236
What sister?

130
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,477
- Anne.
- She isn't my sister.

131
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,594
She said she was.

132
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,508
Why would she bother lying
about something like that?

133
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,912
Did she lie about anything else?
Say anything about me?

134
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,954
- She told me about what happened.
- What?

135
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,315
About that terrible assault.

136
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,839
And that you...

137
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,152
Did she say that?
That I had been assaulted?

138
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,190
That's a new one.
And you believed her?

139
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,193
Why would she lie about that?

140
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,472
Do I look like I've been assaulted?

141
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,594
- I don't know if you can see that.
- That wasn't what I asked.

142
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,109
Do I look like
someone who has been assaulted?

143
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,833
Where are you going?
Wait!

144
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,673
Stop it!

145
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,150
Do you like my room?

146
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,669
Give me the key!

147
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,033
- Have you been here before?
- What? Of course not!

148
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,233
You have.
You just don't recognize it.

149
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,549
Bring me the key now.

150
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,955
I don't want to be here.

151
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,918
Are you angry at me?

152
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,998
You are.
Then I don't want to talk to you.

153
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,031
Hello?

154
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,358
Kim?

155
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,352
Kim!

156
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,877
Kim, I'm not angry.

157
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,430
I'm not angry.

158
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,351
Were you very sad
when your girlfriend left?

159
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,560
- Yes.
- How sad?

160
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,516
So sad
that you no longer wanted to live?

161
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,757
I heard she cheated on you.

162
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,835
Wasn't that horrible,
when you realized she...

163
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,236
Did you ever think
she would leave you?

164
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,318
I wish I could meet a man
as certain as you.

165
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,669
There's a chair
to the right of the door.

166
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,711
On the seat you'll find the key
to the door at the end of the room.

167
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,795
Anne had another line installed.

168
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,314
Pretty smart, huh?
So you can call from room to room.

169
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,070
Real smart.

170
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,318
You like it?
This is where I live.

171
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,435
That's not true.

172
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,710
- Can you let me out now?
- So soon?

173
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,551
We're finally getting
to know each other.

174
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,716
I have no business here.

175
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,673
"I have no business here."

176
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,235
I'm not letting you out
when you're this angry.

177
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,912
- I'm not angry.
- Listen to yourself: "I'm not angry!"

178
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,954
- What do you want?
- I want to talk.

179
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,992
Have a seat.

180
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,032
Sit down.

181
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,040
Do you think I have had many men?

182
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,434
I have no idea.

183
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,676
What do you think?

184
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,591
Anne was once with two men
on the same night.

185
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,830
- Do you think that's possible?
- Probably.

186
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,919
It was in Greece,
or somewhere like that.

187
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,510
Would it turn you on to be
with a woman who had just had sex?

188
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,280
I don't think so.

189
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,758
Why are you lying?
You think it would be a turn-on.

190
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,630
Let me tell you a story first,
then I'll let you out.

191
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,389
- What kind of a story?
- You'll hear.

192
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,636
I'm about to start.
Close your eyes.

193
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,879
- Why?
- I want you to picture it.

194
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,199
One day, about a month ago,
there was a knock at the door.

195
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,674
I opened it.
There were three men -

196
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,272
- In plumber's garb...
What are they called?

197
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,309
Overalls.

198
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,878
They look at me,
then come into the hall.

199
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,754
I'm hardly wearing anything.
I had just come from the shower.

200
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,959
They look at me.

201
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,872
I can tell they are horny.

202
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,597
I say, "Why don't we sit down
on the couch first?"

203
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,516
We sit down.

204
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,995
Suddenly
the one who's sitting next to me -

205
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,476
- Sticks his hand between my legs -

206
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,111
- And starts caressing me.

207
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,470
The other one pulls down his pants
and stands in front of me.

208
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,035
I take him in my mouth -

209
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,269
- And start blowing him.

210
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,954
Then the third man comes up
and bends me over the couch.

211
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,678
He bends me over
and forces his way in from behind.

212
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,793
Suddenly I feel the other one
come in my mouth.

213
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,878
It runs down my throat.

214
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,678
Then they take me one at a time.

215
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,072
It hurts a little,
but I soon get used to it.

216
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,078
Did you like my story?

217
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,716
Didn't you?

218
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,914
I was just kidding.
Do you think I did that?

219
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,839
I just read it somewhere.

220
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,394
Come sit over here.

221
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,000
Come over here.

222
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,434
What are you doing?

223
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,069
That's enough!
Stop!

224
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,716
Touch me.

225
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,595
Do that again.

226
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,990
- Hi there.
- Hi.

227
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,555
- How's it going?
- Fine.

228
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,672
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing.

229
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,235
Your face is bruised.

230
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,956
- I bumped myself moving a cabinet.
- Are you refurnishing?

231
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,069
- Looks like you got a beating.
- Who would do that?

232
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,918
I have no idea.

233
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,788
If there's anything
you want to talk about...

234
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,911
Thanks for your concern.

235
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,358
Those are not coming in here!
Look how much we already have!

236
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,798
- I can take them.
- No, you can't. You aren't even well!

237
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,434
Now you'll be stuck here
until the wee hours.

238
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,438
It's no problem.

239
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,792
You always say yes. That was
probably your problem with Ingrid.

240
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,797
Don't mention Ingrid.

241
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,913
Could you look up a number for me?

242
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,669
36 Swartzdorf Street, 5th floor.

243
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,870
Yes, that is my number.

244
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,998
Don't you have any other numbers
on the 5th floor?

245
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,871
How about unlisted numbers?

246
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,795
No?

247
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,951
<i>Hi, you hav</i>e <i>called Ingrid. </i>
<i>Please leave a m</i>e<i>ssag</i>e.

248
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,714
Hi, it's John.

249
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,233
I was just wondering
how you were doing.

250
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,717
I'm... much better now.

251
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,879
I feel much better now.

252
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,393
I was wondering -

253
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:11,039
- If we could get together
for coffee, or something?

254
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,191
Have a talk.

255
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,473
I'm sorry -

256
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,478
- About what happened last time.

257
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,478
I behaved like an idiot.

258
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,033
Anyway...

259
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,509
- What else did you tell him?
- This and that.

260
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,188
- Like what?
- Stuff.

261
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,472
- What kind of stuff?
- Stuff that happened.

262
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,033
Like what?

263
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,949
That was an accident.

264
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,912
Was it?

265
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,075
Did you tell him
I did that on purpose?

266
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,833
We agreed that it was an accident.

267
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,430
I thought so at the time.
Now, I'm not so sure.

268
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,509
- It slipped out of my hand!
- You poured hot coffee over my arm.

269
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,199
You can't go around
telling lies like that about me!

270
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,597
흆e made me realize
it wasn't an accident.

271
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,109
He wasn't even there!

272
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,951
- He asked what we did afterward.
- I took you to the emergency room.

273
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,392
The emergency room?

274
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,436
Isn't that what I did?

275
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,517
We had sex.

276
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,950
For the first time in six months.
It turned you on. Remember?

277
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,630
That had nothing to do with it.

278
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,516
흆e thought that sounded sick,
to get turned on by burning me.

279
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,309
You know what I think is sick?

280
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,399
This 흆e person
who asks his girlfriend -

281
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,037
- About who she has had sex with,
and when and how.

282
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,597
흆e thinks it's important that
we tell each other everything.

283
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,033
- Is he outside?
- Yes.

284
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,834
Was he worried I would hurt you?

285
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,511
I could never hurt you.
I only wanted what was best for us.

286
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,077
Ingrid? What has he done to you?
You were never like this before.

287
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,635
I wasn't myself before.
Now I am.

288
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,479
- Ingrid...
- I told him everything.

289
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,389
How I had to make up crazy stories
to turn you on.

290
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,989
- But that isn't true.
- Isn't it?

291
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,751
You got turned on when I told you
I had sex with other men.

292
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,235
- Please stop.
- No!

293
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,269
Maybe you want to hear it again?

294
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,268
How three men
were standing outside the door.

295
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,110
How they took me on the couch.
Is that the story you want me to tell?

296
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,359
How a man comes in
and starts fucking me from behind.

297
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,755
How he comes inside me.

298
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,758
Oh, John, I'm so horny...

299
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,593
John, I'm so horny...

300
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,711
Who is it?

301
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,838
John.
Your neighbor.

302
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,109
What do you want?

303
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,629
I just want to talk.

304
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,958
I've had a pretty lousy day.

305
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,272
- Me too.
- What did you want to talk about?

306
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,678
I was wondering why I've
never heard a sound from in here.

307
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,678
We can be pretty quiet.

308
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,759
No one can be that quiet.
What do you do in here?

309
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,996
We're waiting.

310
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,829
For that mystery man
who supposedly is going to break in?

311
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,236
You expect me to still believe that?

312
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,749
Why can't we stop
all this lying and sneaking around?

313
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,111
Never mind.

314
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,760
Why are you so angry at Ingrid?

315
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,396
We heard everything.
Through the wall.

316
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,554
What did you hear?

317
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,317
We just had a little argument.

318
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,756
- What's so wrong with that?
- What are you going to do about it?

319
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,833
I think she wants to talk to you.

320
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,957
Anne?

321
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,834
Open the door.

322
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,950
Stop kidding around.

323
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,472
Hello?

324
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,832
You know you aren't allowed in there.

325
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,272
Someone else is here.
I saw a man.

326
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,313
It's just you and me.
The door is locked.

327
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,512
- I saw someone.
- It must have been Anne.

328
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,234
- Why do you keep locking me in?
- Why did you hit me yesterday?

329
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,158
Why did you hit me yesterday?

330
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,991
- Kim, you started hitting...
- You didn't have to hit back.

331
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,830
You're stronger than me.
You could have just held my arms.

332
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,839
You're right.
I could have.

333
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,875
Please, not now.

334
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,716
Do you think I have had many men?

335
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,115
I have no idea.

336
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,310
She was once with two men on the
same night. Think that's possible?

337
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,033
Probably.

338
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,316
It wasn't here. She was on vacation.
In Greece, or somewhere.

339
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,198
Would it turn you on to be
with a woman who had just had sex?

340
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,675
Would you find that exciting?

341
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,350
I don't think so.

342
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,396
Who are you?

343
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,556
I'm on my way out.

344
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,956
You're John, aren't you?
I'm 흆e.

345
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,712
Hasn't Ingrid told you that we...

346
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,272
Yes, she told me.

347
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,799
She has talked about you too.

348
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,438
- What has she said?
- The usual.

349
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,236
It's only natural to talk about
your ex. Don't you think so?

350
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,156
She was worried about you.
Are you doing better now?

351
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,668
Promise you'll tell me -

352
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,475
- If there's anything
I can do for you.

353
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,511
Promise?

354
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,835
Are you angry?

355
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,318
I can't stand it
when people are angry.

356
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,670
- No.
- No what?

357
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,713
- No, I'm not angry.
- That's good.

358
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,839
We should sit down
for a real talk some time.

359
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,918
You could give me some tips.

360
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,954
- About what?
- About what Ingrid likes, of course.

361
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,836
So I can get to know her better.

362
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,554
Do you want to leave?

363
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,478
Try this.

364
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,190
Doesn't it fit?

365
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,512
Ingrid told me about the coffee.

366
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,069
That wasn't nice.

367
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,355
I'm not one to judge people, but...

368
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,268
That's inexcusable.

369
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,679
May I ask you a question?

370
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,032
Is Ingrid that type?

371
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,313
I've always considered her
a careful woman.

372
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,431
Haven't you?

373
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,553
I didn't think she'd go for
that kind of treatment.

374
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:59,712
But I got the impression
it turned her on. Didn't you too?

375
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,118
You were wrong
the whole time you were together.

376
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,154
She wasn't
the innocent little girl you thought.

377
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,109
I think she liked what you did.
She's one of those.

378
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,354
She liked it, John.

379
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,390
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

380
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,912
John, you've never experienced
anything more intense. Isn't that right?

381
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,390
It's nothing to be afraid of, John.

382
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,397
It's too late.

383
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,309
You've already done it.

384
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,557
Don't you remember?

385
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,356
Don't you remember?

386
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,675
You asked us
to take care of her for you.

387
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,230
That isn't true!

388
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,718
You should love her, John.
You weren't supposed to kill her.

389
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,434
I haven't killed anyone!

390
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,191
Go look.

391
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,715
She's in there.

392
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,072
Go look.

393
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,510
What's going on?

394
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,149
These are my things.

395
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,511
This is from work.

396
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,955
Where did you get this?

397
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,751
And this.

398
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,789
I got this from my sister.

399
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,916
Please tell me what you have done!

400
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,788
Why are my things in here?

401
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,551
These are my things!

402
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,592
Just go in.

403
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,552
She's in there.
Go on in.

404
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,194
Hello?

405
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,233
Hello?

406
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,919
Hello?

407
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,550
What have you done?

408
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,638
John?

409
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,148
- Are you there, John?
- Go away.

410
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,709
It's me.
Peter.

411
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,796
Peter who?

412
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,595
Peter Reis.
What's going on?

413
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,071
What do you want?

414
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,914
I need you to look at something.

415
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,997
What's happened to you?
Are you sick?

416
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,629
What has happened in there?
What are you doing?

417
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,593
- Don't you have it like this?
- No.

418
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,308
Different strokes
for different folks, I guess.

419
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,196
- What are you talking about?
- Or else we're all the same.

420
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,594
Ingrid used to say that.

421
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,190
Either we're different,
or we're the same.

422
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,913
May I ask you something?

423
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,918
You're in the hallway
right now, aren't you?

424
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,079
Yes.

425
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,430
What do you see?

426
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,273
A wall with a hole in it.

427
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,519
You don't see the neighbors' door?

428
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,871
Of course not.
You're the only one up here.

429
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,559
Can I come in?

430
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,799
What are you doing in there?
What's that smell? John!

431
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,313
- What's going on?
- Go away!

432
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,669
John!

433
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,630
John, I'm so horny...

434
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,553
I should have left you ages ago!

435
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:33,519
I'll scream for 흆e
if you don't let me go.

436
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,237
Go ahead.

437
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,758
흆e!

438
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,875
흆e!

439
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,394
흆e!

440
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,592
Help!

441
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,118
John?

442
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,753
John?

443
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,710
- Hi.
- Hi.

444
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,356
Sleep OK?

445
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,397
- Haven't you slept?
- No.

446
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:52,479
What have you been doing?
Sitting there all night?

447
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:55,797
- Are you still angry?
- Angry?

448
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,031
No, you don't understand.
I'm not angry.

449
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,470
I'm just tired.

450
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,474
Then come to bed.

451
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,435
You know that I would never
hurt you in any way, right?

452
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,192
Of course.

453
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,597
I would never
do anything to hurt you.

454
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,233
Not deliberately.

455
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,149
Of course I know
you would never hurt me.

456
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,669
Why do you say that?

457
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,315
