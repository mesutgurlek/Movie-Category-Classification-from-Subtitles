The shadow monster woke up.

5
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,810
It saw the boy
in the pot and said:

6

"Mmm. I'm starving."

7

"I'm going to eat you up."

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,570

his mouth wide and...

the little tailor whole.

27

I know, I know!

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,489
