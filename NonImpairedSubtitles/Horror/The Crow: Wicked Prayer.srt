Like some more salsa with that?

2
00:02:55,776 --> 00:03:00,599
Get back to work. or "m docking
your severance pay when the mine closes.

3
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:06,424
I fear that you have awakened a sleeping
giant. and filled him with a terrible resolve.

4
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:08,832
Get back to work.

5
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:50,024
Save our jobs. Save our jobs.
Save our jobs. Save our jobs.

Attention all units.
Riot in progress at Lake Ravasu Mine.

<i>- Cover his face. Cover his face.

He who liveth by the sword
shall die by the sword.

10
00:06:27,224 --> 00:06:31,600
He who liveth
by the sword shall die by the sword.

11
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:35,950
An eye for an eye
will make you blind.

12
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:39,822
An eye for an eye
will make you blind.

13
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:44,371
He who liveth by the sword
shall die by the sword...

<i>Get the gun. get the gun...</i>

17
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:07,098
With War. there is no substitute for victory.

18
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,970
Lead the way. Mr. Crash.

19

lt's your wedding night.
you dirty old bastard.

So. this one time. "m buying the hookers.

<i>Cuidado. homes.</i>

22
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:49,051
Your local Satanic cult is back in black.

23
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:52,928
The Four Horsemen ride again.

24
00:07:58,082 --> 00:07:59,992
No prisoners. homes.

25
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:14,239
Just kidding.

26
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,341
How's it going. Lo?

27
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,609
Better. now that "m with you.

28
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:34,177
- Will you marry me. Lola Byrne?
- Till death do us part. Luc Crash.

29
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:53,373
Praise the Lord.
it's almost time for Jesus to rise up.

30
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:58,238
<i>As preacher. I expect the flock to be in
the church tomorrow on Easter morning.</i>

31
00:08:58,313 --> 00:09:03,103
<i>As tribal chairman. I invite you
to party the night away at Rave-N Fest.</i>

32

He found himself in mystic places.

33
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:11,210
<i>Tonight. as we celebrate
the birth of the crow.</i>

34
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:14,057
<i>and the coming
of our Raven Aztec Casino.</i>

35
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:16,544
<i>Hallelujah. hallelujah!</i>

36
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,724

<i>And don't forget to eat
your 1 2 lucky grapes for dinner.</i>

38

<i>One for each month of the coming year.</i>

39
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:29,666
<i>This Spanish custom worked wonders
for our conquistador conquerors.</i>

40
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,683
<i>and it'll work wonders for you.</i>

41
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:36,263
<i>'Cause the name of our lucky tribe
is the Raven Aztecs.</i>

42
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:45,160
Barnaby. there comes
a time in every man's life

43
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,988
when he's just got to face the fact that
the contents of his fridge just ain't cutting it.

44
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:54,286
<i>And now. I want to introduce
our shaman and my daughter.</i>

45

<i>Lily Ignites The Dawn.</i>

46
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,681
In times like these.

47
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:32,520
<i>when our community is divided.</i>

48
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:35,530
<i>and we hear calls for vengeance.</i>

49
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:39,281
it's important to remember the old stories.

50
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:45,707
Killer! Murderer!

51
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,537
We are told
that when someone dies...

52
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,881
Convict!

53
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,528
...the crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

54
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:55,500
<i>- Then sometimes. just sometimes...
- You hear me? I called you convict.</i>

55
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:57,297
<i>-...the crow can bring that soul back...
- Shit. here he comes.</i>

56
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,334
<i>...to release it of its burden.</i>

57
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:03,440
To put the wrong things right.

58
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:11,121
<i>What gives the crow his strength?</i>

59
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,784
<i>Not hatred.</i>

60
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:14,514
<i>or bitterness.</i>

61
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:16,177
<i>or anger.</i>

62
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,299
His strength is love.

63

00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,615
Come on. baby.

65
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:57,778
Rave-N Fest? No.

66
00:11:57,853 --> 00:11:59,609
No. Never again.

67
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,190
Come on. I want them
to see you through my eyes.

68
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,291
Lily.

69
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:09,595
I'm off parole at midnight.

70
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:14,646
We can hit the coast
before anybody notices.

71
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:17,588
I want them to notice.

72
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:19,768
I do.

73
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,749
I love you. Jimmy!

74
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,021
You put too much faith in people.

75
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,497
I believe in a lot of things.
Even you. Jimmy Cuervo.

76
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:32,438
I am what I am.

77
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:37,631
If you want to escape from here.
you gotta let it go. You gotta let it all go.

78
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:40,567
I can't. Not without you.

79
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:46,206
Now. that kind of belief
will get you locked up.

80
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:48,511
Set me free. Warden.

81
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:53,824
You know what time I get off.
Don't be late.

82
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:11,228
Lily. "m gonna let it all go.

83
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,887

Have you lost your mind. sis?

lt's takedown time.

88
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:26,931
Spoke to your parole officer today.

89
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:30,444
Oh. nice suit. white trash.

90
00:15:30,517 --> 00:15:32,754
Did you rob a grave?

91
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:37,641
Your jurisdiction ends
on that side of the road. asshole.

92
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:41,460
There isn't much people
on either side of the road can agree on.

93
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:45,356
Except that nobody likes you.
Jimmy Cuervo.

94
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,561
Goddamn. I guess I'll fire my publicist.

95
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:57,683
You better be stopping in to say goodbye.

96
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:15,217
Are you fucking kidding me?

97
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,052
You're lucky.

98
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:35,123
Bullet's still in your hand. asshole.

99
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:42,133
Come midnight tonight. you're free to go.

100
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:44,147
She's not.

101
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:07,287
Lil?

102
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,821
Lily?

103
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,901
Lily?

104
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:16,637
Oh. hell... "m just gonna say it.

105
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,941
Lily lgnites The Dawn...

106
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:22,558

112
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,563
Roses? Lilies would have been better.

113
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:48,735
But hey. it's your funeral.

114
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,232
And you're late. lnjun lover.

115
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,578
- Come on.
- Nobody keeps the Grim Reaper waiting.

116
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,784
- Luc!
- Blue-eyed lnjun.

117
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:05,505
And a cold-hearted killer.

118
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:09,061
Just what the witch doctor ordered.

119
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:13,371
"Romeo. oh. Romeo.
wherefore art thou Romeo?"

120
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,123
Looks like Juliet's left hanging.

121
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:21,026
<i>- Hang these. you bitch.</i>

122
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:24,128
Ugh. God!

123
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,186
I never had the option
to love someone like you.

124
00:18:39,402 --> 00:18:41,541
Is she a firecracker or what?

125
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,090
- Didn't I tell you. Lo?
- Yes. Luc. You told me.

126
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,101
Appetizer was tasty.

127
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,178
Bring on the main dish.

128
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:55,819
She doesn't deserve this.

129
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,257
Please.

130
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:59,593
Please! Luc!

131
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,694
I always liked you. kid.

132
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:06,634
You should have just stayed
on your side of the road.

133
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,610
<i>Perd?name.</i>

134
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:13,226
- "m sorry.
- Jimmy...

135
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,969
The object of war
is not to die for your beliefs.

136
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,235
but to make the other
poor bastards die for theirs.

137
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:30,376
Ever since we were kids in school.

138
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:35,813
I always thought
your eyes were so pretty. Lily.

139
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:39,341
They've seen things.

140
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,415
Mine?

141
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:44,489
They've never seen shit.

142
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,507
Sometimes. if your eyes can't see.
you have to trade 'em in for a new pair.

143
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,381
Time's a-wasting. Lo.

144
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,656
Go in peace with our love.

145
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,596
<i>You will always be in our hearts.</i>

146
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:18,900
<i>Your eyes will watch over us.</i>

147
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:21,648
<i>Your spirit will always be nearby.</i>

148
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:26,836
<i>We will treasure your memory
until we meet again.</i>

149
00:20:26,901 --> 00:20:28,756
Dude. that's Lily.

150
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,820
Take flight. Mother.

151
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,827
Magnificent fuckers. aren't they?

152
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:37,585
You wanted to bone her since you were 1 2.

153
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,996
Yeah.

154
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:43,286
- Keep talking shit about my girl.
- Go get 'em. Tonto.

155
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:10,895
"By sun's dying flame.
and Hades' wicked might"

156
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,319
"l peer into the darkness"

157
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:17,875
"To take hold of the light"

158
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:41,405
Now I have the eyes of a shaman
to unlock the spell.

159
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,457
By sunup. you'll be Satan
and that bitch's tribe will be history.

160
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:53,236
Such a shame.

161
00:21:57,055 --> 00:22:01,758
Without her eyes.
she'll be lost in the spirit world forever.

162
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:06,973
Luc.

163
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,186
Luc.

164
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:16,188
You are gonna fucking die.

165
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:21,121
Ah. Jimbo. you're breaking my heart.

166
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:33,664
Hearts were made to be broken.

167
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:04,224
"The killer's heart by love redeemed"

168
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:09,919
"ln Satan's claw like ruby gleamed"

169
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:57,122
I feel good.

170
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,764
Pestilence? Famine?

171
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:16,778
Take these rags to the dump and burn 'em.

172
00:24:58,644 --> 00:25:01,678
This place has been tearing me down.

173
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:04,945
But "m finally crawling to the top.

174
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:16,947
Shit. That's the freezer
Momma used to lock me up in.

175
00:25:19,382 --> 00:25:23,889
She'd say. "lt's damnation in there.
You ain't never coming out."

176
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:33,142
Damnation sure is a happy place.

177
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,430
Yeah. maybe.

178
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:41,006
If you're dead.

179
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,554
Kick us down a sign.

180
00:26:46,624 --> 00:26:49,624
What do you see with your new eyes?

181
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:57,980
I see the devil rising up.

182
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,279
He's gonna make
all your dreams come true.

183
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:13,243
Eat up. Partake in the deviled ham.
eat of the deviled eggs. and for dessert.

184
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:16,217
feast on devi"s food cake.

185
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:20,091
<i>Al flambeau.</i>

186
00:27:20,163 --> 00:27:24,506
lt's all been dusted
with Lola's magical peyote mix.

187
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:37,083
What is this?

188
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,928
Hm?

189
00:27:40,998 --> 00:27:43,300
Have we all forgotten...

190
00:27:45,382 --> 00:27:48,197
..whose side you're on?

191
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:51,524
Who's been holding you down?

192
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:56,709
Who's gonna shut down the mines.
putting your families out of work.

193
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,874
just so they can open up a casino?

194
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,790
War.

195
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:10,178
Your people. they were enslaved.

196
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:12,355
Hm?

197
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:15,622
Why ain't there a goddamn
government-backed casino

198
00:28:15,689 --> 00:28:18,919
in every street corner of the 'hood? Hm?

199
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:26,625
For every one of them that dies.
ten of us may die.

200
00:28:26,698 --> 00:28:30,561
But in the end. it's they who will tire of War.

201
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:32,544
Now you're talking.

202
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,616
Famine.

203
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:40,033
Famine. You're the nearest thing
to Montezuma for 500 miles.

204
00:28:40,108 --> 00:28:42,727
How come you ain't got
a piece of that Aztec Casino pie?

205
00:28:42,797 --> 00:28:46,594
- Hell. yes. "d eat that shit up.
- Yeah!

206
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:47,945
- Pestilence.
- Huh?

207
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:51,209
Pestilence. do you want to be
a real cowboy?

208
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:57,126
How long you got to live before that toxic
brew spreads cancer through your gut?

209
00:28:58,094 --> 00:29:01,258
Long enough to see the lnjuns burn.

210
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:04,004
Tonight...

211
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:07,398
Satan's gonna walk in my shoes.

212
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,302
'Cause tonight. we'll make 'em hurt.

213
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,318
One by one.

214
00:29:13,392 --> 00:29:16,174
Tonight is about one thing.

215
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:18,350
Revenge.

216
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:20,846
Revenge.

217
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,970
And who needs a wedding invite?
Don't be late.

218
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,936
We have to do this before sunrise
or the power is lost.

219
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:31,944
And we registered for one gift.
A sacrificial virgin

220
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:34,474
to seal our wedding vows.

221
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:59,885
Pestilence. Go down to the bar
and score some more peyote.

222
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:06,446
I'm gonna go visit an old friend.

223
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:33,692
<i>- Oh. my God.</i>

224
00:31:57,826 --> 00:32:00,347
Shut up!

225
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:28,704
Oh. my God. what have I done?

226
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:32,157
Oh. my God. oh. my God!

227
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:01,830
You believed me when nobody else would.

228
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:15,750
For once in my life. I wasn't alone.

229
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:48,173
I always liked you. kid.

230
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:52,101
<i>But you should have stayed
on your side of the road.</i>

231
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,156
Yeah. cut her eyes out!

232
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:12,232
Cut her eyes out!

233
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,720
That heart's beating.

234
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:45,226
What am I?

235
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,700
Hey. Barnaby.

236
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:53,909
They're gonna love you at Rave-N Fest.

237
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,890
I love you.

238
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:09,340
You're not a killer.

239
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:12,803
Murderer!

240
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:36,448
Call the tribal council.
We have to have a meeting.

241
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,455
Tell my father Cuervo's done it again.

242
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:04,649
If there's anyone here
who objects to this couple...

243
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,432
<i>? La la laa. la la laa</i>

244
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,371
? La le lee. la la laa

245
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,511
<i>- Speak now. or forever...
- Hey. Luc.</i>

246
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,988
I bet you that virgin bride
tastes just like cherry pie.

247
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:21,700
Here. don't lose your place.

248
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:23,202
"Out of..." What?

249
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:25,765
Good call. hawkeye.

250
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:35,661
Hello. Moses.

251
00:38:36,238 --> 00:38:38,573
l... I don't want any trouble.

252
00:38:38,638 --> 00:38:41,638
You've done well for yourself.

253
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:46,220
I've waited a long time
for you to find success.

254
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:49,063
- They're all useless sluts.
- Please. son.

255
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:51,984
The only thing I found is God.

256
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:58,894
Who do you think stuffed your collections
box every time the mortgage was overdue?

257
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,521
God?

258
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:04,554
I wanted you to taste success.

259
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:06,600
so I could take it away from you.

260
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:09,424
Who are you?

261
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:14,280
I'll tell you for 47 dollars and 66 cents.

262
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:18,313
Don't you see the resemblance

263
00:39:18,387 --> 00:39:23,406
to the preacher you shot down
for the contents of his collection box?

264
00:39:24,308 --> 00:39:26,927
Wait. I paid for my crime.

265
00:39:28,276 --> 00:39:31,408
I did all this for your father.
to make amends.

266
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:34,926
I'm doing his work.

267
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,884
I've changed.

268
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,858
Hear that?

269
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:40,908
He's changed.

270
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:43,982
Moses.
the wedding food is ready.

271
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:45,647
Shh.

272
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:50,069
Don't hurt her.

273
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:52,687
<i>- Hey. Lo.</i>

274
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:54,996
What? What are you doing?
What are you gonna do...

275
00:39:55,063 --> 00:39:56,689
Pick it up.

276
00:39:56,759 --> 00:40:01,037
If you shoot me first. maybe she'll live.

277
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:03,959
<i>- Moses! Moses!</i>

278
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:06,229
<i>- No! No!</i>

279
00:40:06,297 --> 00:40:10,159
<i>- "ve changed.
- Moses. I need you...</i>

280
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,273
Get away!

281
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:16,176
Moses. help me!

282
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,178
<i>- Go on.
- I won't do it. "ve changed.</i>

283
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:23,152
<i>- Moses. help!</i>

284
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,089
You bastard!

285
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:35,061
<i>- Get out of here and call the police!
- Moses...</i>

286
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:39,767
Moses!

287
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:44,666
Good God...

288
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,976
Moses. oh. God.

289
00:41:04,543 --> 00:41:06,452
People don't change.

290
00:41:10,495 --> 00:41:12,154
Witnesses.

291
00:41:14,528 --> 00:41:16,535
Luc?

292
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:21,079
I'm full.

293
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,422
You take the leftovers.

294
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,878
But leave the wife to suffer.

295
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:29,815
Luc. where are you going with this?
Let's just go. baby.

296
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:32,475
Homeboy's just fucking with you.

297
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:38,241
- Aren't you?
- Blood alone spins the wheels of history.

298
00:41:48,932 --> 00:41:51,715
So I said to him.
"Get your own whore!"

299
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:01,660
<i>? The man in black
rode down on a horse</i>

300
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:07,038
? What course they'd run.
he dare not recall

301
00:42:08,006 --> 00:42:10,821
? He'd become a creature.
thirsty and hungry...

302
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:14,683
They just ain't smart enough
to stay down where they belong.

303
00:42:14,758 --> 00:42:15,936
?...kill them all

304
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:22,172
They got to spread their
little wings and fly up into the light.

305
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:25,663
? Perhaps their pain
would help him remember

306
00:42:26,728 --> 00:42:29,631
The package you ordered is on its way.

307
00:42:29,705 --> 00:42:31,745
Cowboy.

308
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:37,442
You said the peyote'd
be here before dessert.

309
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:40,646
And if it ain't...

310
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:44,229
...your head becomes
a portal to the fifth dimension.

311
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,871
Get it?

312
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,194
You see that?
There's a new sheriff in town.

313
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:04,169
? The creature sat naked...

314
00:43:06,572 --> 00:43:10,435
? He held his heart in his hand.
and he ate of it

315
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:15,138
? The man in black asked.
"ls it good. friend?"

316
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:17,996
Get off me. you damn hallucination.

317
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,568
? "But I like it. because it is bitter"

318
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:27,205
? "And because it is my heart"

319
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:35,850
Boo.

320
00:43:52,561 --> 00:43:56,653
I guess Famine's momma
was wrong about that freezer.

321
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,457
Where's fucking Luc?

322
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:05,993
He owes me two lifetimes
and a set of perfect blue eyes.

323
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:12,306
We misjudged you.

324
00:44:12,372 --> 00:44:16,267
For an lnjun-loving heartless convict.

325
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,122
you sure got a lot of life in you.

326
00:44:20,469 --> 00:44:22,160
What I got in me...

327
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:26,574
...ain't life.

328
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:30,253
Join the club.

329
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:44,912
Ow!

330
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,682
"Am I a man who dreamt
he was a butterfly?"

331
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:21,939
"Or a butterfly who dreamt he was a man?"

332
00:45:38,877 --> 00:45:41,266
I'm afraid of what "ve become.

333
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:44,984
You tell 'em they should be too.

334
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:52,888
"Oh. hell. "m just gonna say it."

335
00:45:53,855 --> 00:45:56,092
"Will you marry me?"

336
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:46,754
Oh. shit!

337
00:47:14,888 --> 00:47:16,579
You're not a killer.

338
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:30,238
Back when Lake Ravasu
had a lake.

339
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,927
<i>I used to take her out on the water fishing.</i>

340
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,286
Time stood still when she laughed.

341
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:45,731
They said smelting
wouldn't make much mess.

342
00:47:46,923 --> 00:47:49,160
So I let 'em drain the lake.

343
00:47:50,732 --> 00:47:53,700
And when the miners came. I told Lily:

344
00:47:53,773 --> 00:47:58,410
<i>"Mi hija. stay away from 'em.
Stay on your side of the road."</i>

345
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:02,018
She knew better.

346
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,563
Dear Heavenly Father...

347
00:48:08,942 --> 00:48:09,924
Let us pray.

348
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,343
<i>Give us the strength to forgive.</i>

349
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:18,055
<i>And drain this outrage from our hearts.</i>

350
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:21,095
You will always be in our hearts.

351
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:24,617
<i>Your eyes will watch over us.</i>

352
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:29,285
<i>Your spirit will always be nearby.</i>

353
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:34,026
Baby. I miss you so much.

354
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:36,039
Make your camp here.

355
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:41,068
What have you done to me?

356
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,744
You made me a fucking monster.

357
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:56,172
Dad.

358
00:48:57,715 --> 00:48:59,919
Did you catch him yet?

359
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:01,581
No.

360
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,927
He just took another one down.

361
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:09,233
At the bar.

362
00:49:09,301 --> 00:49:11,243
I'll have the state troopers
set up roadblocks.

363
00:49:11,317 --> 00:49:12,691
No.

364
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:15,212
No outsiders.

365
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,456
We've seen their kind of justice.

366
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,046
They're the ones
that set him free the first time.

367
00:49:20,118 --> 00:49:24,242
But. Dad. our authority ends
at the reservation line.

368
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:28,334
And we have our kind of justice.

369
00:49:33,783 --> 00:49:39,500
Now let's show the dark prince
our worthiness. pilgrims.

370
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:54,895
Herd these lambs for slaughter.

371
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:57,042
Not all of them deserve to die.

372
00:49:57,114 --> 00:49:59,503
"Deserve?"

373
00:49:59,578 --> 00:50:02,262
Did your brothers
deserve to die in mines

374
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:06,804
that were dug too deep
and too close to the water

375
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:09,395
so they could profit?

376
00:50:10,363 --> 00:50:12,218
So.

377
00:50:12,283 --> 00:50:15,480
We haven't seen the last of War.
now. have we?

378
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:19,412
Only the dead
have seen the last of War.

379
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,924
I'm not gonna hurt you.

380
00:50:52,992 --> 00:50:55,862
Are you an angel?

381
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:58,141
Or are you another devil?

382
00:50:58,209 --> 00:51:00,249
I don't know.

383
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:02,493
Maybe both.

384
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:09,241
- Come on. "m gonna get you out of here.
- I can't go out there. I just want to die.

385
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:11,419
I want to die.

386
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,720
But we can't. Not tonight.

387
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,280
All my life...

388
00:52:13,353 --> 00:52:15,012
No!

389
00:52:18,473 --> 00:52:21,769
..."ve been pushing down
this fire inside of me.

390
00:52:22,218 --> 00:52:24,225
Jimmy. stop!

391
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,719
It just keeps coming back up.

392
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:29,992
Jimmy. stop! Jimmy. stop. Stop.

393
00:52:36,172 --> 00:52:39,172
I'm so fucking tired of running.

394
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:53,318
You didn't think "d recognize you?

395
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:56,772
After what you did to our son?

396
00:52:56,846 --> 00:52:59,399
Your husband's still alive.

397
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:03,528
His heart's still beating.

398
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:17,195
Mary.

399
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:18,858
Moses.

400
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:23,691
Who are you?

401
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:25,736
Dear God.

402
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:28,876
- Maybe a ghost.
- lt's a miracle.

403
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:40,494
I'm sorry.

404
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:45,323
I don't pretend to understand
what just happened.

405
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:47,599
But don't ask me to forgive you.

406
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,827
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

407
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:40,341
Now it's time
for Montezuma's revenge.

408
00:55:37,024 --> 00:55:39,839
I like it.

409
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:56,536
Didn't we kill that guy?

410
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:13,307
- I don't believe it.
- The truth is. belief's not required.

411
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:25,565
I know.

412
00:56:25,637 --> 00:56:27,906
He's the crow.
Like in the legend.

413
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:34,302
God is finally paying attention.

414
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,439
Hello. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy.

415
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:43,421
Jimmy. Hi.

416
00:56:45,512 --> 00:56:48,195
Tell me. did the blood wash off?

417
00:56:48,263 --> 00:56:52,126
Or did you have to scrub
really. really hard?

418
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,950
Oh. Jimbo. man. Come on. it's me.

419
00:56:55,017 --> 00:56:56,326
Luc.

420
00:56:56,392 --> 00:56:57,821
Huh?

421
00:56:57,897 --> 00:57:01,476
I taught you how to fight.
Showed you how to survive.

422
00:57:01,545 --> 00:57:03,520
And then cut out my heart.

423
00:57:04,874 --> 00:57:07,492
So let me get this straight.

424
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:10,823
I mean.
you're here to make wrong things right.

425
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,884
That's funny.
'cause that's what "m doing. too.

426
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:17,508
Wait. I have an idea.
Maybe you two should form a club.

427
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:19,586
Yeah.

428
00:57:19,659 --> 00:57:23,140
- "ve never been much of a joiner.
- Oh. yeah. sure you are. Come on.

429
00:57:23,212 --> 00:57:26,082
Join us in iniquity. Hm?

430
00:57:26,155 --> 00:57:30,084
You can be my best man.
How are you at wedding speeches?

431
00:57:30,764 --> 00:57:32,804
I'm better at eulogies.

432
00:57:33,932 --> 00:57:36,321
That's what "m talking about.

433
00:57:37,645 --> 00:57:40,395
What's the difference
between me and you? Hm?

434
00:57:40,461 --> 00:57:43,276
I'm dead.

435
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:55,690
Watch out. Jimmy.
He's not the same man he used to be.

436
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:07,467
War.

437
00:58:17,618 --> 00:58:20,913
What happens to an angel
that loses his wings?

438
00:58:22,898 --> 00:58:24,523
He falls.

439
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,653
"Hellfire rise"

440
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:54,831
"The heavens drop"

441
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:13,391
? Ten little. nine little. eight little lndians

442
00:59:14,648 --> 00:59:17,997
? Seven little. six little. five little lndians

443
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:31,374
? Four little. three little. two little lndians

444
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:35,444
? One little lndian boy

445
00:59:56,477 --> 00:59:58,714
lt's too quiet in here.

446
01:00:04,158 --> 01:00:05,980
Let's go.

447
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:13,018
Daddy.

448
01:00:13,086 --> 01:00:16,949
<i>- Where's my daddy?
- Shh. lt's gonna be OK.</i>

449
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:26,527
<i>- What the hell are you doing?
- He took my hearse.</i>

450
01:00:26,592 --> 01:00:28,185
- Who?
- Jimmy Cuervo.

451
01:00:28,256 --> 01:00:30,460
He had a gun
and a Rave-N Fest costume.

452
01:00:30,529 --> 01:00:32,601
Rave-N Fest?

453
01:00:34,305 --> 01:00:36,345
Don't just leave me here like this.

454
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:38,326
Oh. fuck!

455
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:58,334
When he was dead.
he saw that he had not lived.

456
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:06,170
Jimmy Cuervo. you're under arrest
for the murder of Lily lgnites The Dawn.

457
01:01:09,285 --> 01:01:12,384
Come on. Tanner. I loved your sister.

458
01:01:13,797 --> 01:01:16,863
- You know I didn't kill her.
- Bullshit.

459
01:01:16,933 --> 01:01:19,933
- I don't believe you.
- Well...

460
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,719
Go ahead. Shoot.

461
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:25,605
lt's loaded this time. I'll kill you.

462
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,704
Man. I wanna die.
I want to die.

463
01:01:28,775 --> 01:01:32,485
Do it. Do it. please. Please.

464
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:34,820
Go ahead.

465
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:50,181
Join us in iniquity.
You can be my best man.

466
01:02:01,547 --> 01:02:03,587
Lily.

467
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,056
Lily.

468
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:08,196
Killing is easy.

469
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:11,236
Forgetting is hard.

470
01:02:20,173 --> 01:02:22,507
See you in iniquity.

471
01:02:47,376 --> 01:02:52,428
You think you can keep any crows
from crashing the party?

472
01:02:52,496 --> 01:02:55,725
"Strength lies not in defense
but in attack."

473
01:02:57,969 --> 01:03:01,417
Oh. hurry up. witchy girl.
My biological clock is ticking.

474
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:03,628
lt's not too late to break the spell.

475
01:03:03,698 --> 01:03:05,454
You know. we don't have
to go through with this.

476
01:03:05,521 --> 01:03:09,034
We could just get back in the car.
and head to the coast.

477
01:03:09,106 --> 01:03:10,797
What?

478
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:13,136
Cold feet. baby?

479
01:03:13,202 --> 01:03:15,657
Come on.

480
01:03:16,563 --> 01:03:18,952
What do we have to worry about?

481
01:03:21,107 --> 01:03:22,700
Nothing.

482
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:26,067
But did we bag a virgin?

483
01:03:26,516 --> 01:03:28,905
Our luck is changing.

484
01:03:30,004 --> 01:03:33,747
We just got one
standing on the side of the road.

485
01:04:10,937 --> 01:04:14,767
- What the hell. Luc Crash.
- Yes. Lola Byrne.

486
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:19,154
Let's get hitched.

487
01:04:31,547 --> 01:04:35,028
- There's no place like home.
- Yeah.

488
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:39,094
Think your pimp shrimp's
gonna flip out when he sees us?

489
01:04:39,164 --> 01:04:43,604
Let's hope he's sentimental.
You were always bad for business.

490
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:46,524
"m not saying
the white weight ain't worth a lookup.

491
01:04:46,588 --> 01:04:50,582
I'm just saying don't buy from Smokey.

492
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,581
Looking good. Carmen.

493
01:04:57,214 --> 01:04:59,734
- You missed me?
- No.

494
01:04:59,806 --> 01:05:04,695
I was counting on never seeing
your ungrateful ass again.

495
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,116
You know. I gave you a chance to get out
of here and make something of yourself.

496
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:10,647
Nobody ever gave me nothing.

497
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,087
Where is he?

498
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:18,043
You know what else?
You disrespect my man one more time.

499
01:05:18,113 --> 01:05:21,408
I will split your fucking wig
wide open.

500
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:24,858
- Fuck you.
- Where's Ni?o?

501
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:26,456
Ni?o!

502
01:05:31,746 --> 01:05:33,688
Check it out.

503
01:05:33,762 --> 01:05:36,545
Crash and Byrne.

504
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:39,164
Ready to come back
and do some more damage.

505
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,886
You need not reapply. shorty.

506
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:44,028
I got standards.

507
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:47,677
Good to see you. Ni?o.
Dig that coat.

508
01:05:49,284 --> 01:05:52,001
lt's El Ni?o.

509
01:05:52,068 --> 01:05:54,719
Get it right. crackerjack.

510
01:05:57,573 --> 01:05:59,744
Some respect.

511
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:03,202
I'm moving up in the world.

512
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:05,533
Well. all right.

513
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:09,189
If we're gonna do this thing.

514
01:06:09,254 --> 01:06:11,491
give me my book back.

515
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:16,710
I stole it fair and square.
Plus. you never had the eyes to use it.

516
01:06:16,775 --> 01:06:19,044
But now I do.

517
01:06:19,111 --> 01:06:22,624
- And I ain't your shorty no more.
- Don't undercut me. shorty.

518
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:25,730
You stole the keys to Daddy's car.

519
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,542
But you can't handle the horsepower.

520
01:06:29,608 --> 01:06:32,991
Now. what's it gonna be. homey?

521
01:06:33,064 --> 01:06:35,847
You want to be Satan. or what?

522
01:06:37,865 --> 01:06:40,254
Lo?

523
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,981
The book.

524
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,123
Kiss it. bitch.

525
01:06:51,146 --> 01:06:53,056
All right.

526
01:07:05,164 --> 01:07:07,052
- We better do something.
- Don't make a move.

527
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:08,709
I want justice for my daughter.

528
01:07:08,781 --> 01:07:11,945
- We can't just sit here.
- We wait for Cuervo.

529
01:07:23,598 --> 01:07:25,573
How is it you're a virgin?

530
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:28,298
I guess "m just old-fashioned.

531
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:29,611
And I was...

532
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,975
I was saving myself
for somebody special.

533
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:37,416
Hands off.

534
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:40,581
We are gathered here.

535
01:07:41,521 --> 01:07:43,910
<i>Oh. lust. Oh. hatred.</i>

536
01:07:43,985 --> 01:07:46,734
<i>Gluttony. Greed. Avarice.</i>

537
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:50,729
<i>And some other real deep heavy shit.</i>

538
01:08:03,187 --> 01:08:06,187
Oh. Satan. What's up. bones?

539
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:13,163
This is mack daddy. El Ni?o.
calling you up. man.

540
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:17,644
Quit your basking in the darkness.
and come on up here.

541
01:08:17,716 --> 01:08:20,171
Hitch your bitch.

542
01:08:20,244 --> 01:08:21,073
Grr.

543
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:23,629
<i>Oh. Lola. baby. Gee.</i>

544
01:08:23,701 --> 01:08:27,727
<i>This hot bitch is gonna
bang gangbang your evil nasty self.</i>

545
01:08:27,797 --> 01:08:29,969
<i>Oh. lust. oh. hatred...</i>

546
01:08:30,901 --> 01:08:33,357
What's that hearse doing here?

547
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:06,967
What's with the drive-by?

548
01:09:11,354 --> 01:09:16,919
Nobody move. We're doing this
dead or alive. Keep going. Daddy.

549
01:09:19,451 --> 01:09:21,907
- Cara Mia!
- Just shoot to the end. Ni?o.

550
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:35,672
Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up.

551
01:09:36,284 --> 01:09:38,194
<i>Come on. Lev?ntate.</i>

552
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:46,709
Aah!

553
01:09:47,134 --> 01:09:49,404
So you're not invincible.

554
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:06,622
We're kicking our homey down.
Our hardcore banger Luc G here.

555
01:10:06,688 --> 01:10:11,359
And. uh... To have and to hold
your immortal badassitude.

556
01:10:12,929 --> 01:10:15,034
Killer. Killer.

557
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:22,849
And. uh... He'll be your homey.
Now. and for evermore.

558
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,179
Bye-bye. birdie.

559
01:10:55,173 --> 01:10:57,595
This is some serious shit.

560
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:01,533
lt's not time yet.

561
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:04,192
Hurry up.
Make me the fucking antichrist.

562
01:11:12,807 --> 01:11:15,295
- Shoot him. Shoot him.
- No. don't.

563
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:26,529
You need to keep better track
of your ammo.

564
01:11:26,601 --> 01:11:28,903
lt's been a long night.

565
01:11:30,762 --> 01:11:34,374
Uh... Do we all take him. or vice versa?

566
01:11:34,442 --> 01:11:37,224
I do.

567
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:42,692
Nice timing. Tonto.
I now pronounce you devil and his shorty.

568
01:11:43,275 --> 01:11:47,552
- I love you. Lucifer.
- Well. kiss the bride. motherfucker.

569
01:11:47,627 --> 01:11:50,442
Kiss the bride.

570
01:11:57,645 --> 01:12:01,868
<i>- Will you marry me. Lola Byrne?
- Till death do us part. Luc Crash.</i>

571
01:12:18,383 --> 01:12:20,718
- Shoot him. Shoot him.
- No. No. don't.

572
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:24,907
- Shoot him.
- He's the crow. Look. "ve seen his magic.

573
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:29,733
I'll blow us both to hell.

574
01:12:29,809 --> 01:12:33,104
- Good idea.
- I know your soft spot. lnjun lover.

575
01:12:33,168 --> 01:12:36,300
Shoot him. Shoot him.
He's no crow. he's a killer. Shoot him.

576
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:38,095
God. This isn't right.

577
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:40,398
"War doesn't determine who's right.
just who's left."

578
01:12:40,466 --> 01:12:45,322
Better to die a hero at night
than to wake a coward in the morning.

579
01:12:46,002 --> 01:12:49,679
I can't believe
you really did that. shorty.

580
01:12:49,746 --> 01:12:52,943
Look at that. Nice try.

581
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:56,840
It looks like we're gonna have to get
another dumb fuck to tie the knot. huh?

582
01:12:57,235 --> 01:13:02,255
lncoming on an ass-kicking.
night-riding. suicide machine.

583
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:43,151
Honey...

584
01:13:45,145 --> 01:13:47,993
I'm home.

585
01:13:48,057 --> 01:13:49,301
Luc.

586
01:13:49,465 --> 01:13:51,025
Luc?

587
01:13:51,097 --> 01:13:54,414
<i>- Call me Lucifer.</i>

588
01:13:55,929 --> 01:13:59,192
Someone owes me two lifetimes.

589
01:13:59,258 --> 01:14:01,527
And a set of perfect blue eyes.

590
01:14:01,594 --> 01:14:05,588
Jimmy Crow.
Let's get this party started. shall we?

591
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:09,402
By taking out my vengeance on God

592
01:14:09,467 --> 01:14:11,540
and all his angels.

593
01:14:11,612 --> 01:14:13,652
one nail at a time.

594
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:32,445
Do you really wanna fucking dance?

595
01:14:35,935 --> 01:14:38,237
Come on here. tiger.

596
01:14:38,303 --> 01:14:40,725
Feeding time.

597
01:15:06,177 --> 01:15:09,407
I need sex. baby. and fast.

598
01:15:09,474 --> 01:15:12,224
If we don't do it before sunrise.

599
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:16,830
the spell breaks.
and you'll be digging a hole straight to hell.

600
01:15:16,899 --> 01:15:22,082
Are you hearing me? On sacred ground
is where these eyes get their power.

601
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:24,057
lt's all good. baby.

602
01:15:24,132 --> 01:15:28,988
I'm already way deep
in that sacred burial ground of yours.

603
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:31,231
Dig?

604
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,472
Is it really you?

605
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,876
Original gangster?

606
01:15:35,941 --> 01:15:39,738
Well. wicked-ass props to you. Mr. OG.

607
01:15:39,813 --> 01:15:42,202
And thanks for representing
all the homeboys.

608
01:15:42,278 --> 01:15:43,652
Yeah.

609
01:15:49,607 --> 01:15:53,284
You still do tricks. right. shorty?

610
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:57,094
You wanted revenge.
and a deal with the devil.

611
01:15:58,248 --> 01:16:00,965
Take your vengeance. baby.

612
01:16:06,152 --> 01:16:11,237
You're gonna really
enjoy it soon. and learn how to fake it.

613
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,672
<i>Kiss the book.</i>

614
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:16,869
<i>A little cherry for your cherry.</i>

615
01:16:19,882 --> 01:16:21,377
No. No.

616
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:24,766
I mean. you promised me. No.

617
01:16:25,194 --> 01:16:28,129
<i>- No! Wait! Aah!</i>

618
01:16:28,555 --> 01:16:31,872
Let us pray.
Dear Heavenly Father...

619
01:16:32,459 --> 01:16:33,889
Freeze!

620
01:16:34,124 --> 01:16:35,531
Freeze!

621
01:16:39,116 --> 01:16:44,354
See this knife? This is the one
I used to carve out your daughter's eyes.

622
01:16:44,877 --> 01:16:47,016
Sorry. folks.

623
01:16:47,085 --> 01:16:52,355
I'd slice all your throats.
but I gotta get to the burial grounds.

624
01:16:52,429 --> 01:16:54,339
<i>Au revoir.</i>

625
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:03,140
She's itching for a climax.

626
01:17:10,287 --> 01:17:13,005
So I did what you wanted.

627
01:17:13,072 --> 01:17:17,545
Now it's time for you
to ring my bell and lock the spell.

628
01:17:17,616 --> 01:17:23,596
And we're talking. what? Seven days.
seven nights until you have to go back.

629
01:17:23,665 --> 01:17:27,211
Seven days?
You're thinking way too small. princess.

630
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:33,004
You're in for a seven-year itch
you won't ever want to scratch. Ah!

631
01:17:33,074 --> 01:17:34,284
You want to see the Middle East. huh?

632
01:17:34,354 --> 01:17:37,071
It won't just be the Sahara desert
that's burning hot.

633
01:17:37,139 --> 01:17:39,921
Pick any city. Paris?

634
01:17:42,963 --> 01:17:45,003
Rio? Carnival.

635
01:17:45,076 --> 01:17:47,531
Beijing?

636
01:17:47,604 --> 01:17:52,307
We'll stroll in. set a little spark
like your little fucking mine and casino.

637
01:17:52,372 --> 01:17:56,845
and just watch 'em all
cut each other to fucking pieces.

638
01:17:56,916 --> 01:17:59,470
You see. the world's like an angry dog
on a choke chain. you know?

639
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,842
It lunges. snaps and pulls.

640
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:05,073
But the chain around its neck
just gets tighter and tighter.

641
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:10,869
It don't know that all it has to do
to be free is let go.

642
01:18:10,934 --> 01:18:12,429
Huh.

643
01:18:14,871 --> 01:18:17,489
<i>Oh. Don't fret. Fr?ulein.</i>

644
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:21,553
The apocalypse is gonna be
one hell of a honeymoon.

645
01:18:21,623 --> 01:18:25,202
'Cause in the morning we're gonna
massacre that lndian tribe for you.

646
01:18:25,272 --> 01:18:28,272
and then move on
to bigger and badder things.

647
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:04,731
Take him down.
Take down the crow.

648
01:19:21,438 --> 01:19:25,333
<i>...que est?s en el cielo.
santificado sea tu Nombre.</i>

649
01:19:25,406 --> 01:19:31,768
<i>Venga tu reino. H?gase tu voluntad.
en el cielo asi que en la tierra.</i>

650
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:35,287
<i>Danos hoy el pan cotidiano.
y librenos del mal.</i>

651
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:37,302
<i>porque el tuyo es el reino...</i>

652
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:39,514
Is he dead?

653
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:41,821
<i>- Or alive?</i>

654
01:19:41,888 --> 01:19:44,125
Holy Jesus!

655
01:19:50,209 --> 01:19:52,446
You're in my way.

656
01:20:30,854 --> 01:20:33,243
She believed in you.

657
01:20:34,886 --> 01:20:37,439
She believed in all of you.

658
01:20:37,991 --> 01:20:40,674
She believed in fairy tales.

659
01:20:40,742 --> 01:20:43,231
Who are you to tell me
what she believed in?

660
01:20:43,303 --> 01:20:49,054
I'm the fairy fucking godfather
that's gonna save your fairy fucking tails.

661
01:20:50,664 --> 01:20:56,164
- He's bleeding to death.
- Help him. Help the crow.

662
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:01,478
How could God pick such a man?

663
01:21:05,609 --> 01:21:07,682
Why not?

664
01:21:07,754 --> 01:21:09,664
She did.

665
01:21:31,372 --> 01:21:34,471
Lily believed in the old stories.

666
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,908
Like the Crow Dance.

667
01:21:36,973 --> 01:21:39,177
They'll think I was a fool.

668
01:21:39,245 --> 01:21:41,831
They already do.

669
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:44,291
Show 'em how fools dance.

670
01:22:28,563 --> 01:22:34,095
lt's your wedding night. little girl.
And Poppy's a horny little devil.

671
01:22:40,948 --> 01:22:43,883
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes.

672
01:22:47,157 --> 01:22:50,703
The book says
you have to look at my eyes.

673
01:22:50,933 --> 01:22:54,000
The book says
you have to look at my eyes.

674
01:22:56,726 --> 01:22:58,865
Oh.

675
01:22:58,934 --> 01:23:00,876
So close.

676
01:23:01,622 --> 01:23:05,365
The dark prince
was almost crowned. baby.

677
01:23:05,879 --> 01:23:08,497
You can't stop. If the sun comes up
and the spel"s undone.

678
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:14,002
you're just gonna be a worthless punk.
and I'll just be a piece of white trash. Luc.

679
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:15,665
Luc!

680
01:23:16,824 --> 01:23:20,621
Oh. come on.
Don't you have any respect for the dead?

681
01:23:20,697 --> 01:23:22,933
You know what. kid?

682
01:23:29,657 --> 01:23:32,472
You're really pissing me off.

683
01:23:41,979 --> 01:23:44,368
Minor angel wants to play.

684
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:48,210
Homeboy's going down
in the majors tonight.

685
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:55,479
So God gave trash like you wings.

686
01:23:56,412 --> 01:23:59,642
He never gave me shit.
Fucker.

687
01:23:59,709 --> 01:24:02,579
Always just took it all away.

688
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:18,133
Come on. I need a spell.

689
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,942
No. no. but... Damn. Come on.

01:24:26,016 --> 01:24:28,667
Please let me find a spell for this.

691
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:40,924
If you want to escape from here.
you've got to let it all go.

692
01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:41,942
I can't.

693
01:24:55,747 --> 01:24:59,097
You think your bitch's mojo
can save you? Huh?

694
01:24:59,779 --> 01:25:02,813
You're a hiccup. man.
A fart in my gas pump.

695
01:25:13,637 --> 01:25:15,874
Goddamn. they're dry-clean.

696
01:25:23,622 --> 01:25:25,411
lt's alive.

697

"Quoth the Raven. 'Nevermore'."

You think you're doing God's work.

699
01:25:55,978 --> 01:25:59,175
Killers don't go to heaven. dog.
They go down.

700
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:01,315
Like my fucking bitch.

701
01:26:05,739 --> 01:26:07,976
Yeah. There we go. Yeah?

702
01:26:20,076 --> 01:26:22,313
Get the fuck back up!

Look at me.

704

Oh. fuck.

706

Hail Mary. full of grace.

You hear that? Huh?

709
01:27:13,874 --> 01:27:17,191
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
are riding. man.

710
01:27:17,267 --> 01:27:19,209
Blessed art thou amongst women.

711
01:27:19,283 --> 01:27:21,039
Famine.

712
01:27:21,748 --> 01:27:22,730
Check.

713

Death.

721
01:27:39,669 --> 01:27:41,360
You bastard!

722

Oh. say... Say. kid...

726
01:28:10,168 --> 01:28:14,031
Do you know what
an angel without mercy is? Huh?

727
01:28:15,097 --> 01:28:17,007
lt's nothing but a devil.

728
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:24,345
How about a little
sympathy for the devil. huh?

729
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:26,297
"l saw a creature."

730
01:28:26,363 --> 01:28:31,960
"He sat. and he held his own heart
in his hands. and he ate of it."

731
01:28:32,827 --> 01:28:35,861
"l asked him. 'ls it good. friend?"'

732
01:28:35,931 --> 01:28:38,931
"He said. 'lt is bitter."'

733
01:28:39,419 --> 01:28:41,362
"'Bitter."'

734
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:49,302

You have the right to remain silent.

737
01:29:14,591 --> 01:29:19,927
And anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

738
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,782
You have the right to an attorney.
If you don't have one...
