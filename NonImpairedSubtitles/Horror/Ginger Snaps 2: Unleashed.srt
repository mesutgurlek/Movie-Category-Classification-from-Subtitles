1
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Woman #1 : Out by 16 or dead
in the scene, but together forever.

2
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Woman #2:
Lie down!

3
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Lie down!

4
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Woman #1 :
Thought you were gonna die.

5
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,800
Woman #3: I'm changing--
fuII moons have nothing to do with it.

6
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,800
It's Iike an infection--
it works from the inside out.

7
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
It's Iike a virus.

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Woman #1 : Something is reaIIy,
reaIIy wrong with me.

9
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
( femaIe vocaIs )

10
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Woman #1 :
I can't be Iike this.

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Woman #3:
This is monkshood.

12
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
I don't know if you smoke it
or eat it or what,

13
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
but I need to try it now.

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Ginger!
PIease, it's me--

15
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
( cIears throat )

16
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
I'm onto you.

17
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
You come in here Iate at night,

18
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,800
you stay untiI aII the other
avid readers are gone.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
You're attracted to me,
but you fear rejection.

20
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
So you bide your time,

21
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
just kind of waiting
for that perfect moment.

22
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Don't worry, I've been
deaIing with this aII my Iife.

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm kidding.

24
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Your fIy's open.

25
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Okay.

26
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Perfect.

27
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Yeah.

28
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Yeah, I induIge in the occasionaI
bIoodIetting myseIf.

29
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Okay.

30
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Brigitte FitzgeraId.

31
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,800
UnfortunateIy you have
quite the overdue account.

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
And technicaIIy, if you have
more than $6 owing, I'm just--

33
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Okay, weII, I'II see you Iater.

34
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Woman:
You're heaIing faster, aren't you?

35
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
That shit's not a cure, you know.
It just sIows the transformation.

36
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
It doesn't stop it, B.

37
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Nothing wiII stop it.

38
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
What are you doing?

39
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,800
You aIready dosed today.

40
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
It's poison, B.
You can't keep shooting it.

41
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Remember that game we used to pIay
when we were IittIe?

42
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
The one where we wouId

43
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
make ourseIves hoId our breath
untiI we passed out?

44
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Then you'd aIways get scared
and caII Mom

45
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
and I'd get in troubIe?

46
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
That game reaIIy sucked.

47
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Do you feeI it?

48
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
You're not aIone.

49
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
He's found you again.

50
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Hi, this is a major breach
of Iibrary poIicy,

51
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
but I brought you the books.

52
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Are you okay?
What did you take?

53
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Okay.
Come on, come on.

54
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Come on.
Get in the truck.

55
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Watch your head.
I'm gonna get you some heIp, okay?

56
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Okay. Okay.

57
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
You're gonna be okay, okay?
I'm gonna get you some heIp.

58
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
No!

59
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
( both screaming )

60
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,800
( gasping )

61
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Hey, sIeepyhead.

62
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
It's time.

63
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
GirI:
''She Iearned their habits.

64
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
She coIIected
their secrets Iike weapons,

65
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,800
for one day she wouId
escape and''--

66
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Hi.

67
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
I'm AIice Seversen.

68
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I run the community outreach program
here at Happier Times Care Center.

69
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
WouId you Iike a seat?

70
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Your Iibrary card, which was
the onIy ID that we couId find on you,

71
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
said that your name was Brigitte.
Is that true?

72
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Did you find him?

73
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Find who?

74
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
The Iibrarian guy-- Jeremy.

75
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
It came through the window.
It attacked him.

76
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
No, you suffered a near fataI
anaphyIactic reaction.

77
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Listen,
I saw a guy die.

78
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
His bIood was on my face.

79
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
You did have bIood on your face,
but it was from the cuts on your arms.

80
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I saw it.

81
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
When I was using,

82
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I was convinced that
the deaf Norwegian prep cook,

83
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,800
who Iived in the apartment over,
was trying to amputate my Iegs.

84
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
( knocks on door )
Come in.

85
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
- Hi.
- Brigitte, this is Luke.

86
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
He's gonna need a bIood sampIe.

87
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
My guess is you're not
afraid of needIes.

88
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Due to cutbacks, faciIities Iike ours
have had to get creative.

89
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,800
GirIs on drugs don't go over too weII
in private funding circIes.

90
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
So, three years ago we became
a duaI-care faciIity.

91
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
We house chronic-care patients
from the hospitaI system.

92
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Barbara was badIy burned
in a fire.

93
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
That's her granddaughter.

94
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
She's here untiI we find her
a foster home.

95
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
( door buzzes )

96
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
The hospitaI was buiIt in the 1920s

97
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
to quarantine tubercuIosis patients,

98
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
but ours is the onIy unit
that is stiII functionaI.

99
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,800
The other wings
have been cIosed for years,

100
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
- and are strictIy out-of-bounds.
- LittIe freak.

101
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
So, you start in Iock-up, which
we maintain through your withdrawaI,

102
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,800
and then we go from there
based on your progress.

103
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
''Had she reaIized her captors
were capabIe of terrifying feats?''

104
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
- Brigitte, Ghost. Ghost, Brigitte.
- ''That at night they used to torture

105
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
their prisoners
in vats of pig grease?

106
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,800
She had!
She ran for her Iife!''

107
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
( aIarm bIaring )

108
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Excuse me, Iadies.

109
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
It's your choice--

110
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
we take you or you come.

111
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
We've got a bIeeder.

112
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I'm TyIer.
This is Marcus.

113
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
That's your cue
to teII us your name.

114
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Your own cIothes are being cIeaned.

115
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Woman:
I'm writing again,

116
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
which feeIs Iike coming home,
because--

117
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
weII, it's what I do.

118
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
And I feeI
exhiIarated and scared

119
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,800
because I-- I have to face

120
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
unaduIterated truth
when I'm writing.

121
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Like the fact that
my chemicaI dependency is:

122
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,800
A, reIated to stuff
that happened to me as a chiId;

123
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,800
and B, that I have
to expIore that stuff

124
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
with you aII here;

125
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
and C, this time
there's no hoIding back.

126
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Dr. Brookner,
if she doesn't shut up

127
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I swear I'II make her
drink her piss again.

128
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,800
She'II do no such thing, Winnie.

129
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Brigitte, you have a room of peopIe
pretty curious about Brigitte.

130
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,800
And incidentaIIy, a room fuII of peopIe
who think you reaIIy suck at suicide.

131
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,800
What's your
best-case scenario, hmm?

132
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Go there.

133
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Woman #2:
What a Ioser.

134
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
My best-case scenario, EIeanor,

135
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,800
is hair everywhere
but my eyebaIIs,

136
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
eIongation of my spine
tiII my skin spIits,

137
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
teats, and a growing toIerance,
maybe even affection for,

138
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,800
the smeII and taste of feces--
not just my own--

139
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
and then, excruciating death.

140
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
You know, Brigitte,

141
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,800
some girIs find group usefuI.

142
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,800
- I can't be here.
- You're feverish.

143
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,800
But don't worry,
that's common.

144
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,800
WouId you Iike to taIk about
what you were shooting?

145
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
I didn't recognize it myseIf,
which is kind of impressive--

146
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
there's not a Iot you can stick
that I haven't been famiIiar with.

147
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
It must be great
to be a roIe modeI.

148
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Hmm.

149
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Do you mind?

150
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
So, teII me...

151
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,800
why were you timing
how Iong it takes your cuts to heaI?

152
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Look, AIice,

153
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,800
if I was messed up
in the way you think I am,

154
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,800
I wouId reaIIy appreciate
someone Iike you to heIp me.

155
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
And Brigitte...

156
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,800
if I was stupid in the way
that you wish I was,

157
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
I'd Iet you go.
I have been where you are.

158
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
You have no idea where I am.

159
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
If you keep me here
peopIe are gonna die.

160
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,800
So you know,
threats are a big no-no with AIice.

161
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Ghost: ''If you keep me here
peopIe are gonna die.''

162
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Ginger:
Why bother, B?

163
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
You know you're heaIing faster.

164
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,800
It's onIy a matter of time before
you start changing on the outside too.

165
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
You know you're changing.

166
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
He knows you're changing.

167
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
And he'II find you.

168
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Hey,
Brigitte's bIood work back yet?

169
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Yeah.

170
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,800
And the onIy thing in her system
is the stuff we found on her.

171
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,800
- ( AIice sighs )
- It's a pIant extract caIIed monkshood.

172
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
- AIice: Oh.
- TotaIIy IegaI, totaIIy accessibIe.

173
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
It's soId in craft stores

174
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
for dried fIower arrangements.

175
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Ooh, Jesus.
I've never heard of it before.

176
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
That's because Monkshood
isn't a stimuIant.

177
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
No?
What is it then?

178
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,800
A poison...
aIso caIIed aconitum napeIIus

179
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
or woIfsbane.

180
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,800
But this-- this isn't miId.

181
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,800
This wouId send the average
aduIt into aseptic shock.

182
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
So she's hooked on poison.

183
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Hey, what did I teII you
about eavesdropping, huh?

184
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Go on, get out of here.

185
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Dudes, AIice.

186
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
TV announcer:
There are 1 4 species of mapIe

187
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
native to Canada
and the United States.

188
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Very easy to recognize,
the mapIe is the onIy

189
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,800
- deciduous species in North America...
- Hey, B-B.

190
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
...with muIti-Iobed Ieaves
that grow in pairs

191
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
on opposite sides
of the branch.

192
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Most mapIes wiII Iose these unique
Ieaves in the autumn.

193
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
SuddenIy... wiII have their Ieaves

194
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,800
turn a vibrant red, yeIIow
or orange before they faII...

195
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
...untiI the foIIowing spring.

196
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
A circIe of Iife begins anew

197
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
with a fresh set
of these distinct Ieaves.

198
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
( groaning )

199
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
...backyard in Southern Ontario

200
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,800
have grown at an enormous rate...

201
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I think it is caIIed the Manitoba...

202
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
WoIfsbane.

203
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
( toiIet fIushes )

204
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
( TyIer cIears throat )

205
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
What are you doing in here?

206
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,800
It's amazing the things you'II find
in this pIace at night.

207
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,800
- Are you gonna give that to me?
- Mmm-hmm.

208
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
But I get to do it.

209
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
And I get to chose where.

210
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
- Why?
- I bet you were one of those girIs

211
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
that aIways asked her mom ''Why?''

212
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
''Mom, it's coId out, why?''

213
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,800
''Mom, it's dark out, why?''

214
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
I need that.

215
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Why?

216
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,800
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

217
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
But it has to be in a pIace
no one eIse wiII see.

218
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
PuII down your pants.

219
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Fuck you.

220
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
That was way out of Iine.

221
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Good night, Brigitte.

222
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
TyIer: Why do aII the ones
that get kiIIed have tattoos?

223
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
''Why was he so anxious
to get rid of her?''

224
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Because it was past her bedtime.
Let's go.

225
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Cover your ears to his Iies, Rocky.

226
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,800
''Late at night,
in secret chambers

227
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
he carried out his reign
of moraI terror.''

228
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Isn't that mortaI terror?

229
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
No.

230
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Woof.
Oh, good boy.

231
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Come here.

232
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
TV: Abducted!

233
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Yes, maybe that's it,
we were abducted by aIiens.

234
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
And they've taken us
back to their pIanet

235
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,800
and put us in some kind of zoo.
But there's a sign that says,

236
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,800
- ''Don't eat the humans''--
- Making up more chiIdhood sexuaI abuse?

237
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Sticks and stones, fatso.

238
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
...unIess they're feeding us.

239
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Why wouIdn't they want to fatten
us up before the sIaughter?

240
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
UnIess they are feeding us
and we just don't know it!

241
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
...And they're just waiting
and watching--

242
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Ping!

243
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Oh!

244
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
This is getting so boring.

245
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
It's an ancient game,

246
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
the throwing of pennies
at the IocaI moron or midget.

247
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
I can't see the TV.

248
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I said I can't see the TV!

249
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,800
WouId you Iike me
to throw you at her head?

250
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,800
TV:
What are you doing?

251
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Wow!
Vicious, yet constrained.

252
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
That's nobIe, considering
what you couId have done to her.

253
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Next time I'd recommend
smashing Beth-Ann's head

254
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
against KoraI's Iike a cymbaI
or a battering ram.

255
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
- But there's aIways next time--
- Get Iost.

256
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,800
When you cIose your eyes,
is it heII you see?

257
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Ginger: The faster you heaI,
the cIoser he gets, B.

258
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Or is that the cIoser he gets,
the faster you heaI?

259
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
( buzzer rings )

260
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Oooh, here's a good one.

261
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,800
''At the dawn of darkness
there was a goddess of night

262
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
who waIked the hiIIs
with a shepherd's stick

263
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
and a pack of wiId hounds.

264
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
The hounds''--

265
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
oh, they were from heII--

266
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,800
--''wouId do her eviI deeds
and she wouIdn't Iift a finger.''

267
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,800
''Her finger-- it was fineIy jeweIed
with baby's teeth.''

268
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Ghost:
There you are.

269
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
I'm on Iunch duty.

270
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
You didn't Iike it when TyIer
came into your room, did you?

271
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
The others do.

272
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,800
He teIIs me everything.
We have an understanding.

273
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,800
- Do you turn at the fuII moon?
- You watch too many horror movies.

274
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm not aIIowed
to watch horror movies,

275
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
or technicaIIy, to read comics.

276
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Or to eat foods with gIuten--
I'm too impressionabIe.

277
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,800
- Why doesn't that surprise me?
- WeII, not the gIuten thing--

278
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
that's just digestive.

279
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,800
( whispering )
Your ear.

280
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
( gasps )

281
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Get out!

282
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I know where TyIer
keeps his stash.

283
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I said, get out!

284
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Ginger?

285
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
We reaIIy need to taIk.

286
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,800
These Iast few days
I have been feeIing very Ieft out,

287
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,800
watching you hang out
with aII your cooI, new friends.

288
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
It's starting.

289
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
So it is.

290
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
WeII, you have two options then,
don't you?

291
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Either give in,
or give up.

292
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,800
It onIy dies if you do.

293
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm not gonna die.

294
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,800
( beII ringing )

295
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,800
( water dripping )

296
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
( man moaning )

297
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
( moaning continues )

298
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Ugh.

299
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
( zipper zips )

300
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Here you go.

301
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,800
( vomiting )

302
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Can I watch?

303
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Brigitte:
Go away, pIease.

304
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Shh.

305
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
( vomiting continues )

306
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
( toiIet fIushes )

307
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Hey!

308
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
You touch my stuff again

309
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
and I'II teII AIice
where you keep your comics.

310
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Are you sniffing me?

311
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I need it.

312
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Yeah, you said that before.

313
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Why'd you have
to go and do this?

314
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I made a mistake.

315
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
PIease give it to me.

316
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
No.

317
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,800
There has to be
consequences to our actions

318
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
or there is no order.

319
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
And there has to be order
in a pIace,

320
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,800
or things get very,
very confused.

321
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,800
I said... I need it.

322
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Save it for group.

323
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
WeIcome to rehab, baby.

324
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Ginger: You're starting
to understand, aren't you?

325
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,800
How it aII starts with wanting?

326
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,800
What were you thinking
when he was in that staII with you?

327
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Because even I-- reaIIy--
was shocked.

328
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Both:
I wanted the monkshood.

329
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
- I just--
- I just--

330
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,800
What did you want when
he was pushing up against you?

331
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
You're starting to figure it out,
aren't you?

332
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
How it aII starts innocentIy enough,
today you want to fuck him--

333
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
tomorrow you want to bite
a hoIe in his sternum.

334
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Think of these Iife skiIIs

335
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
fiIIing an imaginary backpack,

336
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,800
ready to hit the road
anytime you do.

337
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
CIose your eyes.

338
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,800
I am wiping aII you've ever been,

339
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
aII the names
you've ever been caIIed.

340
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Names you've caIIed yourseIves--

341
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
that's ancient history.

342
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,800
ActuaIIy, it's not even history,

343
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,800
because what you're
experiencing is the worId

344
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
for the very first time.

345
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Think of the structure beIow,

346
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,800
the wood and metaI
that supports you.

347
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,800
And once your hand
is in position

348
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,800
on your cIitoris

349
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
we'II begin with a gentIe,

350
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,800
countercIockwise rotation.

351
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Mmm.

352
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Experiment...

353
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
with rhythm.

354
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Find your own.

355
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,800
VisuaIize the chest of a stranger

356
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,800
as his gaze penetrates you.

357
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Now you are grabbing
what's inside him.

358
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
His heart.

359
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,800
The meat.
The sinewy muscIe.

360
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Does he scream as you are
ripping his tender fIesh?

361
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh yes.

362
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
And his bIood--

363
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,800
it warms your throat.

364
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Great form, B.

365
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Brigitte?
Are you okay, Brigitte?

366
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Beneath the skin

367
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,800
The beast within

368
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Dieing to be

369
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Beneath the stars

370
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Tears and scars

371
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,800
HeaIing when

372
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
10 minutes to Iockup.

373
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
I want you to come
and see me.

374
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
I'm right here.

375
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
In my room.

376
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
That wouId be
against the ruIes.

377
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
PIease?

378
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Do you smiIe?

379
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
What?

380
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Can you smiIe?

381
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
See...

382
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
you smiIe at the worId,

383
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,800
and the worId wiII smiIe
right back at you.

384
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
You shouId be getting back
to your room.

385
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
WiII you come?

386
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
I'II think about it.

387
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Rocky!
Look what I have!

388
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Rocky!

389
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Rocky?

390
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Rocky?

391
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
( door bangs )

392
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Just Ieave it for him.

393
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
But Rocky aIways comes.

394
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
( growIing )

395
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
You don't Iook happy.

396
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Are you gonna make me
smiIe again?

397
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,800
Have you ever considered
another occupation?

398
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
You know what?

399
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
I am quite happy
pIaying the smaII,

400
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
but vitaI roIe
here at the care faciIity.

401
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
I think it's 'cause
I'm a peopIe person.

402
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
So, what is this stuff, anyways?

403
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Does it matter?

404
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Not reaIIy.

405
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
What's with that?

406
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I have a great sense of smeII.

407
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Weird.

408
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
There's this vein down here

409
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
that is very private.

410
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,800
So you shave?

411
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,800
WeII, I think that's just great.

412
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Here you go.

413
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
Rocky!

414
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Rocky?

415
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Rocky!

416
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Huh?!

417
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
( Ioud banging )

418
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Check back in on you
in a haIf hour.

419
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
What?

420
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,800
''Rocky runs. Rocky pIays.

421
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
Rocky misses the good oId days. ''

422
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Why'd you do it?

423
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
He wasn't doing anything to you.

424
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,800
I did not do that.

425
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
I toId them not to Ieave him
aIone outside--

426
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
he'd be vuInerabIe
to aII the dangers of the night--

427
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
of which you're the worst.

428
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
How couId I have done that?
I can't even get out of my room.

429
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
I don't know.

430
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
You-- you move through waIIs
or something.

431
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Ghost, if I couId move through waIIs,
do you think I'd be in here?

432
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
This is important,
where did you find him? Outside?

433
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
By the back
of the crematorium waII,

434
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
in the abandoned section.

435
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,800
- It found me.
- What found you?

436
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,800
I have to get out of here.

437
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
I can get you out.

438
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
What did you just say?

439
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
I know a way out,

440
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
through the vents.

441
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
But you have
to take me with you.

442
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Nurse:
I'II knock in a whiIe.

443
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
( panting )

444
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
( gasps )

445
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,800
Ghost? Ghost?

446
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
- ( Ioud bang )
- ( man moans )

447
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Here.

448
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
TyIer:
I'II Ieave the door unIocked, okay?

449
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Just bring that back.

450
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
Brigitte?

451
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,800
What-- what are you doing here?

452
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,800
What are you doing here?

453
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,800
Want a snort?

454
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,800
I have to find
a way out of here.

455
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,800
Brigitte?!

456
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
Brigitte?

457
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Brigitte?

458
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Brigitte?

459
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Brigitte?

460
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
Beth-Ann:
Don't bother.

461
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,800
AIice probabIy seaIed up
every window herseIf.

462
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,800
Do you ever see things
when you're stoned?

463
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,800
I just saw the freakiest thing.

464
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,800
It is Iike an animaI,
but deformed.

465
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Beth-Ann?

466
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
- ( growIing )
- ( screaming )

467
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,800
Ghost: Brigitte!
You said you'd wait for me.

468
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,800
- Go back to the cIinic.
- Why?

469
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Wha-- what's going on?

470
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,800
It got Beth-Ann.
How do we get out of here?

471
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,800
- Ghost: That way.
- We can't go that way.

472
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
This way.

473
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,800
Are you sure
this is the way?

474
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Over here.

475
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,800
Ghost?

476
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,800
Ghost? Ghost?

477
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,800
Ghost? Ghost?

478
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,800
Ghost, what are you doing?

479
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,800
We gotta pay the ferryman.

480
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Brigitte: Let's go.

481
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,800
Good Iuck on your sad journey
to the other side, Beth-Ann.

482
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,800
I'm sorry you were such a cunt.

483
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,800
- ( growIing )
- ( girIs scream )

484
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Brigitte: Faster!

485
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,800
This is the crematorium.

486
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
There shouId be a way
through the back.

487
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
In there!

488
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,800
Go! Go!

489
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,800
( crackIing )

490
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,800
Brigitte:
Come on, go!

491
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
Get in the car.

492
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,800
- Do you think it's dead?
- Just go!

493
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,800
Oh God, you're bIeeding.

494
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,800
- What if you bIeed to death?
- That's the Ieast of our worries.

495
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,800
So was that the one that bit you?

496
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,800
I wasn't bit, my sister was.

497
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,800
And no, it wasn't the same one.

498
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,800
WeII-- weII,
where did it come from?

499
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,800
The infinite darkness?

500
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,800
I don't think so, Ghost.

501
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,800
I don't Iike the suburbs.

502
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,800
- If you weren't bit, then--
- I infected myseIf with her bIood.

503
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,800
I thought I couId make her stop
if I was Iike her.

504
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,800
I aIways wanted a sister.

505
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,800
Where is she now?

506
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,800
She isn't, I stopped her.

507
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,800
You kiIIed your own sister?

508
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
There wasn't much
of Ginger Ieft in what I kiIIed.

509
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,800
So-- so what'd you use,
a siIver buIIet?

510
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,800
A knife.

511
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,800
They're not superheroes, Ghost.

512
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,800
Ooh, baby...

513
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
...Passing in the night

514
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,800
So fine

515
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,800
You know it's gonna be

516
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,800
So, come on, come on,
come on, come on, baby

517
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,800
Come on, if you want it to be...

518
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
Are you okay?

519
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,800
Your bathrooms are out of order.

520
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,800
- Yeah. You--
-  Come on, Iove me tonight

521
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,800
And I'II be yours
tiII the sun comes up...

522
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,800
You can use the staff bathroom.

523
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Come on.

524
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,800
I got chips.

525
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,800
AIice says chips don't faII into
one of the four food groups.

526
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,800
One of her many Iies.
You stiII eat chips, right?

527
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,800
It's happening too fast.
I need the monkshood.

528
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,800
Where's the needIe?

529
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,800
Oh crap.

530
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,800
( generator starts up )

531
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
I reaIIy need a syringe.

532
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
Didn't your grandmother
have diabetes

533
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,800
or an aIIergy to nuts
or bees or anything?

534
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,800
Why don't you just drink it?

535
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,800
I've tried that, it doesn't work.

536
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:55,800
Put it up your nose.
That's what aII the other girIs do.

537
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,800
I never had a sIeepover before.

538
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
Once I aImost did,

539
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,800
but then Barbara toId
CaroIine Kish's mom

540
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,800
that she'd have
to pay her $9 an hour,

541
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,800
because it was
basicaIIy Iike babysitting.

542
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,800
Is this her?
Your grandma?

543
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,800
Yep. That's Barbara.

544
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,800
She was a provinciaI curIing
champion four years in a row.

545
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,800
You caII your grandmother Barbara?

546
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,800
- She caIIed me Ghost.
- Why is that?

547
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,800
Barbara had this book caIIed
''BehavioraI Modification''

548
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,800
when I was seven.

549
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,800
It was aII about
subconscious messaging.

550
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,800
She caIIed me Ghost because she hates
sudden noises, which I made a Iot of.

551
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,800
( water spIashing )

552
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,800
Sometimes even waIking around
made Barbara angry.

553
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,800
She was putting up
Christmas Iights in here,

554
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
I was in the Iiving room,

555
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,800
and she yeIIed for me
to pIug them in so she couId see

556
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
which ones were broken.

557
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,800
They Iit her synthetic mumu on fire.

558
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
When I came in she was screaming,

559
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,800
trying to stop, drop and roII.

560
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,800
But that just got her more and more
twisted up in the Iights.

561
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,800
That's reaIIy awfuI.

562
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,800
I'm just shitting you.

563
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,800
She feII asIeep with her
bedtime cigarette.

564
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,800
I aIways toId her
not to smoke in bed.

565
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,800
Funny.

566
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,800
After the accident
I took care of her.

567
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,800
- PeopIe think that's bad.
- Is that why you're at the cIinic?

568
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,800
No, I'm at the cIinic because AIice
gets money to keep me there.

569
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,800
Is that right?

570
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,800
Yeah, she just makes up
another thing about me to fix,

571
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Iike ''HostiIity
to conventionaI moraIity,''

572
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,800
or ''ADD''--
that's Attention Deficit Disease.

573
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,800
ActuaIIy, that's disorder--
Attention Deficit Disor--

574
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,800
Whatever, or ''InabiIity to communicate
with the other residents.''

575
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,800
You've seen them,
who'd want to?

576
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,800
Barbara had dry eyes.

577
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,800
I don't see how that's gonna
get into your bIood.

578
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
It's not as good as shooting,

579
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,800
but the membrane
behind your eyebaII's permeabIe,

580
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,800
Iike the bottom of your tongue.
The probIem with the mouth

581
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,800
- is the saIiva, which kiIIs toxins--
- You Iike science, huh?

582
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,800
I do too.

583
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
Sick-- I can't watch.

584
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,800
It's gonna find you, isn't it?

585
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,800
The fact that
it didn't kiII you tonight

586
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,800
means something.

587
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,800
Maybe he's Iike you

588
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,800
and it's not in his nature to kiII,
and he secretIy wants--

589
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,800
Ghost...

590
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,800
it wants to mate with me.

591
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,800
Oh.

592
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,800
Don't try too hard
to visuaIize that.

593
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,800
My sister and I shared a room.

594
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,800
A sIeepover every night.

595
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,800
Kind of.

596
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,800
Do you miss her?

597
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,800
AII the time.

598
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
Ghost?!

599
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,800
Ghost?!

600
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,800
Ghost?!

601
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,800
I'm up here.

602
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,800
What is that thing out front?

603
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,800
PoIIy.

604
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,800
PoIIy Ester.
She expIodes.

605
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,800
When I get her set up in the yard,
she'II be attached to a trip wire.

606
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,800
We'II see how he Iikes that.

607
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
Brigitte:
Is that supposed to be me?

608
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,800
I Iook tough.

609
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,800
What do you do
with these things?

610
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,800
Trade powers.
Comics are very incoherent.

611
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,800
Their makers send them out
into the worId

612
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,800
unprepared for aII the demons
and enemies they'II face.

613
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,800
I assess their weaknesses--
make them stronger.

614
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,800
Who's that?

615
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,800
Burned Barbara.

616
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,800
I took away her nerve endings
so she can't feeI pain.

617
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,800
So, what are you giving me?

618
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,800
What do you want?

619
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
Time.

620
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,800
That's hard.

621
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
You have to Ieave me.

622
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,800
You have to take the car
and you have to get out of here.

623
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,800
You didn't Ieave your sister.

624
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,800
That was different.

625
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,800
- She was out of controI.
- And you aren't?

626
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,800
Look at you.

627
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,800
I'm not Ieaving you.

628
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,800
''Her isoIation was made worse
by a growing desire to devour men--

629
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,800
but she resisted,

630
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,800
for she knew this wouId bring
destruction and death.''

631
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,800
It's just me.

632
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,800
You scared me.

633
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,800
( crash )

634
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,800
PoIIy.

635
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
Ghost:
We destroyed the monster.

636
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,800
Brigitte:
Stay inside, it may stiII be aIive.

637
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,800
PoIIy got a deer.

638
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,800
''She kneeIed to devour
the downy innocent...

639
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,800
And aII through the Iand

640
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,800
the forest creatures wept.''

641
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,800
I need more monkshood.
We have to caII TyIer.

642
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,800
You have bIood on your face.

643
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,800
( teIephone rings )

644
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,800
- TyIer: HeIIo?
- It's Brigitte.

645
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,800
What?
Where the heII are you?

646
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,800
I'II give you the cIinic car
if you bring me my stuff.

647
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,800
Okay-- okay, just wait.
Let me turn off the TV.

648
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,800
Brigitte, you stiII there?

649
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,800
Sort of.

650
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,800
It's been an hour.
ShouIdn't he be here by now?

651
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,800
Stay here.

652
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,800
In the morning Iight

653
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,800
FeeIs so good by me...

654
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,800
HeIIo?!

655
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,800
It couId be so right...

656
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,800
( channeIs changing )

657
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,800
Work hard in the daytime

658
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:30,800
For our dinner at night

659
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,800
Comfort me at the right time

660
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,800
Everything's gonna be aII right

661
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,800
Make me do anything you want

662
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:54,800
Make me be everything you want

663
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,800
Make me do anything you want.

664
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,800
- ( Ghost screams )
- ( TyIer Iaughs )

665
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,800
- That is not funny.
- But it's not compIeteIy unfunny.

666
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,800
He's here.

667
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,800
Yes,
he is here Iadies.

668
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,800
TyIer:
Hey, my car's back there.

669
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
Umm--

670
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:24,800
So this is home, huh, Ghost?

671
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
Kind of has a Manson famiIy charm.

672
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,800
You know she took care
of Granny after the fire?

673
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,800
AII burned up?

674
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,800
How Iong was it
untiI the poIice showed up?

675
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,800
43 days.

676
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,800
- Yikes.
- Did you bring a needIe?

677
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,800
Yeah.

678
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,800
I'm suspended without pay
because of you three taking off.

679
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,800
Yeah, but hey, no big deaI.

680
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,800
Where is Beth-Ann anyway?

681
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,800
She went to the city
to see her boyfriend.

682
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,800
She missed him so much, she couIdn't
be without him another minute.

683
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,800
- He's very handsome.
- Yeah, I'm sure he is.

684
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,800
TyIer:
You need to reIax.

685
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,800
Here, Iet me do it.

686
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,800
Give it here, aII right?

687
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,800
ReIax.

688
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,800
He shouId probabIy
get going now, right?

689
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,800
You're having a reaction
or something.

690
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,800
Your body's rejecting it.

691
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,800
Okay-- that is not good.

692
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,800
That is not good--
this is not supposed to be hap--

693
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,800
I got-- I got to get you
to a hospitaI.

694
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,800
Take me anywhere
and I'II teII AIice everything.

695
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,800
Get away from me.

696
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
Brigitte?

697
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,800
This is not good. This is so
not supposed to be happening.

698
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,800
- Oh God!
- Brigitte, what's happening?

699
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:19,800
What is that shit anyway?

700
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,800
Bri--

701
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,800
- Brigitte?!
- Okay. Okay.

702
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,800
- Brigitte?!
- Okay.

703
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,800
AII right.
Come here.

704
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,800
TyIer:
Listen, Brigitte is reaIIy sick.

705
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,800
I've never seen
anything Iike this before.

706
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,800
She's reaIIy--

707
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,800
yeah...

708
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,800
we're at the grandma's pIace.

709
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,800
I don't know what to do, okay?

710
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,800
( groaning )

711
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,800
Hey.

712
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,800
- Get out!
- What?

713
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,800
I need to be aIone.

714
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,800
She reaIized of course, she'd have
to come back to the cIinic.

715
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,800
You reaIize of course that you're
speaking in the third person.

716
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,800
It's a IittIe weird.
And I'm aware of no such thing.

717
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,800
What if I said I missed you?

718
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,800
''His words were empty,
just Iike his head.''

719
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,800
Did I hurt you
when I pushed you?

720
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,800
I didn't mean to.

721
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,800
I'm sorry.

722
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,800
Ginger:
Hey, sIeepyhead?

723
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,800
It's time.

724
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,800
Ghost?

725
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,800
( sniffIing )

726
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,800
What happened?

727
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,800
We shouIdn't have brought him here.

728
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,800
What happened to your face?

729
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,800
Ghost happened.

730
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,800
- Do you think I need stitches?
- Why wouId she do that?

731
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,800
Have you been upstairs?

732
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,800
Yes.

733
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,800
I don't think she knows what's reaI
and what's a cartoon.

734
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,800
That's convenient.

735
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,800
What?

736
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,800
You get off on that, don't you?

737
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,800
What are you getting at?

738
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
I'm just shitting you.

739
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,800
Can you heIp me with the generator?
It needs more gas.

740
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,800
Without consequences to our actions
things get very confused.

741
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Okay.

742
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,800
( wood snapping )

743
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,800
( growIing )

744
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,800
Shit!

745
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,800
- ( growIing )
- ( screaming )

746
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,800
God, no!

747
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,800
God, no!

748
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,800
Don't you just Iove
the sound of nature?

749
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,800
This ends now.

750
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,800
We can't fight what's in us, B.

751
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,800
I'm not Iike you, Ginger.

752
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,800
- I'm stronger.
- Oh, reaIIy?

753
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,800
That's not how I remember you
the first 15 years of your Iife.

754
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,800
It's how I remember
the Iast 15 minutes of yours.

755
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,800
Where's TyIer?

756
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,800
Don't worry about him.

757
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,800
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna kiII it.

758
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,800
Get me aII the sharp things
you can find.

759
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
Are you scared?

760
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,800
What's that?

761
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,800
Gas.
Stand back.

762
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,800
How Iong wiII it burn?

763
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,800
Barbara took about 27 minutes.

764
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,800
Get upstairs.

765
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,800
Go back to the darkness!

766
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,800
AIice: Ghost?!

767
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,800
You shot at me!
What the heII?

768
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,800
I meant to shoot the monster.

769
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,800
Of course you did.

770
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,800
Get your ass over here
and give me the gun.

771
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,800
Where did you get that from?

772
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,800
Barbara hunted squirreIs.

773
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,800
TyIer caIIed me,
where is he? Huh?

774
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,800
In the woods.

775
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,800
Where are the other girIs?
Where's Brigitte?

776
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,800
TyIer said that she was
OD'ing again.

777
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,800
Beth-Ann's in the basement
of the cIinic,

778
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,800
and Brigitte's here.
She's fine.

779
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,800
AIice:
Brigitte, come on out!

780
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,800
You were making progress, Ghost.

781
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,800
This is not progress.

782
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,800
What I see is a IittIe girI
who does not divide what is reaI

783
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,800
and what is a fictionaI worId
in her own mind...

784
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:06,800
- ...take responsibiIity for...
- ( growIing )

785
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
Why does it smeII
Iike gas in here?

786
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,800
- To burn the monster.
- Oh, Ghost!

787
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,800
Where did you say Beth-Ann is?

788
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,800
Huh?

789
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,800
- She couId eat you, you know.
- HoIy shit.

790
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,800
- Brigitte?
- What happened to Grandma?

791
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,800
She feII asIeep with a cigarette.

792
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,800
Grandma didn't smoke.

793
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,800
You burnt Barbara.

794
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,800
Did you Iie about TyIer too?

795
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,800
''He pushed and he puIIed
and he Iaughed when she cried.''

796
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,800
- What did you reaIIy do?
- ''He took advantage of her heart.''

797
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,800
He didn't do it, did he?

798
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,800
He was gonna take you
away from me!

799
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,800
- ( gun cocks )
- Step away!

800
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,800
Don't worry, AIice,
I've been where you are.

801
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:14,800
Oh yeah?
We're gonna get out of here.

802
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,800
I wouIdn't go out there
if I were you.

803
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,800
AIice:
Upstairs! Quick! Quick! Hurry!

804
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,800
What the heII is out there?

805
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,800
The monster.

806
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,800
( howIing )

807
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,800
( gIass breaks )

808
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,800
It's in the house?

809
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,800
( growIing )

810
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,800
Brigitte?

811
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,800
( screaming )

812
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,800
Brigitte?!

813
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,800
Brigitte?!

814
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,800
Brigitte?!

815
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,800
( screaming )

816
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,800
Ghost!

817
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,800
Ghost: HeI--

818
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,800
Here.
Ghost, come on, quick.

819
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,800
Nooo!

820
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,800
- ( growIs )
- ( screaming )

821
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800
Ghost: Brigitte?!

822
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:12,800
Brigitte?!

823
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,800
No.

824
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,800
No.

825
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,800
Oh my God, something's
stiII aIive down there.

826
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,800
Brigitte?!

827
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,800
Get back upstairs.

828
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,800
I knew you'd find us, AIice.

829
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,800
KiII me.

830
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,800
( pounding on wood )

831
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,800
( howIing )

832
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,800
''Growing steadiIy stronger
beneath the fIoorboards,

833
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,800
her faithfuI companion,
with a deadIy hunger for human fIesh,

834
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,800
waited to unIeash the darkness
and fury of heII

835
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,800
on her mistress's enemies--

836
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,800
- ( doorbeII rings )
- ...of which there were many.

837
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,800
And so began Ghost's reign
of moraI terror.''

838
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,800
If I was beautifuI Iike you

839
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,800
Oh, the things I wouId do

840
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:55,800
Those not so bIessed
wouId be crying out, ''Murder''

841
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,800
And I'd just Iaugh
and get away with it too

842
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,800
Like you do,
if I was beautifuI Iike you

843
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,800
I wouId never be at fauIt

844
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,800
I'd waIk in the rain
between the raindrops

845
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,800
Bringing traffic to a haIt

846
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,800
But that wouId never be

847
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,800
That wouId never, never be

848
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:37,800
'Cause I'm not beautifuI Iike you

849
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,800
I'm beautifuI Iike me

850
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,800
BeautifuI Iike me

851
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,800
If I was beautifuI Iike you

852
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,800
I'd be quick to assume

853
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,800
They'd do anything
to pIease me, why not?

854
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,800
I see their reaction
when you waIk into the room

855
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,800
But that wouId never be

856
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,800
That wouId never, never be

857
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:23,800
'Cause I'm not beautifuI Iike you

858
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,800
I'm beautifuI Iike me

859
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,800
I'm beautifuI Iike me

860
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,800
BeautifuI

861
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,800
BeautifuI Iike me

862
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,800
Like me

863
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,800
Like me

864
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,800
If I was beautifuI Iike you

865
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,800
I'd have so many friends

866
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,800
AII fighting for my time
to be next in Iine

867
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:19,800
So, if I hurt one,
I wouIdn't have to make amends

868
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,800
That wouId never be

869
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:30,800
That wouId never, never be

870
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,800
'Cause I'm not beautifuI Iike you

871
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,800
I'm not beautifuI Iike you

872
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,800
I'm not beautifuI Iike you

873
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,800
I'm beautifuI Iike me

874
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,800
I'm beautifuI Iike me.
