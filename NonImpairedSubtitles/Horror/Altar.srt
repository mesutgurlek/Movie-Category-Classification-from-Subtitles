1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,642
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with Y.

2
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,964
Yorkshire.
You can't SEE Yorkshire.

3
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:04,285
Yellow.
I don't see anything yellow.

4
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:09,608
Penny, these moors
have been inspiration for a lot
of great British artists.

5
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,690
Maybe they'll be good for you, too.

6
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,814
Look, kids!

7
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:25,336
There's Heathcliff chasing Catherine
across the moor.

8
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,737
I don't see anybody.

9
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,219
Just a load of...empty.

10
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:49,749
Creepy.
I think it looks nice.

11
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:52,070
Wait till your mom's done with it.

12
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,352
Rock stars and royalty
will be lining up around the block

13
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:58,593
to get into one of Brad Mason's
parties. What block?

14
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:02,795
All I see is green stuff.
It's only for six months.

15
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:05,597
Six months?
I thought it was four months.

16
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:07,798
It depends what I find.

17
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:11,600
If there's woodworm and dry rot,
it could take longer.

18
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:18,523
Come on!
We're going to enjoy ourselves.

19
00:02:18,564 --> 00:02:20,484
This is an adventure.

20
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:24,527
An adventure that pays well.

21
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,768
I'll drink to that.

22
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:51,420
There it is!

23
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:03,507
Who'd pay money to stay in a dump
like this?

24
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:06,388
Come on. Let's get settled in.

25
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:18,234
Mum, there's no signal. What kind
of hotel doesn't have bathrooms?

26
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:20,475
It wasn't a hotel. It was a B&B.

27
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:23,917
There's a bathroom down the hall.
Yeah, still!

28
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:30,921
Is there no water? No. Sorry,
darling. I'll fix it tomorrow.

29
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,484
Ooh!

30
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:42,247
Budge up. Let me in.

31
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,372
Think you're going to be able
to work here?

32
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:56,414
I think I could work anywhere.

33
00:03:56,454 --> 00:04:00,416
But right now,
I just really want to go to sleep.

34
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,414
Right.

35
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,300
Three, two, one.

36
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:34,624
Yeah. It's perfect.
What was it before? A games room.

37
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:40,267
When it was built,
it was an artist's studio.
Radcliffe had an artist?

38
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:43,789
No. Radcliffe WAS an artist,
a landscape painter.

39
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:49,272
Shouldn't wonder,
with all this landscape lying about.
It's not too late to join the fun.

40
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:53,314
I'd get crazy up here. When has
that been bad for an artist? True.

41
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,636
Perhaps you'll make something
worth selling.

42
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,076
What?

43
00:05:58,116 --> 00:05:59,997
And ruin my marriage?

44
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:04,840
Is she all right?
She has a broken jaw.

45
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,081
The car's a write-off.
Jesus!

46
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:10,403
It could be serious.
They want to do a brain scan.

47
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:15,605
I'm sorry, Meg. I can't leave her.
Maybe you could get Tony to help?

48
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:18,767
But Tony's on a build in Scotland.

49
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:23,449
Look, they're calling me back.
What about that Italian guy?

50
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,651
Can you hear me? Frank?

51
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,647
Greg left. Couldn't get out of here
fast enough.

52
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,730
Is everything all right?
Celia's had a car accident.

53
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,891
God! Is she all right?
Yeah.

54
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,533
But Frank's got to look after her.
What are you going to do?

55
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:51,695
I don't know.
I'll...find a local guy?

56
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:55,457
Can you help me with something?

57
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:59,619
It must be nailed shut.

58
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,220
What's in there?

59
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,902
I've no idea, but from the skylight,
it's worth a look.

60
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:09,544
That's it. Nearly there.

61
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:16,348
Ooh. Are you all right?
Yeah. It's just a nick.

62
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:20,350
I'm all right.
Come on. After three.

63
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,511
Two, three!

64
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:27,994
Ooh!

65
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:33,797
What do you think this place was?
I have no idea!

66
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:37,999
It's not on any of the plans.

67
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,040
I wonder why.

68
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,131
What are you going to do with it?

69
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:05,093
Turn it into a playroom
for one of Brad's kids?

70
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:10,015
I have a feeling
this house is full of surprises.

71
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,898
What the hell is that?

72
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:16,619
Wow!

73
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:20,100
Right. I've got a builder to find.

74
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,272
I'm looking for Mr Donnelly.

75
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:50,076
Sean Donnelly?
I'm not available.

76
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:53,157
I've come about a long-term job.
Radcliffe.

77
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:55,719
Yeah. Wow. How do you know that?

78
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,241
You're the American banker's
designer from London.

79
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:04,843
Why do I get the feeling
you don't approve? I don't mind
who lives in that house.

80
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:07,645
I just don't want
to turn it into Disneyland.

81
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:12,607
That's not what we're doing.
Is it true he hasn't set foot
in the place?

82
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,768
That he bought it on the internet?

83
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:18,410
He doesn't want to see it
until it's fully restored.

84
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,932
Many of those skills are long gone,
Miss...?

85
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,013
Hamilton, Meg.

86
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:29,256
What do you know
about Yorkshire stone?

87
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:33,818
I know that if you try and fix a
bronze dial plate by F Baker & Sons

88
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:38,181
to a Mark Blanchard pedestal
using hydrated cement paste

89
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,662
it'll probably corrode
in three years.

90
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:44,544
You need to use lime mortar
and a French binding agent.

91
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:47,866
If you want it to last.

92
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:55,069
Mrs Hamilton?

93
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,000
! Sorry!

94
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,961
I'm doing laps.
What the hell?

95
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,242
Harper, can you...?

96
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:31,248
What is that horrible thing?
It's a fountain.

97
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:34,449
It used to live outside the back
of the house.

98
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,771
It won't be horrible
once you've cleaned it up. No, Mum.

99
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:41,253
I've got books to read for school.

100
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,068
Mum? Mm-hm.

101
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:12,829
Have a look.
What is it?

102
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:15,150
Come and see this.

103
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,432
What?

104
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:20,713
What is that?

105
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:25,396
I don't know. It's a flare
or a reflection or something.

106
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:28,517
No. It looks like...

107
00:12:28,557 --> 00:12:30,919
Is that a ghost?

108
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,480
Woooo

109
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,681
Knock twice
if you can hear me!

110
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:42,645
Blow it up on your screen.
Don't touch my...

111
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:44,526
OK. Sorry.

112
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:47,807
What do you want to look at?
The picture.

113
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:59,973
Now I don't see anything.
How can it be there and not here?

114
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:03,655
I don't know. Printer's screwed.
It's a rubbish printer.

115
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:06,537
Maybe it's a different picture.
It's not! Look!

116
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,658
It's the only one I took.

117
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:11,539
See? Nothing there.

118
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,461
Come on. Let's get some lunch.
I'm starving.

119
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:17,182
And you should be doing
differential calculus!

120
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:20,544
OK.
It's nothing. It's in your head.

121
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:06,229
Mrs Hamilton?

122
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,312
Donnelly. I knocked.
Figured you couldn't hear me.

123
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:14,554
Yeah. Thanks for coming.
You did want me here at four?

124
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:17,675
Yes, yes. Sorry, I was miles away.

125
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:19,716
What have you found?

126
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:23,638
I don't know.
I think it's a bricked-up doorway.

127
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:27,520
That would have been the root cellar
when the house was built.

128
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,203
People closed them up when fridges
came in. OK. Give me a second.

129
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,924
I'm just going to patch this up.

130
00:16:34,964 --> 00:16:39,006
I can only do three days a week
and my lad even less.

131
00:16:39,046 --> 00:16:41,808
Well, I'll take what I can get.

132
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,772
I think we should start at the top
of the house and work our way down.

133
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:57,376
As I said,
my client wants to see the place
returned to its original state.

134
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:01,338
I think we might get away
with mostly decorative work...

135
00:17:12,503 --> 00:17:14,825
What was that?

136
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:19,987
It's just the boiler.
Are you sure that's what it was?

137
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:27,591
It's not going to do that all night?
Can you go check, Dad?

138
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,993
Your mum wears the plumber's pants
in this house, sweetie.

139
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:41,438
Ooh!
Where do you think you're going?

140
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,719
I'm going to shut down
the bloody boiler.

141
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,521
I'm not finished with you yet.

142
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:14,095
Jesus!

143
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:13,677
That felt great!
You had a shower?

144
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:18,119
Piping hot and great pressure.
I've got to hand it to you, Meg.

145
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,280
I turned the boiler off.

146
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,961
Yeah. Very funny

147
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:27,164
I...thought I saw a woman
wandering around the garden.

148
00:20:27,204 --> 00:20:31,486
Probably a nosy neighbour curious
about the aliens from London.

149
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:33,887
Maybe I'm just tired.

150
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,265
Do you know what I think?

151
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:12,267
I think that you're more beautiful
now than when we first met.

152
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:15,949
I don't believe you.

153
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:19,030
Why?

154
00:21:20,551 --> 00:21:24,073
I think you wish...
I'd never cut my hair.

155
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:43,203
I'm obviously not the woman
you fell in love with, Alec.

156
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:47,765
I don't know what's happened to her.

157
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:51,647
This is your moment.

158
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:56,449
You're perfect as you are now.

159
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,491
But that's not ME.

160
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,226
Mm.

161
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,751
Mm.

162
00:24:02,794 --> 00:24:05,756
Get your fucking hands off me!

163
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:24,886
Get away!

164
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:30,649
Get away, Alec, please!

165
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,930
No!

166
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,932
Stop it!

167
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:35,313
Penny?

168
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:37,434
Penny, the door's locked.

169
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:43,317
The key must have dropped out.
Can you see it on the floor?

170
00:26:44,998 --> 00:26:47,719
Penny? Have you got your inhaler?

171
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,801
Shit!

172
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,167
I'm coming!

173
00:27:04,328 --> 00:27:05,729
Coming!

174
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:13,252
Shit!

175
00:27:14,853 --> 00:27:17,174
Penny, stand clear.

176
00:27:21,137 --> 00:27:23,258
Where's your inhaler?

177
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,901
Here we go.

178
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:34,263
Exhale...and in.

179
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:36,745
Big one. Good girl. And again.

180
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,707
And breathe in. There we go.

181
00:27:40,747 --> 00:27:43,588
Let the medicine work. Good girl.

182
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:47,830
Deep breath. You're OK.

183
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,992
There was a woman.
She...was here with me.

184
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:54,874
No. That's just a bad dream.
No, it's not.

185
00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:59,356
What's happening?

186
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:02,518
Don't worry.
She just had an asthma attack.

187
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,720
Go back to bed, darling. No way.
I'm sleeping in your bed now.

188
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,641
Are you OK?

189
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,022
So, who wants to go
to the beach today?

190
00:28:50,302 --> 00:28:53,464
There's a town called Whitby,
not far from here.

191
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:55,505
That's where Dracula landed.

192
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:58,867
They put him in a coffin because
the sunlight burnt his skin.

193
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:02,789
Shut up, Harper. It was the centre
of the creepy universe.

194
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:16,036
Since when do you work all night?
I'm on the brink of something.

195
00:29:16,076 --> 00:29:18,677
Where's the tea? We don't have tea.

196
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:24,080
Don't tell me you forgot the tea?
No. We don't drink it.
There's coffee on the stove.

197
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,882
Penny saw a ghost.
What?

198
00:29:27,922 --> 00:29:32,884
She had a nightmare. She got
wound up and had an asthma attack.

199
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:37,086
It was a real fucking ghost.
Penny!

200
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:40,288
What kind of language is that,
young lady?

201
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:45,451
It's the language of a girl
who's been neglected by her father,

202
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:49,213
which is why you're taking them
to the bloody seaside today.

203
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:51,254
Today's no good.

204
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,255
Alec!

205
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:00,458
Alec, we agreed you'd look after
the kids till they start school.

206
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,020
And I will. Just not today.

207
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,422
I'm in the middle of something.
I'm very pleased for you.

208
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:09,703
And you can pick it up
when they start school next week.

209
00:30:09,743 --> 00:30:13,025
This isn't something
you can pick up and drop off.

210
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:25,111
It's important that you position it
in line with the study window.

211
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:30,354
Ten yards from the house.
It's this distance here.

212
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:03,011
There were cuts and scars
up her arms. I didn't dream it, Mum.

213
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:06,452
I know it must seem like that,
but sometimes we can't tell.

214
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:08,614
Then why was the door locked?

215
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:12,456
Penny, the door doesn't have a lock.
The door was jammed.

216
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,937
Jammed?
Old houses move over time.

217
00:31:15,977 --> 00:31:18,098
Things stick.

218
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:23,541
You know Emily? Her uncle bought
this place which was haunted.

219
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,543
He got this guy
who sorted it out in one visit.

220
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:29,784
Have you been Tweeting about this?
We've got to do something.

221
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:32,946
It's not a priest. He just says
he was born with a gift.

222
00:31:32,986 --> 00:31:35,667
My God! You've contacted him.
No, Mum.

223
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:39,309
Emily sent me his home page so
we could check him out. Let me see.

224
00:31:41,871 --> 00:31:44,312
You've got to be kidding.
He's super-discreet.

225
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:48,754
Promise me that you won't talk
about this online any more. Mum!

226
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:51,956
This is my work you're dissing,
Penny!

227
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:54,157
I'm going to get a reputation.

228
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:28,085
Fix yourselves some lunch.
I'm going to check on the guys.

229
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:33,168
Donnelly!

230
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:41,692
"Sorry we missed you."

231
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:56,940
What happened?
We have a little problem.

232
00:33:59,782 --> 00:34:02,183
Wow!

233
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:07,826
My lad's not normally superstitious.
Neither am I.

234
00:34:07,866 --> 00:34:13,709
But we thought, with the history
of the place and all,
you'd want to keep it covered.

235
00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:16,670
I thought you understood.

236
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:18,751
The history of the place is
exactly what we're here to restore.

237
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:24,034
Then I'm afraid you're on your own.

238
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:31,758
Why is it such a big deal?
I've got a reputation, Mrs Hamilton.

239
00:34:31,798 --> 00:34:34,239
Small,
but enough to keep me in work.

240
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:38,802
If word spread that Sean Donnelly
invited the wrong publicity,
I'll lose my business.

241
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:43,684
What kind of publicity? There are
rumours that Radcliffe built
the place as a sort of temple.

242
00:34:43,724 --> 00:34:47,166
It was so long ago, thankfully,
it's all they are - rumours.

243
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:49,687
Now I'm not so sure.
It's just a work of art.

244
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:52,849
No. It's a work of the devil.
That is ridiculous!

245
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:56,651
Is it? He killed his wife
in some sort of ritual.

246
00:34:56,691 --> 00:35:01,573
She haunted him day and night until
he threw himself from the window.

247
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:07,336
If I were you, I'd persuade
your American banker to tear it down
and start from scratch.

248
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:23,745
You've been in there all day?

249
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:27,667
How was the beach?
You missed the phone engineer.

250
00:35:27,707 --> 00:35:30,828
I'm sorry, babe.
Can you stop walking away from me?

251
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:34,350
I'm trying to talk to you.
Alec, this is important.

252
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:39,913
Donnelly's just quit.
I've got to find someone else.
I really need you to pitch in.

253
00:35:39,953 --> 00:35:44,435
Would you sit for me? This
is serious. A couple of sessions.

254
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,637
I can't do this on my own!
I'm in the thick of it, Meg.

255
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:51,999
Look, this is our pay cheque. OK?
It's our only pay cheque.

256
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:56,402
Since your last show, we don't have
any money. I understand all that.

257
00:35:56,442 --> 00:36:00,003
But what I'm doing
will change our lives for ever.

258
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:04,366
Alec, I'm really glad for you
that you found something new,

259
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:07,767
but right now,
I just need your help.

260
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:09,288
OK.

261
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:11,169
OK?

262
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:15,531
OK.

263
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:16,972
Thanks.

264
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:18,653
Really?

265
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:23,776
I'll set aside some time
in the afternoons.

266
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:44,208
Thank God!

267
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,996
Hello?

268
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:42,278
Is that you, petal?
Who is this?

269
00:39:50,162 --> 00:39:52,723
Agh! Agh! God!

270
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,926
! You scared me.

271
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:03,689
What are you doing in here?

272
00:40:03,729 --> 00:40:07,571
Well, I... I just...
I was answering the phone.

273
00:40:07,611 --> 00:40:11,093
I guess the engineer
must have connected it, after all.

274
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:14,654
Phone?
You didn't hear the phone?

275
00:40:17,296 --> 00:40:19,977
Listen, I don't think
we should leave this light.

276
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,899
Did you put this light on?
No. I thought you did.

277
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,861
OK. Let's get out of here.

278
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:42,469
Let's not do this in here.

279
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,870
Can we go upstairs?

280
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:54,075
Alec, can we go up? This room
really gives me the creeps.

281
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:56,516
I don't like it in here. No!

282
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:58,477
Alec, please, no!

283
00:40:58,517 --> 00:41:00,918
I don't like it here, please!

284
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,360
Please, Alec. No.

285
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,642
I don't like it.

286
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:29,853
Hi. Thanks for coming back.

287
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:32,174
Just through there.

288
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:37,377
On the table at the end.

289
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:41,259
Unless that's been converted to
digital, it's never going to work.

290
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:44,901
It was working last night,
but dead again this morning.

291
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:51,144
Well, I can't see how
that's possible. It's not connected.

292
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:54,466
I can't even see
a telephone socket down there.

293
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:57,227
Madam?

294
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,271
OK. Let's go.

295
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:55,768
Absolutely, Bradley. Yeah.

296
00:43:55,808 --> 00:43:59,890
Not only are we on schedule, we're
also finding some amazing stuff!

297
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,932
Great.
Many original features are intact.

298
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:06,013
Which is why, I imagine,
you wanted to buy it.

299
00:44:06,054 --> 00:44:08,135
I didn't buy it. I inherited it.

300
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:11,136
Inherited it?
Yeah. I thought you knew that. No.

301
00:44:11,176 --> 00:44:15,779
The will showed up after 150 years,
buried in some trust somewhere.

302
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,180
The original owner had a sister -
my great-great aunt.

303
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,341
You just discovered that?
Yeah.

304
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:25,103
I guess Victorian paperwork
was not all it's cracked up to be.

305
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:29,105
The only condition was that it's
maintained in its original state.

306
00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:35,229
All I need to do is to get
the executor to check your work
and they'll sign over the deeds.

307
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:38,190
What will you do with it?
Sell it. Keep up the good work!

308
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,439
Hello?

309
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,123
Hello?

310
00:45:02,811 --> 00:45:08,021
I believe you found artwork
of historical interest in the house.

311
00:45:08,061 --> 00:45:10,266
I'm sorry. You are...?

312
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:13,873
Charles Kendrick Walker.

313
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,809
I've always wondered
about this place.
You've been talking to Donnelly?

314
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:23,813
I'd love to take a peak.

315
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:27,581
We're not open to the public.
You misunderstand, Mrs Hamilton.

316
00:45:27,621 --> 00:45:31,749
I'm somewhat of an expert
on the era. I may be able to help.

317
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:34,154
I don't need any help, thank you.

318
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:37,120
Word spreads pretty fast round here.

319
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,725
Good as well as bad.

320
00:45:39,765 --> 00:45:42,050
If we can dispel superstition,

321
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:46,819
encourage people to regard Radcliffe
with fascination, rather than fear,

322
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:50,507
we may be able to restore it
to the status it deserves.

323
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:56,038
I'm a historian, Mrs Hamilton.
Believe me, you need my expertise.

324
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:03,653
Good heavens!

325
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:07,421
The glass is 1860, but I think
the design is a lot earlier.

326
00:46:07,461 --> 00:46:10,587
It goes back to the ancients.
You know what it is?

327
00:46:10,627 --> 00:46:12,832
A map of the human soul.

328
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:16,679
Rosicrucians call it
the Emerald Tablet of Hermes.

329
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,964
Radcliffe was an alchemist?

330
00:46:19,004 --> 00:46:21,249
Yes. A very good one.

331
00:46:23,173 --> 00:46:26,940
What happened here? I guess somebody
didn't like her face.

332
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,908
The glass was shattered. It must
have been hit with something hard.

333
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:33,794
Will you be able to restore it?

334
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:36,880
If I can find out
what she looked like, yes.

335
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,688
There's a painting at the Victorian
Museum of Art in Leeds.

336
00:46:40,728 --> 00:46:47,221
Radcliffe was a landscape artist,
but he left one portrait
of his wife, Isabella.

337
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:50,868
This amazing illumination
features in the background.

338
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,592
Great.

339
00:46:52,632 --> 00:46:54,836
I'll check it out.

340
00:46:54,876 --> 00:46:59,967
There would have been an effigy
of the Hermetic ray hanging over
the tablet.

341
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:02,171
The altar.

342
00:47:04,736 --> 00:47:07,903
Will you be restoring the house
to its original state?

343
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:12,111
Yes. That's the plan.
Not really sure what to do
with this room, though.

344
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:15,157
Do? You said you were going
to restore it.

345
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,528
My employer doesn't really
have a use for a Rosicrucian altar.

346
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:25,017
And then there are the rumours
around town.

347
00:47:25,057 --> 00:47:28,785
These are simple folk, Mrs Hamilton.

348
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:33,314
The miracle of metempsychosis is not
something they would understand.

349
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:35,879
But Radcliffe did kill his wife?

350
00:47:38,003 --> 00:47:40,368
It was an accident.

351
00:47:40,408 --> 00:47:43,374
He loved her more than life itself.

352
00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:48,625
Why don't you meet my husband?

353
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,791
I'm afraid I'm a little pushed
for time.

354
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:54,958
You will put in a good word for us
in town?

355
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,286
I'll do my best.

356
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:08,184
I think that was a tie!

357
00:48:10,028 --> 00:48:12,192
Hi. Is there anything to eat?

358
00:48:12,232 --> 00:48:17,764
There are cold cuts in the fridge
and there's that bread you like.
Can you grab something?

359
00:48:17,804 --> 00:48:22,253
"Hi, Pen. How was your bike ride?"
Internet's working.

360
00:48:48,265 --> 00:48:50,590
My God! That's her!

361
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,397
The woman in my room! That's her!
It's just some stupid picture.

362
00:48:54,438 --> 00:48:58,686
Why were you looking at that?
It came up when I was researching.

363
00:48:58,726 --> 00:49:01,933
Mum, that is definitely her.
Penny, calm down.

364
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:04,899
Look, it's very common.
It's like a deja vu.

365
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:10,871
When you're tired and stressed,
you feel like you've seen someone
in a dream and you haven't.

366
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,237
I promise you! That is the woman
with the cuts up her arm!

367
00:49:14,278 --> 00:49:18,566
You said she was looking out the
window. Yes. How can you be sure?

368
00:49:18,606 --> 00:49:22,614
She looked at me. I saw her face!
Please, we've got to leave now.

369
00:49:22,654 --> 00:49:24,859
Please!
What's going on?

370
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:29,308
Can you go? I'll be up in a minute.
What have I done wrong now?

371
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:32,154
Just go upstairs now,
please!

372
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:36,562
Listen, Penny, I know you're upset.

373
00:49:36,603 --> 00:49:42,254
If you're really not happy here,
I could try and organise for you
to live with Grandpa in London.

374
00:49:42,294 --> 00:49:46,022
Would you like to do that
for a couple of months? No, Mum.

375
00:49:46,062 --> 00:49:48,827
Please, we have to all leave
right now.

376
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:51,032
I can't leave.

377
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:55,761
I have to finish this job. We need
the money. Try and understand, OK?

378
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:58,887
I've fixed the hot water.
I'll run you a nice hot bath.

379
00:49:58,928 --> 00:50:05,661
We'll all snuggle down
in the bed together
and watch a movie on the iPad, yeah?

380
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:08,707
Something, you know, like a comedy.

381
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:23,257
Was it Reverend Green in the cellar
with the lead pipe?

382
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:27,706
Who's that?

383
00:50:38,086 --> 00:50:41,133
May I help you?
Nigel Lean at your service.

384
00:50:41,173 --> 00:50:43,578
This the old spooky pile?

385
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:47,425
God! You're the ghost whisperer,
aren't you?

386
00:50:47,465 --> 00:50:52,195
This is Bessie. I'm terribly sorry.
There's been a misunderstanding.

387
00:50:52,235 --> 00:50:54,399
I know... Mum?

388
00:50:56,243 --> 00:50:58,528
At least show him round, OK?

389
00:51:03,377 --> 00:51:06,303
So, you're a plumber as well?

390
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:10,311
A man's got to make a living.
I'd have thought exorcism...

391
00:51:10,352 --> 00:51:14,279
I don't charge for my cleansing
work. There's rules about that.

392
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,364
But I will take a cup of coffee.

393
00:51:16,404 --> 00:51:19,851
Don't tell me. Milk and two sugars?
You're psychic, Mrs H

394
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:26,504
It kind of looked like a smudge,
but there was definitely a figure.

395
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:30,632
And then, the other night
I was going to bed and...

396
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:34,520
My mum says it was a dream
but I saw this woman.

397
00:51:35,923 --> 00:51:38,047
Here we are.

398
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:44,661
I should just explain,
my husband and I don't believe
in ghosts or spirits, Mr Lean.

399
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:48,669
No-one does, Mrs H, till
they experience one first hand.

400
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:50,873
Are you feeling one right now?

401
00:51:50,913 --> 00:51:53,478
The house has a very strong aura.

402
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:55,643
No doubt about it.

403
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,344
Can I take a look around?

404
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:09,110
As long as you don't break anything.

405
00:52:26,265 --> 00:52:28,549
Been cooking, have we?

406
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,826
Mm!

407
00:52:47,628 --> 00:52:50,634
Yep. That's some psychotic pharmacy.

408
00:52:50,674 --> 00:52:53,439
What?
It's a nasty red potion.

409
00:52:53,479 --> 00:52:55,604
Takes a while to kick in.

410
00:52:55,644 --> 00:52:59,732
Word of caution - be very careful
what you drink. Understood?

411
00:53:01,496 --> 00:53:04,502
OK, that's it.
Upstairs, both of you.

412
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:07,508
Mum...! No!
I've heard enough. Upstairs!

413
00:53:07,548 --> 00:53:13,199
He said we could watch!
We're leaving Mr Lean
to find his own way out.

414
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:15,364
Please let him do the cleansing.

415
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,129
He's not helping.
He's spooking us, that's all.

416
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:39,373
I'm sorry, Mr Lean. I can't have you
scaring the kids like that.

417
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:46,427
Is something wrong?
He's still here.

418
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:51,838
Who? It's not safe.
He wants to take over, take control.

419
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:58,411
You're not making any sense.
He was a painter. He died
on that fountain from the fall.

420
00:54:58,451 --> 00:55:01,698
My God! Radcliffe.
Penny, go upstairs, please.

421
00:55:01,738 --> 00:55:04,985
No, not Radcliffe.
His name was different.

422
00:55:05,025 --> 00:55:07,470
Walker, I think.

423
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:10,916
I'll leave you this,
in case of anything untoward.

424
00:55:10,957 --> 00:55:14,524
Basically, it's holy water
with a few add-ons. It's pukka.

425
00:55:14,564 --> 00:55:16,889
OK. Goodbye, Mr Lean.

426
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:19,935
There's something else,
a feeling I picked up.

427
00:55:19,975 --> 00:55:23,342
I've never quite...
You have to be careful.

428
00:55:23,382 --> 00:55:27,390
What do you mean, careful?
He loved her, that's the problem.

429
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:31,879
He loved her too much and now...
he wants to take control.

430
00:55:31,919 --> 00:55:36,809
Control of what? The house?
No, no. Not the house. Of you.

431
00:55:40,376 --> 00:55:43,662
Goodbye, Mr Lean.
Penny, back in the house, please.

432
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:50,997
He said a painter lived here.
Radcliffe was a painter.

433
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:54,965
All that information is
on the internet for anyone to see.

434
00:55:55,005 --> 00:55:57,851
These guys always do their research.

435
00:55:57,891 --> 00:56:01,017
Go and hang with your brother.
I'll be up in a minute.

436
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,502
Wait. Where are you going?

437
00:56:03,543 --> 00:56:07,671
I'm just going to check on Dad.
. I'll come with you. No.

438
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:11,398
Penny, your dad and I need
a bit of private time, OK?

439
00:56:11,438 --> 00:56:14,605
Take this -
in case of anything untoward!

440
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,691
OK.

441
00:56:24,144 --> 00:56:27,190
Metempsychosis.

442
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,926
"Metempsychotic pharmacy."

443
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,337
Jesus!

444
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,874
Charles Kendrick Walker.

445
00:57:11,399 --> 00:57:14,566
I've always wondered
about this place.

446
00:57:34,085 --> 00:57:35,648
Alec?

447
00:57:40,298 --> 00:57:41,700
Alec?

448
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,326
What do you think?

449
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:17,372
What is this?

450
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,020
Jesus!
Different, huh?

451
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,747
I wanted to wait till
she was a little bit further along,

452
00:58:24,787 --> 00:58:27,593
but I suppose now's as good a time
as any.

453
00:58:30,118 --> 00:58:33,244
I could have done with a couple
more sessions with you.

454
00:58:33,284 --> 00:58:36,651
I had to settle for sketching you
while you slept. Me?

455
00:58:37,653 --> 00:58:42,944
Alec, this isn't me. Wait till
she's cast and finished. You'll see.

456
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:47,072
You're difficult to nail down.
Jesus!

457
00:58:47,112 --> 00:58:49,677
What have you done to yourself?

458
00:58:51,722 --> 00:58:55,529
It sounds crazy, but the blood
makes the clay easier to work.

459
00:58:55,569 --> 00:58:58,215
The woman in Radcliffe's portrait.

460
00:59:00,098 --> 00:59:05,469
His wife. Why are you sculpting
Radcliffe's wife?

461
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:07,554
What are you talking about?

462
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:12,564
It's exactly the same face,
the same position, everything.

463
00:59:12,604 --> 00:59:14,808
Meg, it's supposed to be you.

464
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:20,099
Alec, he was a Rosicrucian.

465
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:24,067
He killed his wife in some ritual
in this house.

466
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:27,594
This job's pushed you over the edge.
You need to get back to therapy.

467
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:32,123
Our daughter is having a breakdown.
She believes she saw this woman
in her bedroom.

468
00:59:32,163 --> 00:59:35,209
That was a nightmare.
You said so yourself.

469
00:59:35,249 --> 00:59:37,293
I'm going back to London.

470
00:59:37,334 --> 00:59:40,099
No. I'm taking the kids.
I'll run the job from there.

471
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:43,466
NO! I'm not going anywhere
and neither are you.

472
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:47,354
Don't you care about our daughter?

473
00:59:47,394 --> 00:59:50,841
Of course I do, but I also care
about me for a change.

474
00:59:53,206 --> 00:59:57,053
This is the best work
I've ever done. Probably ever!

475
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:02,464
I'm not about to give that up now.
This isn't your work, Alec.

476
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:06,873
What are you talking about?
You don't draw like this.

477
01:00:06,913 --> 01:00:10,120
This is your stuff and I love it!
It's real.

478
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,284
This is not yours.

479
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:26,312
Get out!

480
01:00:41,463 --> 01:00:43,186
Um...

481
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:48,357
First thing tomorrow,
after we've had a good sleep,
I'm going to have a family meeting.

482
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:50,481
I think I'm ready to...

483
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,327
go back to London
and work the build from there.

484
01:00:53,367 --> 01:00:54,970
Really?

485
01:00:56,854 --> 01:01:02,465
It's going to cost a lot more money,
but I think I can persuade Bradley
to step up.

486
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:05,351
Mum...we should leave now.

487
01:01:06,754 --> 01:01:09,199
Your father's not ready
to leave yet.

488
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,203
And, um...

489
01:01:11,243 --> 01:01:14,049
and I'm not leaving him here
on his own.

490
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,565
Harper?
Mum!

491
01:02:53,088 --> 01:02:55,012
Harper?
Mum!

492
01:02:55,693 --> 01:02:57,417
Harper?

493
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:02,667
Are you there?
Mum! Mum!

494
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:04,591
Harper?

495
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:08,800
Mum! Stop! Stop!
Harper, where are you?

496
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,407
Mum! Mum! Mum!
I hear you. I can't...

497
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:15,052
Mum? Mum!

498
01:03:21,305 --> 01:03:25,193
Harper!
Mum! Mum! Get the door!

499
01:03:41,666 --> 01:03:46,235
Harper, is that you? Are you there?
Answer me!

500
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:54,692
Shit!

501
01:03:55,494 --> 01:03:57,939
For Christ's sake, Penny!
Where's Harper?

502
01:03:57,979 --> 01:04:01,586
I think he's fallen into
the root cellar. The what?

503
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:03,831
OK, I'll find Dad.
No!

504
01:04:10,043 --> 01:04:12,889
Harper, get back from the wall.

505
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:15,294
Get back from the wall!

506
01:04:20,785 --> 01:04:22,228
Dad?

507
01:04:25,555 --> 01:04:27,038
Dad?

508
01:04:31,406 --> 01:04:32,849
Dad?

509
01:04:35,655 --> 01:04:38,421
Dad? Dad?

510
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,066
Dad...?

511
01:04:47,439 --> 01:04:49,042
Mum.

512
01:04:49,082 --> 01:04:50,805
Mum! Mum!

513
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:54,012
Mum! Mum.

514
01:04:55,335 --> 01:04:56,978
Mum!

515
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,142
Mum!

516
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:05,075
God!

517
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:14,214
God! Oh, God!

518
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:34,815
God! Oh, God!

519
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,954
Where did you go?

520
01:07:41,309 --> 01:07:42,953
Come on.

521
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:55,097
Did you see Dad?
No. I was down there when I woke up.

522
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:59,185
How do you think you got there?
It wasn't Dad. It was the ghost.

523
01:08:00,388 --> 01:08:05,678
Shit. My keys are upstairs
in my bag. Please don't leave us.

524
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:08,003
Well, come with me, then.
No!

525
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:13,093
We can't sit here all night. You
need your inhaler. I'm going back.
Lock the door!

526
01:08:26,921 --> 01:08:28,645
God!

527
01:08:28,685 --> 01:08:30,128
What?

528
01:08:31,931 --> 01:08:33,695
Penny?

529
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,899
Penny? Ssh.

530
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:39,507
It's OK. Ssh.
We're safe in here, OK?

531
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,396
We're going to die.

532
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:51,611
Ssh. It's OK. It's OK.

533
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:01,351
How are you feeling?

534
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:07,162
Where have you been, Alec?
I went for a walk on the moor.

535
01:09:07,202 --> 01:09:09,487
To clear my head.

536
01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:11,691
Are you sure you're feeling OK?

537
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,581
You're wearing a coat.

538
01:09:17,503 --> 01:09:19,427
Are you leaving?

539
01:09:19,467 --> 01:09:24,437
I thought I'd take the kids
to Grandpa's for a couple of days.
I'll come right back.

540
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:30,970
But we're getting so close.
I just think we all need a break.

541
01:09:32,934 --> 01:09:35,660
Why don't we just talk about this...

542
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:39,026
..when I get back?

543
01:09:43,115 --> 01:09:46,802
You can't abandon me.
There's so much to be done.

544
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:08,566
Why are you behaving like this?

545
01:10:17,344 --> 01:10:18,987
Harper?

546
01:10:20,189 --> 01:10:22,674
Penny? Where the fuck's the car?

547
01:10:25,681 --> 01:10:27,484
Penny!

548
01:10:28,847 --> 01:10:30,410
Harper?

549
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:32,815
Where's the fucking car?

550
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:35,540
Help me, somebody. Please.

551
01:10:35,581 --> 01:10:37,344
Penny? Harper?

552
01:10:38,827 --> 01:10:42,555
We need to talk. The kids have gone.
Someone's taken the car.

553
01:10:42,595 --> 01:10:44,679
What kids?

554
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,364
Let go of me. Let go of me!

555
01:11:13,096 --> 01:11:15,341
Isabella.

556
01:11:15,381 --> 01:11:17,505
What are you doing in here?

557
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:20,030
It's nearly time.
We have to get ready.

558
01:11:22,555 --> 01:11:24,479
What's happening to us, Alec?

559
01:11:25,842 --> 01:11:29,690
Who's Alec? One of your lovers?
Stop it.

560
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,213
Stop it!

561
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:35,421
Keep away from me.
You're losing your fucking mind!

562
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:37,425
We made a secret pact.

563
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:39,990
You can't lose heart, Isabella.

564
01:11:41,073 --> 01:11:43,798
Alec, I think Radcliffe's trying
to possess you.

565
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:46,684
You've got to fight him...

566
01:11:57,546 --> 01:12:00,472
I love you more than life itself,
Bella.

567
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:22,075
Are you OK?

568
01:12:22,115 --> 01:12:24,721
I think I peed.

569
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:27,446
When I say run, you run with me, OK?

570
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:34,460
OK? OK. One, two, three...

571
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:36,705
Run!

572
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,929
What now?

573
01:13:16,264 --> 01:13:19,792
Why is there never any signal
in this stupid place?

574
01:13:19,832 --> 01:13:22,156
OK, I think it's this way.

575
01:13:22,196 --> 01:13:25,804
What if the ghost has killed Mum?
Stop thinking those thoughts.

576
01:13:25,844 --> 01:13:28,569
YOU think those thoughts.
Well, I'm older than you.

577
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:33,579
What will we do if he has?
We'll get home and find Dad.

578
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:38,429
He'll know what to do.
What if the ghost has killed Dad?
We'll run away back to London.

579
01:13:39,551 --> 01:13:40,834
OK.

580
01:13:41,796 --> 01:13:45,283
We have to run, Harper.
Stay close to me, OK?

581
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:04,081
My gosh.

582
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:19,111
You! You there!

583
01:14:20,314 --> 01:14:21,676
Harper!

584
01:14:26,606 --> 01:14:28,169
Harper?

585
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:30,654
Harper!

586
01:14:31,737 --> 01:14:32,939
Penny?

587
01:14:34,823 --> 01:14:36,346
Harper?

588
01:16:19,995 --> 01:16:21,678
Daddy! Daddy!

589
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:28,692
Dad?

590
01:16:28,732 --> 01:16:30,456
Stop it, Dad.

591
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:34,865
Dad! ! Ow!

592
01:16:34,905 --> 01:16:37,430
Dad! Let go! Dad!

593
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:48,332
No!

594
01:16:48,372 --> 01:16:50,777
Dad! Let me out!

595
01:16:50,817 --> 01:16:52,741
Dad! Dad!

596
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,585
Harper!

597
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:15,869
We need to get you out of there.

598
01:19:21,401 --> 01:19:23,765
Harper, stand back from the window.

599
01:19:37,713 --> 01:19:40,279
Are you OK? Yeah.

600
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:43,966
Dad's gone mad.
We've got to find Mum.

601
01:19:44,006 --> 01:19:46,852
Have you seen her?
No.

602
01:19:46,892 --> 01:19:48,976
Penny, he's changed.

603
01:19:50,259 --> 01:19:54,227
He locked me in the room.
The ghost got inside him.

604
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:56,632
OK. Let's go.

605
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,191
Boy!

606
01:22:36,714 --> 01:22:37,997
Mum.

607
01:22:40,201 --> 01:22:42,165
Mum, wake up.

608
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:51,785
Wake up. Wake up.
My head.

609
01:23:00,923 --> 01:23:03,689
Mum, come with me. We have to hurry.

610
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:29,380
God, what's happening?

611
01:23:35,232 --> 01:23:37,116
The window.

612
01:23:37,156 --> 01:23:40,242
We can reach the fire escape
from the rooftop.

613
01:24:01,726 --> 01:24:04,010
Isabella. Please.

614
01:24:10,303 --> 01:24:13,750
Don't look down.
Don't look down, please.

615
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:15,674
Please!

616
01:24:15,714 --> 01:24:17,558
Charles!

617
01:24:47,538 --> 01:24:49,542
Why did you do that?

618
01:24:51,907 --> 01:24:54,793
Are you all right?
My head.

619
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:57,558
My back.

620
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:59,883
What happened?
Alec.

621
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:04,292
You scared us.

622
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,404
I love you, petal.
