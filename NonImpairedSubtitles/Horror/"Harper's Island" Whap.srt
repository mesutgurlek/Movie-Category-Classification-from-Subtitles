00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,500
- I don't want to see that.Don't ever show me that again.
- You scared Gigi.

7
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,370
- Madison!
- Want to see again?

8
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,320
- No,no thank you.
- No,no!

9
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,850
I know I have said this a hundred times,

10
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,130
but I just can't believe my
little sister is getting married.

11
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,610
She is.

12
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,700
Sully didn't think
you'd bring the cooler.

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,870
What?

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,210
Of course I bring the cooler.

15
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,670
In what universe do I
not bring the cooler?

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,660
Look at them.

17
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,290
You know what I love about those guys?

18
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,270
They bring their own beer?

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,490
No.

20
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,760
That they love Henry as much as I do.

21
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,490
Groom,groom.
Groom,groom,groom,groom,groom.

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,720
Henry Dunn.

23
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,810
All tarted up to impress the Swells.

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,590
There's only one person
here I need to impress.

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,660
Yep,your
father-in-law.

26
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,720
I don't know about daddy dearest,but there's
a smoking hot rich girl checking you out.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,740
Come on.

28
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,500
- Me?
- Me.

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,740
- Me.
- No,me.

30
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,140
- No,you said me.
- No,she said me.

31
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,700
- Yes,you.
- Yes.

32
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,520
I knew it. Sorry,guys. I win.

33
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,760
Who's getting married?

34
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,850
Uh,the groom is my best
friend from growing up.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,250
You look familiar.

36
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,170
Yeah,I grew up on the island.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,550
Right. You're Sheriff Mills' kid.

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,740
What a shame.

39
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,460
All those people. Terrible.

40
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,410
I never would have believed something
so awful could happen around here.

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,730
We're still waiting on people,Daddy.

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,770
Have you seen Cousin Ben?

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,150
I don't want you to worry.

44
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,310
It's my job to make sure
everything goes according to plan.

45
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,080
Uncle Marty!

46
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,950
Henry! My boy!

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,060
All right! Let's get this party going!

48
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,270
Ol\!

49
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,710
- Uncle Marty.
- Henry,Henry.

50
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,150
Hi,Marty.

51
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,600
Oh,come on,Trish,it's
Uncle Marty to you.

52
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,450
You're part of the family now.

53
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,790
In fact,for the entire week,it's
going to be Uncle Marty for everyone!

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,260
Ol\!

55
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,570
Ol\!

56
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,960
Uncle Marty,I'm so glad you're here.

57
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,380
Yeah,family's everything.

58
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,000
How did you find a
mariachi band in Seattle?

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,170
You're the only guy
who could pull it off.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,040
Never mind,I don't want to know.

61
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,610
- No,you don't want to know.
- Come on,I want you to meet my dad.

62
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,800
Oh,he's going to love me.

63
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,470
Thought you might never
get out of that cab.

64
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,090
Well,I needed a moment.

65
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,230
- Second thoughts?
- About going home?

66
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,380
You know,I told him you'd come.

67
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,440
Trish. Trish.

68
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,030
I am so excited.

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,380
- Hi,you look great.
- Oh,no.

70
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,740
How was your trip from LA?

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,030
I am feeling a bit
shaky from the flight.

72
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,550
Have some champagne,Abner.
You'll feel better.

73
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,260
Oh,my God.

74
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,360
Oh,what do you know? I do feel better.

75
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,360
Here's to all of us...

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,930
hooking up with all them.

77
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,780
We're still waiting on Cousin Ben.

78
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,040
He's always late.

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,450
He always answers,though.

80
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,440
Give him a call again.

81
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,070
Voice mail again.

82
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,810
We can wait if you want.

83
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,930
- No. No,we should go.
- Okay.

84
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,360
All right,let's get her going.

All Wellingtons on deck. Pardon me,sir.

89
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,090
Wellingtons,please.

90
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,780
Hi,sweetheart.

91
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,430
Where's Henry?

92
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,530
Okay,that's everyone.

93
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,760
- Say cheese.
- Cheese.

94
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,530
Shouldn't you be there?

95
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,860
I don't think that's the plan.

96
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,290
There'll be plenty of
photo ops this week.

97
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,500
You didn't think I was
going to show,did you?

98
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,220
I knew you were coming.

99
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,200
- I didn't.
- No?

100
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:03,570
But I realized if I didn't
come home now,I might never.

101
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,390
And that scared me.

102
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,310
You know,it's been seven
years,Ab,since the murders.

103
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,340
The island's moved on.
It feels normal again.

104
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,720
That's why Trish and I
are getting married there.

105
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,850
You'll see,it's the
place we loved as kids.

106
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,940
That would be nice.

107
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,580
Abby so should have been his best man.

108
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,790
You're mixing up best
man with best friend.

109
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,350
Best friend takes care of the feelings.

110
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,970
Best man takes care
of the bachelor party.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,520
Please tell me it's going to be
something seriously debauched.

112
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,020
It's probably your cousin Ben.

113
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,610
Tell him we can charter
a boat for him tomorrow.

114

<i>Caller:HUNTER JENNINGS</i>

115
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,100
No,it's... it's not him.

116
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,260
Come on. You don't know about the muers?

117
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,450
John Wakefield-- he
killed,like,six people.

118
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,080
How can you not remember?

119
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,040
Chloe has a thing for serial killers.

120
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,900
It's so not a thing.

121
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,350
- What set Wakefield off?
- That's the big mystery.

122
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,260
Seven years ago he just showed up
on the island and started killing.

123
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,330
He chopped,hung,and burned anyone that
was unlucky enough to get in his way.

124
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,720
You know,um,Henry's friend Abby?

125
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,780
Her mom was one of 'em.

126
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,060
- So she was on the island when...
- Yeah.

127
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,130
So that's why she's...

128
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,980
Abby Mills.

129
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,970
Hiya,Jimmy.

130
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,530
I knew someday you'd come back to me.

131
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,180
- And I knew you'd be here.
- Oh,yeah? Anhow's that?

132
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,840
I could smell you from the mainland.

133
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,150
Oh,so that's how it gonna be,huh?

134
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,040
Big city girl now.

135
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,120
So,uh,I've changed,too.

136
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,130
Uh,the hat or the gloves?

137
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,360
No,I'm married now.

138
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,540
You are such a liar.

139
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,120
Yeah,yeah,no,I'm kidding. No,but I
had you for a second,right,didn't I?

140
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,350
No,I was just feeling
pity for the poor girl.

141
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,780
All right,pretend like I didn't.

142
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,650
Hey,Abby,welcome home!

143
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,930
It's just a visit.

144
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,090
Hey,Abby,there's room.

145
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,990
Oh,thanks. I think I'll walk.

146
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,020
- Bring the bags to the hotel.
- Okay.

147
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,530
Let's go!

148
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,310
Mom?

149
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,510
Whoa,it's okay. It's okay.

150
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,250
The killer's dead,Abby.

151
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,830
Should've cut down that
tree a long time ago.

152
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,550
Come on,come on. Let's get out of here.

153
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:00,760
Look,sooner or later I was gonna
walk past that tree,so I thought...

154
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,870
why not get it out of the way?

155
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,570
Yeah. No,great. Ease into it.

156
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,880
Hey,maybe we can drop in and say
hi to your dad while we're at it.

157
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,260
Okay,bad idea.

158
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,230
Henry! Henry Dunn! You're here!

159
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,090
Does Maggie know you're coming?

160
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,180
Nobody does.

161
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,940
You grew up so beautiful.

162
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,990
Just the best week ever. Now...

163
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,950
I've kept the afternoon open so
that everyone could get settled.

164
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,670
- Great.
- The welcome dinner is tonight at 7:00.

165
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,060
And,you two,we have a lot of work to do.

166
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,330
Your wedding party has the
entire inn for the week.

167
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,870
And,since it's the end of season,you
practically have the whole island to yourselves.

168
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,940
- Oh,sorry.
- Sorry.

169
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,860
Excuse me. See you at dinner.

170
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,590
Did you show Trish's niece the
bloody finger in the box trick?

171
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,390
I might've had something to do with it.

172
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,120
Well,I knew everyone
was going to love you.

173
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,810
- Get in there.
- Cal!

174
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,450
Oh,this is nice.

175
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,820
Wonder what that's about?

176
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,600
Sailing?

177
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,600
"My bounty is a boundless
as the sea My love is deep."

178
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,730
You always said you wanted
to sail,so I rented a boat.

179
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,660
I thought maybe we could
slip away one day this week.

180
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,880
How do I look?

181
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,140
Dangerous.

182
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,580
Do you know what I love about you?

183
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,600
You always think of everything.

184
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,640
Look at him. He's afraid to
get his tighty-whites wet.

185
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,160
You ever see me dressed for the Love Boat,you
get a harpoon and put me out of my misery.

186
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,050
Who did he bring over today?

187
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,790
A wedding party.

188
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,450
Trish Wellington is marrying Henry Dunn.

189
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,870
- Really?
- Yeah.

190
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,500
- The Princess and the Pauper.
- Yeah.

191
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
Henry's okay.

192
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,870
For a guy who only came to the island for
the summers and knew a lot about boats.

193
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,370
Tell me his psycho little
brother isn't coming.

194
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,890
I don't know. I'll tell
you who did come,though.

195
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,020
- Abby.
- No. Don't go back to that,man.

196
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,230
She dumped you. She didn't even give you
a kiss good-bye in the rearview mirror.

197
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,460
That wasn't about me.

198
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,330
Oh,no,of course it wasn't about you.

199
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,650
You know what your problem
is? You're too nice.

200
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,450
Hey,Al,you need some help?

201
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,710
Get over here.

202
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,080
Way too nice.

203
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,860
I think something's
caught in the rudder.

204
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,070
I think it's just seaweed,Al.

205
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,930
Okay,so...maybe when she left,

206
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,520
it was because of her mom and
the bad stuff that went down.

207
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,040
But in all these years,did
she ever call you?

208
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,660
What,are you giving dating advice now?

209
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,410
I got it.

210
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,010
Keep it as a souvenir.

211
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,010
Hey,excuse me. That's...
that's my bag. Thanks.

212
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,920
Look at this place.

213
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,530
When you think about it,you're
like something out of a fairy tale.

214
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,110
You washed a millionaire's
boats when you were a kid,

215
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,830
and then you grow up
to marry his daughter.

216
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,570
I don't think Mr. Wellington
considers it much of a fairy tale.

217
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,320
Henry,listen to me. Never...

218
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,430
- never let that old man intimidate you.
- I won't.

219
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,640
- I promise.
- Good boy.

220
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,620
Now,Henry,tell me about
that blond on the boat.

221
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,540
You know the one I'm talking
about? You know,the...

222
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,540
Chloe.

223
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,410
Yeah?

224
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,470
Chloe.

225
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,270
I have something for you.

226
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,090
Oh,yeah? Is it big?

227
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,970
well,"big" is a relative term,isn't it?

228
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,830
Are you going to show me or are
you just going to think about it?

229
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,440
I might just think about it for a bit.

230
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,310
That's my Cal--
always thinking.

231
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,650
The question is: Are you big?

232
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,770
I promised Madison we'd find
her a friend to play with.

233
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,410
She's fine. Look at her.

234
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,620
She's having a great time.

235
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,170
Madison,you have one more minute
before you have to get ready for dinner.

236
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,720
Did you hear me? One more minute.

237
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,740
Madison?

238
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,860
JD,you in there?

239
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,530
Just want to see if you
need anything for tonight.

240
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,680
Look,I don't know if you want to hear
this or not,but I'm glad you came.

241
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,980
With Mom and Dad gone,you and Uncle
Marty are the only family I have.

242
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,580
It means a lot.

243
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,510
<i>I*****</i>

244
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,180
Hello?

245
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,610
Hello?

246
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,050
Hubba,hubba!

247
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,600
Look at you! You look amazing!

248
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,820
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

249
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,110
Thanks.

250
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,850
That's good,'cause...'cause
I've decided.

251
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,170
I'm gonna have fun tonight.

252
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,450
No,no,no,no,no,strike that.

253
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,370
I'm going to have fun
this whole week and...

254
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,250
anything you need,I got your back.

255
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,420
You...You don't even have to ask.

256
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,190
Have you been drinking?

257
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,510
A little bit.

258
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,100
A little bit?

259
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,040
Yeah...

260
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,140
yeah.

261
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,060
So Abby seems like a great girl.

262
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,270
All this time,I've heard
about "Henry's friend,"

263
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,950
now I get it; you're
right. She's really sweet.

264
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,510
I know! I told you!

265
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,780
Am I the only one who thinks that
men and women can't just be friends?

266
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,590
You've never had a guy
who was just a friend?

267
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,620
No.

268
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,790
What?!

269
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,950
You know,now that I think about it,I
did have that one friend that was a guy.

270
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,750
You remember.

271
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,950
That doesn't matter.

272
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,750
{\a6}1 new message from hunter jennings

273
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,390
If you mean that Italian
exchange student junior year--

274
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,510
{\a6}you look lovely in blue.
meet me in the south lobby

275
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,060
he doesn't count because he was married!

276
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,730
Remember how he'd go on about
his wife,how he loved her...

277
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,930
Excuse me.

278
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,540
One second.

279
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,380
Hello,Trish.

280
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,040
Hunter...

281
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,160
What are you doing here?

282
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,800
Hunter...

283
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,010
I'm getting married.

284
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,090
Are you sure?

285
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,430
That guy is my hero.

286
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,190
He's not that great.

287
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,030
Oh,God,here we go.

288
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,050
No,no,no,no,I'm serious.

289
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,990
Uncle Marty's,what,50?

290
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,360
- He's not married...
- Okay.

291
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,130
no kids...

292
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,790
and here he is trying to tap
some hot thing half his age.

293
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,550
Come on!

294
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:44,920
Oh-oh,okay,Oprah,so in,uh,what world
does that make him not a superhero?

295
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,760
As far as I'm concerned,eating
ain't cheating.

296
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,070
Oh,my God Tell that to
your boyfriend in Seattle.

297
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,380
How's it going?

298
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,590
We were just talking
about the groomsmen.

299
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,780
So,you and Henry...

300
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:02,350
you've been friends for a long time; you
must've hooked up at least once,right?

301
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,150
I...

302
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,430
Everybody having fun?

303
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,220
Yeah.Yeah.

304
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,300
Has anyone seen JD?

305
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,300
- I'm on it; I'll find him.
- No,wait,that's not why I asked.

306
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,540
I know. Go find that fianc\e of yours,and
let me worry about finding your brother.

307
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,450
Oh,hey,you might want to start...

308
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,200
At The Cannery. I'm on it!

309
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,690
We should go to Dad.

310
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,980
He will make Hunter leave.

311
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,760
No!

312
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,160
Daddy will just cause a big
scene and embarrass Henry.

313
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,440
You have to tell Henry.

314
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,130
Henry is the last person I want to know.

315
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,910
I mean,I don't want anything
to ruin this wedding.

316
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,320
Trish,he's gonna be your husband.

317
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,820
Couples shouldn't have secrets.

318
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,380
Shea,please...

319
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:50,520
We all know that you live the perfect
life,so don't pass judgment on mine.

320
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,380
Okay...look...

321
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:04,370
if you have any doubts...about
Henry...or getting married,

322
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,130
now is the time to speak up.

323
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,290
But I don't.

324
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,160
I love Henry.

325
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,870
And I'm going to marry him.

326
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,410
Appreciate it.

327
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,060
It means a lot to me.

328
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,320
I'm curious if anybody
else had seen you inside.

329
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,940
I did as you asked--
straight to Trish.

330
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,480
I don't know if you know how
important is that you succeed here.

331
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,850
For her sake.

332
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,210
I just couldn't tell,but,um...

333
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,330
she was definitely surprised.

334
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,770
Uh,Trish did agree to meet
me in the morning,though.

335
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
Well,that's progress.

336
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,520
I just want you to know,if
there's anything you need,

337
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,460
please don't hesitate to ask.

338
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,180
I'm not leaving this island without her.

339
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,920
My daughter's not marrying Henry Dunn.

340
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,310
Oh,my God!

341
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,420
Abby!

342
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,030
Nikki!

343
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,590
Look at you!

344
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,090
Coming in here all Aphrodite.

345
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,710
You're trying to make
us local girls look bad.

346
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,920
Oh,please!

347
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,590
You're gorgeous.

348
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,860
Yet you probably forgot that it's
boring as hell here,most of the time.

349
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,210
You looking for someone special?

350
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:01,070
Yes,but not the fisherman
you're so subtly implying.

351
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,610
There's my perp.

352
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,460
Any trouble?

353
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,390
JD?

354
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,640
A lamb among lions.

355
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,450
Okay,then.

356
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,260
I'm gonna text Henry.

357
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,990
Make room,you animals.

358
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:20,110
Any of you so much as lay a hand on this
flower,I'll nail your tongue to the bar.

359
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,930
Who's up next?

360
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,130
You.

361
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,090
Big city girl.

362
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,890
Get over here.

363
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,650
Who are you calling a big city girl?

364
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,480
That's a pretty dress.

365
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,620
You wearing that for me?

366
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,780
I hope your game is
better than your banter.

367
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,660
our cousin ben wellington

368
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,910
Madison!

369
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,260
It's time for bed,sweetie!

370
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,610
Oh,may I?

371
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,740
You know...your
daughter and my nephew...

372
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,730
they make a stunning
couple,don't you think?

373
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,800
Ah,love.

374
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,170
Love's a funny thing,isn't it?

375
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,590
I fail to see your point,Mr. Dunn.

376
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,940
Uncle Marty.

377
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,230
Aw,come on,everybody
calls me Uncle Marty.

378
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,590
Your point.

379
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,430
Well...I'm talking about purpose,y'know?

380
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,840
I'm talking about my
true calling in life.

381
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,460
I thought you were in sales.

382
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,500
See,one thing I know for certain,

383
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,880
is that I was put on this earth
to protect men like Henry--

384
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:10,410
men who deserve true love and
happiness-- from men like you.

385
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,380
Is that supposedo be
some sort of a threat?

386
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,850
Threat?

387
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,630
Now,come on...

388
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,480
we're just sitting around chatting
like a couple of pals,ar't we?

389
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,230
Anyway...

390
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:27,860
pretty soon,you and me...

391
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,940
we're gonna be family.

392
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,070
Thanks for the cigar.

393
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,530
My,I thought you'd be better than this.

394
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,280
I'm at an emotional disadvantage.

395
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,410
So they don't have any phones in LA,huh?

396
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,970
Nope.

397
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,280
E-mail...

398
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,400
Not that I saw.

399
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,870
You telling me you didn't
miss me a little bit?

400
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,980
I didn't say that.

401
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,840
Then you did miss me.

402
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,390
Tell you
what--

403
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,010
I make this,you have to stop
asking me so many questions.

404
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,510
And if you don't?

405
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,320
Name it.

406
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,230
Really!

407
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,590
You got yourself a deal
there,big city girl.

408
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,190
Scratch.

409
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,630
Double or nothing?

410
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,180
Do you mind?

411
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,900
Stop being a creep.

412
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,910
What?

413
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,190
I like your tat.

414
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,320
Broken hearts.

415
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,180
Is he bothering you?

416
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,350
No,Shane,I haven't even met the guy.

417
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,120
Oh,we,allow me.

418
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,330
This is JD Dunn.

419
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,130
His family used to work
summers on the island.

420
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,030
JD...this is Kelly.

421
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,120
We used to go out.

422
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,770
You like the tattoo?

423
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,490
I did it.

424
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,920
You want to show him
the other ones you have?

425
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,820
Don't do this.

426
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,000
What?

427
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,750
It's cool.

428
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,210
Me and JD,we're just...catching up.

429
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,030
Right?

430
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,970
So,heard you tried to
whack yourself again.

431
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,150
Now,was that just an attention- getting kind of thing,
or were you really,really sad?

432
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,390
You know what?

433
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,130
You two probably have a lot to talk about,wt
with all the cutting and the suicidal...

434
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,860
That's enough,Shane!

435
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,030
That's enough,Shane!

436
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,170
Come on,come on!

437
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,520
Hi,Dad.

438
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,440
You okay?

439
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,200
Never better.

440
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,880
You're...

441
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,510
probably wondering about the truck.

442
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,790
It seems fine.

443
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,310
That's the...that's the way I feel...

444
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,530
The heater still works.

445
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,630
Did you get the cards I sent?

446
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,480
The ones at Christmas?

447
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,260
Listen,I was...

448
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,530
thinking maybe,now that you're here...

449
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,590
Thanks for the ride,Dad.

450
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,280
Will you unlock the door,please?

451
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,760
I feel like I owe you an apology.

452
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,550
For what?

453
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,290
If I didn't have you
out there looking for JD,

454
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,040
you never would have run
into your dad like that.

455
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,550
We both knew that part of me
coming home was dealing with my dad.

456
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,430
I feel like I didn't do a very good
job of watching your back tonight.

457
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,920
Are you kidding me?

458
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,560
You broke up a bar
fight with a pool cue.

459
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,730
Maybe if I wasn't playing pool,there
wouldn't have been a fight.

460
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,850
Come on.

461
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,180
You know JD. He's gonna
do whatever he wants.

462
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,290
I'm just afraid that one of these days he's gonna do
something a whole lot worse than just pick a fight.

463
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,620
Maybe,

464
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,220
but...there's a part of
him that's very sweet.

465
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,120
Yeah.

466
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,920
Who were you playing pool with?

467
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,260
Chloe?

468
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,890
Chloe,darling,when I said
swimming,I meant the pool!

469
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,600
What are you doing?

470
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,870
What are you waiting for?

471
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,770
Okay.

472
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,760
I want to show you something.

473
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,740
Uh-uh,you gotta catch me first.

474
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,690
Chloe...

475
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,980
God...wait

476
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,660
hold on!

477
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,760
Chloe?

478
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,940
Honey,did you have a bad dream?

479
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,480
No? What's wrong,then?

480
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,720
Did you know people died here?

481
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,450
What?

482
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,910
People were killed on this island.

483
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,800
Who told you that?

484
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,090
Madison...

485
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,450
who said that?

486
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,960
My new friend told me.

487
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,010
Chloe?

488
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,920
Oh,come on,Chloe,this isn't fun.

489
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,870
Chloe!

490
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,060
Chloe?

491
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,010
Oh,babe,you should have seen your face!

492
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,030
You jerk!

493
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,610
It was just a joke.

494
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,850
You could've killed me!

495
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,740
Look,Chloe?

496
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,900
No!

497
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,950
Oh,God...

498
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,620
Where is it?

499
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,690
Where is it?

500
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,820
Oh,come on!

501
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,120
ruining my night,idiot!

502
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,320
Was I loud?

503
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,190
What? No!

504
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,810
- Oh,my God,I was loud.
- No!

505
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,560
Oh,my God,I was so loud.

506
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,730
No. It's okay. It makes
me look really good.

507
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,540
It's okay! It's okay. I love you.

508
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,390
I love you,too.

509
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:31,170
One sec.

510
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,690
I...will be...right...back.

511
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,380
Hey,honey,I was thinking...

512
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,230
um,maybe we should get
separate rooms from now on.

513
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,770
That way,the night of our
wedding can be special.

514
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,540
Whatever you want,sweetheart.

515
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,200
Hey,is somebody down there?

516
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,550
Give me a hand,will you?

517
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,760
I'm stuck.

518
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,960
Can you help me here?
