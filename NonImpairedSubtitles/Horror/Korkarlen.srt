The Phantom Carriage

00:00:13,618 --> 00:00:18,170
A tale told in livlng plctures
under the directlon of Victor Sjöström

3
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:22,132
At the camera: J. Jullus

4
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:20,897
Once there was a poor
Salvation Army sister at death's door.

5
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:40,451
She was stricken with
galloplng consumptlon,

6
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:44,173
and she had only held out
for the space of a year.

7
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:56,576
When there was no hope left
she had gone home to her mother.

8
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:06,492
Waiting at the foot of her bed
was another Salvation Army sister

9
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:09,849
who had once
worked alongside the sick girl.

10
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:39,969
"Don't fret over those
poor souls now, Sister Edit."

11
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:42,896
"You have done enough for them."

12
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:13,850
"Send for David Holm!"

13
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:51,373
"Please don't! My daughter was yours
as long as she had a spark of life."

14
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:55,696
"Let me have her to myself
now that she ls dylng."

15
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:19,246
"Slster Maria, why don't you
do as I ask? Send for David Holm!"

16
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,416
"l shall go fetch hlm at once."

17
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:07,412
"You can't be serious, asklng
David Holm to attend a death bed?"

18
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,488
"l haven't been able to find him,

19
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:13,849
but Gustavsson is looking too."

20
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,536
"He will bring him here

21
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:18,331
if that is at all possible."

22
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,335
"Poor Mrs Holm Poor Mrs Holm"

23
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,567
"l'll take her back home."

24
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:43,773
"lt wouldn't do for her husband
to see her should he come."

25
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:06,094
The evenlng on which these events took
place was not an ordinary one.

26
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,129
lt was New Year's Eve.

27
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:39,177
"Well, we will certainly know
when it's time to toast the New Year!"

28
00:11:55,498 --> 00:12:02,290
"lt's a spooky place to await midnight,
here among the dead."

29
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:23,207
"You gentlemen
are not afraid of ghosts, l hope?"

30
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:41,213
"Then I'd like to tell you a story
while we wait for the midnight hour."

31
00:12:55,898 --> 00:13:02,610
"l once had a pal called Georges,
who was generally a jolly fellow."

32
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:24,210
"He came of a good famlly, and had
studied hard at Uppsala University,

33
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,410
so he knew a bit more
than the rest of us."

34
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:28,449
"But a change would come over hlm
on New Year's Eve."

35
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:57,411
"Remember that it's New Year's Eve,
the last day of the year!"

36
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:18,333
"Whoever dies on this eve
must drive the cart of death."

37
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:47,008
"There is an old, old cart..."

38
00:18:04,538 --> 00:18:08,008
no ordinary driver holds the reigns."

39
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:12,814
"He is in the service of a strict master
named Death."

40
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:34,854
"For him, a single night
is as long as 100 years on Earth."

41
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:39,813
"Night and day he must carry out
his master's business."

The Phantom Carriage
Part ll

44
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:05,170
"Wherever he goes,
he is greeted with sorrow and despair."

45
00:21:09,138 --> 00:21:14,337
"There is no escape
He must perform his sorry duty."

46
00:23:52,898 --> 00:24:00,293
"Although the horse and cart
remain the same, the driver will vary."

47
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:15,254
"The last soul to die each year,

48
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:18,097
the one who gives up the ghost

49
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:20,937
at the stroke of midnight,

50
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:23,777
is destined to be Death's driver

51
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:26,617
during the coming year."

52
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,737
"Now you know why i'm afraid

53
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:42,771
of something fatal happening
on New Year's Eve."

54
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:11,048
"And the odd thing is, you see,

55
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:15,774
that Georges apparently died
last New Year's Eve."

56
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:44,216
"Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived
with David Holm?"

57
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,858
"Come with me, David Holm"

58
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:08,369
"Sister Edit is dying
and she has asked for you."

59
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:43,567
"lf Sister Edit wants to see you,
you must go at once!"

60
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:50,414
"David, l can't believe it's you!
You are meant to relieve me!"

61
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:15,134
"You ought to lift me up ln your cart
and take me to the hospital."

62
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:27,328
"No living soul rides ln this cart."

63
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:32,578
"By the time l arrive
it is too late for a doctor."

00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:45,617
"You know well enough
that l am no longer alive."

65
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:59,657
"But, worst of all,
you must face the consequences

66
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:04,249
of the evil you have wrought
during your lifetime."

67
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:18,055
"David, do you think i'm unaware

68
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:22,330
that it is my fault
you have met such an end?"

69

"lf you hadn't fallen in with me

70
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:37,366
you would have led a good life
with your wife, children and brother."

"By tomorrow you will have served

72
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:31,333
your time for drunken behaviour."

73
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,016
"But before you leave,

74
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:35,493
a harsher punishment awaits you."

75
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:52,296

77
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,726
he killed a man while intoxicated,

78
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:01,055
and now a long prison term awaits."

79
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:18,216
"But we feel that you ought

80
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,375
to serve the sentence instead,

81
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:24,490
since you and you alone led him astray,

82
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:27,690
and made him a killer."

83
00:39:55,018 --> 00:40:01,457
"Does this not make you turn from
your wicked ways, David Holm?"

"Yes, for only now do l realise

how it feels to have brought great
misery upon a loved one."

that I never expected him

She had got the better of herself

"Yes, this David Holm

220
01:24:16,898 --> 01:24:18,729

to spare the children from infection!"
