ODD THOMAS

2
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:19,675
WELCOME TO PICO MUNDO

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,765
My name is Odd Thomas.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,554
Though in this age when fame is the
altar at which most people worship.

5
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,063
I'm not sure why you should care.

6
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:28,517
I'm not a celebrity.
I'm not the child of a celebrity.

7
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:30,307
I've never been married to,
abused by,

8
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:32,062
or provided a kidney to a celebrity.

9
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,391
Green Moon Bowling

10
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:39,560
But I do lead an unusual life.

11
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:49,154
Penny Kalisto.

12
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:01,642
My name really is Odd.

13
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:05,053
According to my mother, it was
a screw-up on my birth certificate.

14
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:08,429
She says I was supposed to be called
Todd, after a Lithuanian uncle.

15
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,110
My father insists my name
was always Odd...

16
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:14,395
and he notes that all of
my uncles are Bulgarian.

17
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,669
My father claims
my mother is insane.

18
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:20,440
My mother, of course,
begs to differ.

19
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:26,363
My abilities are a gift from God!

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,078
My father won that argument.

21
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:33,997
I was 12 years old when they finally
locked her up and threw away the key.

22
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:43,172
I've come to believe that
my mother and I share certain...

23
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:44,687
abilities.

24
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:47,433
Since I don't want to be locked up
with the key thrown away...

25
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:51,597
I've pretty much kept mine a secret.

26
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:00,989
Odd Thomas.

27
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:02,414
Hello, Harlo.

28
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:03,999
Long time, no see.

29
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:06,954
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey.
Come on, man. No touchy, no feely.

30
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,031
- Sorry, but I love this car.
- I know.

31
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:13,073
It's too bad a car
can't love you back.

32
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:17,942
What's wrong, Odd?
There anything I can do?

33
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:20,171
No, it's something
you've already done.

34
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,152
Hey! Hey! Come on- oh, Odd.
No fooling around, man.

35
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:25,295
- Give me my keys.
- Her blood is in your pocket.

36
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:29,516
Most people would think
that's a weird thing to say...

37
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:31,765
but you don't think
it's very weird, do you, Harlo?

38
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:39,899
On that night...

39
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,868
you took a piece of white felt...

40
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,793
and after killing Penny...

41
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:48,539
you collected some of her blood.

42
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:50,590
And now it's dry...

43
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,374
and stiff and
brittle like a cracker...

44
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:58,962
and it's still in your pocket.

45
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:09,394
In moments like these,
pity tears at me.

46
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:12,071
And a kind of madness
comes over me...

47
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:14,817
forcing me to hunt people
like Harlo Landerson...

48
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:18,767
who I have no pity for whatsoever.

49
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:38,166
Sorry, Mrs. Curtees!

50
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:41,630
Sorry, Saleen!

51
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,757
What the hell are you doing?

52
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,964
Mom, what's going on?

53
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,096
Stevie, run honey, run!

54
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,681
Come here!

55
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:46,282
My life is filled with guys
like Harlo Landerson.

56
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,914
And since I like my face
just the way it is...

57
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:54,831
I learned how to handle myself.

58
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:16,103
I may see dead people, but then,
by God, I do something about it.

59
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:18,788
Hey. Hey!

60
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,748
Shift down, man! Go easy.

61
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:23,701
I'm sorry, sir,
but I don't have a "go easy" gear.

62
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:26,623
You should probably get that looked at.

63
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:28,173
Now, Officer Eckles...

64
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,299
does being a police officer

65
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,002
give you the right to beat
the shit out of people?

66
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:32,636
Not at all, Officer Varner.

67
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:34,663
But it is one of
the perks of the job.

68
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:44,884
I believe in a higher power
and the afterlife.

69
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,434
Call me strange.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,696
Others do.

71
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:52,605
He's so strange.

72
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:56,327
Don't worry, Penny.

73
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:59,782
I think where you're going
is a home for the spirit...

74
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,448
and it's filled with
kindness and wonder.

75
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,453
I'm sorry, Penny.

76
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:09,572
I'm sorry your life was so short.

77
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:21,797
The dead don't talk.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,716
I don't know why.

79
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:30,613
Here we are again.

80
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:33,899
Busted furniture and
shattered glass everywhere.

81
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,913
Most of it was not my fault.

82
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:41,347
Except the panda bear lamp
and the Biffy the Clown mirror.

83
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:44,711
- That was this guy.
- Why didn't you come to me first..

84
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:48,584
give me a chance to find a way
to get Harlo to entrap himself?

85
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:49,717
Whenever we do it that way,

86
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:51,879
it's always more efficient
and less destructive.

87
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:54,006
Yes, I know but he had
to be stopped right now...

88
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,213
or he was gonna do it again soon.

89
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,429
That's what Penny wanted to tell me.
That's why she hadn't left yet.

90
00:06:59,464 --> 00:07:02,880
Son, you so complicate my life.

91
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:06,930
Look.

92
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,821
Besides her blood...

93
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:13,819
Harlo had these photos of Penny
post-mortem in his wallet.

94
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:16,610
If there's any fuss about
how you pegged Harlo...

95
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,366
just say he opened up
his wallet to pay off a bet.

96
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,161
Five bucks on
yesterday's Dodger's game...

97
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:24,321
the photos fell out,
you saw em-

98
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,446
He ran and naturally,
I gave chase.

99
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,328
Naturally.

100
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:22,078
Save me!

101
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:25,735
Save us!

102
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,709
- Save
- Us!

103
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,633
- Save..
- Us!

104
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,523
Save you from who?

105
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:35,357
Who is that?

106
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:37,781
Who is it?

107
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:17,191
EviI is coming.

108
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,950
And it's up to me to figure out
who's gonna be holding the gun.

109
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,454
Morning, Elvis.

110
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,172
Pico Mundo Grill
CLOSED

111
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:26,841
So much of my life
is out of my controI.

112
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:30,421
I would have gone 7 kinds of
crazy if I hadn't simplified.

113
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:34,092
So I have no motorized vehicles,
no homeownership...

114
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:37,095
no insurance,
and no grand ambitions.

115
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,257
Ladies.

116
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,188
Eggs! Wreck em and stretch em!

117
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:42,851
"Wreck em" means scrambled,
and "stretch em" means...

118
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,067
add an extra egg.

119
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:45,527
Cardiac shingles and hash browns!

120
00:09:45,562 --> 00:09:48,690
"Cardiac shingles"
are toast with lots of butter.

121
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:50,418
And hash browns...

122
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:52,076
are just hash browns.

123
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:54,815
Not every word
we use is diner lingo.

124
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:57,706
Just as not every short-order cook

125
00:09:57,741 --> 00:10:01,913
is an undercover detective
for dead people.

126
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,371
Duck.

127
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,722
That is Stormy Lewellyn.

128
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:17,254
Stormy and I are destined
to be together forever.

129
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:20,598
G YPS Y MUMMY ALL SEEING EYE

130
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:25,680
You are destined
to be together forever.

131
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,229
Hey, Chief.
Tummy Tickler coming at ya.

132
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,700
You know, I'm still not happy
about what you did yesterday, Oddie.

133
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:38,952
You could have
gotten yourself killed.

134
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,628
I am not afraid of death.

135
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:44,154
Of course, I'm not ready to go
on a date with him, either.

136
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,299
Would you throw yourself
off a cliff for me?

137
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:53,182
Of course I would.

138
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:56,053
Into a river of razor blades
and lemon juice?

139
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,269
Absolutely.

140
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:59,682
Of course, I'd like to know
the reasoning behind such a request..

141
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,732
but, fortunately for me...

142
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:05,104
you reek of intelligence
and integrity.

143
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,398
And you reek of peach shampoo.

144
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,806
Just the way I like you.

145
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,203
- Chief.
- Morning, Stormy.

146
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:15,532
What's with
the cat-ate-the-canary smile?

147
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,406
Tonight is date night.

148
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,448
So you think you're
gonna get yourself some, huh?

149
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,790
- I wouldn't put it quite that way.
- Stormy SpeciaI.

150
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,867
- Girlfriend.
- Morning, dude.

151
00:11:43,811 --> 00:11:45,445
I call them bodachs.

152
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,113
Well, not to their faces, I hope.

153
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:49,521
I never met anybody
that could see em before.

154
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,446
- Neither have I.
- Everyone told me it's in my head.

155
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:54,031
Well, you should stop
telling everyone.

156
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,664
I tried telling my parents.

157
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,242
If I told my parents,
I'd ve spent my whole life...

158
00:11:57,277 --> 00:11:59,135
picking winning lottery numbers.

159
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,993
You can pick winning lotto numbers?

160
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:04,250
- No, I can't. Stay on point.
- Right. Yeah.

161
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:07,378
Yesterday, when I finally saw one...

162
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,547
I gave him the finger, Homes.

163
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:10,972
Don't you know?

164
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:14,542
If they find out you can see them,
they will kill you.

165
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:22,804
They will kill you.

166
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:00,607
- Little advice?
- Yeah?

167
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:02,610
Karla prefers chocolate to flowers

168
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:05,147
and you should get
yourself some candles.

169
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:06,178
Candles?

170
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,268
Thanks. Good idea.

171
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,540
Whew, close.

172
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,243
That would have been
a little awkward.

173
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:19,700
You two are really something.

174
00:13:19,735 --> 00:13:22,088
I don't know what, but something.

175
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:24,626
We're weird and screwed up
but we're okay.

176
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:25,871
I don't know.

177
00:13:26,086 --> 00:13:27,545
You are...

178
00:13:28,714 --> 00:13:30,013
so cooI.

179
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:33,719
So, you deny me my weirdness,
but agree that I'm screwed up?

180
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:35,352
You're right.
I see your problem.

181
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,681
Weirdness, it can be fun.
It can be kind of cooI.

182
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:41,435
Screwed-up-ness, not so much.

183
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,223
You are quite weird.

184
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:49,027
- Apology accepted.
- I gotta go. Be good, you two.

185
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,654
It's not me you have to worry about.

186
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:52,983
Don't I know it.

187
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,826
I gotta go to work, too, Oddie.

188
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:58,114
- Okay.
- Later, my love.

189
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,002
Stormy!

190
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,510
Miss you already.

191
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,192
- Living up to his name.
- Every damn day.

192
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:28,437
Later.

193
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,614
Months often pass
when I don't see a single bodach.

194
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:33,539
When they do show up...

195
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,702
it's a sure sign that carnage
and bloodshed are not far behind.

196
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:37,585
Morning.

197
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,826
They don't cause it.
They feed on it.

198
00:14:40,456 --> 00:14:44,074
The more bodachs that show up,
the bigger the eventuaI feast.

199
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:49,006
They're attracted to eviI
like bees to flowers.

200
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,509
They know when death is coming
and want to watch.

201
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:53,852
They don't show up
for any ordinary death.

202
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:58,181
They want extreme,
operatic violence and terror.

203
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:03,272
Penny Kalisto's death
wasn't horrific enough...

204
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:07,020
to bring a single bodach
into our world.

205
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:13,691
This town is in serious trouble.

206
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,953
- Bye, Oddie.
- See you, ladies.

207
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:18,827
Nicolina! Levanna!

208
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,372
Odd, am I really sucking
at this whole "mother" thing?

209
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,889
Well, considering their
last one was a junkie...

210
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:31,551
who left them in your lap
when you were barely 18...

211
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:35,180
I think you rather rock, Vi.

212
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:36,211
See you later.

213
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,691
I'm heading this way, too.

214
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:41,082
Gonna go see Madame PearI,
get myself read.

215
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:43,404
Personally,
I don't believe people who say...

216
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:46,567
they can read minds or palms
and, trust me, tea leaves...

217
00:15:46,602 --> 00:15:48,284
just cloggage
in the garbage disposaI.

218
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:51,364
It's just I had this dream
last night you would not believe.

219
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,118
Well, anything short of
a 9-alarm massacre, I can top.

220
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:57,823
I'd never seen myself face-on
in a dream before.

221
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:00,589
You saw your own face?

222
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:04,169
Me and this guy, we were
both Iying dead all busted up...

223
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:06,874
like we'd been shot
to pieces or something.

224
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:14,270
You know, I wouldn't worry
about it, Vi.

225
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,381
I mean, have any of
your dreams ever come true?

226
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:18,471
No.

227
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:21,813
I know most people think
you're just quirky or weird, Odd...

228
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,898
except Stormy who thinks
angels fly out of your butt.

229
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,650
But I know there's more to it.

230
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,200
You have a secret.

231
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:29,160
You're either a clairvoyant...

232
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:31,455
a psychic, a seer,
a soothsayer, or something.

233
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,700
Or you got yourself some juice
with a higher power.

234
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:34,583
And I need to know.

235
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,492
Tell me the truth now, Odd.

236
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,405
Do you see death in me?

237
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:47,131
No. No, all I see
is my own insensitivity...

238
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,583
and a long,
happy life for you, okay?

239
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,179
Hey, Vi, the the dead guy
in your dream, what was he wearing?

240
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,895
Wearing? I don't know.

241
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,155
Oh! Wait. Yeah...

242
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,686
a red and black shirt with
black bowling balls on it.

243
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,496
One of my stranger abilities is
that when I need to find someone...

244
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:20,047
like right now, the creepy
guy in the diner,

245
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:24,045
I can randomly wander around, and
pretty quickly, I'll run into him.

246
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,453
This is a talent for
which I have no name.

247
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:29,676
Stormy calls it psychic magnetism.

248
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:32,269
TIRE WORLD
Super Summer Sale

249
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:35,188
That's Tom Jedd.
He was my little league coach.

250
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:39,394
Been hanging around Tire World for
years, although I don't know why.

251
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,772
His death was not caused
by a defective tire.

252
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:45,521
Such a beautifuI girI-

253
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:55,036
There is something about
a dead man trying to get a laugh...

254
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:57,112
that just bugs me.

255
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:01,501
Perhaps because it suggests
that even in death...

256
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:04,419
we still have a pathetic
need to be liked.

257
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:09,007
As well as the ever-present
ability to humiliate ourselves.

258
00:18:11,803 --> 00:18:13,381
Where are you?

259
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:17,221
Where are you?

260
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,929
MANAGER Stormy

261
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:31,199
When I finally have my own shop,
no stupid uniforms.

262
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:33,702
I think you look adorable.

263
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,654
Adorable? Really?

264
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:37,571
Puppies are adorable.

265
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:41,438
Why are you here so early?
You missing me?

266
00:18:41,473 --> 00:18:44,254
Always.
But I'm here looking for a guy.

267
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,054
A creepy guy.

268
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:48,843
Well, with you,
there can be no other kind.

269
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,377
My psychic magnetism
brought me here.

270
00:18:59,062 --> 00:19:01,979
- That guy?
- That guy.

271
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,360
You are better than a bloodhound.

272
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,612
What is that thing on his head?

273
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,620
Hair.

274
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:10,615
It looks like a yellow yarmulke.

275
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,249
No, it's hair.

276
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,637
Any of those bodachs with him?

277
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:16,991
More than I've ever seen before.

278
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,451
You're not shivering
'cause of cold ice cream, are you?

279
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,571
I'm gonna see what this guy's up to.

280
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:30,761
- Stormy, wait, wait.
- You, sit.

281
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,644
You think those fish
are up to something?

282
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:46,403
All fish do are eat, excrete,
and fornicate all in the same water.

283
00:19:46,438 --> 00:19:47,828
Fish are disgusting.

284
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:49,997
Oh, I never thought so till now.

285
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:52,868
Your creepy friend is buying
two gallons of the summer speciaI.

286
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,293
Are the flavors significant?

287
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,819
That's your department.
I'm just reporting in.

288
00:19:57,123 --> 00:19:59,271
Cherry chocolate coconut chunk?

289
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:01,384
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.

290
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:05,882
I didn't realize the grammar was
so rigid in the ice-cream business.

291
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,257
Well, now you know.

292
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:13,303
This is bad for business.

293
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:16,716
Why? No one can see em but me.

294
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:21,894
Well, how could a bunch
of slithering, eviI spirits...

295
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,143
and guy who look like
fungus be good for business?

296
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:27,268
Fungus Man scares me.
Can't you forget him?

297
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:28,579
I have a gift.

298
00:20:28,614 --> 00:20:30,908
It wouldn't have been given to me
if I wasn't supposed to use it.

299
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:32,994
- Maybe it's not a gift.
- It's a gift.

300
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:35,283
I still got the box it came in.

301
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,464
Here. Take my keys.

302
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:39,620
And please show up
for dinner alive...

303
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,741
because, remember,
I can't see the dead.

304
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,217
If someone is going
to cause extreme violence...

305
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:24,054
especially on a massive scale,
which this is starting to look like...

306
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:28,798
bodachs will not leave him untiI the
last ounce of blood has been spilled.

307
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:33,382
But they lost interest
in Fungus Man.

308
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:15,185
Winstons, Camels, and Marlboros.

309
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,103
Fungus Man has friends.

310
00:22:57,938 --> 00:22:59,931
Oh, now would be
a good time to run.

311
00:24:28,992 --> 00:24:30,024
Bodachs.

312
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,428
- Hey.
- Loop me in, odd one.

313
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:16,689
I think I just achieved a personaI
best in the "jump and gasp" event.

314
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:18,583
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.

315
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,408
I found a gateway to hell.

316
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:21,993
I'm walking back to it right now.

317
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:24,823
Most people would have
the good sense to run away from it.

318
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:28,274
- Well, I'm not like most people.
- Not in the least.

319
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,620
It's gone now.

320
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:39,929
Or hidden.

321
00:26:39,964 --> 00:26:43,084
So, is Fungus Bob a man or
something new in the neighborhood?

322
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,044
I don't know.

323
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,397
This place looks like
some kind of shrine.

324
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:50,356
UNABOMBER...
Theodore Kaczynski Arrested and...

325
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:51,309
Bundy Claims...
Police Believe The Number To Be...

326
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:52,734
CannibaI Killer
DECAPITATED UNABOMBER

327
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,231
Shrine of guys that like to
make belts out of women's nipples.

328
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:57,476
What?

329
00:26:59,776 --> 00:27:01,235
Who is this guy?

330
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:06,111
His reaI name is Robert Robertson.

331
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:08,918
Well, hello Fungus Bob.

332
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:11,455
Did you check the refrigerator
for any severed heads?

333
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,172
No, I didn't open his refrigerator.

334
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:15,626
Where else would you expect
to find severed heads?

335
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,500
I wasn't looking for any.

336
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:21,723
Stormy, Stormy, someone's here.
I got to go.

337
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:23,808
We don't know
what this guy's planning to do yet.

338
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:26,334
You know what? Let me ask him
to wait outside untiI I'm finished.

339
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:30,422
I can feeI that.

340
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:35,647
Wait a minute.
What's today's date?

341
00:27:35,682 --> 00:27:36,947
August 14th.

342
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:39,276
The page to August 15th
is torn out of his calendar.

343
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:41,483
That's tomorrow.
What happens tomorrow?

344
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:45,449
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Get out of there, Oddie.

345
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:48,244
Maybe he has a file on himself,
you know?

346
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,003
Unsolved murders and atrocities.

347
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,326
Chief and I could figure
out a way to entrap him.

348
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:57,128
So, what's in it?
Is he a mass murderer?

349
00:27:57,163 --> 00:27:58,457
No.

350
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:02,599
But I think he wants to be.

351
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:06,299
Hey, Bob!
Robert, where the hell are you?

352
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:09,004
I want my gun back!

353
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:16,306
Oh, shit. Damn dogs.

354
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,277
Shut up, you hear me?

355
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:26,291
Shut up you damn dogs!

356
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:29,529
One of these days, bang!
You hear me?

357
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:38,839
Wyatt is out back here burning
some perfectly good steaks.

358
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:39,965
Thanks, Karla.

359
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,181
Chief.

360
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:44,261
Odd, I hope you haven't come
here to dampen my evening.

361
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:45,686
I share your hope, sir.

362
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:47,285
Been communing with the dead?

363
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,229
It's not about who's dead, sir.

364
00:28:49,264 --> 00:28:51,138
It's about who soon might be.

365
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,572
We call him Fungus Bob.

366
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:58,735
Yeah, I saw him enter the grill, but
he didn't strike me as suspicious.

367
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,911
Just unfortunate.

368
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:04,157
Oh, you don't have the advantage
of seeing his fan club, sir.

369
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:07,584
I guarantee you hell on earth
is coming to Pico Mundo.

370
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:10,997
You know sometimes you expect me
to walk a dangerously narrow line.

371
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:14,376
That's just because I've got such
great respect for your balance, sir.

372
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:17,063
Son that sounds perilously close
to being bullshit.

373
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:19,715
There's a little bit of
bullshit in it. A little.

374
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,766
But it's mostly sincere.

375
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,199
Odd this is one of
our newer officers...

376
00:29:24,234 --> 00:29:26,598
- Bern Eckles.
- Oh, hi. We met yesterday.

377
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:28,231
Good collar, that Harlo character.

378
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,143
I can't believe
I once dated that perv.

379
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:31,443
And of course you know Lysette.

380
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,980
Bern, I want you
to do a little DMV check on..

381
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:36,269
this guy Odd was telling me about.

382
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,237
I think Officer Eckles
is a little worried

383
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:41,370
I might try to hook up with you.

384
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,073
Karla and the chief
are trying to set us up...

385
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:44,947
him being new to the force and all.

386
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,913
It's like cleaning fluid
with sugar in it.

387
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:50,630
Which reminds me, how's your dad?

388
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:54,627
He's selling pieces of the moon
online, vacation home sites.

389
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:55,551
Is that legaI?

390
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,089
He certainly doesn't guarantee
the quality of the air.

391
00:29:58,124 --> 00:30:00,383
And how's it going with Bronwen?

392
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:01,926
She prefers "Stormy. "

393
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:03,302
Who wouldn't?

394
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,188
Did you used to play piano?

395
00:30:06,223 --> 00:30:08,600
I did, yeah, for years.
How'd you know that?

396
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:10,894
'Cause you have really
beautifuI hands.

397
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:12,472
I bet you play like a dream.

398
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:17,776
You know Odd, you're a strange one.

399
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:20,488
Yeah, I can't disagree with that.

400
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:22,279
Bit of an oddball.

401
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:25,201
That was my nickname
all through high schooI.

402
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:26,928
But you do have your charms.

403
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,586
That's what Stormy says.

404
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:30,255
Personally,
I find it rather dubious.

405
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,418
You know, if you ever decide
to give cooking lessons...

406
00:30:33,453 --> 00:30:35,051
you should give me a call.

407
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:37,679
I bet you really know
how to whisk.

408
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:40,216
Sure, yeah,
with scrambled eggs and stuff.

409
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:42,945
But, pancakes, you really,
you got to fold em.

410
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,639
But, mostly,
I just fry, fry, fry, you know?

411
00:30:45,674 --> 00:30:47,513
Hey, Odd. We got to talk.

412
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:51,319
Robertson moved here
five months ago.

413
00:30:51,354 --> 00:30:54,023
Before that,
he was living with his mother.

414
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:56,731
Inherited a shitload
when she died last year.

415
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:59,404
Clean record, though.
Not even a speeding ticket.

416
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:01,329
How'd his mother die?

417
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:04,138
Officer Eckles is checking on
that right now.

418
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,912
But otherwise,
I got squat on your Fungus Bob.

419
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:07,794
I can't hold him.

420
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:11,583
All right, well, you do agree that
he's strange and suspicious, right?

421
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:14,503
If strange and suspicious were
enough to put someone in jaiI...

422
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,377
you'd already be there.

423
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:19,049
You're gonna watch him right?

424
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,307
Only because you're never wrong,

425
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:22,553
I'll put on a taiI on him
and watch his house.

426
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:25,264
You go and have
your dinner with Stormy.

427
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:26,147
She's the one.

428
00:31:26,182 --> 00:31:28,328
You are one smooth operator, Odd.

429
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:30,475
She must love to hear you say that.

430
00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:32,437
I love to hear me say it.

431
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:46,745
You better not be hauling
any dead guys on my scooter.

432
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,706
- Dead don't ride scooters.
- Just saying.

433
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,499
I'd have to scrub
the seat for hours.

434
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,216
Destroying the pleather.

435
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:55,171
I see you left your hormone
spigot running, griddle boy.

436
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,377
Crank it shut.
This is a church.

437
00:32:00,593 --> 00:32:02,053
I know it's a church.

438
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,478
I have a brain, you know.

439
00:32:03,513 --> 00:32:05,098
You know why I call you Pooh Bear?

440
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,398
Because I'm so cuddly.

441
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:08,840
Because his head is full of stuffin'

442
00:32:13,857 --> 00:32:15,157
Now listen to me, odd one.

443
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:17,194
I don't want you going back
to that creepy room again.

444
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:19,119
It doesn't exist anymore.

445
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,948
Well, don't go looking for
it hoping it'll come back.

446
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,998
- Never crossed my mind.
- Yes, it did.

447
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:25,640
- Yes, it did.
- It is a gate to the underworld...

448
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:28,212
and you are forbidden by me
to ever play in it again.

449
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,833
It's hard enough living with a guy who
helps dead people without having to

450
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:33,544
trek all the way down to hell
to pull his ass out of the fire.

451
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,547
Since when are we living together?

452
00:32:35,582 --> 00:32:36,429
We will be.

453
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:38,967
Oh, I guess I didn't think
"Let's put a pin in it" meant "Yes. "

454
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:41,470
You have to learn to listen
with more than just your ears.

455
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:44,174
Stormy, what body part am
I supposed to listen with?

456
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:47,851
Right. My heart.
I'm supposed to listen with my heart.

457
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:49,068
Listen with my heart.

458
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:54,316
I will do something big
to improve our financiaI situation.

459
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:56,242
- Your idea about selling car tires?
- Bigger.

460
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:58,571
And what, from your perspective,
is bigger than tires?

461
00:32:58,606 --> 00:32:59,589
- Shoes.
- Shoes?

462
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:00,538
Yeah, think about it.

463
00:33:00,573 --> 00:33:03,221
A family of 5 might have 2 cars
but they have 10 feet.

464
00:33:03,256 --> 00:33:05,835
Not only that, but they need
different kinds of shoes.

465
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,164
Dress shoes, winkle pickers,
high-tops, low-tops, running shoes-

466
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,250
But not you. You have
5 pairs of the same sneakers.

467
00:33:10,285 --> 00:33:12,456
- Like I said
- You're not like most people.

468
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:15,585
Not in the least.

469
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:25,474
Do you want crackers
with your cheese?

470
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,691
We have a problem.

471
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:28,394
Crackers aren't a problem,
just a choice.

472
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:29,193
- Come on.
- What?

473
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:31,102
- Come on! It's Fungus Bob!
- What!

474
00:33:32,356 --> 00:33:34,230
He followed me. I don't know how.

475
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:38,703
Shit! Come on! Come on!

476
00:33:38,738 --> 00:33:40,372
- It's him? You're sure?
- Sure, I'm sure!

477
00:33:40,407 --> 00:33:42,909
You don't think the two of us
could kick his ass?

478
00:33:42,944 --> 00:33:44,451
Not this guy.

479
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:07,809
- Come on!
- The sacristy!

480
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:15,434
The back door.
Come on. Come on.

481
00:34:15,735 --> 00:34:17,494
Wait! Wait. Come here.

482
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:20,234
We're heading towards danger,
not away from it. I can feeI it.

483
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,487
It's like he's everywhere.
He's in front of us. He's behind us.

484
00:34:25,537 --> 00:34:26,997
Come on.
Let's go back the way we came.

485
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,952
- Let's call the cops.
- No time.

486
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:30,873
I have a better plan.
You stay here.

487
00:34:31,294 --> 00:34:32,858
I'm gonna run over there
and open the door.

488
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:34,422
If he doesn't lunge through,
you run that way.

489
00:34:34,457 --> 00:34:36,556
If, however, he does lunge through,

490
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,676
you run this way and
I'll try to follow you.

491
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:40,213
Some plan, odd one.

492
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:41,715
It's the best I've got.

493
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:43,681
Full of stuffin'.

494
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,574
Does that mean "Get on with it"
or "Up yours"?

495
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:02,033
Unbelievable.

496
00:35:02,576 --> 00:35:03,608
Right.

497
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,194
Come on! Come on!

498
00:35:57,009 --> 00:35:58,225
Chief, it's Stormy.

499
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,971
I'm sorry to drop in on date night,
but here's Odd.

500
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:03,647
Sir, if you send a car reaI
quick to St. Bart's...

501
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:06,394
you may be able to catch
Robertson trashing the sacristy...

502
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:07,610
or even the whole church.

503
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:09,696
What was he doing
vandalizing St. Bart's?

504
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:12,233
He was trying to catch me
and Stormy in the belfry.

505
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:14,194
What were you and Stormy
doing in the belfry?

506
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:16,358
Well, we were having a picnic, sir.

507
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:18,488
I'm sure that makes sense to you.

508
00:36:21,076 --> 00:36:24,574
My guy at Robertsons house said
he still hasn't been home yet.

509
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:28,073
Yeah, because apparently
Bob's been too busy following me.

510
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:30,009
Oh, one second.

511
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:32,338
- Where are you going?
- To get some food.

512
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:34,632
How can you think
of dinner right now?

513
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,474
Because I'm hungry.

514
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:39,426
Look, Odd.
Vandalism, big deaI.

515
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:43,346
I thought you said this guy
was gonna bring on the apocalypse.

516
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:46,846
Yes, sir, on August 15th,
which is less than 3 hours away.

517
00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:50,056
Trust me, that is the day that
Pico Mundo will never forget.

518
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:54,201
Lyle!

519
00:36:54,236 --> 00:36:56,384
Oh. Hi, Odd. Hi Stormy.

520
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:58,532
- Hi, Ozzie.
- Hey, Oz.

521
00:36:58,567 --> 00:36:59,991
Odd.

522
00:37:01,535 --> 00:37:02,494
- I'll be right back.
- Lyle, you know that

523
00:37:03,334 --> 00:37:04,365
I know guys who know guys, right?
Right. - Right.

524
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,291
So if you guys don't stop
messing up my takeout orders..

525
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:09,043
you're the one that's gonna
get taken out. Get it?

526
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:10,051
- Got it.
- Good.

527
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:12,171
Oz, Oz, watch your blood pressure.

528
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:13,805
My blood- Hey, Odd...

529
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,633
my blood has got
cholesteroI molecules

530
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:16,933
the size of marshmallows in it...

531
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,387
and if it wasn't for a little
righteous outrage every now and again

532
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:21,463
my arteries would
completely collapse.

533
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,396
I finished that
trinket you asked for.

534
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:29,388
Perfect.

535
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,077
Wow, Oz, what exactly is this?

536
00:37:35,112 --> 00:37:38,783
It's a steeI heart 6 inches
in diameter, like you said.

537
00:37:38,818 --> 00:37:40,208
No, I said...

538
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:43,871
"A piece of steeI 6 inches
in diameter to go over a heart. "

539
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:46,374
Well, man,
I embellished, you know?

540
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:47,924
I get in the moment.

541
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:50,545
I mean, why would Stormy
wanna wear that?

542
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,387
It's not for Stormy.

543
00:37:52,422 --> 00:37:55,672
I keep having this image of a...

544
00:37:58,178 --> 00:38:00,254
a bullet going through a heart.

545
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:05,342
It's perfect. Thank you.

546
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:10,346
Hey, Chief.

547
00:38:12,985 --> 00:38:15,905
- This place is trashed.
- Yeah, it was Bob Robertson, sir.

548
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,747
I'm sure you're right.
You always are.

549
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:20,994
But he was long gone.
Didn't leave a single print.

550
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:23,288
Even the chalices were spotless.

551
00:38:23,323 --> 00:38:24,212
Weird, huh?

552
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:27,876
I'll give my psychic magnetism a try
to see if I can find him again.

553
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:29,217
Take Stormy home first.

554
00:38:29,252 --> 00:38:31,129
- Like hell he will!
- I heard that.

555
00:38:31,164 --> 00:38:32,244
He heard that.

556
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:35,140
Chief, you know
I love Oddie desperately...

557
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:39,346
so madly I would cut off my hand if
that made any sense as proof of love.

558
00:38:39,381 --> 00:38:41,349
And now I find out
there's a guy trying to kill him.

559
00:38:41,384 --> 00:38:43,637
No one was trying
to kill me, Stormy.

560
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,902
What, you think
he was hitting on you?

561
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:49,274
You know, this is the craziest
conversation I've ever had.

562
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:51,776
Odd you're a fountain
of crazy conversations.

563
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:53,105
A geyser.

564
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:58,237
Time feels like
a powerfuI black wave...

565
00:38:58,272 --> 00:39:01,361
that wishes to crash down
and engulf us.

566
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:04,778
I must run faster.

567
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:15,308
BOWLING

568
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:17,741
Why did I drive here?

569
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:20,104
Green Moon BOWLING

570
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:22,607
Oh, my God.
Oddie, your nightmare...

571
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:25,437
the slaughter of the bowling alley
people, is it happening here tonight?

572
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:27,014
- Now?
- No.

573
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:28,447
No, no, I checked this place.

574
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:30,650
The employees here wear green
and gold shirts.

575
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:32,284
- So?
- So, in my dreams,

576
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:35,984
the victims wear red-and-black shirts
with little black nbowling balls on em.

577
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:39,500
And I don't see
Fungus Bob's car anywhere.

578
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:41,287
You think the slaughter of
the bowling alley people

579
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:42,663
and Fungus Bob are connected?

580
00:39:42,698 --> 00:39:43,992
Yeah.

581
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,123
Yeah, yeah, I know they are.

582
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:54,834
GREEN MOON BOWLING

583
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:11,858
They got new uniforms.

584
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,082
Don't you dare.

585
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,374
Oh, Wyatt.

586
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:32,174
You said that whatever was gonna
happen wouldn't happen untiI tomorrow.

587
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:34,485
- Yes, sir, but you see-
- I still got an hour.

588
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,762
I know, sir.
I just want to keep you up to date.

589
00:40:36,797 --> 00:40:38,395
I think there's a good chance that

590
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,573
Bob Robertson might
come to Green Moon Alley...

591
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:42,717
to do a little more
than just hook some balls.

592
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:55,240
Maybe you wanna send a guy out here
to, you know, keep an eye out?

593
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:57,374
Any of those bodarch things around?

594
00:40:57,409 --> 00:41:01,572
Bodachs. No, sir,
but they will show up when he does.

595
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:04,410
Yeah-yeah. All right.
I'll send a guy right over.

596
00:41:06,168 --> 00:41:07,959
Something doesn't feeI right.

597
00:41:08,378 --> 00:41:09,803
Something's wrong.

598
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:11,402
Are you nuts?
Everything's wrong.

599
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:12,932
There's going to be a massacre...

600
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,948
and I'll bet you
it's going to happen here.

601
00:41:14,983 --> 00:41:16,894
No, all we know is it's
the same uniforms,

602
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:19,430
so it's the same
group of people getting killed.

603
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:21,932
But tomorrow,
any of them could be anywhere.

604
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:27,979
God, I'm missing something.
I'm missing a piece of the puzzle.

605
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:32,771
I need to see Viola.

606
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:36,945
Evening!

607
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:40,162
- Odd Thomas, right?
- Yeah.

608
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,431
Miss Lewellyn.

609
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,630
The chief sent me.

610
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:45,286
So you know this guy, right?

611
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:49,336
I've seen him a couple times today
but no, I don't know him.

612
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:52,383
Yeah, chief says,
If you see him reach for his pocket

613
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:54,257
he's probably not going
for a breath mint.

614
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,645
- Wise words from a wise man.
- Yeah.

615
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,800
So what exactly makes this guy
so suspicious and dangerous?

616
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:03,847
He came into the grill
for lunch today.

617
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:07,185
That's it? You served him lunch?

618
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,475
- He was weird.
- How weird?

619
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,576
He had weird friends.

620
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,071
- He has friends?
- Weird ones.

621
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:13,446
How weird?

622
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,318
Very weird.

623
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:22,707
And a couple hours ago,
he got very aggressive with me.

624
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:24,674
Wait. A couple hours ago,

625
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,125
this guy, Bob Robertson
got aggressive with you?

626
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,466
Look, the creep made a pass at me
and Odd told him to back off...

627
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:34,301
and the creep got,
you know, creepy.

628
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,382
Creepy.

629
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,685
Hey, Simon, I've been dying
to know what this tattoo means.

630
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,345
- Do you mind?
- POD

631
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:47,104
Well, Stormy...

632
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:49,575
when I was a teenager,
I was a mess.

633
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,592
If it wasn't for the police
academy and the good Lord

634
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:55,575
Let's just say this tattoo
is a crude obscenity...

635
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,532
that I'd rather not
say the meaning of.

636
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:00,656
Well, what a gentleman you are.

637
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,625
Nighty-night, Simon.

638
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,622
Night.

639
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,807
You manipulate me like that?

640
00:43:11,842 --> 00:43:14,428
Good heavens odd one,
I manipulate you every day.

641
00:43:14,463 --> 00:43:15,769
- You do?
- Yes.

642
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:18,724
Gently, of course, and with great
affection and you always like it.

643
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:19,969
Oh, I do?

644
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:22,652
You are so adorable.

645
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:24,821
- I'm not adorable.
- Oh, please.

646
00:43:24,856 --> 00:43:27,567
Puppies, puppies,
little puppies, are adorable.

647
00:43:27,602 --> 00:43:31,730
You and puppies,
totally adorable.

648
00:43:34,657 --> 00:43:36,650
I had a feeling
I'd see you tonight.

649
00:43:37,285 --> 00:43:39,579
- It's about my dream, isn't it?
- You said you were shot.

650
00:43:39,614 --> 00:43:43,382
My skull was all whacked,
my eyeball swollen.

651
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:45,982
You know dreams have nothing
to do with the reaI future, Vi.

652
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:48,547
We've already been over that
territory, but here you are.

653
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:50,207
Where are you in your dream?

654
00:43:50,633 --> 00:43:53,131
No place.
A dream place. Fuzzy.

655
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:55,629
Are you planning on going bowling?

656
00:43:56,055 --> 00:43:58,078
Bowling? Did you hit your head?

657
00:43:58,113 --> 00:44:00,066
What are your plans tomorrow?

658
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:03,393
Levanna's birthday is Sunday,
but tips are reaI good on a Sunday

659
00:44:03,428 --> 00:44:06,686
so I was gonna work it and celebrate
her birthday tomorrow instead.

660
00:44:07,317 --> 00:44:10,237
A lot of people died in that
dream of yours, huh Odd?

661
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,482
Yeah, they did.

662
00:44:12,322 --> 00:44:13,982
Your dreams ever come true?

663
00:44:14,283 --> 00:44:15,860
Sometimes.

664
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,364
I thought so.

665
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:21,991
Close your eyes, Vi.

666
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,379
In your dream what do you see?

667
00:44:37,015 --> 00:44:39,636
- What do you hear?
- All right.

668
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,849
I'm running.

669
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,644
There's suddenly lots of
flashing lights with...

670
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:50,276
old-fashioned kiddie music.

671
00:44:52,865 --> 00:44:56,316
And then I hear a big crowd,
a roaring one.

672
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:59,295
Like in a big football stadium.

673
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,367
And then there's the sound
of water, gushing water.

674
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:05,080
How do you die?

675
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,336
It's like someone hit me with
a baseball bat, quick, like twice.

676
00:45:09,883 --> 00:45:12,594
I scream and
fall to my hands and knees.

677
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:14,318
My hands slip, slippery.

678
00:45:14,353 --> 00:45:16,008
What are you slipping on?

679
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:19,309
Oh, God. Blood.
There's blood everywhere.

680
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:22,187
What's under the blood,
under your hands?

681
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:24,123
A floor, grass, concrete?

682
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:26,024
I'm staring at the dead man.

683
00:45:28,444 --> 00:45:31,362
Do you know him?
Do you recognize him?

684
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:38,870
Oh, dear Lord, Odd.
So many dead bodies.

685
00:45:40,415 --> 00:45:42,906
Odd, you have to stop
this from happening.

686
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:49,445
Oh, Odd, is there any hope
this could pass?

687
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,468
If you listen to Oddie,
you'll be just fine.

688
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:52,500
No.

689
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:57,157
Fate is not a straight road.
There are many forks in it.

690
00:45:57,192 --> 00:46:00,553
You have the free will to choose
which one you take, but...

691
00:46:00,978 --> 00:46:02,403
sometimes it will bend around...

692
00:46:02,438 --> 00:46:05,854
and bring you straight back
to that same stubborn fate.

693
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:09,395
I just wanna check on the girls.

694
00:46:14,743 --> 00:46:16,617
They're so beautifuI, Viola.

695
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:19,206
And they're such good girls.

696
00:46:19,241 --> 00:46:21,057
They're lucky to have you.

697
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:22,874
That's what everyone says.

698
00:46:51,323 --> 00:46:52,486
Odd?

699
00:46:53,742 --> 00:46:56,031
- Anything wrong?
- No.

700
00:46:56,453 --> 00:47:00,416
No, no, no. I just wanted
to make sure the girls were safe.

701
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:02,550
And with the bars on the windows

702
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:05,420
I taught them how to work
the emergency release myself.

703
00:47:19,686 --> 00:47:24,064
Well, looks like everything's
a- okay in here.

704
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:27,882
Step one, do not stay here.

705
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,787
I'll go to my grandma's.

706
00:47:29,822 --> 00:47:30,969
Don't tell your grandma
you're coming.

707
00:47:31,004 --> 00:47:32,116
Don't tell the girls
where you're going.

708
00:47:32,151 --> 00:47:33,948
I don't want you overheard.

709
00:47:33,983 --> 00:47:35,710
- By who?
- By anyone.

710
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:38,366
Or anything. Just go with it.

711
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:44,285
Step two is don't go bowling if
for some reason you get the itch.

712
00:47:48,675 --> 00:47:50,552
I can't believe we're leaving
those horrid things...

713
00:47:50,587 --> 00:47:52,346
hovering around those sweet girls.

714
00:47:52,381 --> 00:47:53,228
They won't hurt em.

715
00:47:53,263 --> 00:47:55,349
They just want to smell em
before they die.

716
00:47:55,384 --> 00:47:56,482
God.

717
00:47:56,517 --> 00:47:59,728
Look, Stormy, there's nothing
I can do about bodachs, okay?

718
00:47:59,763 --> 00:48:01,570
And right now
I wouldn't even if I could.

719
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:04,859
I need em to help me see the danger
coming so I can maybe prevent it.

720
00:48:04,894 --> 00:48:07,776
And when they eventually find out
that you can see them?

721
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:14,292
Oddie, will you ever leave here?

722
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:17,664
Well, I sure hope I don't end up like
Tom Jedd hanging out at Tire World.

723
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:19,657
I meant while you're alive.

724
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:24,920
Hey. Hey, Stormy.

725
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:27,379
Hey, hey. Look, look.

726
00:48:29,468 --> 00:48:31,846
Look, Stormy,
if you want us to go, I'll go.

727
00:48:31,881 --> 00:48:33,304
It's not that. It's-

728
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:36,840
I am just so scared for you, Oddie.

729
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:40,601
So scared, ever since
I saw that creep Fungus Bob.

730
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,523
I'm sorry. I just-

731
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:46,644
I love you so much.

732
00:48:51,658 --> 00:48:53,083
My Pooh Bear.

733
00:48:53,118 --> 00:48:56,371
I promise you on
the other side of tomorrow...

734
00:48:56,406 --> 00:48:59,990
I will have all my stuffing intact.

735
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:06,582
That must be for you.

736
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:55,052
Oh, God!

737
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:59,500
I heard the scream.
She ran across my yard.

738
00:49:59,535 --> 00:50:02,899
I saw the dogs following her.
I grabbed my gun.

739
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:05,486
I shot the dogs.

740
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:06,861
It's on.

741
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:12,070
All right. Here's what we know.

742
00:50:12,702 --> 00:50:17,790
Lysette left my barbecue with
Officer Eckles at around 7:45.

743
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:20,467
He dropped her off at home
clocked in at 8:00,

744
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:23,213
and was manning the front
desk when he got the call.

745
00:50:23,248 --> 00:50:26,640
So somewhere
between 8:00 and midnight,

746
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:29,282
Lysette was whacked in the eye
and then tied up

747
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,889
and gagged and hauled
all the way the hell out here

748
00:50:31,924 --> 00:50:34,356
and had two Rottweilers
sicked on her.

749
00:50:34,391 --> 00:50:37,102
Hey, Chief. What's with
the guy who shot the dogs?

750
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:38,736
His name's Kevin Goss.

751
00:50:38,771 --> 00:50:40,821
He was teaching a class
from 6:00 to 10:00...

752
00:50:40,856 --> 00:50:43,651
then he went to Starbucks
till they closed at midnight.

753
00:50:43,686 --> 00:50:46,059
He got home about
two minutes too late.

754
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:50,241
Sir? I've actually seen
those Rottweilers before.

755
00:50:50,276 --> 00:50:52,115
They belong to Bob Robertson.

756
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:56,705
All right!

757
00:50:57,124 --> 00:51:00,460
I want an A. P. B.
put out on this guy now!

758
00:51:00,495 --> 00:51:01,760
- Find him!
- Yes, sir.

759
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:04,840
Simon, I want you to go back
over to Robertson's house.

760
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,508
I'll have a search
warrant in the morning

761
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:07,725
as soon as the courthouse opens.

762
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,514
Sir, no offense, but I wasted most
of the day staking out that house.

763
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:15,268
Then I went to the bowling alley
and stayed there untiI they closed.

764
00:51:15,303 --> 00:51:16,596
Nothing happened.

765
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:19,850
Nobody showed.
It was a complete waste of my time.

766
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:25,476
Sir, are we sure this Robertson
character isn't just a wild goose chase?

767
00:51:25,987 --> 00:51:27,989
Exactly where were you between
the hours of 8:00 and 10:00?

768
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:31,738
- He was with me the whole time.
- Just ease up.

769
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:35,080
Now go check the house again
and ask around about the dogs.

770
00:51:35,115 --> 00:51:36,409
Yes, sir.

771
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:39,740
You two.

772
00:51:40,294 --> 00:51:41,409
Home.

773
00:51:42,046 --> 00:51:43,209
Go, now!

774
00:51:48,094 --> 00:51:52,258
I think you should wear this.
Try not to laugh.

775
00:52:00,524 --> 00:52:03,235
Oddie, you are not responsible
for every death you can't prevent.

776
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,117
She died.

777
00:52:04,152 --> 00:52:07,197
And if Fungus Bob was her killer,
I was either slow or stupid.

778
00:52:07,232 --> 00:52:08,289
Choose your weapon.

779
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:10,082
Why would Fungus Bob kill Lysette?

780
00:52:10,117 --> 00:52:11,834
What's the connection?
It makes no sense.

781
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:16,165
It doesn't have to make sense.
It just has to satisfy some sick urge.

782
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,039
Maybe he's warming up.

783
00:52:18,751 --> 00:52:21,588
I think the chief just sent
some detectives to protect you.

784
00:52:21,623 --> 00:52:23,331
I don't need protecting.

785
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:27,627
Actually I think it might
just be surveillance.

786
00:52:28,553 --> 00:52:29,895
Fungus Bob followed me
to the church.

787
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:32,516
I bet the chief is hoping
he'll sniff me out again.

788
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:34,149
If the chief is using you as bait...

789
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:37,304
he should at least ask if
you mind having a hook in your ass.

790
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:46,484
Oh, man, I got to stay focused.

791
00:52:48,574 --> 00:52:51,492
Good. You keep an eye on my girI.

792
00:52:52,662 --> 00:52:54,536
August 15th had begun.

793
00:52:54,956 --> 00:52:56,699
Time was running out.

794
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:45,216
Hey, Bob.

795
00:53:46,343 --> 00:53:48,217
You're not planning
on getting up, are ya?

796
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,760
But if you're dead...

797
00:53:54,185 --> 00:53:56,676
who's gonna massacre Pico Mundo?

798
00:53:57,397 --> 00:54:00,433
Gun on the floor,
dead guy in my tub.

799
00:54:00,942 --> 00:54:03,231
I know a setup when I see one.

800
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:07,615
But if I call the police,
the chief will have to arrest me...

801
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,951
and I won't be able to stop
the catastrophe from happening.

802
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:22,805
Oh, my God!

803
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,047
Oh, you are creeping me out.

804
00:54:39,524 --> 00:54:41,398
You're freezing cold, Bob.

805
00:54:42,236 --> 00:54:45,153
Your rigor mortis is way advanced.

806
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:48,399
You know...

807
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:51,120
the chief said
you didn't leave any fingerprints.

808
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,994
He didn't leave a single print.

809
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:58,077
And Stormy never actually saw you.

810
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,295
- Come on!
- What?

811
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,282
Because you were already dead.

812
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:08,270
And the whole time in the church,

813
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,974
you were actually
a pissed-off poltergeist.

814
00:55:11,009 --> 00:55:13,609
I think the last time
I saw Fungus Bob alive...

815
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,764
was when he left his house
right before I broke into it.

816
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:22,027
He's been haunting me ever since,
blaming me for his death.

817
00:55:22,062 --> 00:55:26,032
Why he blames me or who the hell
killed him is a little hazy.

818
00:55:26,067 --> 00:55:28,757
If I'm caught,
I'll either be arrested for murder

819
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,447
or rolling what looks like
the biggest joint ever.

820
00:55:48,556 --> 00:55:50,548
It's just me, Rosalia!

821
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,773
Damn it.

822
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,614
Oh, give me a break.

823
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:13,779
It's just me, again, Rosalia.

824
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,961
I'm gonna borrow
your car again, okay?

825
00:56:17,996 --> 00:56:19,303
If I'm being framed,

826
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:22,191
why the police have failed
to arrive and arrest me...

827
00:56:22,226 --> 00:56:25,044
or the murderer hasn't come
to kill me, I do not know.

828
00:56:37,357 --> 00:56:40,859
All right, Bob, where can I put you
to quietly decompose for a while...

829
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:44,361
before someone finds you and has
a new love of Jesus scared into em?

830
00:57:03,134 --> 00:57:04,767
Interesting story, Bob.

831
00:57:04,802 --> 00:57:07,722
After the federaI government
abandoned this prison...

832
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,065
it went through a long
series of owners.

833
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,688
Rumor has it that at Von Zipper's
Burgers the fries were delicious...

834
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:18,139
and the free-soft-drink-refill
policy was generously honored.

835
00:57:21,153 --> 00:57:23,621
And yet, this fine
dining establishment...

836
00:57:23,656 --> 00:57:28,452
never succeeded in winning
over the family-dining crowd...

837
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,987
which is so essentiaI
to any restaurant operation.

838
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:35,091
Welcome to the gas chamber.

839
00:57:35,126 --> 00:57:36,794
A lot of people died in here, Bob.

840
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,462
You should feeI right at home.

841
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:57,441
Stormy's always joking about running
off to Las Vegas and getting married.

842
00:57:57,476 --> 00:58:00,486
But I tell her Vegas is packed
with dead people and bad guys...

843
00:58:00,521 --> 00:58:03,487
and I'd just end up
fighting eviI 24-7.

844
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,776
I should have listened to her.

845
00:58:10,497 --> 00:58:11,611
Too many.

846
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,743
Too many.

847
00:58:35,815 --> 00:58:37,574
The chief.

848
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:38,937
I need the chief.

849
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:42,787
Dear Lord.

850
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:46,357
If that's you again, Odd,
we are going to have words!

851
00:58:58,047 --> 00:59:00,123
Oh, my God.

852
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:10,034
No offense, Odd Thomas,
but I can't think of anybody...

853
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:12,219
who could come in here right now
and not get my back up.

854
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,877
- So you think he knew the shooter?
- Had to.

855
00:59:14,912 --> 00:59:17,234
Which means it's probably
somebody I know, too.

856
00:59:17,269 --> 00:59:19,725
- How bad is he?
- Bad.

857
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,568
- Well, he's a fighter.
- He better be.

858
00:59:25,034 --> 00:59:27,013
- Hey, Bern.
- Ma'am.

859
00:59:27,048 --> 00:59:28,993
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

860
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:33,780
- Hey.
- Oh Oddie.

861
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:37,046
Keep those reporters out of here.
You, on that door.

862
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:39,335
- Sorry, no press inside.
- Comin through.

863
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:44,426
You saved his life, Oddie.

864
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:47,263
Where's this bullet?

865
00:59:47,766 --> 00:59:50,471
That's the one they're
trying to dig out of him now.

866
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:56,224
Time is up.

867
00:59:56,442 --> 01:00:01,234
Pico Mundo is awakening
to a horror that only I can stop.

868
01:00:02,156 --> 01:00:04,408
Lysette and Fungus Bob are dead.

869
01:00:04,443 --> 01:00:06,626
The chief is
in the emergency room.

870
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:09,580
There's hoards of bodachs
swarming all over town.

871
01:00:09,615 --> 01:00:11,297
Whatever's coming is gonna be big.

872
01:00:11,332 --> 01:00:14,008
I'm scared,
and I'm supposed to be fearless.

873
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,233
- Don't tell me to stay home today.
- Please stay home today.

874
01:00:16,268 --> 01:00:18,423
- I will if you stay home with me.
- We've been through this.

875
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:20,926
I have to do
whatever I can to stop it.

876
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:22,893
Is Viola going to be shot dead?

877
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:25,217
You know I don't know
that for sure.

878
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:28,213
She's had it hard in life.
She doesn't need this.

879
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:31,235
Shot dead? Really?
Who does need it?

880
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,856
Oh, I don't know
why I try to reason with you.

881
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:34,989
I always lose.

882
01:00:35,024 --> 01:00:37,047
You're a fabulous man of action,
odd one.

883
01:00:37,082 --> 01:00:39,070
You don't need to be
a good debater, too.

884
01:00:39,105 --> 01:00:40,828
Besides, you said yourself...

885
01:00:40,863 --> 01:00:43,575
any road I choose could lead me
right back to the same fate.

886
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,744
So, which is it?
Do I have free will?

887
01:00:45,779 --> 01:00:47,404
Am I in God's hands?

888
01:00:48,246 --> 01:00:49,254
Or is it both?

889
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:51,583
Have I ever told you
you've got a lot of issues?

890
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:53,342
I'm a woman. We all have issues.

891
01:00:53,377 --> 01:00:56,442
It's what keeps us interesting,
and you men interested.

892
01:00:56,477 --> 01:00:59,508
Oh, yeah? It's what makes us
crazy and die younger.

893
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:00,753
Do you love me?

894
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,679
I love you more than life itself.

895
01:01:03,714 --> 01:01:06,514
See? It's working.

896
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:15,066
Don't look back. Don't look back.

897
01:01:15,101 --> 01:01:16,311
Give him strength.

898
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,739
Knock, knock.

899
01:01:26,745 --> 01:01:29,532
I'm hoping Bob left
a clue on his computer.

900
01:01:30,374 --> 01:01:32,782
Something to lead me
to his partner...

901
01:01:34,545 --> 01:01:37,256
to the person who was
planning on killing 100s,

902
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:40,293
if not 1000s of people.

903
01:02:40,781 --> 01:02:41,789
Hey.

904
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:43,576
Loop me in, odd one.
Where are you?

905
01:02:43,611 --> 01:02:45,466
I'm walking towards the fridge.

906
01:02:45,501 --> 01:02:47,321
Yours, mine, or Fungus Bob's?

907
01:02:48,915 --> 01:02:50,423
Don't "uh-huh" me. I told you...

908
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:53,169
you are not allowed to go playing
around in any more hell gates.

909
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:54,747
Next!

910
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:57,398
Oh, God. Cockroaches.

911
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:59,750
Always cockroaches.

912
01:02:59,968 --> 01:03:02,346
- Odd Thomas, did you hear me?
- Which part?

913
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:03,562
I can't believe
you went back there.

914
01:03:03,597 --> 01:03:06,931
Every time you don't listen to me,
you get yourself into trouble.

915
01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:10,810
- I wish I'd listened to you.
- You get out of there right now.

916
01:03:11,105 --> 01:03:14,023
Right, right. Leaving. Leaving.

917
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,781
Never heard you make that
sound before. Is everything okay?

918
01:03:19,816 --> 01:03:23,613
- Yeah.
- What are you looking at?

919
01:03:25,203 --> 01:03:26,211
Fingers.

920
01:03:26,246 --> 01:03:28,832
Please say they're attached
to someone's hand.

921
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:30,048
Sorry.

922
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:31,300
Get out of there, Oddie.

923
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:34,553
Someone has been buying
a lot of Burke and Bailey's.

924
01:03:34,588 --> 01:03:36,757
Yeah? Well, you tell whoever's
buying it that our ice cream...

925
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:39,378
may be the best,
but it'll still melt in hell.

926
01:03:41,262 --> 01:03:43,014
- I'm calling the police.
- No.

927
01:03:43,049 --> 01:03:44,259
No. Wait.

928
01:03:44,473 --> 01:03:46,893
I'll leave here first.
Then I'll call 'em.

929
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:48,304
Be carefuI.

930
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:49,681
Don't worry.

931
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,565
Hey, Bob.

932
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,000
I guess when I began to out you,
word somehow spread...

933
01:04:03,035 --> 01:04:08,456
and you became a liability to
your partner and he had to kill you.

934
01:04:08,874 --> 01:04:10,119
Sorry about that.

935
01:04:14,922 --> 01:04:19,635
I find it funny how I know more
about dead people than dead people.

936
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:20,727
This is our realm, Bob.

937
01:04:20,762 --> 01:04:23,798
You can't physically harm
a living person.

938
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,930
But there is that.

939
01:04:40,282 --> 01:04:42,856
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

940
01:04:51,544 --> 01:04:53,501
Gas.

941
01:05:21,993 --> 01:05:25,992
I'm exhausted, I'm lost,
and somewhere along the way...

942
01:05:26,027 --> 01:05:29,991
I missed an important clue
that could take me home.

943
01:05:34,923 --> 01:05:36,797
The bullet through the heart.

944
01:05:47,019 --> 01:05:49,308
It wasn't about the chief.

945
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,709
God.

946
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:41,532
Enough already, Bob. Please.

947
01:06:43,954 --> 01:06:47,786
My three least favorite words.

948
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:49,869
Some..

949
01:06:52,296 --> 01:06:53,956
assembly...

950
01:06:54,173 --> 01:06:56,224
required.

951
01:06:56,259 --> 01:06:59,179
Simon, I've been dying to know
what that tattoo means.

952
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:02,382
Let's just say this tattoo
is a crude obscenity.

953
01:07:04,476 --> 01:07:05,851
It's Varner.

954
01:07:06,561 --> 01:07:09,479
I once had a run-in with
some deviI worshipers.

955
01:07:09,815 --> 01:07:11,274
I should've known.

956
01:07:12,943 --> 01:07:16,662
P- O-D. Prince Of Darkness.

957
01:07:16,697 --> 01:07:19,582
No wonder Varner was suspicious
when I told him...

958
01:07:19,617 --> 01:07:22,203
Fungus Bob had gotten aggressive
with me an hour earlier.

959
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:25,453
This guy Bob Robertson
got aggressive with you?

960
01:07:25,665 --> 01:07:28,998
He had already killed Bob
5 or 6 hours before that.

961
01:07:29,294 --> 01:07:31,553
And that police van
protecting Stormy?

962
01:07:31,588 --> 01:07:33,882
That must've been Varner
waiting to follow me home...

963
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:36,295
to bust me
for Fungus Bob's murder.

964
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,673
Or shoot me while resisting arrest.

965
01:07:43,183 --> 01:07:45,442
There were no bodachs around Varner.

966
01:07:45,477 --> 01:07:48,237
But I can still feeI myself
being drawn to him...

967
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,807
and to the place where
he's about to commit mass murder.

968
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,818
GREEN MOON MALL

969
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:02,157
Coconut cherry chocolate chunk.

970
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,738
Oh, God, no.

971
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:16,753
POLICE

972
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:19,680
Hey, Nell,
I see what the problem is.

973
01:08:19,715 --> 01:08:20,563
Stormy.

974
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:23,517
You are eating and
reading at the same time.

975
01:08:23,552 --> 01:08:25,510
How about I eat and you read?

976
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:29,889
No? Not so good? Okay, fine.

977
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:47,824
All right, Varner, where are you?

978
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:28,290
SECURITY

979
01:09:39,222 --> 01:09:42,342
Fungus Bob didn't just
have one kill buddy.

980
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:44,526
He had two.

981
01:09:44,561 --> 01:09:48,607
One more, and they could buy group
health insurance or form a rock band.

982
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:51,098
Officer Eckles is checking
that right now.

983
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:53,946
I don't know what this
Odd Thomas character knows...

984
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,632
but I know that Robertson
is stupid and careless...

985
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:57,283
and he's gonna get us nailed
if we don't do something.

986
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,165
Relax.

987
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,537
Did Robertson ever find those
photos at the mall he misplaced?

988
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:06,034
I said, relax.
I'll take care of him.

989
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:20,004
Stalking someone at the mall, Bern?

990
01:10:20,641 --> 01:10:22,301
Robertson, that idiot.

991
01:10:24,812 --> 01:10:26,689
We got to make it
look like an accident.

992
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:28,831
Oh, it'll look like
an accident all right.

993
01:10:28,866 --> 01:10:30,938
When I find Robertson,
I'm gonna kill him.

994
01:10:31,277 --> 01:10:33,435
Already been there, done that.

995
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:42,622
Looks like their plan was to jump
out at the end of the mall disaster

996
01:10:42,657 --> 01:10:45,244
like heroes responding to the call.

997
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:49,916
But I never saw any bodachs
around Eckles, either.

998
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:54,255
The presence of the bodachs
tipped me off to Fungus Bob...

999
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:58,256
but not to his two co-conspirators,
which now seems...

1000
01:10:58,597 --> 01:11:00,106
intentionaI.

1001
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:04,304
As if the bodachs knew of my gift,
as if they know I can see them.

1002
01:11:05,688 --> 01:11:08,262
The bodachs have been
manipulating me.

1003
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,838
I'm gonna finish you off,
old man.

1004
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:37,645
Four.

1005
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,969
Well, that's just jiffy.

1006
01:12:11,382 --> 01:12:14,502
This just so happens
to be my very favorite book.

1007
01:12:15,136 --> 01:12:17,295
The WonderfuI Wizard Of Oz.

1008
01:12:17,514 --> 01:12:22,853
Officer Varner Prince of Darkness,
Officer Varner, Prince of Darkness.

1009
01:12:32,947 --> 01:12:34,109
Viola.

1010
01:12:34,323 --> 01:12:36,450
- Viola! What are you doing here?
- Odd! Geez!

1011
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,543
- You scared the-
- What are you doing here?

1012
01:12:38,578 --> 01:12:40,517
We had to pick out
a birthday present for Levanna.

1013
01:12:40,552 --> 01:12:43,005
And Nicolina wanted to get
a card for her big sister.

1014
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,458
Look, your dream, it's happening
right here, right now.

1015
01:12:46,086 --> 01:12:48,859
I thought in a big stadium or
at the water park or a bowling alley.

1016
01:12:48,894 --> 01:12:51,633
Ladies, I need you to take Viola
and get her out of here, okay?

1017
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:54,338
Come on.
Come on, come on. Go on.

1018
01:12:55,596 --> 01:12:57,438
This made Dorothy so very angry...

1019
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,767
that she picked up the bucket
of water that stood near...

1020
01:12:59,802 --> 01:13:02,472
and dashed it all over
the wicked witch.

1021
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:05,892
And then the wicked witch said...

1022
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:08,390
"I'm melting! I'm melting!"

1023
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:13,811
There's suddenly lots
of flashing lights.

1024
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:16,730
With old-fashioned kiddie music.

1025
01:13:18,954 --> 01:13:20,911
And then I hear a big crowd.

1026
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:26,537
And then there's the sound of water,
gushing water.

1027
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:31,670
Bye, Nell.

1028
01:13:31,705 --> 01:13:33,334
Bye, Stormy.

1029
01:13:35,638 --> 01:13:37,515
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry!

1030
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:39,057
Move, move. Excuse me!

1031
01:14:27,442 --> 01:14:30,147
A gun! He's got a gun!

1032
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:26,786
Stormy and I are destined
to be together forever.

1033
01:15:27,631 --> 01:15:31,581
Gypsy Mummy gave us a card that
said so, for a single quarter...

1034
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:34,710
what other couples couldn't
buy at any price.

1035
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,428
No!

1036
01:16:04,336 --> 01:16:06,827
Get out of the way! Get off!

1037
01:17:09,697 --> 01:17:11,155
Hi.

1038
01:17:22,543 --> 01:17:23,872
Odd!

1039
01:17:31,511 --> 01:17:32,840
Odd!

1040
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:35,884
It's not over.

1041
01:17:42,356 --> 01:17:43,684
It's not over.

1042
01:17:44,316 --> 01:17:46,938
It's not over. It's not over.

1043
01:17:49,864 --> 01:17:52,241
Hey Chief. What's with
the guy who shot the dogs?

1044
01:17:52,276 --> 01:17:54,530
His names Kevin Goss.

1045
01:17:54,953 --> 01:17:56,830
One of these days, bang!

1046
01:17:56,865 --> 01:17:57,992
You hear me?

1047
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:22,688
He's got a gun!

1048
01:18:37,623 --> 01:18:39,256
- Is this your truck?
- I need a drill!

1049
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:41,105
Do you have a drill?
I need to get this open!

1050
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,885
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop. Now look!

1051
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,005
You see that woman?
Some maniacs just shot up the mall!

1052
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,299
So either get with me,
get behind me, or get out!

1053
01:18:47,334 --> 01:18:48,877
I got a grinder!

1054
01:19:00,563 --> 01:19:03,055
Oh, my God.

1055
01:19:19,125 --> 01:19:22,044
Everyone get the hell out of here!
Get the hell out!

1056
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:23,159
Now!

1057
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:11,543
Hey!

1058
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,864
Shit!

1059
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:46,293
You really set yourself up, asshole!

1060
01:21:25,508 --> 01:21:28,213
It's cold in the desert.

1061
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:17,854
I could tell my stuffing
wasn't entirely intact.

1062
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:19,780
He's awake. He's awake!

1063
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:22,650
But it was nothing
they couldn't stitch back together.

1064
01:22:29,533 --> 01:22:32,245
Karla told me that the chief
had come through just fine...

1065
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,921
and somehow managed
to spin Fungus Bob's corpse...

1066
01:22:34,956 --> 01:22:38,574
into a bizarre cover story
that kept my secret a secret.

1067
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:45,766
An FBI expert
on television said that

1068
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:48,720
if you hadn't gotten
those explosives out of there,

1069
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,605
at least 500 or 600 people
would've died, for sure.

1070
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:55,590
They told me events at the Green Moon
Mall had made headlines everywhere.

1071
01:22:56,645 --> 01:22:59,137
But I didn't want to read
or see anything about it.

1072
01:23:00,816 --> 01:23:01,699
According to Eckles...

1073
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:04,925
he and Varner started a satanic
cult when they were teenagers.

1074
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,116
One night, they killed a man
and realized they enjoyed it.

1075
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:09,416
So they kept at it,

1076
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:12,368
eventually joining
the police force for better cover.

1077
01:23:13,413 --> 01:23:16,600
They met Robertson and Goss
and came up with a plan...

1078
01:23:16,635 --> 01:23:19,787
to infiltrate a small town
and then slowly kill it.

1079
01:23:31,265 --> 01:23:32,690
Odd! Odd! Odd!

1080
01:23:32,725 --> 01:23:35,216
DetaiI, present arms.

1081
01:23:36,062 --> 01:23:36,944
ODD SAVES

1082
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:38,147
MARRY ME ODD!
ODD WORLD

1083
01:23:38,182 --> 01:23:40,306
IN ODD WE TRUST

1084
01:24:01,088 --> 01:24:02,096
When I'm with you,

1085
01:24:02,131 --> 01:24:05,880
I don't have to worry about
pancakes or poltergeists.

1086
01:24:06,928 --> 01:24:10,261
When I'm with you,
I'm with my destiny.

1087
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:14,717
Where you live, I flourish.

1088
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:22,224
We ate food that wasn't healthy.

1089
01:24:24,947 --> 01:24:27,438
We drank too much...

1090
01:24:29,118 --> 01:24:30,778
and slept too much...

1091
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:40,087
but could never kiss enough.

1092
01:24:40,797 --> 01:24:43,632
Everything was just as I wished.

1093
01:24:48,096 --> 01:24:52,260
- Yeah?
- Odd, it's us. Open up.

1094
01:24:53,852 --> 01:24:56,188
- Hey, guys.
- We have been calling you, Oddie.

1095
01:24:56,223 --> 01:24:58,489
I know. You know,
I disconnected the phone...

1096
01:24:58,524 --> 01:25:00,818
because the reporters won't
leave me and Stormy alone.

1097
01:25:00,853 --> 01:25:02,609
- Son.
- Do you want some-

1098
01:25:05,114 --> 01:25:07,404
You've been here long enough.

1099
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,694
We think it's time to stop.

1100
01:25:10,203 --> 01:25:15,114
Sweetheart, the coroner finally
released her poor body.

1101
01:25:32,518 --> 01:25:34,309
A part of me knew...

1102
01:25:34,937 --> 01:25:38,472
from the moment I saw her
behind the ice cream counter.

1103
01:25:39,192 --> 01:25:42,027
But the truth hurt
too much to accept.

1104
01:25:43,154 --> 01:25:46,488
Her death would have been
one wound too many that day.

1105
01:25:47,659 --> 01:25:51,194
And I think I would have
let go of this life.

1106
01:26:03,092 --> 01:26:05,049
She's here, isn't she?

1107
01:26:12,268 --> 01:26:13,928
You got to let her go.

1108
01:26:15,188 --> 01:26:18,105
She deserves to move
to her next life.

1109
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:20,687
Son...

1110
01:26:22,696 --> 01:26:24,238
it's just time.

1111
01:27:20,882 --> 01:27:22,341
I love you.

1112
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:29,092
I promise I will see you again.
Okay?

1113
01:28:37,838 --> 01:28:42,397
YOU ARE NOW LEAVING PICO MUNDO
COME BACK AGAIN SOON

1114
01:28:49,392 --> 01:28:52,437
Stormy always believed that life
is not about how fast you run...

1115
01:28:52,472 --> 01:28:54,595
or with what degree of grace.

1116
01:28:55,148 --> 01:28:57,198
That this life is a boot camp,

1117
01:28:57,233 --> 01:28:59,776
that we must persevere
through all the obstacles

1118
01:28:59,811 --> 01:29:02,320
and hardships to earn our way
into the next life.

1119
01:29:03,365 --> 01:29:06,615
To be with her again, I will have
the perseverance of a bulldog.

1120
01:29:08,078 --> 01:29:11,198
But sometimes, it seems to me...

1121
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:15,161
the training
is unnecessarily painfuI.

1122
01:29:22,468 --> 01:29:24,519
If I live an average life-span...

1123
01:29:24,554 --> 01:29:27,888
I'll have another 60 years
before I see Stormy again.

1124
01:29:28,391 --> 01:29:30,183
That will be a long wait.

1125
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:34,228
But I am a patient man.

1126
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:38,939
And I have much to do.

1127
01:29:40,048 --> 01:29:45,604
