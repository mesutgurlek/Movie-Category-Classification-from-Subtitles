1
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,800
Jessie,
you get in this house right now!

2
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,400
Oh, Mom.

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,300
Right now.

4
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,200
No!

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
Who are you?

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,600
Well, I'm Mrs Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christys'.

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,000
No. They're all dead.
They're all dead.

8
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,600
I'll go look.

9
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,300
Don't leave me. He'll kill you, too.

10
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,500
I'm not afraid.

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,100
No!

12
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,100
Did you know that a boy drowned

13
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,100
the year before
those two others were killed?

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,900
The counsellors
weren't paying any attention.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They were making love
while that young boy drowned.

16
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,900
His name was Jason.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,500
I was working the day
that it happened. Preparing meals.

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Here. I was the cook.

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,800
Jason should have been watched
every minute!

20
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,200
He was...

21
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,200
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

22
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,600
We can go now, dear.

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
No!

24
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,900
My sweet, innocent Jason.

25
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,400
My only child.

26
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,100
Jason.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,900
You let him drown.
You never paid any attention!

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,100
Look at what you did to him.

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,600
Look what you did to him!

30
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,900
No!

31
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,800
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

32
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,500
She can't hide. No place to hide.

33
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Get her, Mommy.

34
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
Kill her.

35
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
No!

36
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,800
My men pulled you out of the lake.
We thought you were dead, too.

37
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,800
Do you remember very much?

38
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,600
The boy. Is he dead, too?

39
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,400
- Who?
- The boy. Jason.

40
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,100
- Jason?
- In the lake.

41
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,900
The one who attacked me
and pulled me under the water.

42
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,300
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

43
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,100
Then he's still there.

44
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
God!

45
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,100
Hello?

46
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,400
Hi, Mom.

47
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,300
I know. I'm sorry.

48
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,700
I meant to call earlier,
but I fell asleep.

49
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,200
Really, I'm fine.

50
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,100
I need a little time alone,
that's all.

51
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,200
I know you and Dad worry,
and I appreciate that.

52
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,700
Come on, Mom,
we've been through all this before.

53
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,800
I have to put my life back together,
and this is the only way I know how.

54
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,900
Look...

55
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,100
Mom, please. It's late,
and I don't want to get into it.

56
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

57
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
Mom!

58
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,100
Hello?

59
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Cute.

60
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,000
You want something to eat?

61
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,000
Keep your eyes peeled.
I think we're getting close.

62
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,000
There's the gas station.

63
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,600
OK, let's call Ted.

64
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,600
Hey, Teddy, buddy!

65
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,700
We just rolled in.
Yeah, Sandra's here.

66
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,300
Hi, Ted!

67
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
You gonna come get us or what?

68
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, OK. Give me the directions.

69
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,500
Here, wait. Alright.
OK, go ahead, I'm writing.

70
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,900
Alright, Old North Road,
and then look for a Dairy Queen?

71
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
OK. And then over...

72
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,500
I told the others.

73
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,100
They didn't believe me.

74
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
You're all doomed.

75
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
What? No, nothing, no.

76
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,800
No, go ahead.

77
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,500
Alright. So... covered bridge.

78
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,700
OK. Then what?

79
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,400
Alright, then past an old cemetery.

80
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
And then...

81
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,100
left down an old dirt road
for half a mile.

82
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,900
Oh, my God! They're towing us!

83
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,700
Shit! I'll call you back.

84
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,700
- Wait!
- Mister!

85
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,800
This is my truck! Come on!

86
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,200
Asshole!

87
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,000
Shit!

88
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,300
Welcome to God's country.

89
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,700
You ratshit!

90
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,500
Thanks, Max!

91
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,700
Max owns the gas station.
He's crazy, too.

92
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,000
I should have known.

93
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,900
It's great to see you.
It'll be like old times.

94
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,500
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

95
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,200
Help me load my gear.

96
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,600
So, Ted, what's the scoop?

97
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,800
I know that guy Paul
that's running the course. He's OK.

98
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,100
He's kind of macho, though.
Takes the whole thing seriously.

99
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,000
Senior Camp Counsellor Course.

100
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,300
We'll probably get
a Brownie badge if we survive.

101
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,600
If we survive?

102
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,200
That's right.
You're second assistant.

103
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,800
Oh, no!

104
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Wait, listen.

105
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,500
There's a bear and a rabbit
in the woods taking a dump.

106
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,900
"The bear says to the rabbit,
""Does shit stick to your fur?"""

107
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,100
"The rabbit says, ""No, Mr Bear."""

108
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,100
So the bear wiped his ass
with the rabbit.

109
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
What is that?

110
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,200
- Where'd this sucker come from?
- I don't know. Let's move it.

111
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
This place is spooky.

112
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,700
- Somebody dragged it here.
- But what for?

113
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,400
You guys, look at this.

114
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,000
Camp Blood.

115
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,400
- It's on the same lake as we're on.
- Camp Blood?

116
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,000
- Let's go.
- Can't we take a look?

117
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,200
- No way.
- What's the problem?

118
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,700
You don't want to know.
Not before lunch.

119
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,300
Need some help?

120
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,600
No, it's OK. I got it.
Thanks, anyhow.

121
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
OK, let's settle down.

122
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,200
Welcome
to our Counsellor Training Centre.

123
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,600
You've all worked as counsellors
at one camp or another.

124
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Terry, Vickie,
you were upstate last summer.

125
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,900
Scott! Good to see you here.
You need it.

126
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,900
Mark, we worked
a season or two together, right?

127
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,600
OK. The rest of you
I'll get to know soon.

128
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,200
There's one thing
I don't have to tell you.

129
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,700
Being a counsellor isn't
the gravy job everybody thinks it is.

130
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,100
What we'll do
over the next two weeks,

131
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,600
if the rest of my staff shows up,
is go back to basics.

132
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,500
Survival, first aid, boating,
archery, rifle range, all of it.

133
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,000
What the hell...?

134
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,700
I'll be right back.

135
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,500
Hi! I'm late.

136
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,800
What is this crap, Ginny?
You're my assistant.

137
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,400
- Everyone else got here hours ago.
- I said I was sorry.

138
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,100
You did?

139
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm sorry. OK?

140
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,600
- My car's sick.
- You could have called.

141
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,200
Paul, I tried,
but your phones aren't working yet.

142
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,800
OK, get your gear stowed
and help me outside.

143
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,800
Paul, look,
the course starts today, right?

144
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
Well, here I am.

145
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,400
And I promise you,
I'll never ever be late again

146
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,200
in my entire life. Is it a deal?

147
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,000
Alright. What the hell!

148
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,000
Ginny,
I was starting to worry about you.

149
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
Bullshit, Paul.

150
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,500
Ginny, put your car on the lot, OK?

151
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,500
This place is starting to look like
a Burger King. Where was I?

152
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,500
"You were about to give your ""Let's
keep our shit together"" speech."

153
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,400
Mr Holt.

154
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Right, Ted. Right.

155
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,600
OK, a few words about safety.

156
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,600
Axes, knives, lanterns, saws.
They can all be trouble.

157
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,700
Their misuse
is the main cause of camp accidents.

158
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,700
Take care of your equipment
and it'll take care of you.

159
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,600
A word of caution
about our friends in the forest.

160
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,200
Among other things,
this is bear country.

161
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,400
Contrary to what everyone hears,
bears are dangerous.

162
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,400
That means no food fights.

163
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,900
Change often.
Food odours cling to clothing.

164
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,000
If you're a woman, don't use perfume.

165
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,400
Keep clean
during your menstrual cycle.

166
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,700
Having trouble? You got to
treat 'em gentle. Just like kids.

167
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,600
Use that child psychology
you're majoring in.

168
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,300
Try it.

169
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,900
It's more fun
using that child psychology on you.

170
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,800
You're such a sucker for it.

171
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,600
I don't want to scare anyone.

172
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,200
But I'm gonna give it to you straight
about Jason.

173
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,500
His body was never recovered
from the lake after he drowned.

174
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,200
The old-timers in town
will tell you he's still out there,

175
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,400
some sort of demented creature,
surviving in the wilderness.

176
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
Full grown by now.

177
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,000
Stalking...

178
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,400
...stealing what he needs, living off
wild animals and vegetation.

179
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,000
Some folks claim
they've seen him, right in this area.

180
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,600
The girl who survived that night at
Camp Blood, that Friday the 13th...

181
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
...she claims she saw him.

182
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,000
She disappeared two months later.

183
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
Vanished.

184
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,400
Blood was everywhere.

185
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,600
No-one knows what happened to her.

186
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,900
Legend has it that Jason saw
his mother beheaded that night,

187
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,200
and he took his revenge.

188
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,400
A revenge he'll continue to seek if
anyone enters his wilderness again.

189
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,400
By now, I guess you all know
we're the first to return here.

190
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,500
Five years...
five long years he's been dormant.

191
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,800
And he's hungry.

192
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
Jason's out there...

193
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,300
...watching.

194
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,900
Always on the prowl for intruders.

195
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,800
Waiting to kill.

196
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Waiting to devour.

197
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Thirsty for young blood.

198
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,100
Hey, come back!

199
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,000
Now we've got that out of our system,

200
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,400
I don't want to hear
any more about it.

201
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,300
It's ancient history. Jason drowned,
Mrs Voorhees was killed,

202
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,500
and Camp Crystal Lake is off limits.
You got it?

203
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,100
Got you, huh? What d'you think?

204
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,500
The second act needs work.

205
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,500
- Too bad.
- C'mon.

206
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
You got him. You got him now.

207
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,000
Go on.

208
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,000
- That's luck, right?
- Thanks a lot.

209
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,600
Next.

210
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,700
- Hi, Terry. Do you wanna dance?
- No, thank you.

211
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,200
Hi. How about you?
Do you wanna dance?

212
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,600
So there I was, sitting in this
fast-food joint, thinking to myself,

213
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,700
Scott, old boy, what are you going
to do with the rest of your life?

214
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,700
I'm striking out all over the place.

215
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,200
Well, I think I've got you. Check.

216
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,600
Wrong, white man.

217
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,700
Checkmate.

218
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,500
Well, what next?

219
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,700
I could get my arm broken by Mark,

220
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,200
my brains
ponged by our electronical wizard...

221
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,500
...or bed.

222
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,900
Good night, Paul.
See you in the morning.

223
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,100
I just gotta see that place.

224
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,300
- What place?
- That camp. Camp Blood.

225
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,500
You're crazy.

226
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,700
Maybe there is something
in that legend.

227
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,400
- I'm serious.
- No way. I'm not going there.

228
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,100
- Besides, Paul said it's off limits.
- We'll see.

229
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,600
Hello?

230
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,100
Who's there?

231
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,200
- Paul, goddamn it!
- Hey, calm down.

232
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,200
You'll wake the natives.

233
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,100
I'm not supposed to be
fraternising with the staff.

234
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
I won't tell.

235
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,800
I missed you, Ginny.

236
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,900
I was worried
when you didn't show on time.

237
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,800
Paul, there's something
I think I should tell you.

238
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,100
BEWARE OF BEARS

239
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,200
Hey, come on!

240
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,200
What's the matter, guys?
Jeff, the women are showing you up.

241
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,200
We've got about half a mile,
then we'll have lunch.

242
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,200
Try to stay on this trail,
because there's poison ivy here.

243
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,300
- How far are we from camp?
- You're gonna trip on that.

244
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,200
After lunch
we're gonna do some more running.

245
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,200
- Here you go, Ted.
- Thank you, dear.

246
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,600
- Come and get 'em!
- I'm here.

247
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,900
Muffin? Here, girl.

248
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,700
Terry, lunch.

249
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,600
OK. I'm coming.

250
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,200
Jeff, are you ready?

251
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,400
- For what?
- Camp Blood.

252
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,200
- We're not supposed to go there.
- They'll never know we're gone.

253
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,400
Jeff, I'm serious.
I really wanna see it.

254
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,500
When we get back to the city,
we can tell everyone we were there.

255
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh, come on, you chickenshit.

256
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,100
OK, let's go.

257
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,000
OK, you guys. I got one. Ready?

258
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,500
What's green and red,
and moves at 100 miles an hour?

259
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,800
- What?
- A frog in a blender.

260
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,000
Ha-ha. That wasn't funny.

261
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,600
- What's brown and sits on a piano?
- Your face.

262
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,800
Beethoven's last movement.

263
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,300
God!

264
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,800
This must be it.

265
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,200
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

266
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,200
Looks like a dog.

267
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,600
- It's too mangled to tell.
- What did it?

268
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,000
Wild animal, I guess.

269
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,000
What are you kids doing out here?

270
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Keep your people away from
that place, Holt. It's condemned.

271
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,900
Next time I catch anybody,
I'll run 'em in.

272
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,500
- He said...
- I'll handle this.

273
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,200
- Might get a warrant against you.
- Really?

274
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,300
Look, Holt... people say what you're
doing with these kids is great.

275
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,500
You've got a good reputation.

276
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,000
But if I was you,
I'd have located in the next county.

277
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,900
You're too close.

278
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,900
It's been quiet for five years.
That's how we want it.

279
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,100
So do I, Officer.

280
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,200
You two, take off.
We'll talk at dinner.

281
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,900
- We'll never do it again, sir.
- Thanks, Mr Holt.

282
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,900
You're not even
going to reprimand them?

283
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,800
No punishment?
What kind of place is this?

284
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,500
- Ginny?
- Yes, Paul?

285
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,800
No seconds on dessert
for Jeff and Sandra tonight.

286
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,300
You OK?

287
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,800
Shall we tell Terry
about what we saw?

288
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,900
No way. As far as I'm concerned,
we didn't see a thing.

289
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,300
Hey, you!

290
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,500
Oh, my God!

291
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Who made this shit?

292
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,200
OK, people.

293
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,600
Today was fun and games.

294
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,300
I like to start you out slow.
Tomorrow, we'll get serious.

295
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,000
Anybody wants a last night
on the town, now's your chance.

296
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,500
Who else? We only have two cars.

297
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,700
Our wanderers
have volunteered to watch the camp.

298
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,700
Isn't that nice of them?

299
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,800
I'll stay, too. Muffin may show.

300
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,400
Well, I'm gonna go change.

301
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,800
I'm pretty tired.
I think I'll stick around, too.

302
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,400
- Would you get me a coffee?
- Don't drink too much.

303
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,500
Hey, you staying?

304
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,500
Yeah. Nothing spoils a party
like a drunk in a wheelchair.

305
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,900
That's crap.
We can go together if you want.

306
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,500
I appreciate that,
but I'm in... training.

307
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,400
- Then I'm staying, too.
- Suit yourself.

308
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,400
- How about it? You coming?
- You buying?

309
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,600
- Sure.
- You got a deal.

310
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,200
Can I have the keys?

311
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,700
Beer time!

312
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,400
Take it easy. Have fun.
I'll have a Jack for you.

313
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,400
- See you later.
- Bring back my truck in one piece.

314
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,000
- I'm going for a walk.
- We'll wait up for you.

315
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,000
Go, Scooter.

316
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,600
Now I know
how you afford grad school.

317
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,100
You always find some fool
to fix your car and buy you a beer.

318
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,000
You got it.

319
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,200
Muffin?

320
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
- Here we are!
- Alright.

321
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,200
Everybody, get some beers! Alright!

322
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,900
C'mon, Mark.

323
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,800
You're gonna lose. Alright.

324
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,800
Cheater.
OK. Two out of three.

325
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,000
Jeff... don't wear yourself out.

326
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,600
You wanna wrestle, come with me.

327
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,600
Later, Scooter.

328
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,300
Wanna take me on?

329
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,300
Sure. Have a seat.

330
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,200
- I only want your fingers.
- What?

331
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,400
Take your pick.

332
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,300
They're Ted's. It's OK with him.

333
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Football and hockey.

334
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,100
Which one do you prefer?

335
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,100
The one with the puck.

336
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,800
- You mean hockey?
- Is that what you call it?

337
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,700
OK. What d'you wanna play for?

338
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,100
Position.

339
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,400
Looking for something?

340
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:50,000
- Come and get it.
- Give me my shirt, Scott.

341
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,500
If I get my hands on you...!

342
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,500
Scott!

343
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,400
It's no longer funny, Scott.

344
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,200
Help! Goddamn that Paul.
Him and his wilderness bullshit.

345
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,400
- What can I do?
- Get me down.

346
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,500
- I'll have to get a knife.
- Well, hurry, OK?

347
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,700
I ought to let you hang, you pervert.

348
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,500
C'mon, Ter. Give me a break.

349
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,500
- You gonna cut the crap?
- Anything. I promise.

350
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,300
OK.

351
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,900
Don't go anywhere.

352
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,600
Very funny!

353
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,100
Where is she?

354
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,900
Scott, I'm gonna cut you down.

355
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,200
But if you ever do this to me again,
I'm gonna kill you.

356
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,800
Scott?

357
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,800
Look at this.

358
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,900
I think I'm in love.

359
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,400
No, it's just tremendous affection.

360
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,500
Are you sure
you don't want me to clear those?

361
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,000
No, I'm collecting these.

362
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,000
Have it your way. I just don't want
the bar to fall down on you.

363
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,500
Thanks.

364
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,500
- I think she likes you.
- I think so, too.

365
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,600
This whole thing's ridiculous.

366
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,600
Two of our kids got hauled in today
because five years ago,

367
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,800
some girl panics and falls out
of a canoe. It's absurd.

368
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,400
- What if there is a Jason?
- Bullshit, Ginny.

369
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,800
No, what if there is a boy-beast
running around Camp Crystal Lake?

370
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,700
Try to think beyond the legend.
Put it in real terms.

371
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,700
What would he be like today?

372
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,700
Some kind of
out-of-control psychopath?

373
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,700
A frightened retard?
A child trapped in a man's body?

374
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,300
Let me out!

375
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:11,200
- He'd be grown by now, right?
- Right.

376
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,000
The only person
that ever knew him was his mother.

377
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,000
He never went to school,
so he had no friends.

378
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,800
She was everything to him.

379
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,200
Yeah. Deranged killer.

380
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,100
No. You're missing my whole point.

381
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,700
I doubt Jason would have even known
the meaning of death.

382
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,100
At least until that horrible night.

383
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,200
He must've seen
the whole thing happen.

384
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,600
He must've seen his mother get
killed, all because she loved him.

385
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,300
Isn't that what her revenge
was all about?

386
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,700
Her sense of loss, her rage
at what she thought happened,

387
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,800
her love for him?

388
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,800
Bizarre, isn't it?

389
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:03,700
He must be out there now, crying
for her return, her resurrection.

390
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,300
- What d'you think?
- I think you're drunk.

391
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,400
I'll drink to that.
Hit us again, sweetheart.

392
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,200
Not me.

393
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,200
Paul, I'm really serious
about this stuff.

394
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,600
Jason's a legend, Ginny.

395
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,800
Your turn. Three goals,
or you're gonna lose.

396
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,100
I've heard that one before.

397
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,000
Mark, what happened
that you have to be in a chair?

398
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,300
Motorcycle accident
paralysed my legs.

399
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,100
Is it permanent?

400
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,400
The doctor thinks so. I don't.

401
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,500
I don't intend to be in this thing
the rest of my life.

402
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,900
Just your legs, huh?
Is everything else OK?

403
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,800
Oh, I do alright, one way or another.

404
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,700
Toke?

405
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,500
I'm in training, remember?

406
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,400
For what?

407
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,500
What does the winner get?

408
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,700
- What does the winner want?
- Guess.

409
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,400
Want to stay together tonight?

410
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,600
I was just about to ask you.

411
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,900
My cabin or yours?

412
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,600
Ted's in mine.
I don't think that would work out.

413
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,200
We've got the whole camp.
We'll find our own cabin.

414
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,800
Just let me get some things, OK?

415
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,700
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

416
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,700
Oh, damn it.

417
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,700
Terry, you turkey.

418
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,300
There you are.

419
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,900
Vickie?

420
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,500
Vickie, is that you?

421
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,700
Vickie?

422
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
- I gotta sleep.
- I'm tired.

423
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:01,100
- You quitting already?
- You'd have me out till breakfast.

424
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,000
- I'll ride with you, OK? Night, Ted.
- Night, Ginny.

425
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,200
When this place closes,
come straight back to camp.

426
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,300
- Yes, boss.
- And let Maggie drive.

427
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,800
Yes, boss.

428
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,700
OK, let's make a run for it.

429
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,800
- Move it!
- I'm going!

430
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,800
This thing'd better start.

431
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,900
- You fixed it.
- That's what worries me.

432
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,900
Are there any after-hours places
around here?

433
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Sure are.

434
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,100
Sure are.

435
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,900
Mark?

436
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,700
Mark, where are you?

437
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,400
Is anybody still here?

438
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,800
Sandra?

439
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,900
Jeff?

440
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,700
No!

441
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,200
No!

442
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,500
Nice night!

443
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,700
Yeah, for a duck.

444
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,600
God.

445
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,300
What the hell
are all the lights on for?

446
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,600
They wouldn't have
left the place like this.

447
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,200
Think something's wrong?

448
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,000
I'll check upstairs.

449
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,200
These kids
smoke better dope than I do.

450
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,800
Paul!

451
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,200
Yeah, Ginny, what?

452
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,700
What is this, a joke?

453
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,800
They wouldn't do anything like this.

454
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,300
Ginny, c'mon.

455
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,200
Wait for me.

456
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,500
Kitchen light's still on.
Must be the main fuse again.

457
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,100
- Paul, what's going on here?
- Nothing.

458
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,500
Where is everybody?

459
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,400
I don't know.

460
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,800
The rain's stopping.
We'll go look for 'em.

461
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,100
Paul, there's someone in this room.

462
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,600
There's someone in this fucking room!

463
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,200
Oh, my God!

464
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,300
Paul?

465
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,300
Answer me!

466
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,500
Keys.

467
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,900
Come on!

468
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,100
Please start.

469
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,600
Oh, shit!

470
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,100
Oh, my God!

471
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,400
Oh, my God!

472
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,400
Please help me.

473
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,000
Oh, God...

474
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,000
Jason! It's all done, Jason.

475
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,800
You've done yourjob well,
and Mommy is pleased.

476
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,200
That's a good boy.

477
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:06,400
Now, come to Mommy. Come on.

478
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,400
Come on.

479
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:16,500
Mommy has a reward for you.

480
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,800
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

481
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,900
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

482
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,300
Come on.

483

You're OK, Ginny.
