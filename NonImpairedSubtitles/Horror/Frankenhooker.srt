1
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,016
Just watch my hand.

2
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:19,222
Watch it.
Watch my hand now.

3
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:21,619
Nice and slow.
Back and forth.

4
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:23,556
Watch the hand!

5
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:31,597
Come on. Do something.
Wake up. Let's go!

6
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:33,613
Let's see that peeper.

7
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,087
Be very careful here..

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,525
I'm gonna give it a lobotomy

9
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:02,313
Jesus..
That's it.

10
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:03,599
That's it!
That's right!

11
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,139
Now follow my hand.
Look at the hand.

12
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:06,489
Just follow the hand

13
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:08,108
Come on.
Gotta follow my hand.

14
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:10,410
We're in sync now.
Now we're cookin'

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,907
That's it.

16
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:13,661
That's right.
Look at it.

17
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:16,299
Jeffrey?!

18
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:19,661
Jeffrey?

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,247
Be a doll and pass me the ketchup.

20
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:32,297
Sorry.

21
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,829
Thanks hon.

22
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,607
Mom!

23
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:57,719
Let me help you with that.

24
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:59,674
Oh, no, no.
..Those hamburgers up here.

25
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:01,809
Will you hold your horses Henry?

26
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,738
Let me get started here.

27
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:07,018
By the way,
he's at it again in the kitchen.

28
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,018
Oh dear..

29
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,813
I'll check on him in a minute mom.

30
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,922
Would you?
I'd appreciate that.

31
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:13,343
Coz we can't get too real
to night, you know?

32
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:15,557
By the way,
for your own good.

33
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:17,061
Ease up on the pretzels.

34
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,205
Trouble?

35
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:23,840
Nah, same old thing.

36
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:26,388
Jeffrey's too strange
and I'm too fat.

37
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,024
What happened to your diet?

38
00:02:28,096 --> 00:02:30,270
Oh, heck. I've tried it all
and nothing works.

39
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:31,699
I've tried liquid diet..

40
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,937
Sea food diets..

41
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:34,683
Vegetable diets..

42
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,810
Fruit diets..

43
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:38,294
Pills, powders, weight watchers
and clinics.

44
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,660
I even had Jeffrey staple my stomach
and nothing else.

45
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,264
Jeffrey stapled your stomach?

46
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:47,722
Yeah, but it didn't help much.
I'm still a compulsive eater.

47
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,301
I didn't know Jeffrey was a doctor.

48
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:51,908
Well, yes and no..

49
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,940
I thought he worked
for New Jersey Electric?

50
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:56,179
Oh, he does.
He's.. just...

51
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:58,235
sort of a doctor in his spare time.

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,865
Calls himself a bio-electro-technician.

53
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,277
Whatever that means.

54
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
Well, is he at least
going to Medical School?

55
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:07,749
Goodness no. He's been
kicked out of three of them already.

56
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:10,003
And you let him operate on you?

57
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:13,018
Well, of course. I mean..
We're going to be married.

58
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,846
Hi!

59
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,067
Watcha doin'?

60
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,750
Oh, what's this?

61
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:53,221
I'm not sure.

62
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,087
I can fix it, though.

63
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:57,492
Well not now.
Come on outside with me.

64
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,502
Dad's cooking tons of hamburgers.

65
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:02,145
It's so nice out there.

66
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,822
Good idea. I need this table
to make my Coleslaw.

67
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:22,521
Thanks sweetheart.
Happy birthday Daddy!

68
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,362
You didn't have to.
I've got a surprise for you.

69
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:26,950
Now close your eyes.

70
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,483
And don't open them
until I tell you.

71
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,078
They're closed nice and tight.

72
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,628
I wish she wouldn't have
bought me something, I know it.

73
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,938
Ok now, turn around.
Real slowly.

74
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,745
Ok, Ok.
Stop, stop!

75
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:42,658
Now open 'em!

76
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,118
Ta-dahh.

77
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:50,148
And look..

78
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:54,100
Jeffrey rigged it with this remote control
so you don't even have to push it.

79
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,842
Thanks son.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,476
Come on. This is your day.
I don't want any credit.

81
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:01,540
He's always been creative.

82
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:02,667
What!!

83
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:06,150
And it's so easy
you just turn it on like this.

84
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,492
Don't stand in front of it.

85
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,365
And this controls the speed..

86
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:11,849
And the direction.

87
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:13,953
So when you want it to go..

88
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:15,803
you just press this.

89
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:18,478
You're on your way chuck.
Don't stand in front of it!!

90
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,853
I gotta get 1600 Volts in there..

91
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,928
I gotta tap into there.

92
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:34,190
Tap into the North Power Station.

93
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,547
I'm gonna cause a burnout.

94
00:10:15,135 --> 00:10:18,896
What began as a Birthday-Barbeque
ended in a bizarre tragedy

95
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:20,651
in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey today.

96
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:23,273
It was this Power mower,
that brought a quick end

97
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:26,765
to the life of 21 year old
bride-to-be, Elisabeth Shelley

98
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,278
Like wood through a mulcher,
the girthle fiancee

99
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:31,542
disappeared beneath the blades
of the berserk mower

100
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:35,629
that sent her personality raining down
upon the horrified birthday revelers.

101
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:38,470
In a blaze of blood, bones and body-parts.

102
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:42,201
The vivacious young girl was instantly
reduced to a tossed human salad.

103
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:45,243
A salad that police
are still trying to gather up.

104
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,203
A salad that was once named..
Elisabeth.

105
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:52,635
But death by lawnmower is not the end
of the strange twists in this case.

106
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:55,121
Of course it's hard to be real specific
at this point,

107
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,423
but yes, apparently parts of her
are missing.

108
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,232
Do you know which parts
or how many?

109
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,825
Ehh, like I said, It's hard
to be real specific at this point.

110
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:08,072
She's just one big Jigsaw Puzzle.

111
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,949
Jigsaw Puzzle?

112
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,012
Jigsaw Puzzle.

113
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,074
One of the eye-witnesses
to this terrible tragedy

114
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,352
is also the young victims fiance.

115
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,886
Oh excuse me.
You saw the accident happen?

116
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:26,870
I don't want to talk about it.

117
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,372
...and you have no idea
what happened to the head?

118
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,950
I..I don't know.
I didn't see it.

119
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:34,362
Last time I saw it,
it was spinning through the air.

120
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:35,946
I don't Ehh..

121
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:38,613
Why don't you just
leave people alone when they grieve?

122
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,064
I guess that's it.

123
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:44,058
Because this is such a quiet town

124
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,240
the whispers can be heard all the louder.

125
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:49,864
Whispers that are less concerned with
the tragedy that befell a young woman

126
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:53,084
than with the grizzly souvenirs
collected by a person

127
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:54,830
or persons unknown.

128
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:58,506
In Ho-Ho-Kus, this is Judy Graph
for 8-news alive.

129
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,450
May I?

130
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:20,217
Yeah, sure Ma.

131
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:34,191
You've been watching it again.

132
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:35,716
Can't help it Ma.

133
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:38,112
This is not healthy for you.

134
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:40,175
It's not good for you.

135
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,810
I can't help that either.

136
00:12:42,557 --> 00:12:44,145
I don't know, Jeffrey.

137
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,327
Ehm..You know..
You know that girl at the supermarket

138
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,636
that I told you about?

139
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:51,209
She asked for you again today.

140
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:53,685
Why don't you give her a call?

141
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:55,058
I don't want to.

142
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,946
You don't want to?

143
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:03,224
You know it's not right for you
to spend the rest of your life in here.

144
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:07,505
Elisabeth's dead.
Life goes on.

145
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:10,957
I mean, you've gotta find
yourself another girl.

146
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:14,549
That's what I'm working on, Ma.

147
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,342
Oh, that's what you're working on?

148
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,668
I don't know, Jeffrey.

149
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,544
Well, you don't find someone

150
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,830
by hiding from the rest of the world.

151
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,645
Or keeping yourself
cooped up in here

152
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,879
or in the garage
or in that stupid Power-Plant.

153
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,942
Why don't you go back
to medical school?

154
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:38,135
Medical schools upset me mother.

155
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,900
Now, I really thought that someday

156
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:43,432
you would become a great Doctor

157
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:46,359
and I mean a great Doctor.

158
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:49,414
I mean, I never thought
that you would throw it all away

159
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,875
for some silly fusebox or..

160
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,431
Oh my god..

161
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:57,494
Oh, look..

162
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:01,041
Look!

163
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:03,689
Look!

164
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:06,570
You're working fine now.

165
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:10,878
Oh Jeffrey,
it's looking so much better.

166
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:15,858
What is he?

167
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,413
I'm not sure.

168
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:28,237
Oh Jeffrey.

169
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,617
I'm worried about you.

170
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,839
Yeah well, so am I, Ma.

171
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:41,297
Somethings happening to me
that I just don't understand.

172
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:43,837
I can't think straight anymore.

173
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:50,139
My reasoning is all twisted and distorted,
you know?

174
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:54,670
I seem to be disassociating
myself from reality.

175
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:56,733
More and more.
Each day.

176
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:00,897
I'm anti-social.

177
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:04,850
I'm becoming dangerously amoral.

178
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:10,535
I've lost the ability
to distinguish between right from wrong.

179
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,741
Good from bad.

180
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,340
I'm scared Ma.

181
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:21,247
I mean..I feel like sometimes I'm..
I'm plunging headfirst

182
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:23,778
into some kind of black void

183
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:26,866
of sheer utter madness,
or something.

184
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,529
Do you want a sandwich?

185
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,235
No thanks.

186
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,751
There's a little egg-salad
left in the refrigerator.

187
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:39,172
..I mean really.
It's no trouble.

188
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,960
No, really. I'll get my own dinner
tonight, thank you.

189
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:45,628
Ok, but just Ehh..

190
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:49,349
I don't mean to be a pest
but could you just promise me one thing?

191
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,746
One thing, huh?

192
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:52,921
Ok. What is it?

193
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,952
That you won't stay up all night.

194
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,709
I promise.

195
00:15:58,185 --> 00:15:59,828
Goodnight, sweet boy.

196
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:02,899
Goodnight, Ma.

197
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:01,435
How are you feeling?

198
00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:07,512
Sorry I'm late.

199
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:11,401
I was talking with Ma.

200
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:13,882
You know how she yaps.

201
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,352
Do you feel like having Italian tonight?

202
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,805
You look radiant tonight, Elisabeth.

203
00:18:26,098 --> 00:18:28,424
Those baths are doing you
a world of good.

204
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,098
You've got such a healthy glow, now.

205
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:33,142
You look luminous.

206
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,753
Magnificent.

207
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:35,983
Wonderful.

208
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,982
Here's to you..

209
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,172
To us.

210
00:18:42,617 --> 00:18:43,942
To new beginnings.

211
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,676
Cleanse the pallet now.

212
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:49,493
There we go.
Nice and slow.

213
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:51,041
That's very good.

214
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,237
That's it.

215
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,031
That's it.

216
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,019
Very good.
Nice and easy.

217
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,857
Very nice. Very tidy.
Very neat.

218
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,159
You like that Beaujolais don't you?

219
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:05,292
I got big news honey.

220
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:07,497
And it's the reason for
this celebration tonight.

221
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:08,977
There's a storm headed our way

222
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:11,787
It should be here in about two days
and I want to be ready for it.

223
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:15,700
If everything goes as planned
and it should..

224
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,874
It'll be a whole new look for you.

225
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:21,743
As a matter of fact, it'll be
a whole new you.

226
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:24,842
Let me show you what I mean.

227
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:32,689
Isn't she gorgeous?

228
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,245
Maybe teddy isn't your style, eh?

229
00:19:36,404 --> 00:19:37,086
Okay.

230
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:38,697
What do you think?

231
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,244
Honey-pie, can't you picture
yourself in this body?

232
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,419
Kneeling on Ma's couch
in the basement.

233
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,610
How about the crawling cat, eh?

234
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,769
How 'bout this model?
A visit to the sweet shop?

235
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,973
I can make you into anything you want.

236
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:57,893
I can make you the centerfold
goddess of the century.

237
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,316
I just need the live parts.

238
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,554
But enough excitement.

239
00:20:06,486 --> 00:20:07,748
How about a little dessert?

240
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,185
Something I wrote for you.

241
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:15,058
A poem.

242
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:17,306
Warning!

243
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:19,045
Contents under pressure.

244
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:20,606
By...

245
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,710
Jeffrey Franken.

246
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:26,400
My heart is packed
so full of love for you.

247
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,111
That I dreamed I exploded

248
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:31,850
Like aerosol cans sometimes do.

249
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,008
I blew with such force

250
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,103
that my bones became shrapnel.

251
00:20:36,206 --> 00:20:38,936
And leveled the town
except the small chapel.

252
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:41,477
My teeth flew like bullets.

253
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,540
I didn't know what was happening.

254
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:45,532
They killed everyone in sight.

255
00:20:45,557 --> 00:20:46,937
Except for the Chaplin.

256
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:49,925
And then, thanks to him,
we were happily wed.

257
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:52,342
Even though at the time, I...

258
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,073
think we were both dead.

259
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:56,303
The end.

260
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:01,295
I know it's not the best
poem in the world, but...

261
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:06,535
I want you to have it.

262
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,252
Goodnight Elisabeth.

263
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,195
I 'll Se you tomorrow.

264
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:29,789
It's six hundred volts more

265
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:31,760
or otherwise there's gonna be...

266
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,721
spider veins or I might get stuck
with a chicken leg.

267
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:36,843
No, that's...

268
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,041
How can I have gone too far?
Now I'm nitpicking.

269
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,530
I gotta have more wattage.

270
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:42,157
Otherwise I'm not gonna be happy.

271
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:43,578
I can't...

272
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:45,529
I don't wanna...

273
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,432
I can't.. I cant fell guilty now.

274
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,096
I don't wanna feel guilty now.
I just...

275
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:53,255
I just wanna make life.

276
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,223
I mean, you know.

277
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,464
I just wanna bring you back Elisabeth,
you know.

278
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,523
I mean in order for you to...

279
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,729
to live, I mean, somebody's gotta
take your place, you know?

280
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:03,261
I mean somebody

281
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:05,134
has to die for you to live.

282
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,249
Gettin' a cluster headache.

283
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:24,281
And as you can see
from this lovely map right here

284
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:27,623
we have some very exciting weather
arriving here in about two days.

285
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:31,304
More thunder and lightning and electricity
than you've ever enjoyed before.

286
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,336
Haha, very spooky.
Very spooky.

287
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,880
And just right for you
mad doctors out there:

288
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:43,771
It's great.

289
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,518
Two days.

290
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:47,105
Two days.

291
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,519
I gotta find her fresh parts
in two days.

292
00:22:50,313 --> 00:22:52,391
Ok. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

293
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,042
I just gotta relax.

294
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:56,669
Relax. The key to this whole
thing is relaxation.

295
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:59,032
Relax, Calm down
and relax.

296
00:22:59,516 --> 00:23:00,754
I can't relax.

297
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:04,030
Just gotta get right up from here.

298
00:23:37,345 --> 00:23:38,861
Some people need drugs...

299
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:42,711
Some people need booze...

300
00:23:43,937 --> 00:23:45,945
I just need a little surgical assistance.

301
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:58,506
Five-o-seven?

302
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,253
No, twenty-one, no...

303
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,431
Twenty-two.

304
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:05,088
Goodnight twenty-two.

305
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:15,605
Ok. I gotta get
some...

306
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,336
Stewardesses.
Stewardesses.

307
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:19,994
Take the Van Wyck express way

308
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:21,471
out to Kennedy airport.

309
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:23,859
I'll walk on to the plane.
I've got a maintenance uniform on.

310
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:26,112
Girls! Ahh, there's a screw loose

311
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,495
in the luggage stool.
you gotta follow me and get off the plane.

312
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:29,860
I'll get them in the back of my van.

313
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,408
I'll tie them up
with the extension chords.

314
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,825
It's no good. That's not gonna work.

315
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:41,246
It's ridiculous.

316
00:24:41,872 --> 00:24:43,292
Nobody's gonna believe that.

317
00:24:43,388 --> 00:24:44,895
I don't care how stupid they are.

318
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,647
Ok.

319
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,536
All right, now we try this again.

320
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:50,314
Now we're gonna come up
with something here.

321
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,018
The hole is already bored.

322
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:00,386
That..
That's it.

323
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:02,688
Okay, okay.

324
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:12,773
Why, it's..

325
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:14,527
It's so simple.

326
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,189
If I need female body parts...

327
00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:21,999
Then I'll buy female body parts.

328
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:26,060
And there's a place across the river
where there's thousands of women

329
00:25:26,085 --> 00:25:27,642
Anxious to sell their parts.

330
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:30,258
With no questions asked.

331
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,183
Of course with the right
amount of cash.

332
00:25:34,685 --> 00:25:37,026
I do have my Christmas club account.

333
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,481
Ohh, this is...

334
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,696
Very busy here tonight.

335
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:49,633
This is like a smorgasbord here.

336
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:52,444
What a buffét.

337
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:54,659
Now, these legs are very nice.

338
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:55,988
Yes...

339
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:58,174
This might be easier than I thought.

340
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,968
Oh my god,
now this is..

341
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,684
She's nice.
A little lopsided though.

342
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:04,814
Come on now.

343
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,488
She's not gonna work out.

344
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:08,927
Very nice!

345
00:26:08,952 --> 00:26:10,851
Oh, there is something very interesting.

346
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,421
Ok. This is it.

347
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,279
I think this could be the block.

348
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:15,310
All right.

349
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,707
Ok. This is it.

350
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,000
I've got it now.

351
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:19,853
Now, this is the block.
I'm...

352
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:21,424
Ok.

353
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,408
Ride behind.
Nice and easy now.

354
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:24,863
Ok.

355
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,506
Hey! You looking for some action?

356
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:28,905
Or a date?

357
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,035
Hey you!

358
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,678
Need some company?
Are you lonely?

359
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:35,723
Come on. come on.

360
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,614
Hey! Goin' out?
Want a date?

361
00:26:41,949 --> 00:26:42,877
Some action?

362
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:44,257
Company?
Are you lonely?

363
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:46,355
You look Ehh..
You.. You look great. I...

364
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,416
I'm not used to seeing a...

365
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,011
You're a Jersey Boy.
Aint 'ya?

366
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:53,130
Yeah, Jersey.
Right over the bridge.

367
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:54,385
Ehm.. to the left.

368
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:56,338
Well, you just take
a couple of deep breaths.

369
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:57,886
And relax.

370
00:26:58,155 --> 00:26:59,536
Tell me what you want.

371
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:00,960
Ehm..well..

372
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,634
I'm looking for a couple of girls.

373
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:04,325
Ehm..That have the right..

374
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,610
Nice parts. I..I..

375
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:07,465
I'm looking for a lot of good parts.

376
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,576
Honey..

377
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:10,203
In case you aint noticed..

378
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,419
I not only have all the right parts.

379
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,443
I've got all the right places.

380
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:17,776
Shit, you got 'em all right.

381
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,070
You Ehh..You...

382
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:20,625
You're right. You're right.
You're right.

383
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:21,910
You got money?

384
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,427
Money? Yeah yeah.
I got Ehh...

385
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:24,555
I got..I got some. I...

386
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,577
I went to the bank.

387
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:28,981
Oh! Whoa!
Now you're talking.

388
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,051
Pardon me Jersey Boy.
Hold on. Wait a minute!

389
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:34,281
Wait a minute.
I'm not ready yet.

390
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,823
Well, let me in!
Look at you!

391
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:37,720
Don't wait up.
Not in front of everyone.

392
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,585
Stop it. I'm not ready.
I..I..I'm...

393
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,950
I need a few more girls.

394
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:42,014
How many more?

395
00:27:42,218 --> 00:27:43,496
I don't know.

396
00:27:45,678 --> 00:27:47,202
Yo! Amber.
Come over here!

397
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,416
What's all the fuzz?

398
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,551
Jersey Boy here
needs twosomes.

399
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,488
No no no no.

400
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:09,925
Jersey Boy doesn't want that.

401
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:10,821
Ehh...

402
00:28:10,996 --> 00:28:11,774
Ahh...

403
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,767
I wanna..throw a party.

404
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,663
For my brother.
He's sick. Ehh...

405
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,730
I..I'm gonna need about Ehh...
Six or seven

406
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:20,088
Of the most beautiful girls
you've got on this block

407
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,412
Yourselves included.

408
00:28:22,062 --> 00:28:25,247
See, I wanna..I wanna
have sort of like a beauty contest for him.

409
00:28:25,605 --> 00:28:27,780
Oh! And you get the winner.
Right?

410
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:29,634
Well, Ehm..

411
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:31,173
I'll make a new woman of her.

412
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,545
It'll cost ya.

413
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:33,870
Oh, money...

414
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:35,234
Money is not a problem.

415
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,371
I got money.

416
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,744
Well lover. We can get you
all the girls you need.

417
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,137
You better check it out
with Zorro first.

418
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:42,277
Zorro?

419
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,364
Zorro.

420
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:44,605
Zorro.

421
00:29:11,953 --> 00:29:13,271
I don't want any trouble.

422
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,431
Hey Spark.

423
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:20,161
Hi honey!
What can I do for You?

424
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:21,518
Where's Zorro?

425
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,031
He went to the back a while ago.

426
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:24,261
I aint seen him since.

427
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:25,087
Thanks.

428
00:29:26,381 --> 00:29:28,515
This suck.
You need to go to the men's room.

429
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:32,770
I don't have to go.

430
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,334
I left my money in the bar.

431
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:48,926
Coming through.

432
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,861
I'm all right. I'm her Doctor.
Gotta get back there somehow.

433
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:52,949
How are you?

434
00:29:55,254 --> 00:29:56,333
First time here.

435
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,853
I gotta go underneath here or..?

436
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,613
...and he says "how come you
don't do business with me?".

437
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:38,628
..And I've got the power of almighty hell!

438
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,290
Wait here a sec.

439
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:23,978
Here, Jersey Boy.

440
00:31:25,194 --> 00:31:26,194
How do you do?

441
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,875
Zorro here will fix you up.

442
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,509
Get you everything you need.

443
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:34,958
See you later guys.

444
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:36,689
The Last diet.

445
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:39,928
Yeah, seems like there's a lotta
folks on it at these parts.

446
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:42,430
Abby tells me you're holding a party.
Need a lot of girls.

447
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:43,874
Yeah, yeah.
Tomorrow night.

448
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:54,145
My girls are the best.

449
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,272
The best to look at.
The best for fun.

450
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:58,407
A few minutes may cost
you a thousand dollars.

451
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:00,760
You want the best,
you gotta pay.

452
00:32:01,037 --> 00:32:03,585
Well, you know,
I'm sure we can agree on a price.

453
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:05,354
Yeah, let's talk business, my friend

454
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,557
By the way, Ehh...

455
00:32:10,017 --> 00:32:12,063
How much does one of those
little plastic bags cost?

456
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:17,215
One of these?

457
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:23,017
Yeah.

458
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,961
What? Are you crazy?

459
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,255
What the hell
are <i>you</i> talking about?

460
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,668
I am talking about women
controlled by drugs.

461
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,064
And dying from them.

462
00:32:31,144 --> 00:32:32,969
I'm talking about women
selling their bodies

463
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,200
because they no longer
have any other choice.

464
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:37,302
I am talking about human beings

465
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:38,706
who need protection.

466
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,418
And you honestly believe
that legalizing prostitution

467
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,396
is gonna somehow magically
make all of these problems

468
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,531
disappear!
Well, it's a start.

469
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:48,071
Alright. What's next?

470
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:49,777
Let the government issue them condoms?

471
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:53,356
Let the taxpayers pay for the hotels.

472
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,675
Don't laugh.

473
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:56,533
Don't laugh.
She's right.

474
00:32:56,612 --> 00:32:57,874
She's right.

475
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:00,617
This crack shit's killin' em!

476
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:09,507
This supercrack will get
the job done a lot quicker.

477
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:12,174
And without any pain.

478
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,360
Of course it may get a bit hot.

479
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,377
The name of your organization
is H.O.O.K.E.R, isn't it?

480
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:22,172
It's called: Hold on to our knowledge
of equal rights.

481
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:24,139
And if you run that film

482
00:33:24,164 --> 00:33:26,402
you'll get a hint of what it's
like on the streets

483
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:27,576
for these women.

484
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,256
Throw it Lou.

485
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:30,817
Where's the money?

486
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:32,055
Where's the money, bitch?!

487
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,158
Where is it, huh?

488
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:34,481
Where's the money?

489
00:33:34,698 --> 00:33:36,079
Where's my money? Huh?

490
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,238
Where is it, huh?!

491
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,222
Where is it, huh?!

492
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,301
Where is it?!

493
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:44,102
Where's the money?!

494
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,004
Jeffrey!!

495
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,749
All right.
Take it easy now.

496
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:00,416
Don't flip out. Don't flip out.
Just relax.

497
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:01,382
You gotta do the drill.

498
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,406
You do the drill
and you're gonna feel much better now.

499
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:04,780
Reverse. It's on reverse.

500
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:33,698
I mean, it's not like
I'm committing murder.

501
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,889
I'm not killing anybody.

502
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:38,834
The crack is what's gonna kill 'em.

503
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,374
Hell, it's killing them already.

504
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:44,453
I'm just speeding up
the process, that's all.

505
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,882
I'm not.. I'm not shooting anyone.
I'm not stabbing anyone.

506
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:53,842
I'm merely gonna place a lethal form
of crack in their presence.

507
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:55,627
They don't have to take it.

508
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:58,159
Nobody has a gun to their head.

509
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:00,889
If they don't wanna do it, they can...

510
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:02,234
just say no.

511
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:10,760
The super crack is placed

512
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:13,468
on the pre-heated hot-plate.

513
00:35:14,694 --> 00:35:16,678
Tube into cage.

514
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,249
Now we begin.

515
00:35:22,044 --> 00:35:24,354
Now we have a nice cloud.

516
00:35:24,671 --> 00:35:26,028
Nice indeed.

517
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,258
Now, that's right.

518
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,638
Look how sexy you are.

519
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:34,694
I bet you get a thousand dollars a night.

520
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:36,502
Can I buy you a drink?

521
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:39,035
Is the hotel nearby?

522
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:41,333
Can we get there by walking?

523
00:35:43,362 --> 00:35:46,560
Now, if you want a guinea pig,
I'd jump in that cage myself.

524
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:48,783
Yes, you know the moves.

525
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,599
Those moves
are thousand dollar moves.

526
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:53,639
Now, take a nice..

527
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,020
deep breath!

528
00:35:57,915 --> 00:35:59,740
Holy Jesus Christ.

529
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:03,661
This could get ugly.

530
00:36:18,225 --> 00:36:19,843
Hey!
Jersey Boy.

531
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:34,618
All set?

532
00:36:36,014 --> 00:36:36,890
All set.

533
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:38,439
Ok girls. Listen up.

534
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:40,232
This here is Jersey Boy.

535
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:41,883
<i>Doctor</i> Jersey Boy.

536
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,502
But you can call him Jeffrey.

537
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:44,791
Jeffrey,

538
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:46,085
this is Angel.

539
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,616
Hi.- Krystal.
- Hello.

540
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:49,000
Amber you already met.

541
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:50,088
Nice to see you again.

542
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:51,366
Anise.
- How do you do?

543
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:52,684
Chartreuse.
- Pleasure.

544
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:53,931
Snow.
- Hello

545
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:55,375
Sugar and Monkey.

546
00:36:55,526 --> 00:36:56,462
Now, girls...

547
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:58,399
Zorro told you all about Jeffrey.

548
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,478
It's his party
and he wants to play doctor.

549
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:03,028
Now, if Jeffrey wants
anything more than that

550
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:04,433
you gotta let <i>me</i> know.

551
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:08,060
Because Jeffrey is a
good personal friend of Zorro's.

552
00:37:08,448 --> 00:37:09,996
And he's gettin' a special rate.

553
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,066
Understood?

554
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:12,693
Yes Ma’am!

555
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:15,603
Ok Jeff.
How you wanna work this?

556
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:18,063
Ehh...

557
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:20,444
Well.
Let's start with the...

558
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:22,327
Legs.. Shall we?

559
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:25,287
Ohh, I don't...

560
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:26,557
This is...

561
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,105
Oh, this is...

562
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:29,644
Excellent.

563
00:37:29,927 --> 00:37:32,141
This is a perfect eighteen
in diameter.

564
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,366
Uhu?!

565
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:40,156
Now this is...

566
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:41,872
This is unfortunate.

567
00:37:41,897 --> 00:37:43,467
And so crude.

568
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:46,851
Honey, you aint seen nothing.
Wait til you see the one on my groin.

569
00:37:55,987 --> 00:37:56,939
Awesome.

570
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:00,227
Utterly awesome.

571
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:02,752
Nice buoyancy too.

572
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:06,741
Ahh, gout free.

573
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:08,083
Fine.

574
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:09,670
Wanna take my temperature, Doc?

575
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:11,924
I bet you've got a big thermometer.

576
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:18,599
This lactiferous gland is almost perfect.

577
00:38:18,957 --> 00:38:20,782
They're yours
if you want 'em, Doc.

578
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:23,425
..And divided by Pi...

579
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:26,959
Ok. Hold still.

580
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:30,395
This reminds me of
the Saint Louis arch.

581
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:37,532
Excellent!

582
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,295
Oh, this is fine.

583
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:43,779
Very good!

584
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,588
Oh, very nice.

585
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:48,423
These are good looking.

586
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:49,804
Clean shaven too.

587
00:38:50,885 --> 00:38:52,012
Mmm, nice.

588
00:38:52,907 --> 00:38:55,075
Ahh, now these.

589
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:57,983
Very nice.
I like these very much.

590
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,555
I'm gonna need some more voltage

591
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,515
to get this to work.

592
00:39:12,027 --> 00:39:13,685
Hey Zorro!
What's up?

593
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:15,042
Just waiting for my bitches.

594
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:16,415
They should be down
in a few minutes.

595
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,709
Oh, good!

596
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,758
Jeffrey, we only got a few minutes
before we hit the streets.

597
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:25,965
Have you found
your perfect woman yet?

598
00:39:29,206 --> 00:39:29,881
Look...

599
00:39:29,984 --> 00:39:32,333
Zorro said you're allowed thirty
minutes to get a pick.

600
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,206
But you gotta pick.
The rest of us gotta go.

601
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:42,899
I can't...

602
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:45,219
I can't pick, I...

603
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,315
Look I'm sorry. I...

604
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:49,634
You're all very nice.

605
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:51,634
You've been very nice,
but I can't do it. I...

606
00:39:51,753 --> 00:39:53,142
I can't go through with this.

607
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:56,765
I'm.. I'm not even sure
that this would work.

608
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,788
Oh God, Elisabeth...

609
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:03,462
What the hell is he talking about?
And who the fuck is Elisabeth?!

610
00:40:03,557 --> 00:40:04,518
Are we getting paid?

611
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:05,946
Listen Jersey Boy...

612
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,408
You got the money!

613
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:09,817
Money huh?

614
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:11,619
You talking about money!

615
00:40:11,984 --> 00:40:14,008
I'm talking about human life.

616
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,339
You want money?
Here...

617
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:18,394
Here you go.

618
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:20,108
Take the god damned money.

619
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:23,365
Don't you see what I'm trying to do?

620
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:26,436
What do you thinks been going on here?

621
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:29,348
Yeah, everybody play with the money.
Play with the dirty money.

622
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:31,973
Whoa!

623
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:33,108
Oh shit!

624
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,061
What's this?

625
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:36,255
Holy shit!
It's drugs!

626
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:38,377
It's super drugs!
Holy shit!

627
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:41,727
Wait.. Wait..
Put that back.

628
00:40:41,752 --> 00:40:43,068
That's supposed to be for the winner.

629
00:40:43,283 --> 00:40:44,322
Look at this girls.

630
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:45,830
The party aint over yet.

631
00:40:48,415 --> 00:40:50,066
Give me that.
That's dangerous.

632
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:52,645
Jeffrey, you devil.

633
00:40:58,748 --> 00:40:59,843
Give it to me.

634
00:41:00,295 --> 00:41:01,415
Give it back.
Now!

635
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:03,256
Come on girls.
Let's get 'em.

636
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:04,256
Pull me up.

637
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:05,757
Pull me up, quickly.

638
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:28,667
Don't.. Don't smoke it.

639
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,334
Now listen to me...

640
00:41:45,209 --> 00:41:46,407
Oh, we need some music.
Yeah!

641
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:58,281
Oh no, not the devil's music.

642
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,861
Turn it off.

643
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:01,671
It's no good.
It's a deadly mixture.

644
00:42:01,924 --> 00:42:03,392
Please, it's killing you.

645
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:04,932
Some things you shouldn't be doing.

646
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,089
God, please...

647
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,366
Don't smoke that.

648
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:17,176
I'm telling you.
It's not what you think.

649
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:37,204
Please, there are programs
you can check into.

650
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:39,339
You can get off it.

651
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:09,090
Stop that.
That's not natural.

652
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,019
Wait a minute.
For cryin' out loud.

653
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:12,678
You're like cats with catnip.

654
00:43:12,774 --> 00:43:14,004
Just stop that.

655
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:16,655
Your body wasn't meant
to do that!

656
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:21,989
The poser fuckin' with me.

657
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:26,701
Just gone on too long.

658
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:37,849
Don't do it.

659
00:43:38,128 --> 00:43:39,611
You're gonna die!

660
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:47,049
Whoa!

661
00:43:48,398 --> 00:43:50,184
Oh god!
- She's gonna blow!

662
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:51,444
<i>She gonna blow!!</i>

663
00:43:52,603 --> 00:43:53,746
Duck and cover.

664
00:43:53,771 --> 00:43:55,024
Isn't it awfully hot in here?

665
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:08,943
Take it easy.

666
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,765
Yo! Jeffrey!

667
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:54,582
Move it out!
Open up!

668
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,083
Open up!
Open up!

669
00:44:57,137 --> 00:44:58,638
Open up this god damned door!

670
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:00,305
Amber! Open up!

671
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:02,437
Open the door.
Let me in.

672
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:06,671
Open the door.
I'm gonna knock this door down!

673
00:45:11,036 --> 00:45:12,108
What the fuck!

674
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,362
What the fuck is goin' on
in there?

675
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,524
Oh, the humanity.

676
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:22,183
It's crashing.

677
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,842
It's burning.
I'm sorry!

678
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:26,071
Jeffrey?!

679
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:27,818
<i>Die scumbag!!</i>

680
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,696
Oh my god!

681
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,670
Oh my god!

682
00:45:43,123 --> 00:45:44,345
Oh Jesus!

683
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:47,821
Oh, I'm sorry!

684
00:45:48,385 --> 00:45:49,464
I'm sorry!

685
00:45:49,678 --> 00:45:50,813
Everybody I'm sorry!

686
00:45:50,885 --> 00:45:52,353
I didn't mean for this to happen.

687
00:45:52,378 --> 00:45:53,400
It was an accident.

688
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:54,205
Look...

689
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:58,349
I want.. I want to apologize
to everybody here.

690
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,325
Please.

691
00:45:59,571 --> 00:46:01,135
I'm gonna put everyone back together.

692
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,429
I promise you!

693
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,654
But first I'm going to put
Elisabeth back together

694
00:46:04,686 --> 00:46:06,653
because that's.. that's the whole
point of this.

695
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:08,781
And then I'm gonna
take care of everybody.

696
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:10,339
I'm gonna get to everybody.

697
00:46:10,658 --> 00:46:11,800
Just take it easy.

698
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,562
I guess we're gonna take
a little trip to New Jersey.

699
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,703
It's just right over the bridge.

700
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:19,188
I've got an estrogen based
blood serum there.

701
00:46:19,314 --> 00:46:20,989
It's gonna do wonders for you.

702
00:46:21,427 --> 00:46:23,260
It'll make you feel
like little girls again.

703
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,473
Just trust me.
Alright?

704
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:27,060
Just be quiet.

705
00:46:27,092 --> 00:46:28,243
Relax...

706
00:46:28,346 --> 00:46:29,624
It's gonna be alright.

707
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,319
Oh, you're gonna get another shoe.

708
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:33,344
Alright.

709
00:46:33,796 --> 00:46:34,709
Oh Jesus.

710
00:46:35,277 --> 00:46:36,785
Chinese girl.

711
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,460
Alright, Ok.

712
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:41,202
I'm gonna get new clothes.

713
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,004
Just relax.

714
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,694
This is well done.

715
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:46,850
Alright.

716
00:46:51,946 --> 00:46:53,215
It's a close shave.

717
00:48:06,377 --> 00:48:07,686
Holy Jesus!

718
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:09,377
I gotta work fast.

719
00:48:11,606 --> 00:48:12,844
Not usable.

720
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:15,388
It's like a mans hand.

721
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:19,318
This piece.. This is...

722
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:20,866
Everything we have.

723
00:48:42,901 --> 00:48:43,806
Ok.

724
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:46,250
Too soft.

725
00:48:46,275 --> 00:48:47,171
Ok. What's this?

726
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,868
These? No!
No good.

727
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:50,051
Mutton Jeff.

728
00:48:50,448 --> 00:48:51,702
Alright, these two?

729
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,246
Maybe.
- Wait a minute.

730
00:48:54,548 --> 00:48:55,842
Them!
- Alright.

731
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:02,665
Alright.

732
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:05,436
Where are they?

733
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,150
Where are the perfect ones?

734
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,181
Just stand there!

735
00:49:16,242 --> 00:49:17,744
How the hell did that
get in there?

736
00:49:18,212 --> 00:49:19,021
Alright.

737
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:20,402
Ahh. Now this...

738
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:22,243
This is what I'm
talking about now!

739
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,497
Here it is.
Okay!

740
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:27,013
We got it.

741
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:28,304
Nice.

742
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:37,254
Oh my god.

743
00:49:37,532 --> 00:49:38,540
Bunions!

744
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:10,773
Now, just one final detail.

745
00:50:26,138 --> 00:50:27,146
Well...

746
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:28,955
This is it, Elisabeth.

747
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:31,583
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

748
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:37,625
Just give me a couple of seconds.

749
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,449
Okay.

750
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:53,924
It's alright.

751
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:55,060
That's good.

752
00:50:57,617 --> 00:50:58,847
Now just relax!

753
00:50:59,776 --> 00:51:01,165
Gonna get to each and
everyone of you

754
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,183
as soon as I can

755
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,437
just like I promised.

756
00:51:04,426 --> 00:51:05,474
It's alright.

757
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:08,364
That's it.

758
00:51:08,389 --> 00:51:10,063
Ohh!
Okay!

759
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:20,995
But tonight belongs to Elisabeth.

760
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,081
Oh god, Elisabeth.

761
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:32,438
I love you so much.

762
00:51:35,069 --> 00:51:36,663
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

763
00:51:36,688 --> 00:51:37,957
I mean...

764
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:40,672
I know that things
will never be the same again.

765
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:43,202
As before, but...

766
00:51:45,012 --> 00:51:47,017
I mean, who knows?
Maybe.. Maybe it'll be better.

767
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:48,091
I don't know.

768
00:51:48,887 --> 00:51:50,863
But I do know
I'll have you back with me.

769
00:51:52,323 --> 00:51:53,966
And I'll never let anything ever
hurt you again.

770
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:55,299
I promise.

771
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,323
For as long as I live
you'll be safe.

772
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:02,623
Whup. Wohuo.

773
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:04,274
Ok. It's alright.

774
00:52:04,377 --> 00:52:06,274
No harm done.
Everything’s okay.

775
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:07,702
No blood.

776
00:52:07,743 --> 00:52:08,830
Nothing's broken.

777
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:28,555
It's time.

778
00:54:01,853 --> 00:54:03,052
Good luck.

779
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:03,833
Elisabeth?

780
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:24,721
Elisabeth.

781
00:56:26,127 --> 00:56:27,492
<i>Want a date?!</i>

782
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,706
<i>Going out?!</i>

783
00:56:29,196 --> 00:56:30,624
<i>Looking for some action?!</i>

784
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,347
<i>Need some company?!</i>

785
00:56:32,592 --> 00:56:33,759
No. Wait wait huh?

786
00:56:33,784 --> 00:56:34,934
It's.. It's Jeffrey.

787
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:35,645
Jeffrey

788
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,891
<i>Got any money?!</i>

789
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:38,827
Money? no.
I don’t.. I don't have any money.

790
00:57:43,417 --> 00:57:44,385
Oh my god!

791
00:57:44,686 --> 00:57:45,821
<i>It's a girl!</i>
Ohh!

792
00:57:46,766 --> 00:57:47,567
Oh my!

793
00:58:16,749 --> 00:58:17,868
Elisabeth?

794
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:23,995
Elisabeth!

795
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:33,510
Where are you?

796
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,002
Oh my god!

797
00:58:40,788 --> 00:58:42,113
Elisabeth!!

798
00:58:52,922 --> 00:58:54,907
What did she want a date for?

799
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:56,803
She wants money.

800
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:58,232
She wants my money.

801
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,232
Oh my god, no.

802
00:59:00,872 --> 00:59:01,856
Oh no, no.

803
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:03,015
No. Wait a minute.

804
00:59:03,142 --> 00:59:05,079
You're not gonna go back there!

805
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:06,566
Elisabeth!

806
00:59:40,055 --> 00:59:41,588
Want a date?
You going out?

807
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:44,098
No thanks. I'm on my way home,
but thanks anyway.

808
00:59:46,184 --> 00:59:48,052
Well well.
Look at the lady in purple.

809
00:59:48,241 --> 00:59:49,582
What's rockin' you?

810
00:59:49,751 --> 00:59:50,981
You looking for some action?

811
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:52,973
Hey, get your hands off me.
<i>Babe!!</i>

812
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:02,662
Need some company?

813
01:00:02,721 --> 01:00:04,356
Lonely?
Got any money?

814
01:00:12,796 --> 01:00:15,335
Jeffrey!
We've only got a few minutes left

815
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,501
before we hit the streets.

816
01:00:16,526 --> 01:00:18,049
Have you found
your perfect woman yet?

817
01:00:18,397 --> 01:00:20,389
Whoa! Yes god!

818
01:00:20,414 --> 01:00:22,087
Yes..Yes..

819
01:00:22,183 --> 01:00:23,659
Take me.
Yes!

820
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:33,495
Holy...

821
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:36,800
Are you a Pasties?
I love Pasties.

822
01:00:37,745 --> 01:00:38,887
Where are you taking me?

823
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:40,464
Oh. Oh. Oh!

824
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:41,694
I know this place.

825
01:00:42,155 --> 01:00:43,107
I know this place.

826
01:00:43,132 --> 01:00:44,678
I love this place!

827
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,462
I've been here before.

828
01:00:46,487 --> 01:00:48,493
Oh Yes!
Yes.. Yes..

829
01:00:54,963 --> 01:00:56,097
We'd like a room.

830
01:00:56,122 --> 01:00:57,162
..Like a room.

831
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,971
Oh, sweet mother of..

832
01:01:00,614 --> 01:01:01,431
Look!

833
01:01:01,456 --> 01:01:03,700
Zorro said you have thirty minutes
with the girl you pick.

834
01:01:03,725 --> 01:01:06,263
But you gotta pick.
Coz the rest of us gotta go!

835
01:01:08,851 --> 01:01:10,501
This is great!
I love that.

836
01:01:12,398 --> 01:01:13,684
She's so anxious.

837
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:16,516
Wait! I've got the key.

838
01:01:16,754 --> 01:01:18,214
Don't start without me.

839
01:01:19,103 --> 01:01:20,254
Boy. Oh boy!

840
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,000
Better!
Bed?

841
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,048
Whau!!

842
01:01:27,088 --> 01:01:28,747
Ha ha ha haa!!

843
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:30,532
That's great. I love it.
I love it.

844
01:01:30,566 --> 01:01:31,713
This is terrific!

845
01:01:32,649 --> 01:01:33,847
Do.. Do more.
Do more!

846
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:38,745
Ok girls!
Listen up!

847
01:01:39,586 --> 01:01:41,426
This here is Jersey Boy.

848
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:43,586
Doctor Jersey Boy.

849
01:01:44,224 --> 01:01:46,041
But you can call him Jeffrey.

850
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,168
You wanna play Doctor!
Doctor!!

851
01:01:49,423 --> 01:01:51,868
Me Doctor.. You Nurse.
Ha ha haa!!

852
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:54,003
Oh! This is great!

853
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,130
What a great idea.

854
01:01:57,272 --> 01:01:59,058
Paging Dr. Jeffrey.

855
01:01:59,169 --> 01:02:00,836
Paging Dr. Jeffrey!!

856
01:02:05,582 --> 01:02:06,884
Oh. This is great.

857
01:02:14,368 --> 01:02:15,590
Oh. Mother...

858
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:27,075
Yes.
- Yes!

859
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,628
Oh Jeffrey!

860
01:02:39,558 --> 01:02:41,598
Don't be selfish, lover!

861
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,987
Hold 'em still.
Give it here!

862
01:02:46,642 --> 01:02:47,515
Jeffrey.

863
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,531
Jumbo heaven!!

864
01:02:49,556 --> 01:02:51,253
Is it sort of hot in here?

865
01:02:51,452 --> 01:02:52,500
Aahh!

866
01:02:54,505 --> 01:02:55,695
All Right!

867
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,591
Ohh...

868
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,623
That was wonderful.

869
01:03:20,542 --> 01:03:21,217
Hey!

870
01:03:21,272 --> 01:03:22,296
'Scuse me?

871
01:03:22,544 --> 01:03:23,250
'Scuse me?
Listen.

872
01:03:23,275 --> 01:03:25,241
I'm looking for a very tall
attractive woman.

873
01:03:25,266 --> 01:03:27,703
She's purple and she's got fresh
scars on her.

874
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:29,766
'Scuse me.
Pal.

875
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,679
I'm looking for a.. a..
Tall attractive..

876
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,703
Well, she's got a sexy purple outfit on.

877
01:03:34,005 --> 01:03:35,759
She's got a scar on her neck.

878
01:03:35,926 --> 01:03:37,458
She's very sick!

879
01:03:38,805 --> 01:03:40,186
Hey!
Excuse me?

880
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,884
Please.
You gotta help me out here.

881
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:43,360
I'm looking for my girlfriend.
She's very sick.

882
01:03:43,385 --> 01:03:44,773
I gotta get her
her medicine.

883
01:03:44,801 --> 01:03:46,476
She's tall.
She's got..Ehh..

884
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:48,913
She's purple.
She's got some scars on her.

885
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:51,001
A purple outfit.
Have you seen her around here?

886
01:03:57,652 --> 01:03:59,318
What are you talking about?!

887
01:03:59,343 --> 01:04:00,921
What are you?
Some kind of a Swede?!

888
01:04:01,198 --> 01:04:03,420
You're talking to me in Swedish
in Times Square!

889
01:04:04,815 --> 01:04:06,053
Elisabeth!

890
01:04:39,196 --> 01:04:40,062
Hey!

891
01:04:40,601 --> 01:04:41,752
Hey Doll-face!

892
01:04:43,665 --> 01:04:44,776
How about those Mets?

893
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:51,049
Well. Actually I'm not to fond
of organized sports.

894
01:04:51,493 --> 01:04:53,739
I'm more of a one on one
type guy.

895
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:56,687
I kinda prefer a certain
indoor sport.

896
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:57,989
You know what I mean?

897
01:04:58,413 --> 01:04:59,865
I bet if I Ehh...

898
01:05:00,071 --> 01:05:01,651
Stick my tongue down your throat.

899
01:05:23,176 --> 01:05:25,009
Fifty bucks!
Just like that!

900
01:05:28,189 --> 01:05:29,824
You're looking for some company
this evening?

901
01:05:29,943 --> 01:05:31,404
What's happening, sugar?

902
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:32,840
Listen. Girls.
I need some help.

903
01:05:32,964 --> 01:05:34,560
Oh, I'm sure I can help you.

904
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:35,821
I know I can.

905
01:05:36,409 --> 01:05:38,107
I'm looking for a tall purple girl.

906
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:40,186
She's got a black forearm..
And.. And fresh stitches..

907
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:42,513
We got handcuffs, whips,
enemas, dildos,

908
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:45,296
rags, chain-link, barbed wire...

909
01:05:45,891 --> 01:05:47,257
And feathers.

910
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,463
She's also got a tattoo on her arm.

911
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:51,249
It's a "Z".
In a circle.

912
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:53,606
That's one of Zorro's girls.

913
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,147
They're all gone.

914
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:56,115
They're dead.

915
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,940
No, they're not.
They are coming back!

916
01:05:57,965 --> 01:05:59,137
They're gonna be back
in a couple of weeks.

917
01:05:59,162 --> 01:06:00,495
What do you know about this, huh?

918
01:06:00,638 --> 01:06:02,008
Oh! What do you
fucking know about this, huh?

919
01:06:02,143 --> 01:06:03,595
What do you dress like that for man?

920
01:06:03,619 --> 01:06:04,364
To do the right thing.

921
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:05,698
Did you do the fuckin' right thing?

922
01:06:05,723 --> 01:06:08,016
That's the question.
Did you do the right thing?

923
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:10,328
I'm going to the hospital now.
I gotta go to my emergency room.

924
01:06:10,353 --> 01:06:12,018
I'll put you in the fucking emergency room.

925
01:06:12,043 --> 01:06:13,892
What are you?
A sick son of a bitch!

926
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:16,860
<i>Party!!
- Party!!</i>

927
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:18,614
<i>Wanna party</i> ?

928
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:21,868
Jersey Boy here wants a twosome.

929
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:23,471
<i>Lonely</i> ?

930
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:25,209
<i>Need some company</i> ?

931
01:06:26,393 --> 01:06:27,703
<i>Goin' out</i> ?

932
01:06:28,314 --> 01:06:29,703
<i>Want a date</i> ?

933
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:32,250
<i>Party</i> !

934
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:34,034
<i>Got any money</i> ?

935
01:06:48,152 --> 01:06:50,057
I don’t know.
They didn't leave.

936
01:06:50,082 --> 01:06:51,239
They didn't go nowhere.

937
01:06:51,264 --> 01:06:52,470
They just blew up.

938
01:06:52,495 --> 01:06:53,501
Blew up?

939
01:06:53,672 --> 01:06:54,703
Fucking exploded.

940
01:06:54,767 --> 01:06:57,116
One minute, they are my bitches.
The next they are pieces all over!

941
01:06:58,023 --> 01:06:59,039
Well...

942
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:01,483
When a man loses he's ho's...

943
01:07:02,025 --> 01:07:04,144
He loses <i>everything</i> !

944
01:07:04,175 --> 01:07:05,710
I didn't lose 'em man!

945
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:07,155
They just blew up!

946
01:07:09,334 --> 01:07:10,922
That's what happened man!

947
01:07:11,183 --> 01:07:12,175
Yeah Zorro.

948
01:07:12,723 --> 01:07:13,730
I'll catch you later.

949
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,311
Brush it up with you
and them bloomin' bitches.

950
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:20,165
<i>Holy shit girls</i> !

951
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:21,896
It's Jones!

952
01:07:22,047 --> 01:07:24,198
Super Jones!

953
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:28,078
A whole shitload of Jones!

954
01:07:31,643 --> 01:07:34,142
One of these days I'm gonna get
sick and tired of this shit

955
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:35,992
and let one of you pugs win.

956
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,251
<i>Hey Spike</i> !

957
01:07:40,132 --> 01:07:42,183
What the hell is that?

958
01:07:51,477 --> 01:07:53,723
Well hello baby!

959
01:07:54,521 --> 01:07:56,386
Pretzels good!

960
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,730
Hey babe!
For your own good...

961
01:08:01,755 --> 01:08:03,710
Go easy on those Pretzels.

962
01:08:06,873 --> 01:08:09,015
Now, I know that I never saw you
here before.

963
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,286
Of course...

964
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:12,643
I would have most
surely remembered.

965
01:08:13,244 --> 01:08:15,069
Are you gonna take
my temperature Doc?!

966
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:16,752
I bet you got a big thermometer!

967
01:08:16,784 --> 01:08:18,386
Uhh.. Baby!

968
01:08:18,697 --> 01:08:21,140
I just loves a woman
who knows what she wants.

969
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:22,116
Ok. Girls.
Listen up!

970
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:23,177
This here is Jersey Boy.

971
01:08:23,202 --> 01:08:25,773
Doctor Jersey Boy.
But you can call him Jeffrey.

972
01:08:26,512 --> 01:08:28,282
Zorro told you
all about Jeffrey.

973
01:08:28,307 --> 01:08:30,211
It's his party and he wants to play Doctor.

974
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,842
Oh yeah!

975
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,294
Hey babe...

976
01:08:33,834 --> 01:08:35,810
There's way to many freaks
in this joint.

977
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:37,963
Hows about if you and I
just skip out.

978
01:08:38,003 --> 01:08:40,273
To some place a little
more.. Intimate.

979
01:08:40,298 --> 01:08:41,077
Oop!

980
01:08:41,102 --> 01:08:43,529
Zorro said you have thirty minutes
with the girl you pick.

981
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:45,632
But you gotta pick.
Coz the rest of us gotta go.

982
01:08:45,657 --> 01:08:46,974
Whatever baby.

983
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:47,875
Look...

984
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:50,161
Why don't you and I...
We can sit right over here.

985
01:08:50,264 --> 01:08:51,677
Are we gettin' paid?

986
01:09:07,862 --> 01:09:09,172
Oh. Baby...

987
01:09:09,781 --> 01:09:11,257
It's not right...

988
01:09:11,654 --> 01:09:13,344
A woman like you...

989
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:15,269
You're...

990
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:16,952
Beautiful.

991
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:18,467
Go protected.

992
01:09:19,387 --> 01:09:20,220
All alone.

993
01:09:20,245 --> 01:09:21,482
In a city like this.

994
01:09:22,554 --> 01:09:24,030
There's sharks all around.

995
01:09:24,055 --> 01:09:26,692
Folks, who could just as easily
prey upon a woman

996
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:28,402
as unusual as you.

997
01:09:28,427 --> 01:09:31,506
A woman so distinctively different.

998
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:34,483
Somebody's gotta take care of you.

999
01:09:35,793 --> 01:09:38,007
Somebody like me,
who can protect you.

1000
01:09:38,046 --> 01:09:40,777
Somebody who'll understand your needs...

1001
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:42,992
..Who are strong.

1002
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,952
<i>Honey, in case you aint noticed...</i>

1003
01:09:44,977 --> 01:09:47,163
<i>I not only got all the right parts...</i>

1004
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:49,647
<i>But I got 'em in all the right places</i> !

1005
01:09:49,706 --> 01:09:50,713
Oh I noticed...

1006
01:09:50,738 --> 01:09:54,237
I noticed.
Ohh.. I noticed.

1007
01:10:04,835 --> 01:10:05,914
Uh! Honey!

1008
01:10:05,946 --> 01:10:07,914
Look at Miss Thang.

1009
01:10:24,623 --> 01:10:26,417
Anyone got a stamp?

1010
01:10:36,761 --> 01:10:38,769
Ohh Pavelarna Drake!

1011
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,229
Mother of Harlots.

1012
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,988
And abomned nations of the earth.

1013
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,891
Are we sure unto thee, the judgment

1014
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,255
of the Grey whore,

1015
01:10:45,296 --> 01:10:47,869
the woman arrayed in purple and Scarlett.

1016
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:50,449
Things of the earth
has committed fornications.

1017
01:10:50,544 --> 01:10:52,766
And lived illiciously with her.

1018
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,449
They shall whale and lament

1019
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,135
when they see the smoke
of her burning.

1020
01:10:57,223 --> 01:10:58,357
So, you've seen her?

1021
01:10:58,412 --> 01:10:59,975
She's in the Bar!

1022
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,119
God bless.

1023
01:11:02,385 --> 01:11:03,583
Who the fuck are you?

1024
01:11:03,608 --> 01:11:05,702
How come you know about
me and Jersey Boy?

1025
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,933
This aint your tattoo.
This aint your arm!

1026
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:10,237
Where'd you get this arm?
This is one of my bitches arm!

1027
01:11:10,515 --> 01:11:11,975
Who the fuck are you?

1028
01:11:40,812 --> 01:11:41,892
Coming through.

1029
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:42,869
I'm a Doctor.
Alright?

1030
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:44,699
Let me through.
Just step to the side.

1031
01:11:44,724 --> 01:11:46,073
Take it easy.
It's like...

1032
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:47,707
It's like a soccer game.

1033
01:11:47,739 --> 01:11:48,969
Elisabeth!

1034
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,120
Elisabeth!

1035
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:15,000
Jersey Boy.

1036
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:16,501
Christ Elisabeth.

1037
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:19,368
I didn't bring you back to have you
hang out in a joint like this.

1038
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:20,972
Now come on.
We're going home.

1039
01:12:20,997 --> 01:12:22,056
Let's go.

1040
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:31,081
<i>I told you</i> ! <i>I told you</i> !

1041
01:12:31,106 --> 01:12:32,622
Ok. Come on.
Just put one...

1042
01:12:32,647 --> 01:12:33,606
I know.

1043
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:35,406
One step in front of the other.
That's right!

1044
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,509
<i>Yes</i> ! <i>I told you</i> !
I know you did.

1045
01:12:37,545 --> 01:12:40,045
<i>I told you</i> ! <i>I told you</i> !
Don't bump your head. That's right.

1046
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:42,014
Nice and easy.
<i>Yes</i> ! <i>I told you</i> !

1047
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:44,368
I know you did.
Ok. Thank you!

1048
01:12:44,487 --> 01:12:46,471
<i>I told you</i> !
That's a good man.

1049
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:48,225
<i>Yes</i> ! <i>Yes</i> ! <i>I told you</i> !

1050
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:50,016
Thank you.
<i>I told you</i> ! <i>I told you</i> !

1051
01:12:56,336 --> 01:12:57,582
Taxi!

1052
01:13:09,308 --> 01:13:10,824
Oh god Elisabeth.

1053
01:13:11,324 --> 01:13:13,562
I didn't want things to
turn out this way.

1054
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:16,638
I didn't want <i>you</i>
to turn out this way.

1055
01:13:46,184 --> 01:13:47,922
Elisabeth.
Please!

1056
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:14,767
Elisabeth.

1057
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:16,577
I know you're not a hooker.

1058
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:18,713
You're not a hooker Elisabeth.

1059
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:20,078
You're not! You're not!

1060
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:21,491
Of course I'm not.

1061
01:14:21,516 --> 01:14:24,699
Why in the world would you ever
say anything like that, Jeffrey?

1062
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:26,905
Elisabeth.

1063
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,485
Elisabeth, is that..
Is that you?

1064
01:14:29,597 --> 01:14:31,081
What are we doing here?

1065
01:14:31,795 --> 01:14:34,287
What happened to Mom and Dad
and the party?

1066
01:14:34,312 --> 01:14:35,605
I...

1067
01:14:35,922 --> 01:14:37,486
I...
You don't remember?

1068
01:14:38,943 --> 01:14:41,681
The Lawnmower!
Oh God! What's happened to me?

1069
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:47,012
You were...

1070
01:14:47,464 --> 01:14:48,900
You were gone.

1071
01:14:49,273 --> 01:14:50,369
A coma?

1072
01:14:51,575 --> 01:14:52,599
Worse.

1073
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:54,877
Dead?

1074
01:14:56,936 --> 01:14:58,206
I brought you back Elisabeth.

1075
01:14:59,341 --> 01:15:00,666
I brought you back to life.

1076
01:15:01,817 --> 01:15:02,698
How?

1077
01:15:02,728 --> 01:15:05,276
Oh, a bunch of things.
I've got it all written down over there.

1078
01:15:06,426 --> 01:15:07,704
This is fantastic.

1079
01:15:07,729 --> 01:15:09,371
This is incredible!

1080
01:15:09,998 --> 01:15:10,744
What a miracle.

1081
01:15:10,776 --> 01:15:13,514
You have to share this
with the rest of the world

1082
01:15:14,173 --> 01:15:15,959
No. No.
It's half a miracle. I.. I..

1083
01:15:16,298 --> 01:15:18,560
My.. My blood serum is estrogen based.

1084
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:20,527
I mean I can only bring back women.

1085
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,452
Oh.. But just think of
how many people you can save.

1086
01:15:24,477 --> 01:15:26,365
Jeffrey. I'm so proud of you.

1087
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:29,051
So very very proud of you.

1088
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:32,591
These aren't my arms!

1089
01:15:32,925 --> 01:15:34,616
This isn't my hand.

1090
01:15:35,028 --> 01:15:36,433
These aren't my legs!

1091
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:37,599
This isn't my breast!

1092
01:15:37,624 --> 01:15:39,767
Look at me!
What have you done?

1093
01:15:39,829 --> 01:15:41,210
Take it easy alright?

1094
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:42,074
Just calm down.

1095
01:15:42,099 --> 01:15:43,860
I can explain everything.

1096
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,090
I had to make a few changes.

1097
01:15:46,115 --> 01:15:47,226
That's all.

1098
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:49,160
There wasn't enough of you left

1099
01:15:49,185 --> 01:15:50,755
to fry an egg with.

1100
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,153
But I feel so strange.

1101
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,708
As if there were so many
different women

1102
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:57,042
inside of me.

1103
01:15:57,067 --> 01:15:59,439
Alright. Maybe I had to do
a few unorthodox things.

1104
01:15:59,523 --> 01:16:00,602
But, you know...

1105
01:16:00,627 --> 01:16:02,563
Thing's didn't turn out so bad.

1106
01:16:02,588 --> 01:16:03,602
I mean...

1107
01:16:03,706 --> 01:16:04,833
I love you.

1108
01:16:05,518 --> 01:16:06,725
I love you.

1109
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:08,733
And you're alive.

1110
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,550
And I love you Elisabeth.

1111
01:16:11,844 --> 01:16:13,709
Now, more than ever.
I love you.

1112
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:15,994
And we're gonna spend
the rest of our lives together.

1113
01:16:16,019 --> 01:16:17,034
Me and you.

1114
01:16:21,431 --> 01:16:22,519
Oh god!

1115
01:16:22,876 --> 01:16:24,328
Why did you do this?

1116
01:16:24,353 --> 01:16:25,622
Who are you?

1117
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:27,733
No. No. No. No.
The question is who are <i>you</i>?

1118
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,470
And for what happened here
your ass is mine.

1119
01:16:29,495 --> 01:16:31,256
And I'm taking possession right now!

1120
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:32,938
You hear me, honey?

1121
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,121
You hear me Crystal?

1122
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:35,595
Do you hear me Angel?

1123
01:16:35,794 --> 01:16:36,809
Chartreuse?

1124
01:16:36,857 --> 01:16:38,318
Snow?
Sugar?

1125
01:16:38,357 --> 01:16:40,024
Monkey?
I know you all in there.

1126
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:41,216
Everyone of you.

1127
01:16:41,241 --> 01:16:42,995
Well, Zorro's here
to take care of you again.

1128
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,813
And Zorro knows what you need
to get in the right state of mind.

1129
01:16:46,077 --> 01:16:48,400
Some of this sweet, sweet rock.

1130
01:17:11,404 --> 01:17:12,848
What the fuck?

1131
01:17:29,575 --> 01:17:31,615
Oh shit!
Get the fuck away from me!

1132
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:37,070
Get the fuck away from me!

1133
01:18:15,885 --> 01:18:18,298
Anybody got a stamp?

1134
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:30,997
Jeffrey!

1135
01:18:31,337 --> 01:18:32,813
I have an idea.

1136
01:18:35,932 --> 01:18:37,594
Jeffrey!

1137
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:39,917
Yuhuu!

1138
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,648
Wake up.

1139
01:18:42,568 --> 01:18:43,980
You awake?

1140
01:18:45,604 --> 01:18:46,771
Elisabeth.

1141
01:18:47,136 --> 01:18:48,358
Jeffrey!

1142
01:18:48,383 --> 01:18:49,343
What happened?

1143
01:18:49,383 --> 01:18:51,318
Some man named Zorro came by here.

1144
01:18:51,343 --> 01:18:52,438
Zorro?

1145
01:18:52,668 --> 01:18:54,049
What? Here?
Yes.

1146
01:18:54,944 --> 01:18:57,364
Jeffrey, you were...
You were gone.

1147
01:18:58,912 --> 01:18:59,920
Dead?

1148
01:19:00,618 --> 01:19:02,134
How did...
What...

1149
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,732
Well, you kept very good notes.

1150
01:19:05,066 --> 01:19:07,654
And of course I used
living parts.

1151
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:10,133
Living parts?

1152
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:12,331
What do you mean?
Living parts?

1153
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,887
Holy shit.

1154
01:19:14,022 --> 01:19:15,553
That's.. Not my hand.

1155
01:19:16,091 --> 01:19:17,528
What are these boobs?

1156
01:19:17,702 --> 01:19:19,432
Elisabeth!
What did you do to me?

1157
01:19:21,483 --> 01:19:22,737
I can explain.

1158
01:19:22,848 --> 01:19:27,339
Obviously, since your serum only works
on female body parts

1159
01:19:27,568 --> 01:19:30,750
I couldn't reuse your old body
or even Zorro's.

1160
01:19:30,775 --> 01:19:33,346
So naturally I had to make changes.

1161
01:19:34,497 --> 01:19:35,679
No! Look!

1162
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:37,521
Where's my Johnson?

1163
01:19:37,809 --> 01:19:39,532
What did you do to me, Elisabeth?

1164
01:19:40,122 --> 01:19:41,011
Granted.

1165
01:19:41,036 --> 01:19:44,209
What I did may have been
a bit unorthodox...

1166
01:19:44,415 --> 01:19:45,701
But, Hey!

1167
01:19:46,021 --> 01:19:47,553
You look great.

1168
01:19:47,578 --> 01:19:49,045
And you're alive.

1169
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:51,512
And you're back with me
and I love you.

1170
01:19:51,665 --> 01:19:54,331
I love you Jeffrey
and we're together again.

1171
01:19:54,442 --> 01:19:55,649
All of us.

1172
01:19:55,823 --> 01:19:57,236
Together again.

1173
01:19:57,878 --> 01:19:59,140
Together again.
