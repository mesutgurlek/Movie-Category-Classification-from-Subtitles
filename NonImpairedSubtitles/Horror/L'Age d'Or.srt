1
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:03,290
The scorpion is an arachoid species
found in various parts of the world

2
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:24,848
Its tail comprises
five prismatic joints

3
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:37,134
The pincers, recalling those of
the larger crayfsh...

4
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:40,652
...are instruments of aggression
and information

5
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:52,051
Its tail ends in a sixth joint...

6
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:56,448
...a sac from which poison
is injected by barbed sting

7
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:19,052
A lover of darkness,
it burrows under stones...

8
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:23,289
...to escape the glare of the sun

9
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:40,208
Antisocial, it ejects the
intruder on its solitude

10
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:50,048
Such lightning strikes,
such virtuosity in attack

11
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:54,846
Even a rat, for all its fury,
falls prey to it

12
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:25,574
Some hours later

13
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,047
Stop it!

14
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,449
Perhaps I just happened to fall?

15
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:48,767
No. We saw nothing

16
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,765
Is there any news, yes or no?

17
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:01,810
Yes, the Majorcans are here

18
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,494
Quick, to arms!

19
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,288
To the rear!

20
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,648
What about Peman?

21
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:59,616
I'm done for

22
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:03,130
So are we, but we're going

23
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:09,290
Yes, but you've got accordions...

24
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:14,847
...hippopotamuses, wrenches...

25
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:20,368
...mountain goats, and...

26
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:25,245
Bollocks! Let's go

27
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:29,734
...and paintbrushes

28
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,847
1930 AD. This stone, on the site
where the Majorcans died...

29
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:17,208
...marks the founding of
the city of...

30
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,886
...Imperial Rome

31
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:40,289
Once mistress of the pagan world,
now secular seat of the Church

32
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:44,495
Aspects of its stoutest pillar,
the Vatican

33
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:13,455
<i>The landlord's terms are very
favourable. We can move in at once</i>

34
00:19:13,616 --> 00:19:19,566
<i>Longing to see you, very soon noW.
Your loving cousin</i>

35
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:29,294
But the hurly-burly of modern life
has overtaken the Imperial City

36
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,886
Sometimes on Sundays...

37
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:23,053
Various picturesque aspects
of the great city

38
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,455
Bandaged?

39
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:47,849
Yes, it's been sore for over a week

40
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:50,207
Is Daddy home yet, Mummy?

41
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,411
Yes, he's in the dispensary

42
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:55,687
Then he'll dress for the party

43
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:58,051
We went out together this morning...

44
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:00,856
...and engaged four of them

45
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:05,448
The little moustached one
sang like the rest

46
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:08,210
Only a pianist is lacking

47
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:11,846
But our priest is a fine violinist

48
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:16,049
I think the musicians we have
will be enough

49
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:20,607
Six of them placed near
the microphone...

50
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:24,530
...will make more noise than sixty
ten kilometres away

51
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:28,526
I know sound gets lost in
the open air...

52
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:32,689
...but we could bring
the guests in close

53
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:38,691
Get a move on. The Majorcans
will be arriving at nine

54
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:27,528
Bastard! Filthy swine!

55
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:29,846
Keep your trap shut!

56
00:27:30,136 --> 00:27:34,288
Want us to work you over?

57
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:58,207
Here's a taste of the rough stuff!

58
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:04,050
Enough is enough; let me show you
who you're dealing with

59
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:16,050
Let's have a look, then

60
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:59,688
The International Goodwill Society...

61
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:03,053
...hereby appoints you
its special delegate

62
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:07,528
This document testifies to
our faith in you

63
00:29:07,696 --> 00:29:11,371
We pray that you will prove worthy...

64
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:15,529
...of this trust we place in you...

65
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:21,054
...and successfully complete
your goodwill mission

66
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:26,053
On your spirit of self-sacrifice
and your proven valour...

67
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:28,525
...depend many lives

68
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:32,448
Children, women, old men

69
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:39,454
The honour of our Fatherland rests on
the outcome of this noble enterprise

70
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:17,325
At his magnificent Roman estate, the
Marquis of X prepares for his guests

71
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:23,449
The Minister of the Interior
is on the telephone

72
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:52,011
You scoundrel! You are
entirely to blame!

73
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:54,252
You compromised me, too

74
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:58,165
Do you realize that
not one child survived?

75
00:47:58,456 --> 00:48:02,847
Many women and old men perished, too

76
00:48:03,056 --> 00:48:06,526
You're bothering me about a few brats?

77
00:48:06,696 --> 00:48:11,565
Filthy ruffian, you've
dragged me down with you!

78
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,689
Dishonoured me!

79
00:48:14,856 --> 00:48:16,926
You can die for all I care!

80
00:48:17,216 --> 00:48:22,006
Then listen to my last words...
Has he gone?

81
00:49:42,296 --> 00:49:45,049
<i>Are you sleepy?</i>

82
00:49:46,376 --> 00:49:49,129
<i>I Was just falling asleep</i>

83
00:49:52,216 --> 00:49:54,446
<i>Where's the light sWitch?</i>

84
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:57,847
<i>At the foot of the bed</i>

85
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:49,048
<i>Your elboW's hurting me</i>

86
00:50:49,616 --> 00:50:55,054
<i>Move your head closer,; the pilloW
is cooler on this side</i>

87
00:51:04,216 --> 00:51:06,855
<i>Where's your hand?</i>

88
00:51:09,856 --> 00:51:12,051
<i>That feels so good</i>

89
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:17,451
<i>Let's just sit here and not move</i>

90
00:51:44,696 --> 00:51:46,846
<i>Are you cold?</i>

91
00:51:48,536 --> 00:51:51,687
<i>No, I Was falling</i>

92
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:10,212
<i>I've been Waiting so long for him</i>

93
00:52:11,056 --> 00:52:16,688
<i>What joy! What joy in having
killed our children</i>

94
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:22,049
<i>My love... my love...</i>

95
00:58:04,456 --> 00:58:09,052
Just as these feathers fell,
but a long way away...

96
00:58:09,216 --> 00:58:13,209
...the survivors from the
Chateau de Selliny...

97
00:58:13,376 --> 00:58:19,326
...emerged to return to Paris

98
00:58:41,616 --> 00:58:46,531
120 days earlier, four godless
and unprincipled scoundrels...

99
00:58:46,696 --> 00:58:51,690
...had, driven by their depravity,
shut themselves away...

100
00:58:51,856 --> 00:58:56,850
...to indulge in the most
bestial of orgies

101
00:58:57,056 --> 00:59:02,050
To them, the life of a woman
mattered no more than that of a fly

102
00:59:02,216 --> 00:59:07,210
They took with them eight
lovely adolescent girls...

103
00:59:07,376 --> 00:59:12,370
...to serve as victims for
their criminal desires...

104
00:59:12,536 --> 00:59:17,530
...plus four women well versed
in debauchery...

105
00:59:17,696 --> 00:59:22,690
...whose narrative skills would
serve to stimulate...

106
00:59:22,856 --> 00:59:26,849
...their already jaded appetites...

107
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:29,650
...whenever interest flagged

108
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:40,851
Here are the survivors of these
orgies, leaving the Chateau de Selliny

109
00:59:41,056 --> 00:59:45,049
First and foremost of the four
instigators, the Duc de Blangis
