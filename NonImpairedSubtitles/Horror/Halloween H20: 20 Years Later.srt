What's goin' on ?

00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,577

- You sure ?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,583
- I checked all the rooms
and all the closets.
- Nothing's missing.

41
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,754
I don't think so, but they,
uh, they did a real number
on your office.

42
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,132
- My office ?
- Yeah, there's crap everywhere.

Spent his life tracking down
that Halloween guy...

00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,123
who butchered all those kids
up in Haddonfield, right ?

75

- Michael Myers.
- Right.

76
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:48,005
- Hey, you don't think Michael Myers--
- They never found his body.

77
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,007
Yeah, but that was,
like, 20 years ago.

and warn 'em.
- There's no way, Fitz.

Just a precaution.
Tomorrow's Halloween.

83
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,696
All right, you tell 'em to look for
a guy with a cane and Alzheimer's.

84
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,115
The guy would be
younger than I am, okay ?

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,368

his sister back in '63.

Yes, Fitzsimmons. Patch me through
to Haddonfield, please.

- Yeah.
- Michael Myers.

Yeah, right.

89

I met him 15 years ago.

90
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,504
I was told
there was nothing left.

91

No reason, no conscience.

92
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,802
No understanding. Even the most
rudimentary sense of life...

93
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,305
and death, of good or evil...

94
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,307
right or wrong.

95
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,394
I met this
six-year-old child...

96
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:30,357
with this blank, pale,
emotionless face, and...

97
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,069
the blackest eyes.

98
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,405
The devil's eyes.

99
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,558
I spent eight years trying to reach him...

100
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,852
and then another seven
trying to keep him locked up...

101
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,856
because I realized that what was living
behind that boy's eyes...

102
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:14,526
was purely, and simply...

103
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,528
evil.

104
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,444

105
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,780

106
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,492
You okay ? You all right ?

107
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:32,206
Oh. Oh !

108
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:36,460
- Everything's okay. It's okay.

109
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:40,964
- Do you need somethin' ?
- Oh ! Uh, yeah.

110
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,966
Yeah, please. Thanks.

116
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,945
No.
None for me, thanks.

- We're out of Percodan.

00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,662
Got mail.
It's from your dad.

119
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:02,629
- Birthday card.
- It's only two months late.
I'm impressed.

120
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:05,090
Cash is good. I'm gonna need it
when I go to Yosemite.

121
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,135
- You're not going.
- Yes, I am.

122
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:11,180
No, you're not.

123
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,308
Yes, I am, and with your full blessing.
Do you want to know why ?

124
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,394
- Why ?
- Because today is the day.

125
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,938
I can feel it.
Today is the day...

126
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,649
that you're going to realize
that I'm 17 years old...

127
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,236
and your overprotection and paranoia
is inhibiting my growth process.

128
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,740
Want to go camping ?
I'll take you camping.

129
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,076
I don't want
to go with you.

130
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,121
Sorry.

131
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,333
- Dad would let me go.
- Well, Dad...

132
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,919
is an abusive, chain-smoking
methadone addict.

133
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,921
Who would attract
someone like that ?

134
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,883
- Ouch.
- And just think, he left you.

135
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,928
Look, John.

136
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:55,057
I know you get your smart mouth
from my side of the family,
so I'll give you a break.

137
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,185
- But point check, you're going too far.
- No, I'm goin' to Yosemite.

138
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,563
- No, you're not.
- Look, Mom, help me out here.

139
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,358
I need a little more open air.
I've earned it.

140
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,362
Look, I know today is the day,
but I think that--

141
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,532
- Oh, really ? What day is that, John ?
- Halloween.

142
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,035
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

143
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,247
Look, Mom,
we're through with all that.

144
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,084
We really are.

145
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,679
You know what you're becoming ?
You're becoming an Oedipal
enabler, you know that ?

146
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,557
- Thank you.
- I'm serious !

147
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,809
Twenty years from now, you're still
going to be living with her.

148
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,853
Probably running some weird motel
out in the middle of nowhere.

149
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,896
- So this means no Yosemite ?
- Correct.

150
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,982
- Now, how do I get out of it ?
- Why don't you want to go ?

151
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,818
Oh, it's so lame.
No, no, no. It's worse.

152
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,153
I-l went there
two summers ago with my family.

153
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,991
Loathsome. No, it's worse.
It'll come to me.

Wretched. You know ?
Okay, think-think...

155
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,121
campfires, s'mores--

156
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,062
Repugnant !
That's it, repugnant.

157
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,106
I would rather have
my eyes pierced.

158
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,360
I'm very sorry.
I wish I could help. I'm sorry.

159
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,446
- But he promised that--
- No. I'm not going.

160
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,282
You couldn't pay me to go.

161
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:41,413
- Hey, what's wrong ?
- Oh-- Uh, my dad.

162
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:44,416
He flaked on
my financial aid again.

163
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,377
- The bursar's being such a dick.
Now I can't go to Yosemite.
- You're not going either ?

164
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,379
- No.
- I'm not going.

165
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,381
- How are you going to get out of it ?
- Please.

166
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,551
- Hey. Hold on. We ditch Yosemite.

167
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,095
It means we could have
a Halloween party, just the four of us.

168
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,473
Whole place would be empty.
We'd have the run of it.

169
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,935
- We could have a roaming orgy.
- I love the way this man thinks !

170
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:06,146
Hope that's not
the only thing you love about me.

171
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,736
- Hey, come on.
- All right, let's go.

172
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,391
Okay. You see,
I told you we'd make it.

173
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,893
When I was a little girl,
we used to pee in the woods.

174
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:01,243
- Ohh ! Uh--
- Don't worry !

175
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,167
Come on.

176
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,419
Mom, that's the boys' room.

177
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,588
Then the boys are just
gonna have to deal with it.

178
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,008
Hello ?

179
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,264
Okay. Coast is clear.

180
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:36,236
Okay. Come on.

181
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:45,537
I'll be just next door.
Mom's gotta go too.

182
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,874
## "Mary Had A Little Lamb"

183
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,752
- Oh !
- Mom ?

184
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,754
I know.

185
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:02,387
- Mom ?
- It's just the door, Casey.

186
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:10,395
Here's some tissues--
Casey ?

187
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,786
Spiders !

188
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:20,632
All right.
Ready ? You know why you're here.

189
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:24,178
The buses leave for Yosemite
at 4:15, sharp.

190
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:35,898
And now it's time for me
to do my obligatory plea...

191
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:38,775
that you uphold
the standards of Hillcrest.

192
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:42,321
And that means
no musical sleeping bags.

193
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,364
- No booze.

194
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,451
- No drugs, no kidding.

195
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,370
Undoubtedly, someone will ruin it
for the rest of them...

196
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,540
so I just want to remind you that
the entire teaching faculty has--

197
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:56,084
- Hey ! Guess what this is.
- What ?

198
00:22:56,168 --> 00:23:00,297
It's my history report.
Forgot to hand it in.

199
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,674
Guess who's not going to Yosemite.
I'm so bummed.

200
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,718
Guess who has a fever of 102...

201
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,720
and has to stay in bed
all weekend long.

202
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,349
- You two company ?
- So, what's the plan ?

203
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,143
Romantic dinner,
candlelight, soft music.

204
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,438
- Animal sex.
- You need a hormone suppressant.

205
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:19,274
You're embarrassing
the newlyweds, Charles.

206
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,944
That's it.
Have a good time.

207
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,826
And why aren't
you going camping, Miss Tate ?

208
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,703
Because it sounds like fun.
And you, Mr. Brennan ?

209
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,581
Guidance counselors aren't usually
a big hit in the wilderness.

210
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,709
Besides, somebody has to stay behind and
watch over the three or four outcasts.

211
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,753
Oh, good morning, Miss Tate.

212
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,839
- Morning, Norma.
- Your mail and messages are
on your desk,

213
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,258
along with the
new quarter budget, and oh,

214
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:47,886
surprise, surprise, the drains in the
girls' shower room are clogged again.

215
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,430
- Can I talk to you alone
for one second ?
- But, l-l called the plumber,

216
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,432
and he assured me that
he will be here as soon as he can--

217
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:55,269
Thank you, Norma.
Thank you very much.

218
00:23:57,646 --> 00:23:59,898
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Place of employment.

219
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,193
I'm sorry, l-l just--
I needed a fix.

220
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:08,866
- We still on for lunch ?
- Uh-huh. 1:00.

221
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:13,287
You are, without a doubt,
the most amazing,

222
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,081
challenging woman
I have ever met.

223
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:18,125
And what's wrong now ?

224
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:21,837
Can you just stop with the
Keri analysis just once, please ?

225
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,089
You can do it tomorrow,
all you want.

226
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,884
But please, can I just
have today off ?

227
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,262
- Whatever you want.
- Thank you.

228
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:33,098
- Lunch. Don't forget.
- 1:00.

229
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,100
Uh--

230
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:02,127
"He turned, just in time
to see her enter the room,

231
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:07,132
with her long, slender legs
that climbed high up her skirt,

232
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,927
Ieading to two tumultuous,

233
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,138
round, melon breasts."

234
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,140
Round melon what ?

235
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:17,142
Now why do you want
to label it like food ?

236
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:20,687
A-And what kind of melon
you talkin' about ?
Cantaloupe ? Watermelon ? What ?

237
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,941
Baby, it's fiction ! People like
to read descriptive adjectives.

238
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:26,360
- It sets the scene.
- It's stupid is what it is.

239
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:28,362
It's sensual
and romantic.

240
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:30,197
Ronny, it's unrealistic. This whole
writing career is unrealistic.

241
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:33,242
Ronny, it's unrealistic. This whole
writing career is unrealistic.

242
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,036
Hey, we're married now,
baby, we gotta get serious.

243
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:39,289
- This is serious.
- Honey, I been patient,
but this writing thing...

244
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,668
just ain't takin' off, and I want
a baby before I get so old...

245
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,920
- I can't get my butt back.
- You gotta give me a chance, honey.

246
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:48,882
I have to express myself creatively.
We payin' the bills, aren't we ?

247
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,301
- Uh ! Fuck me ! Shit !
- What ?

248
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,846
Not you, honey. Hold on for a sec.
You scared the shit out of me !

249
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,390
Sorry, Ronny.
I gotta ask a favor, man.

250
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,350
- I'm not lettin' you out of here.
- Aw, come on, man.

251
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,352
- Jus-Just for lunch. Please.
- Look, your mom told me...

252
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,688
the next time I let you loose,
I was gonna be fired.

253
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:06,149
- Look, man.
I got a date with Molly tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,111
And I want to make it special.
What do you say ?

255
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,949
Look, I promise I'll be back
for afternoon classes.

256
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,451
Huh ? I just want
to get a gift.

257
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,537
Come on, man, have a heart.

258
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:25,085
No. No. Can't do it.

259
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:28,463
Aw, come on, man.
Okay, how about this ?

260
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,967
- You accidentally press the gate.
- Mm-hmm.

261
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,219
And when you have
your back turned, we sneak out.

262
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,513
Ronny, don't you get your ass fired--

263
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,564
- Don't you do me wrong, okay ?
- Not a chance, man ! Cool.

264
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,066
- All right.
- Get outta here, get outta here.
Comb your hair.

265
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,986
- Just one more book.

266
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:54,072
Just one more, and I promise
I'll work with your daddy, all right ?

267
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,214
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, Jesus, Will.

268
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,717
- I'm sorry. I thought you saw me.
- No.

269
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,637
You see me now ?

270
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,473
How are you doin' ?

271
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,444
You wanna talk about it ?

272
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,741
I think I'm losing John.

273
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:24,746
I think he's finally
tired of my bullshit.

274
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:29,418
How about you ?

275
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,420
You tired of my bullshit ?

276
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:34,047
I'm a counselor.
I'm attracted to it.

277
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,888
- So counsel me.
- Oh, no. I know better.

278
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,182
I love you just
the way you are.

279
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,104
Do you think
it's possible...

280
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:51,106
that something so tragic
can happen to somebody...

281
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,108
that they never
recover from it ?

282
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:57,362
I like to believe that
recovery is always possible.

283
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:06,580
There's a little back story
that I haven't been, um...

284
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:13,003
- completely successful with.
- I know.

285
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:17,257
I've tried everything. I really have.
I've tried everything.

286
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:22,721
Twelve steps, uh,
self-help, group therapy,

287
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,643
shrinks, meditation--

288
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,482
- Everything.
- That's not everything.

289
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:37,528
Oh, yeah ?
What else is there ?

290
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:40,072
I'm a really
good listener.

291
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:52,000
Maybe.
Some night, by a...

292
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,002
warm fire.

293
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,135
I'll be right back.

294
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:11,270
Can I get another glass
of Chardonnay, please ?

295
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:16,275
- Today.
- Yes, ma'am.

296
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,277
Thank you.

297
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:31,165
Thanks.

298
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:36,378
Thank you very much.

299
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,769
God. I can't believe
we're doin' this.

300
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,855
- Desperate measures.
- It's illegal.

301
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:56,899
It's harmless,
and expected.

302
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,942
Studies have proven that
all teenagers, at some point...

303
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,737
- in their adolescent lives,
have shoplifted.
- What studies ?

304
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,697
Hey. We could have avoided
this whole thing...

305
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,699
if you woulda simply scored
some of your mom's booze.

306
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,202
- Look, my mom's a functioning
- alcoholic. She accounts for--
- John !

307
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:13,040
- John, what are you doing here ?
- Just gettin' some off-campus lunch.

308
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,710
You're not allowed to have
little off-campus lunches, John.

309
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:20,672
- You know that. You too, Charlie.
- Sorry, Miss Tate.

310
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:25,093
Come on,
I'll drive you back.

311
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,387
You know what ?
Charlie, here.

312
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:29,932
Go get in the car.
I'll be right there.

313
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,725
What the fuck
do you think you're doing ?

314
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,769
Mom, I'm really uncomfortable
with you saying that word.

315
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,980
Well, then don't put me
in the position, John.

316
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,608
Do you know
what day it is ?

317
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,777
Of all the days
for you to pull this shit--

318
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,491
What do you think you can do ?
Just wander around town ?

319
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,493
I don't ask you
for very much.

320
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,955
- Just give me one day !
- Mom, I've given you 17 years !

321
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,332
And I need you
to be responsible.

322
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,669
- Do you know what that means ?
- Responsible. Don't talk to me
about responsible, Mom !

323
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:03,215
- I just need this one thing !
- Mom, I am not responsible for you !

324
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,427
That's it. That's enough.
I can't take it, Mom.

325
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:09,429
He's dead.

326
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:12,558
Michael Myers is dead.

327
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,354
- What do you want me to say ?
- That it's over ?

328
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:22,234
That we should try to get on with
some attempt at a happy existence, Mom.

329
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,195
Because all the shit that's going on
in your head is leakin' out on me.

330
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:27,322
And I can't take it anymore.

331
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:32,661
You told me yourself
you watched him burn.

332
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:37,666
- I didn't e-exactly stay
to see his ashes, John.
- Mom, 20 years.

333
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,794
Twenty years.

334
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:43,714
Don't you think he would
have shown up by now ?

335
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:46,258
What's he waitin' for, huh ?

336
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,180
Okay, Mom. I can't live
like this. I'm sorry.

337
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:54,600
Wha--
What does that mean, John ?

338
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:56,977
If you want to stay handcuffed
to your dead brother, that's fine.

339
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,522
But you're not draggin' me along.
Not anymore.

340
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:10,657
- # Mister Sandman #
- Yes ?

341
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:15,537
# Bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a-- ##

342
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:32,971
Ronny ?

343
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:37,059
- Mom, let me.
- Where the hell is he ?

344
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,899
- Ronny !

345
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,069
Hey, Ronny !

346
00:34:02,084 --> 00:34:04,753
- Where the hell were you ?
- Norma told me to walk the perimeter.

347
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,549
And where were you
when these two got out ?

348
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,344
Eyes up, Ronny.

349
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:20,978
Psycho.

350
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:37,161
Okay, bye !

351
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:56,221
- Dennis !

352
00:34:56,305 --> 00:35:00,642
- Don't send down any more, all right ?
I gotta go to class.

353
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,622
Dennis ?

354
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:29,231
- Oh ! Uh !
- Shh ! The best part.

355
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:34,820
Oh !

356
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:37,322
Do I get points or what ?

357
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:39,366
Huh ?

358
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:43,162
You score. Yeah. Yeah.

359
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,581
Hmm. Well, it just
occurred to me today...

360
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:49,251
that I've never
celebrated Halloween before.

361
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,253
And why is that ?

362
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:54,089
Oh, we've got a psychotic
serial killer in the family,

363
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:56,633
Ioves to butcher people
on Halloween, and...

364
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:59,803
I just thought it
in bad taste to...

365
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,805
celebrate.

366
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,057
So why now ?

367
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:07,269
Mm, because there comes a point in your
life where you have to concentrate...

368
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,313
on what's right about it.

369
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:13,233
Really ?

370
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:19,281
And you...

371
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:21,658
are a sterling example...

372
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,660
of what's right.

373
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,499
And tonight you get
my full concentration.

374
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,462
I'm honored.

375
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:44,723
Very good point, A.J.
So, what could Victor have done...

376
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,808
to save Elizabeth ?

377
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,609
Anybody at all ?

378
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:01,323
Come on, people.
Did anybody read the book ?

379
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:06,745
Guys.
It's "Frahnk-en-steen."

380
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:10,958
- You could have watched the movie !

381
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,837
Molly. Please.

382
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,964
Do you have any thoughts
on Victor and Elizabeth ?

383
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,675
Well, uh--
Um...

384
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:23,136
Well, I think that Victor should have
confronted the monster sooner.

385
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,180
I mea-- He's completely responsible
for Elizabeth's death.

386
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:28,976
He was, he was so paralyzed by fear
that he never did anything.

387
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,812
It-lt took death
for the guy to get a clue.

388
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:36,441
And why do you think he was
finally able to confront his monster ?

389
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:39,945
I think that Victor had reached
a point in his life where he
had nothing left to lose.

390
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,781
I mean, the monster saw to that
by killing off everybody that he loved.

391
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:44,825
Victor finally
had to face it.

392
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,619
It was about redemption.
It was his fate.

393
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,793
Okay, everybody, um,
have a good time !

394
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,974
John !

395
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,568
What ?

396
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:29,328
It's a permission slip.

397
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,830
Bus leaves in 45 minutes.

398
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:35,375
- Go pack quick.
- Ma, I don't have to go.

399
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,377
Go, just go ! Have fun.

400
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:40,297
- You sure ?
- Yes. Look, it's good for you.

401
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,549
It's good for me.

402
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:45,928
So, just call me.
You know, call. And call.

403
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,472
If you feel like
you've called too many times,

404
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,891
call once more.

405
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:53,977
Have a great time.

406
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:56,188
Thanks, Mom.

407
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:05,322
- Hi. So what was that all about ?
- Hey.

408
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:07,324
She changed her mind
about Yosemite.

409
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:09,409
- So now you're goin' ?

410
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,411
Ah, I wouldn't say that.

411
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:33,100
I don't know.
If we were at the midterm--

412
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:36,144
No, she's doing fine.

413
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:39,356
No--

414
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:46,738
Mrs. Cheney,
can I call you right back ?

415
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:10,304
- Uh, oh ! Oh !
- Damn it !

416
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:14,600
Oh, Miss Tate, I'm-l'm so sorry.
I-l didn't mean to make you jump.

417
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:18,103
- It's okay.
- Well, it's Halloween.
I guess everyone...

418
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:20,564
- is entitled to one good scare.

419
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:25,319
- I've had my share.
- U-Uh, Miss Tate,

420
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:27,988
I know it's not my place.

421
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:31,992
If I could be maternal
for a moment,

422
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,828
I don't like
to see you like this.

423
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:38,290
I've seen you
like this before, and...

424
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:41,877
we've all had bad
things happen to us.

425
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,631
The trick is
to concentrate on today !

426
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,718
What do I know ?

427
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,931
You just take care
of yourself, okay ?

428
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:56,308
Thank you very much.
I'll see you Monday.

429
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:05,984
Oh ! Mi-Miss Tate,
uh, Happy Halloween.

430
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:08,797
"She took off her clothes,
revealing her satiny-soft femininity.

431
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:10,966
And Lawrence looked at her
with lust in his eyes...

432
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:14,386
and said, 'l want to invade
every part of your being.

433
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:17,556
I want to tantalize myself
with your sweet nectar.'"

434
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,600
Old Tanya better not
fall for that shit.

435
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:23,020
- I smell that a mile away.
- "And Tanya laughed at him.

436
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:25,063
'You don't expect me to fall
for that shit,' she said."

437
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:27,983
That's right,
make her smart. That's it.

438
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:30,068
- Oh, shit, honey, someone's here.
Can I call you back ?

439
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,321
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'll hold on.
I wanna know what stupid line...

440
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:35,115
-Tanya falls for.
-The same one you did. Hold on a second.

441
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,838
- Hello !

442
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:51,840
Hello !

443
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,780
- Hey, honey.
- What's up ? Where did you go ?

444
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:59,950
I don't know. Some car at the gate.
I'm gonna have to call you.

445
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:20,596
- Hey.
- Wait, wait. What's goin' on, baby ?

446
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,390
- I don't know.

447
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,684
Honey-- Where'd you--
Ronny !

448
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,979
You always fuckin' doin' this. You get
me goin', and then you gotta go. Ro--

449
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:33,567
Hello ?

450
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,287
- Aah !
- Oh !

451
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,789
I keep scaring you today.

452
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:13,667
Wh-What are you doing ?

453
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,670
Uh, n--

454
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:21,592
Nothing. I, um--

455
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:23,635
What are you doing ?

456
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:26,763
I'm making the rounds. I still
have to check on the kids, but...

457
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:30,726
I was hoping I would have the honor of
spending the evening with you tonight.

458
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,147
I'd like the company.

459
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,525
- Give me 20.
- Okay.

460
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:40,527
I'm okay.

461
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,921
Hello ?

462
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:03,342
Do you want to die tonight, Cici ?

463
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:07,679
- Oh, uh, come on... in.

464
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:11,767
Sarah, Molly.

465
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:16,021
Just checking on the Hillcrest remains.
You girls okay ?

466
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:19,399
- Good. Thanks, Mr. Brennan.
- And how are you, Mr. Brennan ?
Looking cute as ever.

467
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:21,944
Thank you, Sarah.
What are you two up to tonight ?

468
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:24,530
Well, we thought we'd hit the town,
pick up some guys.

469
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:27,449
You know, drop some Roofies in their
drinks. Have a whole date-rape evening.

470
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:29,827
- Oh. Sounds good.
- Care to join us ?

471
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,704
I can't. I'm, uh, I'm having
my nipples pierced.

472
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,998
- Oh.
- But you two have a good time.

473
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:38,126
- Will do.
- If you need anything,
contact me or Miss Tate.

474
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,295
- Okay ?
- Thanks, Mr. Brennan.

475
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:42,005
Behave.

476
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:45,551
- My stash. Come on.

477
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:53,016
- Come on.
- All right. Send it through here.

478
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:57,104
Come on, man. Let's go.

479
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,440
Yeah.

480
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:02,442
Come on.

481
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:06,405
John.

482
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,615
Come on !

483
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:13,162
I got you.

484
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:59,583
Fuck it.

485
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,637
I thought we'd do this right.

486
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:13,639
Come on in.

487
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:20,312
Oh, I love food.
I really do.

488
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:23,232
I hope you don't mind
if I get really big and dumpy.

489
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:25,275
- It's my goal in life.
- Oh, no.

490
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:28,737
I, uh, I always found obesity
to be very sexy.

491
00:50:28,821 --> 00:50:31,156
God, you are so Renaissance.

492
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:45,420
Oh, the buffet has arrived !

493
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:47,965
Ah, for your pleasure tonight,

494
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:52,636
we have prepared Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday's Hillcrest dinner selections,

495
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:55,264
ignoring Meat Loaf Monday
and Turkey Tuesday.

496
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:58,684
- Thank you very much.
I hate that meat loaf.
- Where's the booze ?

497
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:01,728
- We need a corkscrew for that.
- Oh, I'll go get it.

498
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:05,482
- Just don't start anything without me.
- Don't worry.

499
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:33,302
I'm not who you think I am.

500
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:36,805
Okay.

501
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:38,807
Who are you ?

502
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:44,146
My name's not Keri Tate.

503
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:47,316
Mmm.

504
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:49,318
What is it ?

505
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,655
Laurie Strode.

506
00:51:57,618 --> 00:51:59,661
- Strode ?
- Strode.

507
00:51:59,745 --> 00:52:02,080
Okay.

508
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:04,917
I changed my name
when I went into hiding.

509
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,921
Oh, I like that.
That's like-- Iike the--
Iike the witness protection program.

510
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:12,257
What, did you like rat out
the mob or something ?

511
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:18,597
My brother killed my sister...

512
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,016
- when she was 17.
- Wow.

513
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:24,061
Well, that's... "sucky."

514
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,065
How'd he do that ?

515
00:52:28,106 --> 00:52:31,276
With a really big,
sharp kitchen knife.

516
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,737
That's terrible.

517
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,739
Take off your clothes.

518
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:37,825
You said you'd listen.

519
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:40,702
Okay.

520
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,377
They locked him up
for a long time,

521
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,880
but he got out and...

522
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:54,550
he came after me,

523
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:57,386
but I got away.

524
00:52:57,469 --> 00:53:01,014
But he killed
a lot of my friends.

525
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:07,146
- It happened--
- On Halloween.

526
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:10,315
- You've heard the story.
- Who hasn't ?

527
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:14,570
Michael Myers.

528
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:17,239
It's like 20 years ago, right ?

529
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:19,992
1978.

530
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:23,078
And the girl that-- What happened
to the sister ? She died, right ?

531
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:28,333
No, she faked her death.

532
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:32,713
And now she's the headmistress...

533
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:36,383
of a very posh, secluded
private school in northern California.

534
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,677
What ?

535
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,180
Hoping and praying every year...

536
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:45,642
that her brother won't find her.

537
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:48,145
You're tellin' me the truth ?

538
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:54,443
- Now do you want a drink ?
- Yeah.

539
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,487
I'll be right back.

540
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:10,501
Explains a lot, doesn't it ?

541
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:14,213
So you-- you have been living
with this for 20 years ?

542
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:17,508
Something like that.

543
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:20,385
But honey, you-you don't--

544
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:22,888
You don't think that
after all this time h-he'd--

545
00:54:22,971 --> 00:54:26,141
he'd still be comin'
after you, do you ?

546
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:31,522
He sat in a sanitarium
for 15 years, waiting for me.

547
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,108
And then...

548
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:41,448
one rainy night, he decides
to go trick-or-treating.

549
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:49,665
How old were you ?

550
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,090
Seventeen.

551
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:02,845
What ?

552
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:08,058
Do you think they made it to Yosemite ?
Do you think they're there ?

553
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:12,479
- I don't know.
- I just-- I just want
to call Johnny. Just--

554
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:18,277
What is it ?
Keri, what are you doing ?

555
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,279
My phone's dead.

556
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:26,118
Shit.

557
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:40,007
- What's goin' on ?
- Somebody didn't go to Yosemite.

558
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:42,259
Keri. Uh, what are you doing ?

559
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:45,512
- I'm just gonna go find John.
- Th-- This is nuts.

560
00:55:45,596 --> 00:55:48,015
I hope so.

561
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,810
- Jesus !
- Christ !

562
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:53,979
Ronny, the phones are out.

563
00:55:54,062 --> 00:55:57,107
I know, and there's a strange car
parked down at the gate,

564
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:59,860
but I can't seem to find
any signs of trespassing.

565
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:02,821
- Fuck.
- Okay, th-there's no reason
to get upset yet.

566
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:05,157
Let's just calm down.

567
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:07,618
Look, I'm gonna go look
for John and the kids.

568
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:11,455
See if you can get the phones
working, and we'll meet back
at the gate, okay ? Come on.

569
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:15,918
Charlie !

570
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:18,295
Charlie ?

571
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:21,340
Where are you, Charlie ?
We're waiting on you.

572
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:26,011
Charlie.

573
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:28,514
Inconsiderate,
party of one,

574
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:30,849
your table's ready.

575
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,980
Charlie ?

576
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:45,656
Hi ! Gotcha.

577
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:47,658
You shit.

578
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,369
I found these,
but no corkscrew.

579
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,789
Come on. I'm hungry !
Where are you going now ?

580
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:56,333
To see if there's
a corkscrew upstairs.

581
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,627
- I'll be right back.

582
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,880
- Charlie.

583
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:34,413
Shit.

584
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:20,667
Hi.

585
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:48,862
- Shit.

586
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:52,324
Lights up, Charlie.

587
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:55,327
No sex games
till I've eaten.

588
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:01,750
Fuck.

589
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:15,222
Charlie.

590
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:18,183
Charlie, what are you--

591
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:21,436
Oh, shit !
Oh, my God !

592
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:25,566
No !

593
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,736
Oh, my--

594
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:37,035
Aaah !

595
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,881
Oh !

596
00:59:55,387 --> 00:59:57,973
- Oh !

597
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:22,414
# They're laid to rest before ##

598
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:25,417
- Did you hear that ?
- No. What was that ?

599
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:27,419
## [ Off ]

600
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:31,089
I'm gonna go check
on those guys.

601
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:33,342
They've been gone
for a while.

602
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:35,511
- What do you think they're doin' ?
- Hmm.

603
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:38,013
- Mm-hmm.
- Kind of rates a cheap scare,
doesn't it ?

604
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:40,015
- Let's go.
- All right.

605
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:55,531
Oh, fuck !

606
01:00:55,614 --> 01:00:57,616
Please.

607
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,211
Oh, please !

608
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:35,904
- Hello !
- Maybe they just skipped to dessert.

609
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,534
- What the hell's that ?
- Oh, man.

610
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,330
What the fuck ?

611
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:58,677
This is a sick joke.

612
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:26,747
- Oh, shit !

613
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:30,459
Who's that ?

614
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:33,086
- Let's get out of here.

615
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:36,006

All right, what do we do ?

01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:33,267
Try to live.

Go.

I want you to drive down
the street to the Becker's.

677
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,798
It's a mile down the road. Tell them

Don't move.

01:15:39,331 --> 01:15:41,750
Load him in !
