Maybe not.
I mean... maybe he really meant it.

It might be terrific.
You might have a really good time.

Hey, Carrie, I wanna talk to you. It's about
this attitude you have about yourself.

369
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,515
You're always walkin' around
with your hair down, all mopin' around...

Carrie?

Come here, you big silly.
I want you to look at yourself.

372
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,356
Would you look at that?

373
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,476
Come on.

374
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,956
Now, that's a pretty girl.
Look at your eyes!

375
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,712
Little mascara to bring it out?

376
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:18,437
Your lips... Try some lipstick. You have
nice pretty lips. And your cheekbones.

377
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,680
Look at your hair. It's beautiful hair. You
could just put it up a little, add a little curl.

378
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,756
What do you think?

379
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,438
Yeah!

00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:28,997
Well?

381
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,359
- Well, what do you wanna know?
- Why Tommy asked her to the prom.

382
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,355
- Well?
- I asked him to.

383

Why?

385
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,078
What could you have had in mind?

386
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,389
I thought it would be good for Carrie to
get her to join in and be with people...

387
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,795
- Make her a part ofthings?
- Right.

Come on, Sue. We're not that stupid.

389

- Neither is Carrie.
- Maybe not. I don't know.

390
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,557
You mean you're not gonna go?
Stay in and miss your own senior prom?

391
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,397
Come in.

392
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,398
- What is it?
- The attendance sheets, Miss Collins.

393
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,671
You know you can't go without a date.

394
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,670
- Is there anything else, Norma?
- No, Miss Collins.

395
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,394
- Which brings us to you.
- I have to get to practice.

396
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,670
Well, it's too bad, isn't it?

397
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,110
- If you don't mind, it's between Sue and I.
- But I do mind.

398
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,995
Unless, of course, you'd like to continue
this little discussion in Mr Morton's office.

399

What is the big deal?!

400

Because it is a very big deal
for Carrie White, and you know it.

401
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,668
- She already said no anyway.
- With a little effort you can change that.

402
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,519
- Don't count your chickens.
- Just don't try.

- Fine. I won't try.

- Grab a chair.

I'm gonna go and talk to some people.

647
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,838
I remember my prom.

648
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,999
I had a date with the captain
ofthe basketball team.

649
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,237
And he was six feet seven inches tall, so...

650
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:40,152
...I bought a pair ofthree-inch heels so our
kiss goodnight would be less awkward.

651
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,669
So anyway, we went
in his pick-up truck...

652
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,675
...which of course broke down, and we
had to walk the last half mile to the prom.

653
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,510
By the time I got there, my feet were so
blistered that all I could do was sit there.

654
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,509
I couldn't dance.
So we just sat there and, uh... just talked.

655
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,116
And... it was magic. Is it like thatfor you?

656
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,996
It's, um...

657
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,795
- It's nice.
- Just nice?

658
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,433
No. It's...

659
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,476
It's like, uh...

660
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,235
- It's like bein' on Mars.
- You'll never forget it.

661
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,516
I don't think I will.

What are you doing with my date?

664
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,830

- Yeah?

665

I won't.

672
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,957
Yeah, I promised.

673
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,158

- That's OK.
- What?

678
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,036

I don't wanna spoil anything.

What I was gonna say...

680
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:30,196
...is that, if you'd like to, we could stop in
at the Beehive for a couple of minutes.

681
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,197
- I've never been there.
- No?

682
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,875
Good! Well, then, let's go!

683

- OK.
- OK? For sure.

<i>(mother) They're all gonna laugh at you! </i>

775
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,959
<i>They're all gonna laugh at you! </i>

776
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,038

- <i>They're all gonna laugh at you! </i>

779
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:55,071

- <i>They're all gonna laugh at you! </i>

780
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,112
<i>(Miss Collins) Trust me, Carrie. </i>
<i>You can trust</i> me.

781
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,118
<i>Trust me, Carrie. You can trust</i> me.

782
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,357
<i>Trust me, Carrie. You can trust</i> me.

783
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,516
<i>(laughs)</i>

784
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,710
Come on, let's go. Billy!

785
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,071
- <i>They're all gonna laugh at you! </i>

- <i>We're all sorry, Cassie. </i>

787
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,551
- <i>Trust me, Carrie. </i>
- <i>They're all gonna laugh at you! </i>

788
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,636
<i>(voices continue)</i>

789
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,835
Somebody open this door!

790
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,311
<i>(current buzzes)</i>

791
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,916
Help! Help!

792
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,354
<i>(panicked cries)</i>

793
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,996
<i>(screaming)</i>

794
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,993
Can't these students calm down?

795
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,593
Mr Fromm! Mr Fromm!

796
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,599
Carrie!

797
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,309
Carrie...!

798
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,396
<i>(screaming)</i>

799
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,236
<i>(siren)</i>

800
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,558
Mama?

801
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,235
Mama?

802
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,636
Mama? Mama, it was bad, Mama.

803
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,591
They laughed at me.

804
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,188
Mama, hold me.

805
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,955
Hold me, Mama. Please, hold me!

806
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:12,392
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

807
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,154
After the first time, before we were
married, Ralph promised never again.

808
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,350
He promised. And I believed him.

809
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,594
But sin never dies.

810
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,160
Sin never dies.

811
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,516
Atfirst it was all right. We lived sinlessly.

812
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,716
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.

813
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,836
And then, that night...

814
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,878
I saw him looking down at me that way.

815
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,276
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

816
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,713
I smelt the whisky on his breath.

817
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:10,032
And he took me... He took me...

818
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:16,036
...with the stink ofthe filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.

819
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:19,516
And I liked it. I liked it!

820
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,479
With all that dirty touchin'
of his hands all over me...

821
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,468
...I should have given you to God
when you were born.

822
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,751
But I was weak and backsliding.

823
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,072
And now the devil has come home.

824
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,830
- We'll pray.
- Yes.

825
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,712
We'll pray.

826
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,156
We'll pray. We'll pray.

827
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,349
For the last time,

828
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,195
we'll pray.

829
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,277
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

830
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:11,037
...thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

831
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,876

<i>(phone)</i>

836
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,597
Hello?

837
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,311
Oh, Betty, thank God it's you.

838
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:28,752
I don't think I could've handled
one more reporter.

839
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,839
Yeah, well... We're all a little edgy.

840
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,429
She's better. Well...
sleeping too much, I guess...

841
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:43,236
...but Dr Schneider said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.

842
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:49,873
Well, he said that she's young enough
so that she'll forget all about it in time.

843
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,197
<i>No. I wouldn't let her go to the funerals. </i>

844
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:58,838
<i>With Tommy and all the others gone, </i>
<i>it's best wejust go away for a while. </i>

845
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,274
<i>(screams)</i>

846
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:28,957
It's all right!

847
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:38,639
It's all right. I'm here. It's all right.

848
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,591
It's all right. I'm here.

849
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,956
