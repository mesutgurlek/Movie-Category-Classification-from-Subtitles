177
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,489
Nora! The operation is not
on the map.

178

Hey, little one,
Smoking is prohibited here.

184
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,732
Was it all, ask what you wanted?

185
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:30,293
40 women in Europe.
Nearly 100 of the world. - And the men?

186
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,618
Are extinct.
- They were too loud, too greedy and too stupid.

187
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,768
One part was the hand of man, the rest
We have killed himself and vowed to

188
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,213
never to bite another, the gift

If you turn on me again,
I let cheer up!

200
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,530
I know
That was alittle bit hard.

201
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,493
But he is sweet, right?

202
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,170
And why do you treat him so bad?

203
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,259
I do not want to hurt him.
- But you have now!

204
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,373
I mean, really hurt.

205
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,219
People go so terribly
quickly broken.

206

You are so beautiful.

212
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,775

00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:45,379
I could not kip. - What's wrong?
Do not know.

218
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,699
I'm afraid of missing something.
- If you want to grow old here,

219
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,938
then you search for 'n to compensate for that shit.
- You mean 'n hobby oderwas?

220
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,609
Private life, I mean.
Cuddle, cuddle.

00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,980
I'm working on.

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,856
(Music)

223
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,740
Are you going away?

224
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,776
I was not there two nights! Did the

225
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,297
Lena?

226
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,932
How did you find me?
- Hi. I should have hardly recognized.

227
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,893
You are standing in the police computer.

Have too much fear in front of you!
Wait a minute.

230
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,458
You're an asshole, what with girls
is, 'n some small change ready buttons.

231
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:54,653
I sit up a bag for you at your
18 months probation for stealing a car from!

232
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,613

234
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,653

235
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,659
I want to wash's still

00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,014
If only 's dress.

I've only seen it once!
- In my job gets added to watch.

241
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,736
Your hair, for example, are different now,
not stained. Or your shoes.

242
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,611
So shoes you have not previously taken
this can be observed on your shaky transition.

243
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,300
Anything else?
- Yes.

244

00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,176
Are you leaving me alone then?
- We have only just begun.

246
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,860

253
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,009
Well, someone who seems all right.

254
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,932

258
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,379
Pickpocket was always
your dream job? - Is over.

259
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,900
Sounds cool.

260
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,693
Did I say something wrong?

261
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,097
I must go. - Real, right?
Yes.

262
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,736

00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:26,293
Come on, Lena. Why should we
not again? That makes no sense.

267
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,378
I get trouble with my boyfriend.

268
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,092
Do you think I can those clothes
? Afford Is my way out of here.

269
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:39,374
I do not want to grow old.
- You are 'ne disaster as a liar!

270
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,776
(Music)

271
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,376

(Operatic aria)

273
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:26,338
Have you had enough of the nightlife?

274
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,894
Louise would say now,
You get used up.

275
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,178
She wants
you like it with us.

276
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:42,258
I was at some point it too depressing.
And now she thinks you were the one

277
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,338
after which she studied for centuries.

278
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,249
You should not disappoint them better.

279
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:58,012
I was a very untalented actress.
Talking movies I would not have survived.

280
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,691
Louise and I were at the premiere
the first time taken.

281
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,611
My husband and my little daughter
are then driven up already.

282
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:17,053
If you had bitten me otherwise?

The women now seem to be moody.
- You spoil us too much.

285
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:33,014
This torment no unfulfilled wishes.
- I miss the sun.

286
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:40,532

291
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,579
Who are you? Are you a cop?
- Gun down! Very slowly!

292
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,211

298
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,339
What did she say that?
- We will come to them in the water.

299
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,779
This is still so much room.

Even if he would stay with you

01:23:00,952 --> 01:23:05,503
which I doubt, then it is
at most another 60 years given.

441
01:23:06,152 --> 01:23:08,985

Then you are alone,
