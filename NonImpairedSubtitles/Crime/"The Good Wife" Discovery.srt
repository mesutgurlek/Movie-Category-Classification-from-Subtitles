Let me know if I'm not in frame.

20
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,650
I can move down.

21
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,185
I'm not wearing a camera.

22
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,352
Oh, how considerate.

23
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,088
Let's skip
the hostility, please.

24
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,824
She went out of her way to
make us look like bigots.

25
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,292
I think I'm being pretty
friendly, considering.

26
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,161
I can see you went
with diversity in hiring.

27
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,162
How are Biff and Skippy?

28
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,730
Mike and Brian.

29
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,432
What can we do
for you, Monica?

30
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,235
I can't imagine that
you're here to apologize.

31
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,304
A friend of mine was
recently run out of business

32
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,605
by a giant tech company.

33
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,440
I'm bringing suit.

34
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,176
And you don't have the resources
to pursue the case on your own?

35
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,177
You said to call
if I needed help.

36
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,445
You've complicated
our relationship

37
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,297
since I made that offer.
True.

38
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,148
But at least we know we can
be direct with each other.

39
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,351
Besides, it could be
good for your image.

40
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,520
How?
The company
I'm suing is even

41
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,555
more lacking
in diversity than yours.

42
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,324
And what company is that?

43
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,558
Chumhum.

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,528
And you want us to help?

45
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,430
Well, actually, I need Lucca
to help, but I know you two

46
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:12,698
have this Bert
and Ernie thing going.

47
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,901
Well, why me?

48
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,770
Alicia's the one
that's worked with Chumhum.

49
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,873
Well, it's a racism case.

50
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:24,543
And, uh, my firm's
a little pale at the moment.

51
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:26,478
What an honor.
My parents would be so proud.

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,280
Who's suing?

53
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,716
WOMAN: We used to book up
weeks in advance.

54
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,818
Our venison pot pie was
written up in the<i> Trib.</i>

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,486
We were Zagat rated.

56
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,788
Then people just stopped coming.

57
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,724
It's hard not to take it
personally when it's your baby.

58
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,792
And why is Chumhum
responsible?

59
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:44,263
Their maps program--
Chummy Maps--

60
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,265
it's supposed to help
users stay safe

61
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,733
by giving them directions

62
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:50,569
to avoid the dangerous
parts of the city.

63
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,571
Green's safe, yellow's so-so,

64
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,673
and red means "stay away."

65
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,675
When the filter's on,

66
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,944
driving directions
avoid the red areas.

67
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,547
The filter is always
on by default.

68
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,682
You have to manually
turn it off.

69
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,450
So you lost your foot traffic?

70
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,552
And this--
watch when I

71
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,687
toggle the filter on and off.

72
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,523
MONICA:
It doesn't show businesses
in the red parts of the map.

73
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,559
When this came out, it
was like I didn't exist.

74
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,194
It says this is an unsafe area?

75
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,496
Yes, a red zone.

76
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,500
It doesn't feel unsafe.

77
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,468
MONICA: Yes, except
for one thing.

78
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,904
Too many people of color.

79
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,406
MAN:
<i> Our maps are not racist.</i>

80
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:29,608
It's run by an algorithm.

81
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,777
And math is not racist.

82
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,613
Chumhum is very proud
of its diversity and openness.

83
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,448
DIANE: And yet their
Safe Filter

84
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,783
deters people
from patronizing businesses

85
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,418
in African-American
neighborhoods.

86
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,786
LUCCA:
Chumhum is not responsible

87
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,555
for the actions of those
who respond to its software.

88
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,957
It was Ms. Feldman's choice
to open a four-star restaurant

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,658
in a marginal neighborhood,
not ours.

90
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,893
It isn't a marginal
neighborhood,

91
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,695
It's a black neighborhood.

92
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,230
Well, it's both, which really

93
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,765
isn't that uncommon.
Wait, what?!

94
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,434
Well, he's not saying
anything that unusual.

95
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,703
Look at crime rates.
Look at home values.

96
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,539
And look at the biracial lawyer
pimping for a racist system.

97
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,641
Excuse me?!
Are you actually saying--?

98
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,576
(all talking at once)

99
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,777
Let's not make this personal,
guys. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

100
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,012
Hey, wait.

101
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,681
Chumhum will admit
no wrongdoing.

102
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:13,619
But in the spirit of making
this world a better place,

103
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,588
Mr. Harman is willing to
offer Ms. Feldman $50,000

104
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,590
to open a new restaurant
anywhere she wants.

105
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,259
Consider it a gesture.
MONICA: What
gesture is that?

106
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,393
The finger?

107
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,962
Chumhum is worth 300 billion.

108
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,564
I know how much my company
is worth, thank you.

109
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,332
CARY: Is that because your
stock's dropped 22%

110
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,867
since you became COO?

111
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,401
HARMAN: Wow, seriously?
Okay, Cary, you don't
need to go there.

112
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,553
Want to fight dirty now?

113
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:32,703
You know what?
You know what?

114
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,872
No, we're done!

115
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,575
Your guy's a piece of work.

116
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,410
Unfortunately for you,
the law's on his side.

117
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,911
We'll see.

118
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,847
PAIGE:<i> You're kind of</i>
<i> in love with her,</i>

119
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:42,914
aren't you?

120
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,449
Who?

121
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,584
Alicia.

122
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,986
(scoffs)
No.

123
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:51,056
You just talked about her
for the last 30 minutes.

124
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,591
Occupational hazard.

125
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,692
You have to be obsessed
with your candidate,

126
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,826
or you're not doing your job.

127
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,295
"Candidate"?

128
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,366
Well, the question is
will the voters think

129
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,702
she's still tainted
by her scandal?

130
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,913
You're staring at me.
I can feel it.

131
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,383
I can't help it.

132
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,986
You are very sexy
when you're writing a check.

133
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,689
(laughs)

134
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,594
$50,000?

135
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,463
Convene a focus group.

136
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,633
See if you've resurrected
St. Alicia.

137
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,835
ALICIA:
<i> But above all else,</i>

138
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,870
I am a mother,
and it's as a mother

139
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,374
I am asking for your support,
Webster City.

140
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:45,344
I know ethanol can make
a difference for our children.

141
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:48,113
So please remember,
a vote for Florrick

142
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,615
is a vote for family.

143
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,017
Really?

144
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,652
I feel like I'm pandering
to housewives.

145
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,720
Anyone who knows me will smell

146
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,521
the bullcrap a mile away.

147
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,723
Yes, but it's Iowa.

148
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,391
All they smell is bullcrap.

149
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,826
Look, these e-mail blasts

150
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,394
aren't meant to be subtle.

151
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,562
They're a sledgehammer.

152
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,629
So don't pull back.

153
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,565
Okay, what's
the next city?

154
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,934
Three, two...

155
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,502
Hello, voters

156
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,770
of Sioux Center.

157
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,905
I'm Alicia Florrick.

158
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,474
As the mother
of two incredible--

159
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,908
(door opens)

160
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,043
um...

161
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,645
(door closes)
kids... I, um,

162
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,813
love and adore...

163
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,648
Do you need a minute?

164
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,717
Yeah, it just...
thanks.

165
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,153
Hey.
Hi.

166
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,588
What's wrong?

167
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,524
Uh, nothing.

168
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,729
All right,
so I have something to say.

169
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,798
Okay.

170
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,100
Now, we agreed that I would
stay freelance, right?

171
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,602
Yes.

172
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,669
That's how I keep
my fee low.

173
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,004
And part of that

174
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,607
freelance work has taken me

175
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,741
to Lockhart/Agos.

176
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,843
I know.

177
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,079
Well, clearly
you have some

178
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,615
hard feelings toward them,

179
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,817
but, Alicia,

180
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,853
I would never use

181
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,155
information gleaned
from here--

182
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,756
Oh, no I never
thought you would.

183
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,592
But if you have some sort of
issue with this arrangement,

184
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,161
then we should talk,
because I need to know

185
00:07:09,163 --> 00:07:12,931
whether I can
continue working here.

186
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,869
I want you to work here.

187
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,572
Even if freelancing
takes me to Lockhart/Agos?

188
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,707
Yes.

189
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,609
Good.

190
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,712
I have something
for your motion to dismiss.

191
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,648
Oh, I thought
you were gonna say

192
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,017
you were going to Lockhart/Agos
for this case.

193
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,185
No.

194
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,053
Unless you want me to.

195
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,054
No. Shut up.

196
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,923
(both chuckle)

197
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:40,959
Uh, here.

198
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:41,960
(laughs)

199
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,762
Thank you.

200
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,730
JUDGE MARX:
<i> You're suing Chumhum</i>

201
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,232
for tortious interference

202
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,900
with prospective
economic advantage?

203
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,970
Yes, Your Honor,
Chumhum's Safe Filter

204
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,740
creates a racist geofencing
effect that disadvantages

205
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,776
business owners in African-
American neighborhoods.

206
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,511
Your Honor, tortious
interference requires

207
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:03,482
proof of either purposeful
or knowing interference.

208
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,984
And there is none here.
We believe there is, Your Honor.

209
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,219
I'd like to call
a witness to show

210
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,688
that the intent requirement
is not met.

211
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,890
Mr. Harman, is it possible
for Chumhum's Safe Filter

212
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,861
to have a racist intent?

213
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,597
No, the filter is powered by two
things, and two things only:

214
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,665
objective third party
statistics--

215
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,234
uh, crime rates, for example--

216
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,870
and user-generated
feedback data.

217
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,571
Like comments and reviews?
Yes, exactly.

218
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,840
Which is entirely
in the users' hands.

219
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,942
I mean, there's no way
that anyone at Chumhum

220
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,844
could use a Safe Filter

221
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,081
to purposefully interfere
with plaintiff's business?

222
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,949
No, not even if we wanted to.
Thank you.

223
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,619
DIANE: Mr. Harman, is it
true that Chummy Maps

224
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:44,189
is only available on cOS--
Chumhum's own operating system?

225
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,590
Yes.

226
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,892
This is a recent study done

227
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,994
by the Internet
Research Foundation.

228
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,896
Could you read

229
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,564
what it says right there?

230
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,066
Uh, "cOS users are 71%...

231
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,068
Caucasian."

232
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,170
DIANE: And what percentage of
cOS users are African-American?

233
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,839
Does it say?

234
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,873
Eleven percent.

235
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,108
DIANE: And do these numbers

236
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,677
match your own
market research?

237
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,712
Chumhum is not to blame
for socioeconomic disparity.

238
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,015
Our products cost more because
they are better products.

239
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:14,786
So you knew about the disparity
between white and black users?

240
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:17,155
HARMAN: Again, our products
are not intentionally

241
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,890
targeted toward
Caucasians.

242
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,293
Yes, but if your
user-generated feedback data

243
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,296
is being generated predominately
by white users,

244
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,299
doesn't it follow that
the results will be skewed?

245
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,167
Objection, speculation.
JUDGE: Perhaps.

246
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,002
And yet I'm still curious.

247
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,571
HARMAN: Would the results
be skewed? No.

248
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,972
DIANE: Really?
If you allow

249
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,941
one racial group to
dominate a discussion

250
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,742
about what neighborhood
is safe, you don't think

251
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,011
the results will be skewed?
ALICIA: Objection!

252
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,580
Asked and answered.
You're right.

253
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:42,948
I'm just giving him
a chance to rethink.

254
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,916
But it seems
he doesn't want to.

255
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,651
Withdrawn.

256
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,289
Purposeful
or knowing interference

257
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,059
doesn't just mean
the defendant<i> knew</i>

258
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,861
his product could
have a disparately

259
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,196
racist effect.

260
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,965
It also means...

261
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,967
he should've known.

262
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,001
We lost.

263
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,936
Mr. Harman admits he knew

264
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,037
their data was being generated

265
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,339
primarily by Caucasians,

266
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,008
so an argument can be made

267
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,309
that he should have known

268
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,744
what would result.

269
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,779
Ms. Quinn, Mrs. Florrick,

270
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,349
your motion
to dismiss is denied.

271
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,249
Request full discovery,
Your Honor.

272
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,918
Your Honor!

273
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,053
Plaintiff is only asking
for full discovery

274
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,623
in order to force us to settle.

275
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,891
Poking around
all of Chumhum's products

276
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,394
would compromise trade secrets.

277
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,196
JUDGE: But you can't shut
them out entirely.

278
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,164
I'm granting
the discovery motion

279
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,866
and limiting it to items

280
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,735
related to racist references

281
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:37,902
and Chummy Maps.

282
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,704
(gavel bangs)

283
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,807
What do you think?

284
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,276
Small.

285
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,112
You don't get
claustrophobic in here?

286
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,047
I'm actually
starting to like it.

287
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,915
Yeah, Stockholm syndrome.

288
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,384
I meant what do you think
about the focus group?

289
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:54,653
You want to run her
for a senate seat?

290
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,888
To start.
Alicia Florrick.

291
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,406
Wife of the Illinois governor?

292
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,923
A woman who stood by her husband
during his worst moments.

293
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,095
Housewives--
Republican and Democratic.

294
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,665
And independents.
How large a sampling?

295
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,967
Whatever I can get for $50,000.
But we have to have

296
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,870
ironclad waivers. Nobody
can know we're doing this.

297
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,972
Especially not Alicia.
Why not Alicia?

298
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,174
Because I'm using it
to convince her.

299
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,009
(laughing)

300
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,278
Yup, good old Eli.
(phone rings)

301
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,980
Yeah.

302
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,782
What's wrong?

303
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,098
Gina, could you come in here?

304
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,169
Do we need the
Cone of Silence?

305
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,806
Alicia and Jason Crouse.

306
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,307
I have no idea what that means.

307
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,443
Jason Crouse.
Alicia's investigator.

308
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,944
I know who he is--

309
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:55,146
Are they having an affair?

310
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,118
No, of course not.

311
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,287
No.
He came by the apartment

312
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,255
while I was filming
Alicia's Internet ads

313
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,091
and she touched him.

314
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,792
Touched him where?

315
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:08,960
His arm.

316
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,428
Like a massage?

317
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,064
No, not like a massage.
Then let it go.

318
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,800
She touched his arm.
People touch each other's arms.

319
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,936
She was smiling at him
like a schoolgirl, Eli.

320
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,272
And not just in front of me--
in front of the whole crew.

321
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:27,011
Eli, I want to be clear here.

322
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,013
They were touching

323
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,750
in front of strangers
with cameras.

324
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,984
Okay, let me look into it.
Now, we both know

325
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,252
Peter's campaign

the fallout
of something like this.

327
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,956
And Alicia's rehabilitation
would certainly

328
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,291
become a wasted effort.
Okay, let me handle it.

329
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,127
Oh, Eli, you didn't even know!

What?
March 5 of this year:

356
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,269
"Why do we include
home ownership rates?"

357
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,270
In reference to...?

358
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,605
There's no subject line,

359
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,040
but it's in a thread
about the Safe Filter.

360
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,575
Who to who?
Chummy Map coder

361
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,110
Kip O'Neill to his super,

362
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,278
Larry Melanie.

363
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,382
Damn. I think
this one's responsive.

364
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,884
But did they include
home ownership rates

365
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,252
into the algorithm?

366
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,253
No.

367
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,255
So...?

368
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,523
They were considering it.
CANNING:<i> So?</i>

369
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,993
They didn't do it.
Mark it as non-responsive.

370
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,494
ALICIA (over phone):
Come on.

371
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,563
They discussed including
home ownership rates

372
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,632
in the design
of Safe Filter.

373
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,233
I mean,
that would automatically

374
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,902
disadvantage
poorer neighborhoods.

375
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,536
It's a proxy for race.

376
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,138
CANNING:
Yes, but, again, they didn't,

377
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,506
and so it wasn't.

378
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:12,477
Well... let's let the judge
rule on its relevance.

379
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,178
Anyway, you sure you're not
misinterpreting this e-mail?

380
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,513
It says,

381
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,682
"Why do we include
home ownership rates?"

382
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,384
H-How else
do we interpret that?

383
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,920
Maybe the emphasis is on "we."

384
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,922
"Why do<i> we</i> have to be the ones
who have to do this?

385
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,090
Why can't somebody else
to do it?"

386
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,928
There's an easy way
to find out what he meant.

KIP O'NEILL:
<i> Apricot thyme granola</i>

389
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,701
We rotate every day.

390
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,070
Almond milk?
We make our own.

391
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,505
No, thanks.
We're good.

392
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,508
So about those
home ownership statistics?

393
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,709
Yeah, that was
just in beta.

394
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,110
Uh, what was in beta?

395
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,712
Our use of home
ownership stats.

396
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,580
To determine which
neighborhoods were unsafe?
Yeah,

397
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,382
but only in beta.

398
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,418
See, we had to show users
something on day one,

399
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,253
before there was
any user feedback,

400
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,956
so we used other data
just to start it off.

401
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,958
So what percentage
of the results

402
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,526
is currently shaped
by user feedback?

403
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:05,463
100%.
We realized that

404
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,398
if we kept it completely
in the users' hands,

405
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,069
we would avoid
another "Animal" incident.

406
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:14,005
Okay, a what incident?

407
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,606
Just something
that happened last year

408
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,075
in the imaging department.

409
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,010
We were this close
to causing a major

410
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,512
you-know-what storm.
I'll show you.
Uh, no, no. No, no, no.

411
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,547
I've got my computer...
No, just stop.
It's okay.

412
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,983
Stop.
Well, we just can't

413
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,551
pretend he didn't
say something.
No, but he didn't

414
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,554
say Chummy Maps.

415
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,523
Um, does this thing that you
were about to show us...

416
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,258
The "Animal" incident?
Right.

417
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,060
Does it have to do
with Chummy Maps?

418
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,695
No, but we were all worried
we were gonna...

419
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:41,432
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No, no... Don't
say anything else, okay?

420
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,568
If it doesn't
have to do with the maps,

421
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,269
then we don't
have to look at it.

422
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:48,139
And we really
shouldn't look at it.

423
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,646
(scoffs)

424
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,517
What?

425
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,085
Something
in the discovery?

426
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,587
No. The reader comments

427
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,589
on Safe Filter.

428
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,425
"Super shady street!"
Exclamation point.

429
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,527
"Heard gunshots,
never going back!"

430
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,029
Sad face.

431
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,431
You think it's racist?
Do you?

432
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,601
He heard gunshots.
It's not racist.

433
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,603
My guess is he<i> thought</i>
he heard gunshots.

434
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:22,040
More discovery from
Chumhum. We'll take half.

435
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,143
Oh, good.
Thank you.

436
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:27,211
So...

437
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,546
Biff and, um, Skippy

438
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,747
are working out well for you?

439
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,685
Yes, they are.

440
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,321
And how is that not
reverse racism?
How is what not--

441
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,823
making fun of their names?
Yeah,

442
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,558
calling them
white stereotyped names.

443
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,193
Is that what
Biff and Skippy are?

444
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,530
Country club names from
some bad skit somewhere--

445
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,398
polo outfits and tennis
racquets-- don't pretend

446
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

447
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,136
We don't want to be having
this conversation.

448
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,772
We already are.
Yes, reverse racism--
that dangerous

449
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,708
contagion that's
taking hold of society.
It doesn't have to be

450
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,210
a contagion to be true.

451
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,779
So how is is that
not reverse racism?

452
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,281
Because harm is necessary

453
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,684
for racism to be... harmful.

454
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,120
But you think they're idiots
because they're big white guys?

455
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,621
No, I think
they're idiots

456
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,323
because you hired them
instead of me.

457

(Monica laughs)

458
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,627
Can I see your laptop?

459
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,129
Why?

460
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,198
Because I want to steal it.

461
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,105
What?

00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,873
Banner ads.

This one's my

one's yours.

465
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,678

469
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,885
Meaning?

470
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,421
Maybe we can
expand the discovery.

That's fine.

474
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,865
I'll wait for her.

Yup.

Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

478

That depends.
On what?

The questions.

Married?

I am not.

482

Girlfriend?
Kids?

483
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,260
I've had girlfriends.

Not had kids.

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,663
I have a daughter.

486
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,365
Divorced.

487
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,833
Me, not my daughter.

488
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,469
(forced chuckle)

489
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,639
Sorry for my nosiness.

490
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,374
I just like to
know about Alicia

491
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,743
and her life.

492
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,444
No problem.

493
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,846
You know, they're
actually paying me now,

494
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,548
so I'm gonna get back to work.

495
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,715
She's getting
close to you.

496
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,618
Isn't she?

497
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,892
I think these are questions
for Alicia, not for me.

498
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,895
You understand
why I ask?

499
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,232
Her husband is
running for president.

500
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,301
There's a lot more
attention being paid.

501
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,642
I think these
are questions for Alicia,

502
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,711
not for me.

503
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,883
Good talking to you.

504
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,590
CARY:
The ads you're seeing are for
things you might like, right?

505
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,892
Things you search for
or shop for online.

506
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,727
That's right.
And the ads you see

507
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,730
are different from
the ads that I see?

508
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,265
Yes, they are.
LUCCA: Your Honor, the ads

509
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,701
are just targeted.
Advertisers

510
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,302
tell Chumhum
they want to reach people

511
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:41,505
of a certain age, gender,
ethnic background,

512
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,507
and Chumhum obliges.
That's nothing more

513
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,444
than retailers wanting to reach
their customer base.

514
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,012
Opposing counsel's
missing the point, Your Honor.
Am I?

515
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,347
Tell me.
The point isn't that

516
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,748
white people get white ads

517
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,284
and black people
get black ads.

518
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,785
Because you haven't made
that point.
CARY: The point is the ads

519
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,320
that appear
on Chummy Maps

520
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,788
extract user data
from the entire

521
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,789
Chumhum product suite--

522
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,825
search engine, e-mails,

523
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:03,728
chat sites, news feeds,
shopping-- all of it.
DIANE: Chumhum

524
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,029
is a fully integrated
platform.

525
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,464
Therefore
our discovery shouldn't

526
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,765
be limited
to Chummy Maps alone.

527
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,934
It should include
all of Chumhum.

528
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,371
Your Honor, that's
a hysterical escalation.

529
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,439
It would be a ridiculous
amount of material.

530
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,741
Good thing
we can handle it.

531
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,943
To honor
your discovery ruling, judge,

532
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,645
we must
see everything.

533
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:21,946
They're right,
Mrs. Florrick.

534
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,715
Full discovery
of Chumhum is granted.

535
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,484
(gavel bangs)

536
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,552
Who's side is the law on again?

537
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,460
(sighs wearily)

538
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,896
Eli, I just had my ass
handed to me in court.

539
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,065
I do not have the bandwidth
for any campaign talk.

540
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,034
This is not about campaign talk.

541
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,436
Okay.

542
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,672
I know you want me to ask you

543
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,040
why you are here, then.

544
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:52,310
But I'm not going to.

545
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,945
Jason is in your office,
working.

546
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,480
Uh-huh.

547
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,549
Seems like a nice guy.

548
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,485
Uh-huh.

549
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,554
He reminds me of...

550
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,991
Actually, he doesn't
remind me of anyone.

551
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,827
Very strong.

552
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,996
Man of few words.

553
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,598
Which is odd because most
of the people I deal with

554
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,367
who you know...
use a lot of words.

555
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,768
Yes.

556
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,870
I've gotten over words.

557
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:23,074
How'd you find Jason?

558
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:26,811
Eli, what?
What?

559
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:29,680
What are you after?
What are you trying to say?

560
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:33,851
I know your private life
is none of my business...

561
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:37,355
but when it begins to...
spill into your public life...

562
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,357
You're telling me,

563
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,526
when I sleep with Jason
you'd rather I kept it private?

564
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,995
(wry laugh)

565
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,365
You're joking... right?

566
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,767
You're making fun of me?

567
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:54,705
Okay, I think you
are making fun of me,

568
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,374
but I still need to be clear.

569
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,775
(clears his throat)

570
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,110
This is the speech
I normally give

571
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,512
to the candidate,
but I will adapt it for you.

572
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:04,882
Lucky me.
Rule number one-- no
touching in public.

573
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,717
Ever.

574
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,853
If Jason is on fire,
let him burn.

575
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:11,689
Touching in private--
no such thing.

576
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,023
Nowhere is private anymore.

577
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,692
Clearly.

578
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,661
Rule number two-- if you have
to go out together, make sure

579
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,897
there's always a third party
present, preferably female.

580
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,033
Rule number three-- even if
you go out in a bigger group,

581
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:26,904
never, under any circumstances,
let it be in a hotel, a bar...

582
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,174
...or a hotel bar.

583
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,743
Eli...

584
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,679
you didn't talk about any
of this with Jason, did you?

585
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,047
What?! No.

586
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,482
Okay.

587
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,484
This is the first and last time

588
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,854
we discuss this.

589
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:48,526
I'm<i> not</i> sleeping with
my investigator, but if I were,

590
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:51,595
this conversation between us
could never take place.

591
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,665
I would never let it take place.

592
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,066
Please just tell me
you heard me.

593
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,701
No, Eli,
I didn't hear you.

594
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:58,969
I won't hear you.

595
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,771
You can show yourself out.

596
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,015
ALICIA: I'm<i> not</i> sleeping with
my investigator, but if I were,

597
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:14,018
this conversation between us
could never take place.

598
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,153
I would never
let it take place.

599
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,022
ELI: Please just
tell me you heard me.

600
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,657
ALICIA:
No, Eli, I didn't hear you.

601
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,192
I won't hear you.

602
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:23,861
You can show yourself out.

603
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:31,969
Bad news-- they got
full discovery.

604
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,572
Okay.

605
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,006
New ball game.

606
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,509
Yeah, a lot
tougher one.
(outer door closes)

607
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,077
You want a drink?

608
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,912
I'm getting
better at it.

609
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,981
No.

610
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,116
But thanks.

611
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,918
Everything okay?

612
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,054
No.

613
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,523
Full discovery.

614
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:54,592
Oh, right.

615
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:58,896
Well, maybe we're just
on the wrong side of this one.

616
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:01,098
Maybe.

617
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,167
I'll see you.

618
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,642
CANNING:
<i> The judge has granted</i>
<i> full discovery.</i>

619
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,912
Now, this complicates our job,
but it doesn't alter it.

620
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,914
We still split up the materials.

621
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,817
We still decide what is
responsive and what is not.

622
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:23,120
Okay, so, go to it.

623
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,123
We have a problem.
Already?

624
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,726
An e-mail to Chumhum
customer service.

625
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,961
"Dear Chumhum, your
search results suck.

626
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,530
"When I type in my name,

627
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,131
"it auto-completes
to some seriously

628
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,633
racist crap."

629
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:37,735
What seriously racist crap?

630
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:40,704
When he typed in
his name-- Jamal--

631
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,606
the auto-complete offered
to finish the sentence

632
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,142
with "Jamal stole my car," or

633
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,610
"Jamal arrest record."

634
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,078
Okay, that's not good.

635
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
But it's non-responsive.
ALICIA: Really?

636
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,082
How do you figure?
It's customer based. I mean,

637
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,618
the auto-complete is based
on most used search requests,

638
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,654
so, obviously, more people
who typed in "Jamal"

639
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:59,723
were interested in arrest
reports than anything else.

640
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,993
So, Chumhum's not racist...
its users are?
Well, one could argue

641
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:06,630
that it's racist
to override the results.
Okay, we need

642
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,165
to deal
with the "animal" incident.

643
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,867
I don't like
the sound of that.

644
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:12,703
Chumhum has
photo-identifying software.

645
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:13,904
It sorts your photos
into categories.

646
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,574
Camping trip,
Disneyland, graduation.

647
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,709
LUCCA:
One of the customers

648
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,843
pointed out that it had
tagged photos of her friends.

649
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,183
Oh.

650
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,685
WOMAN:
<i> Alicia Florrick was</i>

651
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,053
was willing
to forgive her husband

652
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:30,721
when he stumbled.

653
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,056
She deserves at least
that much understanding.

654
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,591
And they put her
on that election board, right?

655
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,792
They wouldn't have done that

656
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,193
if she hadn't
turned herself around.

657
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,895
The election board, sure.

658
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,798
Is there anything
Mrs. Florrick has said

659
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,202
or done that influences
your view of her?

660
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,371
Her episode of
<i> Mama's Homespun Cooking.</i>

661
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,306
It was so... raw.

662
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,108
Like she's a real person,
with crap to deal with.

663
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,977
Oh, this is good.

664
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,645
All right, well, let's stay
on that topic for a minute...

665
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,146
Yeah.
NORA: Eli?

666
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,948
I'll be right back.

667
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,150
Real people who have to overcome
real issues in their life.

668
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,052
Show of hands: How many of you
would value those qualities

669
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:05,055
in a political candidate?
I have a mission for you.

670
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,658
A mission? Really?

671
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,828
Sounds very...
mission-like.

672
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,130
Actually, it is.

673
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,732
Mr. Agos?

674
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,367
Cary's fine.

675
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,636
Cary. I was checking up
on the background

676
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,904
of the coders over
at the Chicago Chumhum office.

677
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,806
Which coders?
Kip O'Neill.

678
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,708
The guy who created
the Safe Filter.

679
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,976
I went through his
on-line postings.

680
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,711
In 2013,

681
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,047
a year before he created
the filter, he got mugged.

682
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:33,050
He didn't say where, but he said
it was a "sketchy neighborhood."

683
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,718
If he were mugged by...

684
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,854
You can say it.

685
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,722
If he were mugged
by African-American people,

686
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:39,990
it's evidence
he was racially motivated

687
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,026
in the creation
of the filter.

688
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,728
Good. Do we know if he was
mugged by African-Americans?

689
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,730
No. I checked
for news reports. Nothing.

690
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,832
Okay... That's
good work, Brian.

691
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,437
Whew!

692
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:56,206
That is pretty
good work by Biff,

693
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,343
don't you think?

694
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,412
MAN:
It's really not my team--

695
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:03,180
imaging and tagging.

696
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,915
I'll bring Josh over.

697
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,284
Where's Jason? I thought
he was meeting us here.

698
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,986
Oh, yeah, he called.

699
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:12,022
He thought you might want
to limit his hours on this?

700
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,424
KIP:
This is Josh.

701
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:14,858
He can speak a little more

702
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,994
specifically as
to, uh... yeah.

703
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:20,264
Yeah. So... the photo
wasn't tagged by a person,

704
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,099
it was tagged
by an algorithm.

705
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,101
And the algorithm can't
tell the difference

706
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,336
between an African-American
woman and an animal?

707
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:29,707
Well, it can now, but, uh,

708
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,343
three years ago, we hadn't
given it enough examples.

709
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,779
It had real trouble
with light and shadow.

710
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,283
It got a lot
of other stuff wrong, too.

711
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,319
Just nothing else
that looked so...

712
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,455
Racist?
Right.

713
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:46,356
It's gotten better.
Google had this problem, too.

714
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,825
ALICIA:
Did the algorithm

715
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:50,060
ever mistake a white person
for an animal?

716
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,229
Why would it do that?

717
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,064
LUCCA:
Because it mistakes
white people for

718
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,033
polar bears or white seals.

719
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,868
(laughs)
No. Not so far.

720
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,369
Why not?

721
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,938
Why does it have trouble

722
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,806
identifying
African-Americans,

723
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,441
but not Caucasians?

724
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:08,145
I guess because we hadn't
given it enough examples.

725
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,780
We're not racists.

726
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:11,215
I'm not saying you are.

727
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,851
I'm just looking
around your workplace.

728
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,421
ALICIA:
<i> It's clearly responsive.</i>

729
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,423
CANNING:
I disagree.

730
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,258
It's not racist. It's a
technical shortcoming.

731
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,860
It's implicit bias.

732
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,762
Look, no one at Chumhum
is actually racist.

733
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,063
They just code what they know.

734
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,498
That's why the tagging software

735
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,166
never misidentifies white people

736
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,801
as animals.

737
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,236
The software has
been corrected.

738
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,971
You yourself said no one
there is actually racist.

739
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,506
This is non-responsive.
Click it.

740
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,777
He's wrong.

741
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,445
He's also paying our bills,

742
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,413
so, I think we
have to click it.

743
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,783
(door closes)

744
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:50,320
(doorbell rings)

745
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,790
Nora, hi. Eli's not here.

746
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,358
I know.
The campaign sent me.

747
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,326
They sent you? Why?

748
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,095
In case you need anything.

749
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:59,963
Oh. Well, I don't.
I'm fine.

750
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,799
Oh, hey.

751
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,333
Back to the grindstone?
Yeah.

752
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,035
Tough boss.

753
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,871
Cary Agos called.
He wants to meet.

754
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,840
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe he wants to make a deal.

755
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:12,910
Okay, give me second.
No, he just asked for me.

756
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:13,977
I'll call you.

757
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,181
(thud)

758
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:20,517
I'll just wait in a corner,
in case you need anything.

759
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,886
Nora, I'm fine.
It's okay.

760
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:25,022
I have a book.

761
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,827
CARY:
Thanks for coming in, Lucca.

762
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,895
Anything to settle this.

763
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:36,300
We just found out one
of your coders, Kip O'Neill--

764
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,402
he was mugged in 2013.

765
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,838
I wanted to see
if you knew about this.

766
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
This is why I'm here?

767
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,108
Yes.

768
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,983
He was mugged the year
before he created Safe Filter

769
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,018
in what he called
"a sketchy neighborhood."

770
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,320
Why call me?

771
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:58,155
Why not Alicia?

772
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,992
I thought
you'd be more helpful.

773
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:09,132
You're implying
the assailants were black?

774
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,235
(laughing):
I'm not implying anything.

775
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,870
I thought
you could ask your client.

776
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,474
Next time,

777
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,176
call Alicia, too.

778
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,645
It just seems like something
both our sides would need

779
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:24,047
to address if it turns out
to be race-related.

780
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,884
Good-bye.

781
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,122
It wasn't a negotiation.

782
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,324
We might have a problem
with Kip O'Neill.

783
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,526
Okay, I got it.
Jason's here.

784
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,428
I'll ask him.

785
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,497
Kip O'Neill
was mugged in 2013.

786
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,299
It's on his profile page.

787
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,501
We need to find out the race
of the culprits.

788
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,937
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

789
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:50,474
Jason, did Eli talk to you

790
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,509
before, when you were here?

791
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,178
Yup.

792
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,281
About us?

793
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:58,916
What do you mean, "us?"

794
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,219
Us working together.

795
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:05,055
Yes.

796
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,693
I don't want...

797
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:13,030
things to be uncomfortable
between us.

798
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,065
Me, neither.
Well, then,
don't let Eli

799
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,466
make them uncomfortable.

800
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,142
Here's the thing:

801
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:30,981
I used to have
a very different life.

802
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:33,150
A very...

803
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:36,620
uncomfortable life.

804
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,456
I didn't like it.

805
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:43,727
So now, there is nothing I do

806
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:47,097
that makes me uncomfortable.

807
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,299
Nothing.

808
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,002
Even if I want something...

809
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:52,970
(door opens)

810
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:55,022
Is everything all right in here?

811
00:32:55,023 --> 00:32:57,073
Do you need anything?
We're fine, Nora. Thank you.

812
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,212
(door shuts)

813
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:03,714
You said, "even if you
want something..."?

814
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,248
Yeah, you know, that's...

815
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,352
It's okay.
Jason...

816
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:11,021
look, I just,
I like things simple.

817
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,757
All right? Work simple,
home simple, life simple.

818
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,125
And isn't it?

819
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:17,327
It was.

820
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,135
I have to get back to work.

821
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:27,170
I'll call you.

822
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,441
(sighs intensely)

823
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,048
How did we go from mugging
victim to possible racist?

824
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,283
If the guys who mugged him
were black or Latino,

825
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,552
Cary and Diane
will say racial bias

826
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,488
was motivation
for the Safe Filter.

827
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,156
So cynical.
Here he is.

828
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,392
CANNING: So?
Good news.

829
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,627
The attackers were white,
one was a redhead,

830
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:54,464
so as long as that hasn't been
categorized as a new race...

831
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,532
We dodged a bullet.

832
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,167
JASON:
What do you get

833
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,535
when you cross a black
and two Mexicans?

834
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,670
Excuse me?
It's a joke.

835
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,406
Kip e-mailed it to his teammates

836
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,341
four weeks before
they launched Chummy Maps.

837
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:06,576
Which I'm guessing gives Diane

838
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:07,577
and Cary their bias.

839
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,612
Damn.

840
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:09,613
KIP:
<i> I'm not a racist. </i>

841
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,148
And I'm sure some

842
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,316
of your best friends
are blacks and Mexicans.

843
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,485
The joke was just me
breaking up the drudge work.

844
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,054
Apparently, work around here
gets pretty drudgy.

845
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,688
There are<i> dozens </i>
of these jokes here.

846
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,524
Then you've seen
the white jokes, too.

847
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,325
That... really
doesn't help, Kip.

848
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:25,062
Look... we work
a hundred hours a week.

849
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:27,397
We sleep on the floor here
half the nights.

850
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,367
It was a meta joke--
a joke about joking.

851
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,369
Like dead baby jokes.

852
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,371
CANNING:
<i> So they were just a bunch</i>

853
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,673
of immature frat boys
blowing off steam.
Pretty much.

854
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:40,577
But it's gonna be hard
denying any knowledge
of racism to Judge Marx.

855
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,180
You're right.

856
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:46,183
Y... You're finally
agreeing with me.

857
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,584
It's been known to happen,
Alicia.

858
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,652
(sighs):
Okay...

859
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,587
then I will tag
every Chumhum e-mail

860
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,089
with racist jokes "responsive."

861
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,723
Not just e-mail.

862
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,126
Tag every racist joke
on the Internet.

863
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,429
I'm sure a Chumhum search will
turn up a billion Web pages.

864
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,498
Just mark all "responsive."

865
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,267
You're gonna bury the e-mails.
Of course not.

866
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,336
I'm just following
the judge's directives.

867
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,839
DIANE:<i> This</i> is their discovery?

868
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:10,674
50-terabyte hard drive.

869
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,743
Picture all the contents
in the Library of Congress,

870
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,745
and then multiply
that by five.

871
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,747
Congratulations--
we've just been hit

872
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:20,117
with what may be the
largest document dump

873
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:22,385
in American legal history.

874
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,191
Go away. What are
you doing here?

875
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,860
You're supposed to
be with Alicia!
No,

876
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:31,128
I'm<i> supposed</i> to be working.

877
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,829
That<i> was</i> work.
No, that was

878
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,298
the most embarrassing thing
I've ever done, Eli.

879
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,667
And I've done your laundry.
Where are they now?

880
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,469
Eli, they're not shtupping
at 11:00

881
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,538
in the morning.
Shh!

882
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,406
Courtney can't know.

883
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,375
You are a horrible employee.

884
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,810
(quietly):
And you're a monster.

885
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,245
Yeah, uh... okay, yes,

886
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,313
I'll-I'll see what I can do.
Thank you so much.

887
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,249
Mm-hmm.

888
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,718
Everything all right?
Yes.

889
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Can I call you later?

890
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:58,555
About the PAC?

891
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,790
About the PAC.

892
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,832
RUTH: Eli.
You rang?

893
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,734
What's this?

894
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,769
A file on Jason.

895
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,771
Skeletons and such.

896
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,606
Show it to Alicia.
No.

897
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:17,874
It won't work.

898
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,576
You haven't read it.

899
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,810
Alicia doesn't scare.

900
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,812
Not when it comes to men.

901
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,849
All women scare.

902
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,252
Use it.

903
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,824
Here he is again.

904
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,593
What'd you find, Brian?

905
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:37,961
I've been going
through the algorithms.

906
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,930
I thought you were digging
through the discovery.

907
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,898
Sometimes it's best
to look in the math.

908
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,266
What'd you find?

909
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,535
A patch-- pretty
crude, hastily done.

910
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,836
I don't know what that means.

911
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,705
It's embedded in the
photo-tagging software

912
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,340
It was altered so
the word "animal"

913
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,741
could never appear
in a photo tag.

914
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,210
Why would they do that?

915
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,212
To hide something?

916
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,751
Plaintiff has a motion
to compel?

917
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,253
DIANE:
We do.

918
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:08,725
This, uh, photo shows
an African-American woman

919
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,896
who was mistaken by Chumhum's
photo-tagging software

920
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,898
and tagged as an "animal."

921
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,433
Yes, it does.

922
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:19,769
We discovered this photo
when we noticed a patch

923
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,571
in Chumhum's
photo-tagging algorithm.

924
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,707
A patch in
the software?

925
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:26,276
So it wouldn't
happen again?
Yes, but rather than...

926
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,777
fix the underlying
problem,

927
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,314
they simply... patched it
to prevent one instance

928
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,817
of the problem from recurring.
Was this included

929
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,419
in discovery?
We don't know, Your Honor.

930
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,922
Chumhum's counsel
sent us 50 terabytes

931
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,924
of discovery--
it will take my firm

932
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,892
six years
to work through it.

933
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,894
I see.

934
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,597
Mrs. Florrick...

935
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,300
did you include this photo
in discovery?

936
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,436
No, Your Honor.
Were you aware

937
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,704
of the photo?

938
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,574
We were, Your Honor,

939
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,509
but we found it nonresponsive.

940
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,011
Really?
So you found

941
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:02,979
50 terabytes of data
responsive...

942
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:06,383
but an African-American woman
being mistaken for an animal

943
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:07,851
didn't make the cut?

944
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:10,420
We believed it did not.
No, you will provide

945
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,856
all responsive documents to
plaintiff's attorneys today,

946
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:15,358
<i> and</i> you have been found
in contempt, ma'am.
Your Honor,

947
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,861
this was not my...
You will pay $5,000

948
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,963
to the Clerk of
the Circuit Court

949
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,965
by end of day Friday,

950
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,067
as well as any plaintiff's costs
and attorney's fees

951
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:27,871
incurred in pursuing
this violation.

952
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,040
And if there are any
more games like this,

953
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:33,576
the sanctions will be doubled.
You understand?

954
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:34,744
I do, Your Honor.

955
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,079
(gavel bangs)

956
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,922
(sighs):
All right, look...

957
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,792
you have any more questions,
you ask Alicia, all right?

958
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,561
I'm a guest here.
I don't have a question.

959
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,430
Good.

960
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,031
What's that?

961
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,834
A file on you,
from the campaign.

962
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,937
You serious?
I'm not,

963
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,472
but the campaign is.

964
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:03,940
She knows all about my
criminal record.

965
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:06,443
I don't pretend like
it doesn't exist.

966
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,912
Take a look
at the back page.

967
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,850
Does she know about that?

968
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,619
Why are you
investigating Alicia?

969
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,888
It's none of your business.

970
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,024
Actually, that part is.

971
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,527
I was going into business
with her.

972
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,064
I wanted to know more
about my prospective employer.

973
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,134
I don't believe you.

974
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,503
And I seriously
don't give a damn.

975
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,038
This stuff...

976
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,541
this is<i> your</i> life,
it's not mine.

977
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,144
Eli...

978
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:44,381
do not make it mine.

979
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,720
Now, get off my car.

980
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,058
(car door opens, shuts;
siren wails in distance)

981
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:01,798
Okay, we're listening.
One: Effective 9:00 a.m.
this morning,

982
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,634
Josh Shelby's employment
at Chumhum was terminated.

983
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,870
The Photo Coder?
Yes. Two:

984
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,872
The Safe Filter has been
changed from a default setting

985
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:11,508
to an opt-in--
users will have to activate it

986
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,176
if they want to know
areas to avoid.

987
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:15,678
And the business icons
should not be switched off.

988
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,514
We agree.
CARY: Fine.

989
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:18,515
And how much you offer?

990
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:19,816
Zero.

991
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,419
We were under
the impression

992
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,120
this was
a settlement offer.

993
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,822
These are Little Dokebi's

994
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:26,823
financial records.

995
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,124
The restaurant
was struggling.

996
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,959
Ms. Feldman was
slashing costs

997
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,529
almost as much as 35%

998
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,597
because business
was going soft.

999
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,533
She started doing this
two months...

1000
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,902
<i>before</i> the Safe Filter
went live.

1001
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:41,571
Restaurant business
101, Ms. Feldman--

1002
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:44,707
your business tanked because
you skimped on quality.
Mr. Canning...

1003
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,876
That's not true.
DIANE: How did you even get
these documents?

1004
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,879
Ms. Feldman stored them
on Chumhum's cloud-based
spreadsheet service.

1005
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,514
Which is private...
Actually,

1006
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,016
users authorize Chumhum
total access

1007
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,051
when they agree
to the terms of service.

1008
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:58,855
It was a free service.

1009
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:01,891
Divya probably wanted
to save some money.
Mr. Canning...

1010
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:03,927
(others arguing)
I have never skimped
in my life.

1011
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:07,230
(all talking at once)

1012
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,734
Sorry, but I'm not sure
what we can do.

1013
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:15,104
So your client isn't racist--
they're just omnipotent.

1014
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,607
Keeping us all safe.

1015
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,077
You want to celebrate?

1016
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,213
In what manner?

1017
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:25,815
