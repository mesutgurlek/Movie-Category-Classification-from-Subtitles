1
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,970
Hello, mate. It's me again.

2
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,370
Listen, mate, can you
give me a call back, please?

3
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,980
Well, I'm just getting
a bit worried.

4
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,200
So just give me a call back
as soon as you get this message.

5
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,910
All right, mate. Ta.

6
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,000
It was the end of an era.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,080
But before the murders,

8
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,640
the torture,

9
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,730
the beatings and the Ecstasy...

10
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,710
before all of that

11
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,270
there was football.

12
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,290
You see, football was
where the spites

13
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,270
and the hatred first came from.

14
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,670
On those terraces...

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,040
well, it's where it all began for me.

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,590
I just turned 16, and I was
already a naughty little fucker,

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,040
working my way up
through the ranks.

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,820
I was West Ham, and for us,

19
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,210
football, fighting and fucking
was our way of life.

20
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,710
And if you came down our manor,
well, you're gonna get a slap.

21
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,420
And if we went over to you,
well, we'd fucking turn you over,

22
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,710
'cause for us it was
all about respect.

23
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,590
It was the same
all over the place.

24
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,250
But you know what?
We weren't trying to change the world.

25
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,440
We were just looking
for a fucking tear-up.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,490
Ladies and gentlemen...
Bill Gardner.

27
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,260
He was West Ham's top boy,

28
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,970
an inspiration to us all.

29
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,360
There's your Bovril, Bill...
nice and hot.

30
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,320
Come on then, Gardner!

31
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,900
I've waited all fucking year
for you, you cunt!

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,990
Come o... ah!

33
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,300
Gonna need another one
of those, lad.

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,760
Get us a meat pie and all.

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,470
Even though I was
wrapped around violence,

36
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,350
I always had time for the ladies.

37
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,910
So I waltzed up to this bird

38
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,370
and I just put it on her...

39
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,180
"You all right, darling?
Where you been all my life?"

40
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,100
And that was how I met Karen.

41
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,180
Beautiful Karen.

42
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,560
We got married two days after

43
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,950
I came out of Tottenham
magistrate's court.

44
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,040
I had been up on a threatening
behavior charge.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,600
And I'd also gotten in a fight

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,270
at my stag do the night before

47
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,350
so, yeah, I looked
a right fucking state.

48
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,120
So I was a married man,

49
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,140
but football was my mistress,

50
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,540
and I played away
every weekend.

51
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,560
First round of the Cup
when we played Fulham

52
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,330
and believe it or not,
it kicks off,

53
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,620
and like fucking clockwork
the Old Bill comes steaming in.

54
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,020
But behave yourself
and what are you going to do, eh?

55
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,100
It's fucking war on the streets.

56
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,850
We were all over
the papers the next day,

57
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,520
and they were going on
about how we were

58
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,080
the biggest menace
since the IRA.

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,270
But I mean what
the fuck did we care?

60
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,940
We was just having a laugh.

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,420
Oh, Carlton, she is beautiful.

62
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,650
Yeah, of course she is...
just like me.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,610
Do you hear that?
Just like your dad.

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,030
I'll fucking kill you!

65
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,780
I'll fucking do you in!

66
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,050
# There's gonna be
a Borstal breakout #

67
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,550
# There's gonna be a Borstal breakout #

68
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,260
# There's gonna be
a Borstal breakout #

69
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,030
# There's gonna be a Borstal breakout. #

70
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,200
We started calling
ourselves the ICF...

71
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,660
the InterCity Firm.

72
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,950
and that's because we took
the InterCity trains

73
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,490
to all the away matches rather than
jumping on the old football specials.

74
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,620
And we dressed up smart,
looked a little bit respectable.

75
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,640
You see, that way
the Old Blue don't spot you.

76
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,600
Man U-fucking-nited
and the bloody coach breaks down.

77
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,350
And to be fair to the driver,
he did try and offer up an explanation,

78
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,580
but Paul wasn't having none of it.

79
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,620
We just about get there in time
for the second half,

80
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,220
and then we go down 4-0
without fucking fighting.

81
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,830
- Screw you.
- Speak English, you cunts.

82
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,430
Fuck off back
to your campsite, you little cunts.

83
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,210
You saucy Northern cunts!

84
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,770
Let's fucking do the bastards.

85
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,540
Hey, come back here,
you little punk!

86
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,620
I'll fucking kill you!

87
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,020
Right!

88
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,560
And there we go. Fuck me!

89
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,060
Just fallen
for the oldest trick in the book.

90
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,400
Light it.

91
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,360
Come on!

92
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,490
Come on!

93
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,560
ICF! ICF!

94
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,790
ICF! ICF!

95
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,170
All right, darling?

96
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,420
You look a state, Carlton.

97
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,530
Red Army?
Don't make me laugh.

98
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,590
Scruffy Manc cunts.

99
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,150
You had a good time then?

100
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,240
Yeah, we kicked their fucking heads in.
It was classic.

101
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,530
But I was a mug.

102
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,240
Here I was with a girl
who really loved me,

103
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,840
and you know the last time
I said the words "I love you"

104
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,610
was to Eddie after five pints

105
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,490
down at a boozer in Canning Town.

106
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,760
And then suddenly
I get this job offer out of the blue.

107
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,470
Turns out that Smalls nightclub is
looking for a new doorman.

108
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,030
They've been having
all kinds of trouble

109
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,320
from some local firm
and they wanted someone

110
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,610
with a bit of weight
to keep the peace.

111
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,640
What I'm trying to create here is
what they call an environment.

112
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,550
Now you could usher the nice-looking
birds to the front of the queue.

113
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,800
That's always a good start.

114
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,260
If you get the nice-looking birds,

115
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,720
then the geezers wanna
spend their money.

116
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,700
You following me, Carlton?

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,050
Yeah yeah.

118
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,140
So, what we talking about,
say 40 nicker a night?

119
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,600
Is that good with you?

120
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,760
Yeah, people tried it on,

121
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,530
but everybody got
what they came for.

122
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,140
If you turned up looking
for a drink and a couple of birds,

123
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,600
that's what you got.

124
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,370
But if you came in
for anything else,

125
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,240
well, you'd end up
with my fist in your face.

126
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,160
And if you came back with
your little army wrapped around you,

127
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,350
well, I'd just have
to get my metal bar out.

128
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,430
And if I caught you
noncing in the toilet, well,

129
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,350
I won't think twice about stabbing you
up the ass with a knife.

130
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,640
You see, when someone's
out to make a name for themselves,

131
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,390
you have to rip 'em so hard
that they never want to get up again.

132
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,270
Now this may seem
a little bit harsh,

133
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,290
but in my world kindness is
mistaken for weakness.

134
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,520
I want to talk to you.

135
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,390
I think there's a couple
of doormen on the take.

136
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,060
I'm losing
over 200 quid a week

137
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,140
and the only person who I know
ain't on the fiddle is you.

138
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,370
So what are you saying?

139
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,190
Take control of the door.
Get rid of this lot

140
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,060
and bring in whoever you think
is good for the job.

141
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,460
More money...

142
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,690
more responsibility.
What do you say?

143
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,770
So I fucked off the regular boys

144
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,650
and brought in a couple
of my football mates.

145
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,770
They knew how to look after themselves
and it was nice dough for them.

146
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,070
And now that no money
was going missing,

147
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,520
we could do
whatever we liked.

148
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,130
# I want you to know
that I care #

149
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,150
# I'm so happy with you,
that found me #

150
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,440
# That I'm sad
that you're not there... #

151
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,360
- There you go, sweetheart.
- Ta, babe.

152
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,650
You know what?
I'd better get going.

153
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,360
Well, how about...

154
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,900
I jump into the back of your motor
and suck your big cock?

155
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,510
Well, what could I do?
She put it on me,

156
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,380
and I didn't want to hurt
the girl's feelings.

157
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,030
# Sweet sweet kissing,
I want you to hold me tight #

158
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,510
# And have you come
whenever I call you #

159
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,110
# And let me walk you
home at night. #

160
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,010
What's all that about, huh?

161
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,350
- Where you going?
- Where have you been?

162
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,740
Well, I've been at work, ain't I?

163
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,870
I called the club.
They said you left two hours ago.

164
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,950
- Yeah well, the car's playing up.
- Again?

165
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:03,120
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ. Carlton, make an effort.

166
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,140
What you on about, eh?

167
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,870
Hey, I'm talking to you.

168
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,660
You know, make an effort.

169
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,270
Am I not worth it?

170
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,810
You can't even spend five minutes
trying to hide it from me, can you?

171
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,890
Hide what?

172
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,690
Well, the smell of her perfume
might be a good start

173
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,230
or the used condoms that
I practically find daily

174
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,730
at the bottom of our car.
I have to take them out

175
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,710
before I take
Carly to nursery.

176
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,690
That's dirty, Carlton.

177
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,670
What are you bringing
that up for, eh?

178
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,520
I mean, why do you have to start as soon
as I get through the fucking door?

179
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,150
- We're over, Carlton.
- What?

180
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,750
I want a divorce.

181
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,780
You can't, can you?

182
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,400
You know what?

183
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,940
No. You can either
help me pack that car...

184
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,740
or you can just fuck off back
to one of your dolly birds.

185
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,990
And so it went on.

186
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,670
Match day. Arsenal away.

187
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,450
My lot had gone up in front

188
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,740
and for some reason
I'm stuck with a load of stragglers.

189
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,760
Now these cunts had been out
on the piss the night before

190
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,160
and they weren't exactly up
for an early start.

191
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,050
Fucking hell, it's Millwall!

192
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,870
Get up! The fucking Treatment!
Get up! Get up!

193
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,910
Get up! Get up!

194
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,890
We've got to do
these cunts! Get up!

195
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,620
Come on then,
you fucking wankers!

196
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,610
Get up!
Come on, move move!

197
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,310
Life's all about moving forward.

198
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,020
You learn what you can
and you crack on.

199
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,250
I've been running the terraces
for over a decade.

200
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,430
Maybe this is my time
to bail out gracefully.

201
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,040
The Old Bill were
coming down hard anyway.

202
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,600
They had surveillance
and undercover units.

203
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,370
It was getting fucking stupid...

204
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,870
there was more Old Bill at the game
than there were supporters.

205
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,580
And they weren't slapping you
on the wrist anymore.

206
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,770
They were handing out
heavy jail sentences.

207
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,350
Yeah, I reckon
I got out just in time.

208
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,350
I've been hearing good things
about you, Carlton.

209
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,000
I got told this joint
used to be a shithole.

210
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,810
- Yeah, it did,
- Well, look at it now, eh?

211
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,630
Things seem to be
ticking along nicely.

212
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,230
Why don't you come
and clean up my joint?

213
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,730
Yeah? What's it like?

214
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,590
It's a den of cunts.
I'm hoping you can change all that.

215
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,820
I want the '80s crowd...
suits, briefcases,

216
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,800
nice-looking birds.

217
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,670
I'll be giving you
carte blanche, son.

218
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,070
But the only problem
was I didn't have

219
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,050
enough reliable
cool-headed mates from football

220
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,920
to look after another door.

221
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,150
I needed fresh blood, and I knew
exactly where to get ahold of it...

222
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,690
Talbot's gym.
This ain't no place for showboaters,

223
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,670
This is where
the meanest, hardest lumps

224
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,440
in East London
come to workout.

225
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,420
The reason I'm down here
is I'm starting up a door firm

226
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,820
and I need some lumps. If you want,
I can sort you out five nights a week.

227
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,490
Yeah. I'll have
some of that, yeah.

228
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,360
You fucking want some?!

229
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,130
Get my money by next week.

230
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,340
Oh yeah. Get in there!

231
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,450
Watch it.

232
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,470
You make me look like a cunt
in front of the management!

233
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,660
- Oh, fuck you!
- Every time I get you a gig

234
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,580
you're always fucking pissed!
You're a total cunt!

235
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,010
No, you're the cunt! I'm gonna bring
the lads back in and sort you out!

236
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,160
You're fucking dead!

237
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,390
Get the fucking lot
of them, you wanker!

238
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,200
You want a proper job?

239
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,600
Hello, girls.
How are you doing?

240
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,580
Fuck off.

241
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,120
You know,
someone once told me

242
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,520
you're only as good
as the people around you.

243
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,980
And you didn't get
to work on my door

244
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,580
unless you could
seriously handle yourself.

245
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,040
- Put me down, you wankers!
- Watch him!

246
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,940
Hey! What are you doing?!

247
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,890
But I soon found out

248
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,400
running doors weren't
the only way to make money.

249
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,370
There's more than one use
for hired muscle...

250
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,980
guarding packages,
minding drug deals.

251
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,520
Me and the lads got paid to make sure
things went down as they should.

252
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,440
People don't mind laying out
10% for peace of mind.

253
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,920
It became bread
and butter work for my firm,

254
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,420
but there was more to do
than just babysitting.

255
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,920
People started coming
to me for all sorts.

256
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,590
Yo, you want to start off here?

257
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,860
Oi!

258
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,660
Fuck!

259
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,100
Well, done, eh?

260
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,910
Now the rave phenomenon
will have to go down in history

261
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,890
as being as important
as the birth

262
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,870
of rock 'n' roll, punk or metal.

263
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,790
It all started with the acid house music
in the late '80s.

264
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,540
These kids started putting on
massive parties all over the place...

265
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,520
in factories, warehouses,

266
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,290
whatever they could
get ahold of.

267
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,950
And if you was
a farmer back then,

268
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,350
you'd wake up to find
a fucking spaceship's

269
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,120
just landed in your field.

270
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,560
What's all about here then?

271
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,230
There's Millwall,
Tottenham all over this place.

272
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,000
I keep waiting for it to kick off.

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,770
It's all the Ecstasy, Carl.

274
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,580
This lot will be doing nothing
but loving each other all night long.

275
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,770
Have you checked with John and Terry?
How's the door getting on?

276
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,580
They're all paying £20 to get in...
with no bother.

277
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,190
I tell you... it's a fucking license
to print money, isn't it?

278
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,320
You want to be a little more subtle
about that, don't you?

279
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,920
Yeah, but love
ain't subtle, mate.

280
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,570
Yeah well, neither am I, so you either
put it out or I put you out.

281
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,380
- Do you understand?
- You should have one.

282
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,400
You look like you need it.
Don't worry, it's on me.

283
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,800
You're some sort of cunt, ain't you?

284
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,400
- I don't do drugs.
- It's not a drug, mate.

285
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,840
This is love.
Don't tell me you don't do love.

286
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,970
Yeah yeah yeah, love love love
and all that fucking bollocks.

287
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,740
All right, you mad cunt.
Go on, give me one.

288
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,530
But put the rest away!
You understand what I'm saying to you?

289
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,140
Fuck it. Why not?

290
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,580
Everything all right, Carl?

291
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,180
I've only gone and taken one
of those pills, ain't I?

292
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,620
Yeah, it was either that
or give the kid a slap.

293
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,600
But I'm in a good mood,
so I thought I'd let him off.

294
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,040
So what's it like?

295
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,430
Oh, it's rubbish, mate.
It must be a dud.

296
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't feel nothing.

297
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,620
You know,
I still can't feel nothing.

298
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,520
Really?

299
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,420
Yeah, it's rubbish.

300
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,230
We go way back,
don't we, Eddie?

301
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,210
Yeah, mate.

302
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,230
I'll tell you what, mate:
You're a fucking brother to me you are.

303
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,420
Yeah, cheers, mate.

304
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,690
I fucking love you, Eddie.
Fucking love you.

305
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,880
Oh, mate, I'm buzzing off
my fucking nut here.

306
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,750
I've got to go and dance.

307
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,960
It was incredible...

308
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,630
the first time
I'd ever touched drugs

309
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,820
and got as close to God
as chemically possible.

310
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,050
The biggest crowd I'd managed
before this was 300 strong

311
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,900
and 15 lumps just about managed
to stop them from killing each other.

312
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,670
But everybody in here
was in love.

313
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,280
I mean the drugs were
breaking down social barriers.

314
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,260
Peace by Ecstasy...

315
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,650
even old Thatcher
couldn't have dreamt that up.

316
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,130
# Boy, if my needs
cause a storm #

317
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,300
# And your eyes say
"Take me home" #

318
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,160
# You and I could spend
a night of romance, really alive #

319
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,660
# But when
the morning comes #

320
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,200
# Will I still want you? #

321
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,680
# Ooh, will I still
want you? #

322
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,740
# Will I still want you? #

323
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,970
# Ooh, will I still
want you? #

324
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:41,160
# Uh-huh, you can dance
into my heart #

325
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:45,330
# But I know that's not the part #

326
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,180
# That you want to steal away #

327
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,680
# So when the morning comes #

328
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,700
# There'll be nothing left to say #

329
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,660
# Baby, let me love you
for tonight #

330
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,540
# I've got to have your love #

331
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,410
# I really need it now #

332
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,680
# Baby, let me love you
for tonight #

333
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,870
# I know you want my love #

334
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,850
# My love will treat you right #

335
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,290
# You know I want you, boy #

336
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:31,270
# We all need to love today #

337
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,610
# But the heart will surely pay #

338
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,190
# 'Cause the moment that our loving
keeps from reaching the stars #

339
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,380
# Just say goodbye to me #

340
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,920
# And then nothing will remain. #

341
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,730
This stuff really was
going to change the world.

342
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,710
I wanted to feel
like that forever.

343
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,110
We all did.

344
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,490
Oh dear. A pint of your finest
champagne, please, squire.

345
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,610
Look at this flash cunt
giving it the old Roger Moore.

346
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,690
He feels he's right special,
doesn't he?

347
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,050
He's definitely got
a fucking problem.

348
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,740
Who, him? Looks like
the fucking Honey Monster.

349
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,930
I know you, don't I?

350
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,160
- Do you?
- Yeah.

351
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,280
- You're Carlton Leach.
- What's your name then?

352
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,410
I'm Tony Tucker.
We grew up near each other.

353
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,700
You and your lot used to play football
with my mate's brother.

354
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,780
No, I don't remember that.

355
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,910
I've seen you about.
You work out down at the gym, don't you?

356
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,100
So how long you been
going down to Talbot's for?

357
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,390
Don't know.
A couple of years.

358
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,370
You follow any kind of program?

359
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,350
Nah, I just lift when I feel like it.

360
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,430
You should have some direction, mate.

361
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,930
You want to lump up,
then you've got to know a thing or two.

362
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,330
Take me...
I'm not going full-on right now,

363
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,990
but I look after myself.

364
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,600
I take the right supplements
and I sell them too...

365
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,470
the legal kind
and the naughty stuff.

366
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,180
What is this,
some sort of sales pitch?

367
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,060
Give over,
I wouldn't charge you fuck-all.

368
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,140
I'm just telling you
what I do.

369
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,750
I mean, I've heard of you.
I know what you get up to.

370
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,410
I'm into the same game.

371
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,160
I feel it's always worth having
something on the side, you know?

372
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,390
Oh yeah,
I can see that.

373
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,250
- You want to join us?
- Yeah, why not?

374
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,020
You'll fucking love 'em.

375
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,310
They're as thick as shit
and fucking gagging for it.

376
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,610
You start off on creatine,

377
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,320
you increase protein
and you work out hard.

378
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,820
But it don't last that long, 'cause you
look at the other lads in the gym

379
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,900
and you think,
"Hang on a fucking minute.

380
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,360
What's his secret?"

381
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,960
Anabolic steroids.

382
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,360
They help the body
produce more protein

383
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,130
which in turn
increases muscle mass

384
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,360
which means you can
work out longer and harder.

385
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,550
I started off injecting Anavar...

386
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,420
fairly mild as steroids go.

387
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,220
Nothing could last forever

388
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,780
and club land was no different.

389
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,550
With the kind of money
that was floating about,

390
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,320
it was only a matter of time
before the dealers

391
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,510
started turning each other over.

392
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,530
Why go through all the effort and risk
of importing the drugs yourself

393
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,720
when you can just go
and rob some cunt who has?

394
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,360
- There he is!
- Let's fucking do him!

395
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,280
Drive!

396
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,470
Now the dealers can
hardly go to Old Bill,

397
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,350
so they go to
the next best thing...

398
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,120
muscle for hire.

399
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,560
We started doing punishment
as well as protection.

400
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,430
I mean, why not?

401
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,060
This is good.
You ever used one of these?

402
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,140
It's a bone saw.

403
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,930
Listen. I'm gonna go
and make a cup of tea...

404
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,640
and you can think
about what you've done.

405
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,140
Cycling, stacking...

406
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,750
six weeks on,
six weeks off,

407
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,210
Work hard, lift big.

408
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,810
Pure muscle...
fucking packing it on.

409
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,960
You know,
someone once told me

410
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,730
the thing about being
ripped off is,

411
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,440
you have to be prepared to spend
double what was stolen

412
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,460
on catching and making
an example of the thief.

413
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,000
Please. Please.

414
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,540
I've got kids.

415
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,940
I've got a wife.

416
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,750
I wouldn't worry
about that for now.

417
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,460
I mean, you're not exactly much
of a catch, are you?

418
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,540
She'll get over it.

419
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,670
Yeah, she'll probably
be sucking fresh cock by next week.

420
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,690
Trust me, I know the sort.

421
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,780
Please help me.
Please help me.

422
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,400
And that's what happened
to the lucky ones.

423
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,130
All right?

424
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,410
Mmm.

425
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,800
Are you forgetting something?

426
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,930
What?

427
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,850
Tonight... a special dinner?

428
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,620
Our anniversary?

429
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,740
Listen, darling,
I'm tired, all right?

430
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,510
It's been a hard day.
I just wanna have something to eat

431
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,080
and go have
a lay down, all right?

432
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,100
Can you get up?
I need something to eat. Go on.

433
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,850
For fuck's sake, Carlton,
it's our anniversary tonight.

434
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,140
Am I talking to myself?
What did I just say to you?

435
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,850
Get my dinner. Now. Move it.

436
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,230
- What's that?
- What's what?

437
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,290
What is that?

438
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,690
It's seared chicken
with Jersey Royals.

439
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,980
I cooked it
right from the book.

440
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,020
Well, thanks for telling me,
'cause I can't fucking see it.

441
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,520
Take it away.

442
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,400
All right? Just take it away.

443
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,900
Go on, get it out of my sight.

444
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,070
Listen, you lazy cunt, just...

445
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,150
fuck you!
You want to fucking hit me?

446
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,610
Hey! You want to fucking hit me?

447
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,010
You want to hit me, do you?

448
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,300
I fucking hate you,
you bastard!

449
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,490
- You had to fucking start!
- Get out!

450
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,800
Eh? See what you done?

451
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,670
How could you do this to me?

452
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,440
- How could you do this to me?
- Fucking stop!

453
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,010
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

454
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,820
I put my fucking life
on the line for you every night

455
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,300
and you can't even cook me
a fucking meal, you lazy cunt!

456
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,630
Is that cunt banging?

457
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,200
Is that fucking cunt banging again?

458
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,070
- You old fucker!
- Piss off! Just get out!

459
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,300
Shut up, you horrible cunt!
Shut up!

460
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,700
Shut up! Just shut up!

461
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,280
- Shut up. Shut up.
- You fucking useless cow. Fuck off.

462
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,030
You think you know me, eh?

463
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,430
Go on, hurt me.
Go on, bruise me.

464
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,990
- Yeah yeah?
- Go on, make a mark.

465
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,660
Well, how about I bite
your fucking nose off?

466
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,990
You want me to tear that
fucking nose off of yours? Eh?

467
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,850
Is that what you want?

468
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,870
Don't you fucking dare!

469
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,950
Like this, do you?
Do you like this?

470
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,520
Go on, Carlton.
Go on, fuck me.

471
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,540
Go on.
Go on, fuck me then.

472
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,520
Fuck me properly, go on.

473
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,020
Come on, fuck me hard
like you used to.

474
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,210
Yeah, go on.

475
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,910
Be a man for once in your life.

476
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,770
- Fucking...
- Go on. Go on.

477
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,750
Come on.

478
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,850
You disgust me.

479
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,150
The steroids left
my whole body shaking,

480
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,020
crying out for food.

481
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,480
I couldn't think straight.

482
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,250
They don't just make
your muscles big,

483
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,270
they fuck your head up...
roid rage.

484
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,250
I left the Anavar behind

485
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,820
and moved on
to the heavier stuff.

486
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,320
I was injecting myself
with testosterone,

487
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:23,130
Sustanon...
anything I could lay me hands on.

488
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,460
Baby, please come back.

489
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,780
I took to carrying jars
of baby food everywhere I went.

490
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,690
My body was clucking
for nutrients,

491
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,710
and I'd guzzle down
six jars at a time.

492
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,610
How long have
you been flogging your company for?

493
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,590
I ain't flogging it.
It's doing all right.

494
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,820
You're turning over some good money.
You don't even have an accountant.

495
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,200
Are you fucking listening
to me, Carlton?

496
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,860
- Yeah.
- You sit there eating baby food,

497
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,050
I'm trying to fucking give you
some advice about your business.

498
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,660
All right. I like it.
It's all right.

499
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,950
I know you fucking like it.
I'm trying to help you out here...

500
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,970
- All right, mate.
...you stupid cunt.

501
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,890
What you've got to do is, you've got
to play the fucking game, mate.

502
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,910
You run a company for a year,
18 months at the most,

503
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,890
then you liquidate it,
swap the directors around.

504
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,180
Keep your money moving and
those cunts won't know where to find it.

505
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,370
Yeah, but I'm not good
with all that paperwork bollocks.

506
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,450
You've only got
to fucking ask, mate.

507
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,310
Tony ran security at some
of the top nightclubs in Essex.

508
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:25,740
I had some of the toughest doors
in London.

509
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,930
Joining forces seemed
like a good idea.

510
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,430
It's been confirmed
that US forces

511
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,520
are being sent to the area.

512
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,160
The UN Security Council
passed Resolution 660

513
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:39,080
condemning the invasion
and demanding a withdrawal.

514
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,060
- Hello.
- Carlton, it's Terry.

515
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,730
I need to see you.
It's urgent.

516
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,680
Have you ever heard
of the Baran brothers?

517
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,160
Turkish scag dealers.
Yeah, go on.

518
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,710
Well, Eddie was doing a bit
of minding work for 'em...

519
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,790
you know, babysitting
the odd shipment and that...

520
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,250
and we was helping him.

521
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,750
Heroin. Mug's game.

522
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,500
I told everybody in my firm
to stay well clear.

523
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,210
And? Come on, spit it out,
you cunt. Who's involved?

524
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,860
Andy Riot, Jason, Eddie and me.

525
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,630
Well, it was Eddie
that sorted it out.

526
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,540
He said we'd do a bit of work
for the Turks and get paid handsome,

527
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,210
- but...
- But?

528
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,610
Some heroin went missing.

529
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,110
How much?

530
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,500
They're saying £10 million.

531
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,460
But they think Eddie's took it.

532
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,440
They've been making threats
against me family.

533
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,630
They've been saying
my kids are gonna get it.

534
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,230
Well, did you do it?

535
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,190
- What?
- What do you mean, "What?"

536
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,110
I'm asking you a question.
Did you have the gear away?

537
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:50,340
I can't believe you asked me that.
Of course I didn't.

538
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,300
- Are you sure?
- I swear on the life of my wife,

539
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,550
I swear on the life of my babies,

540
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,260
I ain't got nothing
to do with this... nothing.

541
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,450
All right.

542
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,950
All right, I believe you.

543
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,510
I know, but no one else does.

544
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,840
Everyone's against me.
I ain't stupid, you know.

545
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,930
If I had £10 million worth of smack,

546
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,910
I'd be on my toes.

547
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,320
They ain't letting this go, Carl.

548
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,660
All right.

549
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,950
I'll see what I can do.

550
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,120
These Turks were a heavy outfit.

551
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,660
I'd vouched for Eddie and the boys,
but now it was up to them.

552
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,990
I had to agree to an interrogation
on their turf.

553
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,020
I wasn't about to start
a war if I could help it,

554
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,660
but I had a little insurance,
just in case.

555
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,080
Barak.

556
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,040
You're late.

557
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,830
Sit down. Sit down.

558
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,920
Down. Down.

559
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,560
Look, we don't need
to tie 'em up.

560
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,060
This is supposed to be
a fucking interrogation.

561
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,940
Their hands will be tied.

562
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,480
Search the exit.

563
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,670
Look, is that really
fucking necessary?

564
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,650
We have already discussed this.

565
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,940
Only the guilty will fear to take it.

566
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,510
Truth serum...

567
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,110
another condition they insisted on.

568
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:57,340
I guess they weren't going
to take my boys on their word.

569
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,070
- Carlton? Carlton!
- Jason, shut up.

570
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,300
Show some respect.

571
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,870
All right, let's get on with this.

572
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:42,660
Do any of you guys know where
this gentleman's missing heroin is?

573
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,890
No. No.

574
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,080
I haven't got a clue.

575
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,850
Look, I swear on my kid's life...

576
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,240
Terry, just answer
the fucking question.

577
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,330
Nuh-uh. No.

578
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,430
- Eddie?
- I know nothing about it.

579
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,790
What are these questions?

580
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,980
We know you took it,
so tell us where it is!

581
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,580
Yeah, all right.
Hold on, hold on.

582
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,120
All right,
I'll put it another way.

583
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,980
Do any of you know where the gear
was before the robbery?

584
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,210
- No.
- No.

585
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,460
No.

586
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,420
Eddie?

587
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,120
I knew it was there.

588
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,650
How did you know the heroin
was there before it was stolen?

589
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,630
You heard him, Eddie.
How did you know it was there?

590
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,500
I just heard about it.

591
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,170
These boys weren't
exactly discreet.

592
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,250
Who told him?
I want a name.

593
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,790
I don't know who exactly.
I just heard it.

594
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,920
Everyone spoke about it.

595
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,590
There was no way
I could've worked there and not known.

596
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:53,190
I know where all of you live!

597
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,800
I know where some of you have
chosen to hide your families!

598
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,820
I will bring them here
and before I have them killed

599
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,380
I will pay a crackhead nigger

600
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,050
to rape each
and every one of them.

601
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,440
Maybe I'll give him
some Spanish fly

602
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,210
so he won't have a problem
shooting them full

603
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,990
of his filthy AIDS
in front of a crowd.

604
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:11,630
Listen here, sunshine!
Just keep their families out of this!

605
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:14,860
Control yourself, Carlton.

606
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,470
We know where your little girls are.

607
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,590
Your family matters to you, yes?

608
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,200
Not to us.
To us they're just flesh.

609
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,780
Are you finished?

610
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,180
I'm finished when I bend you over
and fuck you in the ass.

611
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,260
That's when
I'm fucking finished.

612
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,760
Look, he's choking for fuck's sake!

613
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,780
You're fucking poisoning him!

614
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,550
What you want me to do, eh?

615
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,320
Stand here and watch
my mate fucking die?

616
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,510
Is that what you fucking want?

617
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,310
Lay him on his side.

618
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,710
Where's the fucking heroin?

619
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,290
Where's the fucking heroin?

620
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,440
Tell me!

621
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,730
Don't touch me, you cunt.

622
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,670
My boss is satisfied.
We leave them to you.

623
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,270
Now get this scum
out of my warehouse.

624
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,570
Well, I knew they weren't satisfied.

625
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,960
I told the lads
to make themselves scarce

626
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,050
and I got Eddie and his family
to move in with me

627
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,710
just until things settled down.

628
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,280
- Hello, mate. All right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

629
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,980
Hello. All right?
Got your family of young kids.

630
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,860
Yeah, take them straight through.
Hello, darling.

631
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,570
You all right?
Come in.

632
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,070
Yeah, Mom's gonna
get you a drink.

633
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,700
You never said nothing
about the kids.

634
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,360
Yeah well, they're here now,
aren't they?

635
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,450
- You gonna tell me what's going on?
- No.

636
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:30,090
- Where am I gonna put 'em?
- Look, I don't need you moaning.

637
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:31,970
All I need is a gun.

638
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,540
What you want?

639
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,350
Some bloke told me
to give this to you.

640
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,580
- Who?
- A bubble just down there.

641
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,450
Bubble?

642
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,890
Go on now. Fuck off.

643
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,870
We're leaving.

644
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,010
You just look after
Suzy and the kids,

645
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,930
- make sure nothing happens to them.
- Yeah, all right.

646
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,320
Give me a bell tomorrow,
let me know what's happening.

647
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,720
- All right.
- Yeah, it's clear.

648
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,490
Go on. Go.

649
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,120
Three days went by,

650
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,570
and still Eddie hadn't called.

651
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,870
I was starting to get worried.

652
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,850
Listen, John, I need you
to stay here, all right?

653
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,720
Just keep an eye
on the house, will you?

654
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,010
Make sure Denny's all right.

655
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,580
Yeah.

656
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,550
Oh my God! No!

657
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,130
- Yeah?
- Carlton, it's Rick here.

658
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,690
John told me to give you a call.

659
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,570
He said you're looking
for the Turkish fellows.

660
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,860
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, I'm down at The Den,

661
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,880
and one of 'em is right here
drinking raki with his mates.

662
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,760
Right, you just keep them there.

663
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,740
I'm gonna come over
and put that cunt to sleep.

664
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,680
Listen, if I was you,
I'd get those punters out of there

665
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,660
'cause the moment
those Turks walk out that door,

666
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,850
I'm gonna go
fucking Schwarzenegger on the cunt.

667
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,970
- Do you hear me?
- All right, mate.

668
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,850
- Speak.
- Carlton, it's John.

669
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:45,140
Whatever you're planning,
just stop now. We found 'em.

670
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,290
Found who?

671
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,270
They didn't bother
with truth serum

672
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,520
the second time around.

673
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,120
No, this was torture, Turkish style.

674
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,900
They cut 'em, beat 'em,

675
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,870
jammed cattle prods in their balls,

676
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,310
The cunts stuck butcher's knives
straight through Eddie's leg.

677
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,530
Three days...

678
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,170
they didn't figure it out.

679
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,150
If we'd have known
anything about the heroin,

680
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,440
we would've fucking told them.

681
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,420
Oh fuck.

682
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,820
Where are the others?

683
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,720
You're gonna be all right?

684
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,110
- Yeah.
- You sure?

685
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,300
Okay, darling.

686
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,180
Big brave, yeah?

687
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,300
Get away from me!

688
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,910
Honey, don't be afraid.

689
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:01,510
Stop! Get away!
Get away from me!

690
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,090
It's over. It's over.

691
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,800
But it weren't over, not for Eddie.

692
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,620
Those Turks had killed him
in that warehouse.

693
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,280
They may have left him breathing,

694
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,260
but he died there all the same.

695
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,410
One of my boys was dead,

696
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,490
and those Turks were
about to find out

697
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,410
what it felt like to be
on the wrong end of a kebab knife.

698
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,330
- Who is it?
- It's Tony.

699
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,060
Can I have a word with you?

700
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,430
Having another crack
at the Falklands, are you?

701
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,730
I think it's best
you don't know about this one.

702
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,180
It's best I don't know about it?

703
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,790
Everybody knows
about it, Carlton.

704
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,190
Word is those Turks
cut some of your boys up.

705
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,850
Yeah, that's right.

706
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:02,460
So now what?
You're gonna pop them?

707
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,210
They want a war,
I'll give them a fucking war.

708
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,980
Really, you think
that's what they want?

709
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,960
I think it's what you want.

710
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,940
Take a little risk assessment,
why don't you?

711
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,650
You're thinking of taking on
the Turkish mafia.

712
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,630
Have you completely lost
your fucking mind?

713
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,080
No, I ain't lost my fucking mind.

714
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,960
I've lost a mate...
a very good mate...

715
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,940
to a load of fucking Turks,
all right?

716
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,380
And I ain't gonna just stand here
and do fuck-all about it.

717
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,570
This ain't about you.
This ain't about your pride.

718
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,750
This is about your family.

719
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,730
And trust me,
they will fucking kill 'em.

720
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,920
Not if I kill 'em first,

721
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,730
which is exactly what I plan to do
if you get out of my fucking way.

722
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,820
So what, you put a few
of them down and that's it?

723
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,050
They will not stop until
they fucking destroy you.

724
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,760
Not before they kill Karen, Denny,

725
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,460
your babies,
anyone you've ever fucking loved!

726
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,440
- Shut up, you sick fuck!
- Fucking cunt!

727
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,260
Get your fucking hands
off me, you cunt!

728
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,920
- Calm yourself down!
- Fuck off!

729
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,800
- Calm yourself down!
- Fuck off! You really going to

730
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,240
throw all this away 'cause that
fucking idiot didn't take your advice?

731
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,470
All right, just get
your hands off me, Tony.

732
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,340
- Are you going to calm down?
- All right, I'm calm.

733
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,110
Yeah, you sound fucking calm!

734
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,030
Tony, get your hands off me.

735
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,720
I could've saved him.

736
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,120
He was dead the moment
the gear went missing.

737
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,200
Swallow your pride, Carlton.

738
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,080
It's a painful pill to take
and I know it hurts,

739
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,160
but you've just got
to walk away, mate.

740
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,660
Sometimes you've got
to listen to your mates.

741
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,000
I took his advice
and I backed down.

742
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,470
An all-out war with the Turks would've
been a drawn-out bloody affair.

743
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,330
Andy, Terry and Jason
were broken men

744
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,720
and they left the firm soon after.

745
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,740
We never did find out
who took the heroin,

746
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,240
and I guess there's
some cunt still out there

747
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,220
praying that we never do.

748
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,510
So who else is going?

749
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:31,530
Just having a drink with one
of Tony's mates. He's just got out.

750
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,200
What's his name?

751
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:37,050
Pat Tate.
You don't know him.

752
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,220
Is Emma going?

753
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,720
No, she's staying at home
like a good little girl.

754
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,590
What, is it full of tarts then?

755
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,200
Darling, you know
I've only got eyes for you.

756
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,860
Fucking glad you made it, mate.

757
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,900
Didn't think you was coming.

758
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,880
Well, I had to service
the old woman.

759
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,070
I had to give her an oil change.
What you want me to say?

760
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,420
You don't have to
say nothing, Carlton.

761
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,670
I just hope she didn't
wear you out, mate,

762
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,380
'cause this place is
wall-to-wall fanny.

763
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,570
Yeah, I can see that.

764
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,550
- Hey, Tony boy!
- Hey!

765
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,840
Carlton, this here
is Jim Gerenuk.

766
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,960
- How you doing, mate?
- We call him Jimmy G.

767
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,780
Hey, it's a fucking
great party, Tony.

768
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,240
- You're enjoying it?
- Yeah, I'm doing all right.

769
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,900
- See you.
- See you, man. Nice to meet you.

770
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,610
- Fucking Welsh cunt.
- Yeah.

771
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,670
First thing first, mate.
Get this up your hooter.

772
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,320
Yeah.

773
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,880
- Oi oi!
- Oi, Tony!

774
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,000
This is Carlton.
He's like my fucking brother.

775
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,400
Carl, this is Pat.

776
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,790
- Hello, mate. You all right?
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

777
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,880
Don't mind us,
we're just having a little reunion.

778
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,380
I was in the nick with these two...
Darren, Mickey.

779
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:57,980
- Carlton.
- You all right?

780
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,540
Hello, pal.

781
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,810
Everybody knew who
Pat Tate was.

782
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,100
He was a legend
in the Essex underworld.

783
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,670
After a "quiet meal"

784
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,440
down the Happy Eater
in Basildon...

785
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:11,310
Pass the salt.

786
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,480
Now cradle my balls.

787
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,290
- You mean like that?
- Yeah, but slow down a little.

788
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,060
Don't fucking rush it.

789
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,160
Oi. What's that?

790
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,080
- It's the bill, sir.
- Yeah, I can see it's the fucking bill,

791
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,850
but I didn't ask for it, did I?

792
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,350
I just assumed that since
you hadn't ordered anything

793
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,160
for the last 20 minutes
that you didn't want anything else.

794
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,120
Who are you to assume
you know anything about me?

795
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,100
Take it away.

796
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,850
What are you fucking looking at,
nose ointment?

797
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:48,180
- What's this they've charged us for?
- Show us.

798
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:54,430
- What's that?
- It's the service charge.

799
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,100
That's very comical, son.

800
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,600
I thought only proper restaurants
charged that.

801
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,950
You had the sit-down menus...

802
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,350
Oh, right. So if I stood up and ate,

803
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,530
- you'd have charged me less.
- Well, it's policy.

804
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,760
Listen to me,
you fucking lowlife jobsworth cunt.

805
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,990
For the last 20 minutes she's had
her hand wrapped around my cock,

806
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:12,550
and every time
I get into a rhythm

807
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:16,200
one of you fucking mugs
walks over and puts me off.

808
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,970
Now maybe if I'd
have shot my bolt,

809
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,680
I'd have paid the service,
but you keep coming over here

810
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,280
- and interrupting me.
- Sir, if you don't calm down,

811
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,570
- I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
- Get your coat.

812
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,720
Oh, well done, babe.

813
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,590
Shut your fucking mouth!

814
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,820
You, fuck off... now.
How much money you got in there?

815
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,220
- What?
- How much money you got in there?!

816
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,550
- Pat, don't do that.
- How much money you got in there, cunt?

817
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:45,680
Oh my God!

818
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,970
Shut your fucking noise
and get in the car now.

819
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,050
Move!

820
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,590
I'm fucking warning you...

821
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,090
you say a fucking word,
all of you get what that cunt got.

822
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,900
Would you mind stopping all that
and stepping outside the car, sir?

823
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,610
Fucking hell.

824
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,420
Hiya.

825
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,710
He was gonna get 10 years for it.

826
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,320
10 years for stealing 800 quid.

827
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,500
That's less than 100 quid a year.

828
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,110
But you know what?

829
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,820
Pat had other plans.

830
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,730
Go! Go go!

831
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,340
The police tried
to set up a roadblock,

832
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,840
but Pat was too quick.
He slipped off to Spain

833
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:38,170
but was rearrested
in Gibraltar visiting friends.

834
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,690
Cor! Fuck me,
it's only Tom Cruise.

835
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,670
Mate, let me get a pen and paper,

836
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:51,920
I want to get your autograph.

837
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,310
My fucking bird would love that.

838
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,690
Hey, Craig, say hello
to my man Carlton.

839
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:06,920
We've met.

840
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,190
You want to tell me something?

841
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,620
No. I'm sorry.

842
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,500
Tony, I didn't know
he was a friend of yours.

843
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,890
- If I'd known...
- Let me just say to you, fellow,

844
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,020
it ain't a good idea to go out drinking
on an empty head, all right?

845
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,100
Are you looking to get hurt?

846
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:32,120
You've fucked up now, son.

847
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,450
Get the fuck out of here,

848
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,790
you fucking useless
muggy cunt!

849
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:41,180
Fuck's sake!

850
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:47,430
You ever mouth off
to Carlton Leach like that again,

851
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,830
and I swear I'll leave you
where I fucking find you.

852
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,600
Now fuck off, cunt!

853
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,680
The thing about Craig was

854
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,760
he didn't exactly have
the best start in life.

855
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,830
His mom had been knocking off
some toy boy called John,

856
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,850
but she had to put a stop to it
when her old man got her up the duff.

857
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:06,800
It would be an understatement
to say the lad took it badly.

858
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:27,110
I did this to prove
how much I love you.

859
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:31,280
I love you, baby.
I done this for both of us.

860
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,170
Poor bastard
never stood a chance.

861
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:49,300
He was a fuck up
before he was even born.

862
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,740
Tony paid his mortgage,
and in return Craig was his runner.

863
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,090
He took all the risks.

864
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,170
If Tony needed a couple
of kilos of puff picked up

865
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:57,940
or a few hundred pills dropped off,

866
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,400
well, he'd just give him a call.

867
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:02,010
What the fuck are
you cunts looking at?

868
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,190
Tony brought Pat into the firm

869
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:11,170
and gave him control
over a couple of doors

870
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:14,300
and a legitimate job title to keep
his probation officer sweet.

871
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,270
You know, Tony,
you've got to forget charging

872
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,050
those scumbags
to deal in your clubs.

873
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,860
I mean they pay you
a poxy fucking grand a week

874
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,500
and they're nicking 12,
13 large over a weekend.

875
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,900
- That's the way it goes, mate.
- No, it ain't. Fuck 'em.

876
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,500
You've got to get into
this business proper, mate.

877
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,790
You've got to get them dealers
to buy wholesale from you.

878
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,980
Listen. I've got all
the contacts sorted out.

879
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,900
You buy the pills
at a fraction of the selling price

880
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,080
and you knock them out
to the dealers at £6 a pop.

881
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,940
I'm saying we can smash
the life out of this and earn a fortune.

882
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,900
Rolfe, you mother's cunt!

883
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,770
- Where the fuck is he?
- He's not here, Tucker.

884
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,540
It's truth or violence...
your fucking choice.

885
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,420
He's not fucking here.
I swear it.

886
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:56,580
Why not be original and be the first
bitch in history to tell the truth?

887
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,940
You lying cunt!

888
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,210
Fucking cunt!

889
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,440
Come here, wanker!
Come here!

890
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,370
What are you doing, Tony?

891
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,560
You could've fucking killed me!

892
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,160
I wish I had,
you unreliable little cunt!

893
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,830
I've been calling you
all fucking day

894
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:25,950
- and you don't answer!
- I was fucked up...

895
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:29,180
- in bed!
- I've had to make two handoffs myself.

896
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,370
Now what if I'd gotten
fucking nicked?

897
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:34,390
I'm sorry, Tony.
I'm sorry.

898
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,270
"I'm sorry."

899
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:38,140
You're a fucking waste
of space, Craig.

900
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,810
You're off the fucking firm!

901
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,950
If you want
your mortgage paid,

902
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,930
you can whistle out
of your ass for it,

903
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:44,600
you fucking useless cunt!

904
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,450
The firm was Craig's life,

905
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,330
and without it he had no direction,

906
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,780
no purpose.

907
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,280
He wanted to be back inside,

908
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,740
no matter what.

909
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,140
Have a seat, sir.
Fancy a puff of that?

910
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:20,010
No, have you got
anything stronger?

911
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,760
I thought you were
off the heavy stuff.

912
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,260
Yeah, I am. I have
a little dabble now and again,

913
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,130
but basically I'm clean.

914
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:32,200
Are you sure?
It's good stuff, pretty boy.

915
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,670
Don't call him pretty boy.

916
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,550
Why not? He's pretty.

917
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,440
Why don't you
just fuck him then?

918
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,360
Look, mate. I don't want to get
in the middle of some domestic, do I?

919
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,820
Oh, she's been
on my case all day.

920
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:51,150
Just ignore her,
then she might fuck off.

921
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,460
That's fucking charming.
Look at the state of her.

922
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:59,280
All right, mate. Just get over it
and let's do some business, yeah?

923
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,690
Right, here's your 20 kilos.
So where's the money?

924
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,860
I ain't got no money.

925
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,090
Now why would I bother paying
a fucking insect like you?

926
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,420
Who you calling a fucking insect?

927
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,500
What would you prefer?

928
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,310
Ex-scaghead two-bob junkie cunt?

929
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,130
Fucking cunt!

930
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:30,110
So fucking easy.

931
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,060
Fuck. Come here.

932
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,040
You ain't gonna get far

933
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,850
with 50 mils of Largactil
in your beer.

934
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,100
I know you like drugs, Chris.

935
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,060
You've had a right touch.

936
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,770
'Cause tonight...

937
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:24,160
I'm gonna give you all the drugs

938
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,140
you'll ever need.

939
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:00,620
Don't look so upset, mate.

940
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,260
It's a freebie.

941
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:07,180
I know you're
a little skint at the moment,

942
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,200
what with you owing
Tony two grand.

943
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,490
What are you talking about?

944
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,570
What are
you talking about?

945
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:19,050
You thought you were
gonna swerve him,

946
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:23,320
but I'm here to fucking collect.

947
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,440
What have you given him?

948
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,530
Ketamine.

949
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,130
Hey, babe, get me a beer.

950
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:49,360
Yeah, sure.
Does Chris want one?

951
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:52,690
Nah. He's had enough tonight.

952
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,610
Why are we stopping?

953
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:07,380
Just dropping Chris off, babe.

954
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,710
Yeah, but he doesn't
live here, does he?

955
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,960
Get out there, you fat cunt.

956
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:41,020
You ain't gonna
fucking believe this.

957
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,310
He's only gone and killed Chris.

958
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:46,960
You can say he's a fucking useless
spastic shit-cunt,

959
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:50,290
but if that's not dedication,
I don't know what fucking is.

960
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:53,000
He's a fucking liability, isn't he?

961
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,810
What's he doing going around murdering
some kid for two grand?

962
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,930
Tony, it's unnecessary.

963
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,540
No, he's all right, Carl.

964
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:04,560
Anyway, I already told him
he's back in the firm, mate.

965
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,430
# Baby, I need you here with me #

966
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,990
# because I'm trying... #

967
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,870
Along with working together,

968
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,160
me and Tony did a couple
of little earners on the side.

969
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,180
Jimmy G had set up a deal
for some stolen traveler's checks,

970
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,100
but after four canceled meets,
Tony had got the hump.

971
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:35,490
My time ain't fucking free.

972
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:39,030
I've been up and down
the A13 nine times for that cunt,

973
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:42,160
and he gobbed off to Emma
about me fucking that Chinky bird.

974
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,720
She's been at me all fucking week.

975
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,700
Me and Craig are
gonna punish the cunt.

976
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,260
You wanna come?

977
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:50,070
Look, if you're gonna slap
the geezer, just fucking slap him.

978
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,160
What do you need
me and Craig for?

979
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,970
'Cause we're gonna do a demolition job
on the cunt, that's why.

980
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:57,260
Oh, look, leave it out, all right?

981
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:00,700
- You need to calm down, don't you?
- You don't want in?

982
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:03,610
No. No, I don't want in.

983
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,320
- Oi, Jimmy. Hurry up, will you?
- What's happening, Jim?

984
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:11,740
- All right, boys?
- How are you, mate? You all right?

985
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:19,550
- Fuck.
- Get the fuck back, Tony!

986
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:22,670
- I'll fucking kill you.
- I'm fucking doing it! I swear to God!

987
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,760
Calm down!
I'll fucking hit you!

988
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,470
Come on...

989
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,070
Get off me!

990
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,420
Tony, I fucking love you.
Please don't hurt me.

991
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,990
Don't listen to him, Tony!

992
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:39,650
Think of all the agg
he's cause you!

993
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:42,670
Yeah, all the agg you've caused me,

994
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:45,690
you fucking shit-cunt!

995
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:48,090
What do you think, Jimmy?

996
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,690
Craig, take the TV, video and hi-fi

997
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:52,360
and shove it
in the back of the motor.

998
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,750
I'm fining you, Jimmy.
Is that fair enough?

999
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:57,880
- Get off!
- Burn him, Tone.

1000
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,960
- Burn him.
- No, don't burn me!

1001
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:02,360
- Burn the cunt! Burn him, Tone!
- No, please.

1002
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,840
Tony, no!

1003
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:20,690
Tony! Fuck you! Please! Oh God!

1004
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:25,480
Oh, fuck.

1005
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,270
Fuck you!

1006
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:37,140
- No more, Tony.
- "No more"? We've hardly even started.

1007
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,750
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1008
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:45,160
You cunt!

1009
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,270
You bastard!

1010
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:53,910
Craig, what you fucking
let him get away for?

1011
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,680
I had the CD player
in me hands.

1012
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,770
Fucking soppy cunt.
You're rolling around

1013
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:00,680
on the floor for two minutes,
you fucking idiot.

1014
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,700
Now get in
the fucking motor.

1015
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,450
- Yes?
- Are you Jimmy's dad?

1016
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:14,120
Yeah, why?
What's this about?

1017
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,350
- Is he in?
- No, why? What's this about?

1018
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,370
'Cause we're looking for him,
you fucking Welsh cunt.

1019
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:23,910
You fucking tell him
to meet us face to face

1020
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,260
or I'm gonna come in there

1021
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,970
and start cutting your daughter's
fingers off one at a time.

1022
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:30,160
- You got that?
- Yeah.

1023
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,830
I said have you got that?
Have you fucking got that?

1024
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:33,700
Yeah, I got it.

1025
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,380
Jimmy, don't! Please don't!

1026
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:33,800
You fucking... you fucking cunt!

1027
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:36,300
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1028
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,380
Are you all right?
Is the baby all right?

1029
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,530
- Fucking Jimmy!
- Pat!

1030
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:49,730
You fucking cunt!
Come back!

1031
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:53,270
You fucking mug!
I'm gonna kill you, you cunt!

1032
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:57,440
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Pat! Come back!

1033
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:03,480
Yo, Jimmy!
Where the fuck are you?

1034
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,380
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy!

1035
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,770
Jimmy's fucking gone.

1036
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:12,860
Jimmy's fucking dead!

1037
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,730
Fucking hell! Run!

1038
01:12:21,190 --> 01:12:22,650
Fucking...

1039
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:32,020
Fuck you! Come on!

1040
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:37,850
Who's laughing now?

1041
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:41,190
Welcome to
the fucking neighborhood!

1042
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,540
Evening.

1043
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,390
This is supposed to be
a hospital, isn't it?

1044
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:54,100
What's the matter with you?

1045
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,080
Do you want a line, Carlton?

1046
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,950
You lads are taking the piss, huh?

1047
01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:59,930
Yeah, fucking right we are, mate.

1048
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,470
Here, have a go with Sadie.

1049
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,450
- That's Sandy.
- Yeah, whatever.

1050
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:08,160
I'm paying her
a fucking three-a a day

1051
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,040
and she likes to earn her money.
Don't you, babe?

1052
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,470
- Sucks a fucking blinding cock.
- I sure do.

1053
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:15,660
- No, you're all right, love.
- Are you sure?

1054
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,950
- It's no bother.
- No thanks.

1055
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:24,830
You remember Darren, don't you?

1056
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:27,430
- Yeah, we met at your party.
- Yeah.

1057
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,200
- Yeah, I was with Mickey.
- Yeah, the old geezer.

1058
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,490
We was all
in the nick together.

1059
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,780
Yeah well, you'll be back in there
if Old Bill turn up here,

1060
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,180
see this place.
Look at the state you're in.

1061
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,260
There's fucking cocaine
all over the bed, Tony.

1062
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,550
Who in this hospital
is gonna grass us up?

1063
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,340
I still can't believe
it was Jimmy that put you in here.

1064
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:49,200
Yeah? Well, that no-good cunt's

1065
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,700
gonna end up in a box
when I get ahold of him.

1066
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,410
Craig, visiting time is over.
Get these others out of here.

1067
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:58,150
- But we've been having so much fun.
- Fuck off.

1068
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,010
I'll see you later, Pat.

1069
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,680
I'll give your best to Mickey.

1070
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,970
Come on, babe.
Come on, babe.

1071
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:09,510
Here, Darren.

1072
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,690
Don't forget to tell Mickey
about that little bit of business.

1073
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:13,150
Oh, yeah yeah yeah. Sweet.

1074
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,570
Here, Carlton.

1075
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:21,070
I need you
to get Jimmy down here.

1076
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,940
Tell him I want to sort things out
and put an end to this,

1077
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:25,030
but I need you to get him
down here and we'll do the rest.

1078
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,010
Meaning?

1079
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:28,780
Meaning I'm gonna
do him with this.

1080
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,070
And I'll get rid
of the gun and the body.

1081
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,050
Oh, that's a fucking cracking idea.

1082
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:36,170
You're just gonna go
and shoot someone in a hospital?

1083
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:38,980
Behave yourself, will you?
You're on parole, Pat.

1084
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,750
Yeah well, fuck all that.
That wrong'un has gotta go

1085
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,770
because he's made me and him look
like a right pair of cunts.

1086
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,000
All right.
Well, you just get well

1087
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,710
and I'll come see you
in Chelmsford nick,

1088
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,270
all right?

1089
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:11,690
- Hello?
- Carlton, it's Jimmy.

1090
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,600
He said they'd rape my sister.

1091
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,790
They threatened my dad.

1092
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:18,770
They smashed up my house.

1093
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:22,100
They call me 10 times a day,
leaving threats on my answerphone.

1094
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,290
Don't cry, son.
All right?

1095
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:31,060
It's not gonna help.

1096
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:35,330
I can't believe
they turned on me like that.

1097
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,410
I shot at Pat because I knew...

1098
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:39,600
I knew there was no other way.

1099
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,560
They'll never stop now.

1100
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,270
Never.

1101
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,700
Until I'm dead.

1102
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,620
Let me speak to Tony
and I'll see what I can do.

1103
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:55,430
It's too late for that.
It's too fucking late for that.

1104
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,790
There's only one way to make sure
my family stays safe.

1105
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:09,180
I wanna die.

1106
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,470
You just slow down.

1107
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,660
No, listen. I know you're
as harsh as they are, Carlton,

1108
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,260
but at least you're always fair.
At least you're always fucking fair.

1109
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,950
Tony doesn't have
a set of rules you can live by.

1110
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:26,470
I need you...

1111
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:29,180
I need you to kill me.

1112
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,950
You what?

1113
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,970
I'm too scared
to do it by myself.

1114
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,110
Please...

1115
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:43,140
protect my family...

1116
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:46,880
and shoot me.

1117
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:52,930
You can't ask me that.
You can't ask anybody...

1118
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:54,900
I don't know what else to do.

1119
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,240
I don't know what else to do.

1120
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:05,940
Well, you can start
by putting the gun down.

1121
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:12,090
And then you get
yourself out of Essex

1122
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:14,170
and you lay low for awhile.

1123
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:16,880
You keep yourself out
of fucking trouble

1124
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,900
and I'll see what I can do.
Do you hear me?

1125
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,880
Well, it was bound
to fucking happen.

1126
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,070
The nurse came in
and changed Pat's bed

1127
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:26,670
while he was in surgery
and found his gun.

1128
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:30,000
Pat went straight back
to prison on violation of his parole.

1129
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,750
Couple of days later, Jimmy was
picked up with an unlicensed firearm.

1130
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,730
Although it wasn't
the gun that shot Pat,

1131
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:38,550
it was still enough to put him
behind bars for a stretch.

1132
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,520
Best place for him, really.

1133
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,980
He'd be safer on the inside.

1134
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,380
All right, Carlton?

1135
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,170
Fuck me. What's this?
You ain't on brown as well, are you?

1136
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:12,290
- It's Nubain.
- Looks like heroin to me.

1137
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:15,310
- Well, it fucking ain't.
- I can vouch for that, Carlton.

1138
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,960
You? Don't make me laugh.

1139
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,980
I think we'd better have a talk.

1140
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,330
What's him and that
walking clap doing here?

1141
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:30,410
They make me fucking itch
just looking at them.

1142
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:32,500
Can't you just get along
with them for me, Carl?

1143
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,410
I put up with the cunt.
That's about it.

1144
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:40,100
Anyway, I thought you was knocking it
on the head now that Pat's inside.

1145
01:18:41,770 --> 01:18:43,950
When was the last time
you were clean, for fuck's sake?

1146
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:46,970
Fuck clean.
I can work 22 hours a day like this.

1147
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,850
Yeah, but for how long?

1148
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,830
You'll be fucking dead
carrying on like that.

1149
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,660
What's the story with this kitchen?

1150
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:58,740
I thought you said that geezer would
have it done by now.

1151
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:01,560
- So did I.
- He's taking a fucking piss, isn't he?

1152
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,680
Come and check this out.

1153
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:08,010
I had to teach him not
to fuck with me, Carlton.

1154
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,200
Definitely something
wrong with you.

1155
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:40,200
- Come on!
- It had been almost a year

1156
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,280
since Pat had
gone back to prison.

1157
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,570
Tony and Craig were becoming
increasingly powerful

1158
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:46,760
in the drug world
while he was inside.

1159
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:49,570
Pat wanted to get
right back in with them.

1160
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:52,490
You all right, son?
You look a bit long in the boat.

1161
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:55,720
Who fucked your mother?
Tell us, we'll sort him out.

1162
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:57,900
He's a cunt, ain't he?

1163
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:01,440
How would you like to come
on a little deal with us?

1164
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,940
Be a good little earner.
Tell him, Pat.

1165
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:07,070
Mickey Steele's got
a shipment coming in from Holland.

1166
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,150
£300 a kilo.
Not cheap, I know,

1167
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:11,130
but he reckons
there's no fucking chance

1168
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:14,360
- of anybody getting pulled by customs.
- And how do you know that?

1169
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:17,170
Because they don't get some fucking mug
to bring it in on the ferry.

1170
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:19,780
They bring it
across the channel on a powerboat.

1171
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,550
They've done it
fucking 100 times.

1172
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:46,650
Now Mickey needs 80 large
up front to get the gear.

1173
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,310
He's in for £15,000.
I'm in for £40,000.

1174
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,810
Fucking £40,000?
You ain't got 40 large, Pat.

1175
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:52,480
Yeah, but I will
in a couple of days, won't I?

1176
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,500
- How's that then?
- Tone, I told you twice.

1177
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,480
I've got all these
contacts sorted out.

1178
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,500
You make me laugh. I didn't spend
all my time in the nick wanking.

1179
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,690
- Yes, you fucking did.
- Yeah, you're right.

1180
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:05,600
"Fucking let me out!"

1181
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,020
I don't know. We'll see, all right?

1182
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:12,480
Shut up.
What's the matter with you?

1183
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,080
Even the fucking
dancing monkey's in for £6,000.

1184
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:20,500
Tony, will you fill
him in on the rest,

1185
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:23,210
'cause I've got to try my luck
with that little blonde tart over there.

1186
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,520
- What do you reckon?
- Filth, mate.

1187
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,500
No, utter fucking filth.

1188
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,680
With a little bit of luck,
I might get a golden shower tonight.

1189
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:44,040
So what do you reckon, mate?

1190
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,020
No, I ain't got
the dough, all right?

1191
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,100
I've got nothing put aside.

1192
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,660
You heard what Pat said,

1193
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:51,950
you're guaranteed
to double up your money on this.

1194
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:54,870
Yeah well, his idea of a guarantee
and mine are two different things.

1195
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,850
I'm just trying
to help you out, mate.

1196
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,350
Yeah, I know. I appreciate it.

1197
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:01,120
I don't want to fall out over this.

1198
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:02,780
You're my brother, Carlton,

1199
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,280
and I fucking love you.

1200
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,680
It's good to know someone
is looking out for me.

1201
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,760
Yeah, always. You know that.

1202
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:18,510
Do me a favor.
just be careful of him.

1203
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:22,680
- Get off me!
- Go! Go!

1204
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:25,180
- Get off me!
- Go! Go!

1205
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,160
Pat was at it again,

1206
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,550
and even Tony could see
he had become a liability.

1207
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:31,010
In a drug-fueled rage,

1208
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:33,200
he threw the one person
who still stuck by him,

1209
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,700
Kate Carter, out of his house.

1210
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,680
She ran straight to Mickey Steele,

1211
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:40,070
her closest friend while Pat was inside.

1212
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:41,630
Then the dope deal went tits up

1213
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:43,300
when it turned out
the gear was moody.

1214
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,220
You couldn't even burn it,
let alone smoke it.

1215
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:47,670
Mick, listen to me.

1216
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:50,070
You couldn't con
a 12-year-old with that gear.

1217
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:52,570
It's shit and I'm down £40,000.

1218
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,650
- I'll sort it out.
- You fucking will, you slippery cunt,

1219
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:57,260
or I'm gonna come around there
and sort you out.

1220
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,550
- Jesus Christ, Pat.
- Jesus Christ?

1221
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:02,780
Jesus fucking Christ?
You'll be screaming that, you mug,

1222
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,280
when I come around there
and do you with this blade,

1223
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,940
you fucking no-good cunt!

1224
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,610
Pat may have been
a fucking loon,

1225
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:10,800
but this time he was ranting
for a good reason.

1226
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,670
He'd only gone
and borrowed £40,000 off

1227
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:14,750
the most feared criminals in Essex...

1228
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,150
the Hexell brothers.
The deal was that

1229
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,340
in two weeks time
he'd pay them back £50,000.

1230
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:21,210
Look, he's been
to Amsterdam two or three times,

1231
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:22,980
this time he lost the gear.

1232
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:26,630
I swear on my fucking life I wouldn't
dream about having you two over.

1233
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,130
Mickey Steele's
done this to all of us.

1234
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:30,900
Mickey Steele's your fucking mate.
Why would he do that?

1235
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,880
Let me get ahold of him,
I'll bring him in front of you,

1236
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,900
I'll put a blade to his throat
and when you're satisfied, I'll do him.

1237
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:38,290
They gave him a month
to come up with the goods.

1238
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:40,790
And after a lot of agg,
Darren Nicholls and Mickey Steele

1239
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,400
went to Amsterdam
and recovered the money.

1240
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,480
Pat and the boys may have
got their dough back,

1241
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,880
but that was it.
They hadn't made a bean.

1242
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:49,650
They'd had their time wasted,

1243
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:53,500
and Pat, he was still £10,000 short
of what he owed the brothers.

1244
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:56,000
It's fucking lovely.

1245
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,770
Yeah, a nice bit of kit.

1246
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:11,520
Are you gonna help
a girl in trouble, Mickey?

1247
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,910
You can stay here
as long as you need.

1248
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:16,410
Don't worry about it.

1249
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:20,270
Pat is shouting his mouth off
about you to anyone who'll listen.

1250
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,450
He said your operation's a joke

1251
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:23,910
and that you ripped him off.

1252
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,680
He's a junkie.

1253
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:28,390
He's a fucking steroid freak.

1254
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:34,540
And that don't worry you?

1255
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,200
He's out of control.

1256
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,700
He says he's gonna kill you.

1257
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,890
He's all mouth.

1258
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:42,870
He's a fucking idiot.

1259
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:47,560
I don't know, Mickey.

1260
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,350
His threats seem pretty thorough to me.

1261
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:55,680
Look at me.

1262
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:59,430
I don't have a home to go to

1263
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:01,410
and my child

1264
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:03,910
is staying at my mom's.

1265
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:11,300
What sort of a situation
is that, Mickey?

1266
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:16,510
- Do you trust me, Kate?
- Of course I do.

1267
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:18,700
Then listen to me.

1268
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,090
I'm old school,

1269
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:23,180
been around
the block a few times.

1270
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:26,090
Mugs like Pat Tate come around
every once in a while.

1271
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,530
But you know something?

1272
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,200
What?

1273
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,430
The loud ones never last, Kate.

1274
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:37,450
He'll get what's coming to him.

1275
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,280
# Move your body #

1276
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:46,610
Yeah, can I have a 12", please?

1277
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,880
What? What do you mean
you don't do four toppings?

1278
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,960
- It's a pizza shop.
- Give me the phone.

1279
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:56,920
What's your problem, mate?

1280
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,900
Well, why can't we have
all four fucking toppings?

1281
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,150
Because it's not
on the menu, sir.

1282
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:01,820
What are you talking about,
"on the menu"?

1283
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:03,590
We're talking about cheese, you cunt.

1284
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:06,500
Listen. Deliver the fucking
pizza she wants,

1285
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,530
or I'll come down there
and fucking open you up.

1286
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,500
Sir, this phone delivery line

1287
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,800
is actually only for people
over the age of 12.

1288
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,880
Now if you'd like to calm down

1289
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,960
and get your mommy
or dad to phone back,

1290
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,840
I'll be happy
to send you a pizza.

1291
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:22,340
- Who am I talking to?
- My name is Roger Spooner, sir.

1292
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,790
- I'm the manager.
- Well, Rog,

1293
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:25,770
you do yourself a favor, mate,

1294
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:28,380
'cause this is your last chance
for a peaceful night.

1295
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:30,460
Deliver the fucking pizza
she wants

1296
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:33,580
or your mom and dad will be down
at the morgue at 4:00 in the morning

1297
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:36,500
identifying your body.
Do you got me, cunt?

1298
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,650
Where's Roger fucking Spooner?

1299
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,830
- Where is he?
- That's me. Can I help you?

1300
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,830
Fucking mug me off down
the phone line, you cunt?

1301
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,670
If I asked you now
for four toppings,

1302
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:57,330
you'd give them to me,
you cunt, wouldn't you?

1303
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:58,690
- Yeah yeah.
- You'd give them to me, wouldn't you?

1304
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:00,870
- Yes!
- Okay.

1305
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:13,160
Anyone got a fucking problem
with what I just done? Eh?

1306
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,040
You've got a fucking problem?

1307
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,120
Fat bollocks, you've got
a fucking problem?

1308
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,850
Eh?

1309
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,450
Pat's continuing war
with the fast-food industry

1310
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:28,890
resulted in the geezer giving
a detailed statement to the police.

1311
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,180
Come morning,
he found out who Pat was

1312
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:34,410
and suddenly pizza boy had
a bad case of amnesia.

1313
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:36,700
Pat, Tony and Craig
were out of control.

1314
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,790
They just did whatever
they fucking liked.

1315
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:40,560
They robbed who they wanted

1316
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,060
and destroyed any cunt
that got in their way.

1317
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:29,610
While you're doing that,
I'm gonna take the vegetables.

1318
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:32,010
I've peeled them
and I'm roughly chopping

1319
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:35,760
the swede, the carrots
and the parsnips.

1320
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:37,840
Of course everything's going to be
blended up in the mixer at the end.

1321
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,240
If you prefer a chunky soup...

1322
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,940
That will be your boyfriend.

1323
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:45,960
...and then you can still
have the chunky vegetables

1324
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,420
left in your soup.

1325
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,820
It ain't for me.

1326
01:28:58,150 --> 01:28:59,920
- Hello?
- Carlton.

1327
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,530
Sledge, what do you want?

1328
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:04,500
Have you seen
the telly this morning?

1329
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,110
Not much.
She's got some bollocks on here.

1330
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:09,500
Well, try the news.
I'm serious, mate.

1331
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,900
I think something might have
happened to Tony and the boys.

1332
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:17,310
The bodies of three men

1333
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,880
have been discovered
in a Range Rover

1334
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,960
on a farm in Rettendon in Essex.

1335
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,420
It's thought that these were victims

1336
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:24,810
of a brutal gangland slaying.

1337
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:27,210
The police are not divulging
much information at present,

1338
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:30,230
but we do know that
all three men were gunned down

1339
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:33,250
somewhere between 6:00 p.m.
and 12:00 p.m. last night.

1340
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,940
We hope to come back
to this later in the bulletin.

1341
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:41,060
There were serious clashes
between the prime minister

1342
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:42,420
and the leader of the opposition...

1343
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,390
- Hello, Paul. It's Carl.
- Hello, Carl.

1344
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:46,790
- Have you seen the news?
- No, not yet. Why?

1345
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:49,190
Can you pop around Emma's?
I've been trying to get ahold

1346
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,480
of them all morning.
No one's answering. It's just engaged.

1347
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,250
- What's going on?
- Well, I don't know, mate.

1348
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:56,270
Just do me a favor.
Just go around there and give me a call.

1349
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:58,560
- On me way.
- All right, mate. Ta.

1350
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:05,430
This is giving me
the fucking creeps, this is.

1351
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,290
Hello, mate.
It's me again.

1352
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,370
Listen, mate, can you
give me a call back, please?

1353
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:23,870
Well, I'm just getting
a bit worried.

1354
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:27,510
So just give me a call back
as soon as you get this message.

1355
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:29,600
All right, mate. Ta.

1356
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:32,930
Hey.

1357
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,660
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm no all right.

1358
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:40,330
I can't get ahold of no cunt.

1359
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:45,120
Something's happened.

1360
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,700
Babe, you're scaring me.

1361
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,680
Back to the murders in Rettendon.

1362
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:53,450
The police have announced

1363
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,840
that there will be a news conference
later this evening,

1364
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:58,660
when it's expected that the names
of those murdered will be released.

1365
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,570
Carlton. Carl?

1366
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:03,970
- Yeah, go on. What's happening?
- Emma's fine.

1367
01:31:03,970 --> 01:31:06,570
Tony didn't come back last night,
but she ain't worried.

1368
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:08,550
- Hold on, mate.
- Paul?

1369
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,010
Fucking hell,
the Old Bill's just turned up.

1370
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:11,680
Emma!

1371
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,800
- Paul, talk to me.
- Emma!

1372
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,240
I'm gonna have to go.
I don't know what's going on down there.

1373
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,840
Everything's fine
as far as I know, but not here.

1374
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:23,550
I'm gonna have to go.
Laters, mate.

1375
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,720
Police have tonight
released the names

1376
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:34,490
of the three men murdered
in Rettendon

1377
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:36,150
on the night
of the 6th of December.

1378
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:38,960
The victims were
38-year-old Anthony Tucker,

1379
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,050
37-year-old Patrick Tate,

1380
01:31:41,050 --> 01:31:43,230
and 26-year-old Craig Rolfe.

1381
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:46,880
It's believed that all three men had
gangland connections.

1382
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,900
When the police informed
Tony's dad of his son's death,

1383
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,570
he dropped dead
of a heart attack

1384
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,550
right there in front of them.

1385
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:56,150
After the tears
came the questions:

1386
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:58,960
Who murdered Tony,
Pat and Craig that night?

1387
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:18,650
- Evening, lads.
- Before you start, he wasn't speeding,

1388
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:21,770
the car's not stolen, the fucking
tax disc is in date, all right?

1389
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:24,060
I've got some information
I'd like to share with you,

1390
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:27,600
ask you a few questions...
very informal.

1391
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:30,730
What, now? We're in kind of a hurry...
big family dinner.

1392
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:32,400
This won't take long,

1393
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:33,750
but it's dangerous
out on these main roads

1394
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,940
with this weather. Follow the car.

1395
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:38,540
Whoa whoa whoa.
We ain't got to do nothing for you.

1396
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:40,940
No, you don't, but I could always
get a search warrant,

1397
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:43,850
search the three of your houses tonight.
Really fuck your evenings up.

1398
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,770
You'll be on your way
in 15 minutes.

1399
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:50,310
- No, Office...
- Shut up, shithead. Lead the way.

1400
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,470
Sorry about this, lads.

1401
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:11,140
Thanks for the cooperation.

1402
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:12,810
Yeah, blah blah, fucking blah.

1403
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,200
What's so important
that you had to speak to us tonight?

1404
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,970
Trust me, you'll like this.

1405
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:18,850
Why'd you have to fucking bring us
all the way down here for?

1406
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:20,620
The traffic... it's dangerous.

1407
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:22,490
Oi. You on fucking drugs?

1408
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:24,990
You got any?

1409
01:33:44,470 --> 01:33:46,240
The way we saw it,

1410
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:48,950
the police had
stronger motives than anyone.

1411
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,450
The rumor was we were
all under observation,

1412
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:54,570
so how the fuck could a hit
go down right under their nose?

1413
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:58,430
It could have been revenge
for several high-profile Ecstasy deaths,

1414
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:00,610
or it could've been
they were just getting rid

1415
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:03,110
of three of the most dangerous
drug dealers from the southeast.

1416
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:05,820
Either way, it was
a paranoid first few days.

1417
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,740
for anyone who knew
the three was a suspect.

1418
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:11,860
Over the next few days,
silence fell on gangland

1419
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:13,630
as hundreds of people
were questioned.

1420
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:16,550
One theory was gaining
in credibility.

1421
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:19,360
Two names
just kept coming up.

1422
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,900
- Fucking hell.
- Put your hands on the fucking dash!

1423
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,570
Whoa!
What's this about?

1424
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:31,650
The brothers want
a word with you, Pat.

1425
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:33,530
- Tell your bloke to follow that car.
- I ain't going...

1426
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:36,340
Makes no difference
whether you drive or I drive.

1427
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:39,460
- Do you get the picture?
- It's a pretty gory picture at that.

1428
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:02,480
You boys have become
a fucking nuisance.

1429
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,670
We heard about your little fit down
at the pizza parlor, Pat.

1430
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:06,230
We spunked in our pants.

1431
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,310
Then we remembered how much
money you owe us.

1432
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:10,920
Listen. I'm trying to get
all your dough back now.

1433
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:12,480
Whatever problem you've got with Pat

1434
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:14,040
has got fuck-all to do with me.

1435
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:16,230
Fuck off, Tucker.
It's got everything to do with you.

1436
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:19,040
You're all involved.
All fucking out of control,

1437
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:20,810
ripping off every cunt
from here to Hounslow.

1438
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:23,420
Well, it stops tonight.
Shoot that cunt.

1439
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:25,920
Please don't shoot me.

1440
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:27,790
Come on,
take it like a man, son.

1441
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:29,770
Ain't that bad.
All be over in a moment.

1442
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:36,640
- Fuck you, you fucking cunt!
- You next, Tucker.

1443
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,770
But these were just paranoid theories

1444
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:41,750
being handed out left, right and center.

1445
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:44,250
The newspapers started
printing any old shit

1446
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:46,230
from small-time crooks
and wannabes.

1447
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:49,350
Apparently half of Essex was
an expert on the subject.

1448
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:51,640
And what's this then?

1449
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,020
- I have a lot of young lads...
- Six months later

1450
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:59,350
Darren Nicholls was nicked
with 10 kilos of puff in his boot.

1451
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:01,430
Before anyone
thought much about it,

1452
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:04,870
he was busy grassing to
the Old Bill about the triple murders.

1453
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:10,600
# Walk away, walk away #

1454
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:12,680
# Walk away now #

1455
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:17,060
# Walk away, walk away #

1456
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:21,220
# Walk away now... #

1457
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:26,010
Mickey Steel has
fucked up everything.

1458
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:28,620
I've spent years sweetening up
these fucking contacts.

1459
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,180
He's made me
look like a right mug

1460
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,160
and us look like we don't know
what we're doing.

1461
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:33,820
I've told everyone I know
what a fucking cunt he is.

1462
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:36,010
Okay, shut the fuck up.

1463
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:37,680
He's heading towards
our table right now.

1464
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:45,490
Tony, Pat, how's it going?

1465
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:48,610
So what have you got to tell us
that's so fucking important?

1466
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:51,320
I've got
something coming up...

1467
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,090
something big...
so big it's gonna make

1468
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,430
that last deal look like
pocket money by comparison.

1469
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:59,340
Yeah? I hope by that
you mean pocket money

1470
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,220
and not pocketing
our fucking money.

1471
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:06,320
- What's happening, chaps?
- Sit down, shut your mouth and listen.

1472
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:14,760
I've been hired
by this Dutch firm to do a job,

1473
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:18,720
a job that involves my plane
and a shitload of white.

1474
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:20,800
How much?

1475
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,650
I'm meant to be bringing
over 30 kilos of Columbian pure,

1476
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:26,840
land my plane
in a field near Rettendon.

1477
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,030
30 fucking kilos?

1478
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:31,730
- How much is that worth?
- It depends on the quality.

1479
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:35,380
It's the bollocks. They've already
paid me £50,000 up front.

1480
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:37,570
The drugs are
standing by in Holland.

1481
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:39,650
They're all set to go.
I'm meant to be bringing it over

1482
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:41,630
in the next few days
when the weather improves.

1483
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:44,860
- So what's the plan, mate?
- Do what you two do best...

1484
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:46,730
rob the cunts.

1485
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:50,070
I'll tell you where and when
I'll be landing the plane.

1486
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:51,630
There'll be two others
on board with me.

1487
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:53,710
You steam in really strong,

1488
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:55,380
stick guns in our faces...

1489
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:58,090
bish bash... pinch the gear.

1490
01:37:58,090 --> 01:37:59,650
Simple as that.
What do you reckon?

1491
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:01,420
Well, I won't kid you...
if that gear is proper,

1492
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:02,980
we've got to be talking
about £100 mill.

1493
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:06,310
- Exactly.
- So what do you want out of it?

1494
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:08,080
Bust it up three ways.

1495
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:10,690
A third? You're having
a fucking laugh, ain't you?

1496
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,670
That's fine.
That's a fair deal.

1497
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:17,040
# And did you think
that I'd stay #

1498
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:19,230
# In your destructive life? #

1499
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:22,870
# And did you think I'd be okay #

1500
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:25,580
# And someday be your wife? #

1501
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:29,640
# And if I'm here, I live in fear #

1502
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,940
# Why'd you go so far? #

1503
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:34,440
# You can see that it's me... #

1504
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:36,410
We'll have to make this
look convincing though.

1505
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,390
They can't know
you're in on it, Mickey.

1506
01:38:38,290 --> 01:38:41,210
We'll have to fuck you up a bit,
maybe knock a few teeth out.

1507
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:44,430
I can handle a couple
of broken teeth for 10 kilos.

1508
01:38:44,430 --> 01:38:46,410
This is the big time, Carl.

1509
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:49,120
We're talking numbers
with shitloads of zeros on the end.

1510
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:50,890
You're talking like
it's already in the bag.

1511
01:38:50,890 --> 01:38:52,870
Mickey's assured us
it's all going ahead.

1512
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:55,580
- He's already been paid.
- Yeah, he's been paid, you ain't.

1513
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:58,700
- Trust me, it's on.
- Just be careful, will you?

1514
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:02,240
Pat's running around the whole
of fucking Essex shouting his mouth off

1515
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:04,120
and if this gets back
to you, you're fucked.

1516
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:06,410
Relax, mate.

1517
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:09,640
You worry too much.
It's all good.

1518
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:12,560
I want to tell you something.

1519
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:14,530
I'm surrounded
by a lot of people,

1520
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:16,410
but I know they
just want a piece of me.

1521
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:19,430
With you it's different.

1522
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:21,510
You just want to be my friend.

1523
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:25,050
You know,
you're the only one I fully trust.

1524
01:39:25,050 --> 01:39:28,390
- Same.
- I want to do something for you.

1525
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:31,200
I'm gonna give you
£30,000 out of this.

1526
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,280
Don't be silly.
You don't owe me nothing.

1527
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:36,200
I know, mate. I also know you'd do
the same for me if you had a deal

1528
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:39,110
- like this going down.
- Yeah, of course. You know that.

1529
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:40,990
I'm gonna give you money
for two reasons, Carlton.

1530
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:43,910
Firstly, you're broke.

1531
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,030
All right.
What's the other reason?

1532
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:49,630
You never asked me
for a fucking thing.

1533
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,990
Things are gonna quiet down
a lot in the new year.

1534
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:58,070
When this deal goes down,

1535
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:59,530
I'm going into semiretirement.

1536
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:02,340
Do you know what?

1537
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:05,360
That's not such a bad idea.

1538
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,470
I'm gonna slip off, all right?

1539
01:40:10,470 --> 01:40:13,800
I promised Denny I'd have
a family dinner tonight.

1540
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,990
- Sounds good, mate.
- Yeah.

1541
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,070
Yeah, I just fancy
a quiet one for a change.

1542
01:40:20,570 --> 01:40:23,480
- And thanks.
- No worries, mate.

1543
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:27,650
- All right.
- Love you. See you, mate.

1544
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:44,320
- Hello?
- Hey, Darren.

1545
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,400
What are you
up to this evening?

1546
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:49,420
- Why? What's up?
- Me and Jack need a favor.

1547
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:53,060
Tony, it's Pat. I just got
off the phone with our pal Mickey.

1548
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:56,080
- Are we on for it?
- No, too much snow on the ground,

1549
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:58,060
but he reckons we're on
for the day after tomorrow.

1550
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:00,560
- I can't fucking wait.
- Tone, listen up.

1551
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,690
Mickey wants to show us exactly
where he wants to land his plane.

1552
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:06,400
So are you and Rolfe up
for a little meet later?

1553
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:11,290
It's cold, isn't it?

1554
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:13,690
You should've put a coat on then.

1555
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:15,770
Well, I didn't realize the plan was

1556
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:18,370
to sit in the motor
and freeze to death.

1557
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:21,600
The plan is we wait
for Pat to turn up,

1558
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:24,210
then we drive to where Mickey is
landing the plane.

1559
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:29,000
Tell me why again.

1560
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,710
Mickey wants you there
in the background,

1561
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:34,000
just to make sure
everything's all right.

1562
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:36,290
Pat's been unpredictable lately,

1563
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:39,100
in case you haven't
fucking noticed.

1564
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,410
Listen. I've been doing
a lot of thinking about all this.

1565
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:48,060
Why don't we nick all the gear
and do Mickey with the others?

1566
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,830
I thought he was your pal.

1567
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:52,120
That was before
he fucked us over, monkey boy.

1568
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:55,450
I got no loyalty
to that cunt no more.

1569
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:58,060
He's the only one
who can link us to this robbery.

1570
01:41:58,060 --> 01:41:59,930
I'm game.

1571
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:20,140
Okay, let's go.

1572
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:38,160
Right. Drive down
the road about half a mile.

1573
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:40,340
You sit tight
and wait for my call.

1574
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:43,570
- Where's your phone?
- It's in me pocket.

1575
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:45,860
You won't hear the fucking thing
ring in there, will you?

1576
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:47,630
Put it on the dashboard.

1577
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:58,570
I ain't gotta ask you
if that thing is turned on, have I?

1578
01:42:58,470 --> 01:43:00,760
Of course it's turned on.
What do you think I am?

1579
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,740
Are you sure?

1580
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:11,070
I thought it was on.

1581
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:13,150
Darren,
I'm fucking speechless.

1582
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:15,440
I don't know why
Mickey puts up with you.

1583
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:18,260
You're a useless cunt.

1584
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:20,650
- Fat cunt.
- What?

1585
01:43:20,550 --> 01:43:23,570
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1586
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:26,170
And don't go playing
that fucking radio either.

1587
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:28,570
It's vital you hear that phone ring.

1588
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:31,800
Can I stick the tape on?

1589
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:35,340
Tape deck, radio...
what is the difference?

1590
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:37,840
What's the long-range
forecast looking like, mate?

1591
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:41,170
Well, the weather seems
to be improving at last,

1592
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,980
so I reckon we'll be up for it
in the next couple of days.

1593
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:46,480
- 48 hours.
- Uh-huh.

1594
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,540
48 fucking hours
and then our lives are changing!

1595
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,670
Craig, you're gonna have
to chuck a left up here, all right?

1596
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:58,040
Mick... I've got to say it, son...
I fucking love you.

1597
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,600
No, I swear,
I fucking love you.

1598
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,400
You know, that's not what
I've been hearing around town, Patrick.

1599
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,900
Well, forget all that
fucking bollocks now,

1600
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,040
'cause we're going
to hit the big time.

1601
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:09,920
We are gonna be fucking caked.

1602
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,640
Left up here, is it, Mick?

1603
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,310
Yeah, that's right, Craig... a left.

1604
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,350
Hello?

1605
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,270
Hello, babe.

1606
01:44:38,350 --> 01:44:40,640
No. Of course I miss you.

1607
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:45,740
You are such a lovely girl
and I don't deserve you.

1608
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:47,930
You know that. Do me a favor,

1609
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:49,700
give me a bell back later.
I'm with some people.

1610
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:52,310
What?

1611
01:44:53,660 --> 01:44:55,640
No, I'm just with Tony
and the boys.

1612
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:57,720
Yeah.

1613
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,700
Listen. Of course I do.

1614
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:03,450
I love you.
Is that good enough?

1615
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:04,800
I love you.

1616
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:06,580
Call me later. Bye.

1617
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,410
There's a gate up ahead, Mick.

1618
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:14,070
Do you want me to open it?

1619
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:16,890
No, it's okay, son.
I'll get it.

1620
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:39,070
- Shut up, Pat.
- No, please!

1621
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:43,650
Mickey! Please, no!

1622
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:53,440
Mate... please, mate.

1623
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,220
Please, we're mates.

1624
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:58,860
We've worked far too hard to let
a cunt like you fuck everything up.

1625
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:01,570
You take it. Take it all.

1626
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:05,730
What? The 30 kilos
of Columbian pure?

1627
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:07,820
You soppy cunt.

1628
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,420
You soppy, greedy,
gullible cunt.

1629
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:15,840
I'm out, Jack.

1630
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,350
- Yup?
- Come and get us.

1631
01:46:56,350 --> 01:46:58,960
That didn't take long.

1632
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:16,560
Pat squealed like a pig.

1633
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,640
Let's fuck off.

1634
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:41,240
Where's Mick?

1635
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:42,810
He's coming.

1636
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:58,530
Turn that fucking light out now.

1637
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,370
All right, Darren.
Let's go.

1638
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:13,530
This was Darren Nicholl's
testimony of what happened.

1639
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:16,860
The only people
who really know are in the ground.

1640
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:19,680
It may be that
the shooting has occurred

1641
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:23,220
over higher drug dealers

1642
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:26,030
trying to find
a greater position of power.

1643
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:51,240
Daddy!

1644
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:56,760
# Heaven knows
what life may bring #

1645
01:48:58,210 --> 01:49:02,590
# There could be blue skies
through the rain #

1646
01:49:03,730 --> 01:49:08,320
# And I know
I must find my way... #

1647
01:49:08,110 --> 01:49:10,400
- Don't listen to him, baby.
- # Come on, help me #

1648
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:13,520
# Release my soul today #

1649
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:19,040
# Won't you help me,
help me through this pain? #

1650
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:21,650
# It cuts like a knife #

1651
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:24,460
# Burns like acid rain #

1652
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,230
# Come on, help me #

1653
01:49:26,230 --> 01:49:29,880
# Help me release
my soul #

1654
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:33,210
# But nobody knows
which way #

1655
01:49:33,210 --> 01:49:35,500
# Or which road to go #

1656
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:40,290
# Heaven knows
what life may bring #

1657
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:44,980
# Never feel it
till you feel the acid sting #

1658
01:49:46,130 --> 01:49:50,600
# Help me to release
my soul today #

1659
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:54,040
# Help me, help me #

1660
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,850
# Help me, Lord, Lord #

1661
01:49:59,350 --> 01:50:01,850
# Help me, Lord, Lord... #

1662
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:08,620
There's not a lot
of old men in my game.

1663
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:11,230
Paranoia is
what keeps me alive.

1664
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:13,310
I'm taking no chances.

1665
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:15,600
Every room
in my house is armed.

1666
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:19,770
You break in and I'll bathe
in your fucking blood.

1667
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:21,750
And if one day my time is up

1668
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:23,310
let me say to you:

1669
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:25,600
If you think
I'm just gonna sit

1670
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:28,000
and beg for my life...

1671
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,700
well, then you're some sort of cunt.
