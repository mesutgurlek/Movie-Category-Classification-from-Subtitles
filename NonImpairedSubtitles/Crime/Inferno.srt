"Inferno (2016)" ^ (Run time 01:54:36)

2
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:06,618
It took the earth's population
a hundred thousand years

3
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:08,626
to reach a billion people.

4
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:11,776
And then just, a hundred more
to reach 2 billion.

5
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:14,038
And only 50 years
to double again...

6
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:16,837
double again
to four billion in 1970.

7
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:19,756
We're nearly at eight billion now.
... 8 billion now.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,980
We are destroying the very means
where there is life is insane.

9
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,894
Every single global ill that plagues the Earth
can be traced back...

10
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:29,668
traced back to human overpopulation...
human overpopulation.

11
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:31,376
What didn't we demand any action?

12
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:36,269
Declared cut,
consumed or destroyed.

13
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:40,349
Half the animal species
on earth have vanished

14
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:43,685
vanished for the last 40 years...
40 years.

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,193
... we keep attacking 
our own environment!

16
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:50,399
it doesn't take a catastrophe
to get our attention.

17
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,915
Nothing changes behaviour like pain.

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,620
Maybe pain can save us.

19
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:03,802
There is a switch,

20
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:07,249
if you throw it,

21
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:11,045
half the people on earth will die.

22
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:18,012
But if you don't, the human race
will be extinct in a hundred years.

23
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,637
What would you do?

24
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:29,233
Mankind is the cancer
in its own body.

25
00:01:30,618 --> 00:01:33,736
Do you love humanity
enough to save it?

26
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:37,733
In case, they find me,

27
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,914
I left you a path.

28
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,550
The hardest one yet.

29
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:46,717
Inferno will be at the end

30
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:50,327
You are my contingency plan.

31
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:53,814
You are humanity's final hope.

32
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:57,966
Make sure Inferno is unleashed.

33
00:01:58,316 --> 00:02:00,236
Seek and find.

34
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:13,582
Badia Fiorentina.

35
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,489
A long road.

36
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:30,670
but here we are.

37
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:36,570
Better me,
than the Americans.

38
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,728
You're going to want to
tell me where it is.

39
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:46,203
Yes, Mr. Bouchard.

40
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,312
I know I will.

41
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,393
Tell them,

42
00:02:56,418 --> 00:03:01,812
"Humanity is the disease,
Inferno is the cure."

43
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,136
Okay.

44
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,933
Traitor!

45
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,592
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

46
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,929
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

47
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:50,857
Pay for your sins.

48
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:54,704
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

49
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:42,784
Mr. Langdon, I'm Dr. Brooks.

50
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:46,288
I'm going to do a few checks,
nothing to worry about.

51
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:49,095
Let's get rid of this, shall we?

52
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:59,031
Do you know what day
of the week it is?

53
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:01,380
Saturday.

54
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:05,294
It's Monday,
28th of June.

55
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,940
Monday, 28th of June.

56
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,911
Do you know where we are?

57
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:12,482
Boston.

58
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:16,235
Massachusetts General.

59
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:21,336
And what's the last thing
you can remember?

60
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,978
I uh...
I was on campus.

61
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:33,301
Everything is blur.
It's out of focus.

62
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,654
Was I in some kind
of an accident?

63
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:40,699
We'll get to that.

64
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,515
Is there someone
we should call for you?

65
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:44,706
No.

66
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:47,349
Your Wife?
Family?

67
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:50,452
No. No.
I'm not married.

68
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:54,661
Professor Langdon, you're suffering
from a head trauma.

69
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:57,665
You appeared to have
a mild retrograde amnesia

70
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:00,935
We've done a CT scan,
there's no evidence of intracranial bleeding.

71
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,702
Which is very reassuring.
Non-terminal.

72
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,973
Just try to relax.

73
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:09,378
Neurologically, you seem to be fine.

74
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,054
Your memory will return
over the next several days.

75
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,185
So we'll...
we'll wait and watch.

76
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,015
Could you turn off the lights please.

77
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:20,774
Of course.

78
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:23,623
If the head trauma was bad enough
to cause a cerebral contusion, then...

79
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:26,701
Can you please-
Can you please turn off the lights?

80
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,381
What am I...
doing... in Florence? (Italy)

81
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:39,897
That's Il Duomo.
That's the Palazzo Vecchio, isn't it?

82
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,129
Yes.

83
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:44,691
How...
How did I get here?

84
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:48,485
You came to our emergency room
3 hours ago with a head wound.

85
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:56,982
Was I...
Was I with a woman?

86
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:59,278
No, a cab driver brought you in.

87
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:03,554
No wallet. No phone.
No ID.

88
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:06,359
How do you know my name?

89
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,346
We've met.

90
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,576
I saw you at the Church in
Imperial College London, we spoke afterward,

91
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,419
you were very nice to me.

92
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:17,983
We've met.

93
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,636
Sorry, that's not quite fair.

94
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:22,391
I was nine at that time.

95
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,942
Wait.
Nine-nine years old?

96
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:27,081
I was crazy about puzzles.

97
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,307
And I like your books.

98
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:35,221
Maybe not "Lost language of Ideograms",
but the others.

99
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:36,781
Okay.

100
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:38,591
I read them all.

101
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,138
A weird kid.

102
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,468
I was actually.

103
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,296
Did I say that out loud?

104
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:48,867
You did.

105
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:50,630
Very sorry.

106
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:04,849
Professor Langdon, your headaches
are going to be intense initially.

107
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:08,822
And you can also expect
nausea, confusion and dizziness.

108
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,573
That was the front desk.

109
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:27,342
The police are here to see you.

110
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:28,998
Me, why?

111
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:32,515
Before you talk to them, Professor Langdon,
you should know the facts of your case.

112
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,291
Your head wound was not
caused by an accident.

113
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:36,313
It was the result of a gunshot.

114
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:39,276
A bullet grazed the top of your skull
and you most likely took a bad fall

115
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:40,968
which is what caused the concussion.

116
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:43,571
If the bullet had been
an inch to the side,

117
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:46,265
it could have killed you.

118
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:40,240
This way.
This way, come on.

119
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,578
Taxi.

120
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,001
Get in.

121
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,176
This is going to hurt.

122
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,107
It's okay.
It's okay.

123
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:00,746
Seek and find.

124
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,926
This is my apartment.

125
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:54,055
You're still in Florence.

126
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:59,386
I'm going to call the police.

127
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,273
Wait.
That policewoman just tried to kill us.

128
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:03,288
Okay.

129
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:05,607
We will call the U.S. Consulate
instead if you like.

130
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:09,578
Just... wait.
Just give me... give me a minute.

131
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:14,031
Why was someone shooting at you?

132
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:15,371
I don't know.

133
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:17,242
Also, when you came into ER,

134
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,928
you were mumbling
something over and over.

135
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:25,375
Very sorr...
Very sorry.

136
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,372
Very sorry.

137
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,220
Do you have any idea
why you would be saying this?

138
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,842
- No.
- Why was someone shooting at you?

139
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:43,210
You can keep asking me
these questions, lady.

140
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:44,744
But I'm not going to
know these answers!

141
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,541
My name is Sienna.

142
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,112
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:54,722
Hello.

144
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:57,087
Hi.

145
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,130
You asked a lot of questions.

146
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:01,352
Yeah, I'm feeling a tad
vulnerable right now.

147
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:04,448
I'm with someone
other people want to shoot at!

148
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:06,278
I'm sorry.

149
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:10,147
Questions are important.

150
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:12,055
And I hope you recover.

151
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:17,575
May I ask you for a...
cup of a...

152
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,763
What?
It's brown and it's... hot.

153
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:29,453
People drink it in the morning
for energy. Uh...

154
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:30,122
Tea.

155
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,063
Tea.
No. The other one.

156
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:33,976
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

157
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:36,508
Could I have a cup of coffee?

158
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:38,913
Sure.

159
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,779
Thank you.

160
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:48,774
You are very organized.

161
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:51,367
I like things tidy.

162
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,676
Thank you for helping me
in the hospital.

163
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,776
That was very courageous.

164
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:59,922
It's just reflexes.

165
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:28,314
I feel I'm having visions.

166
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,216
It's the head trauma.

167
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,657
You won't be able to trust
your own thoughts for a while.

168
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,241
I saw a plague mask.

169
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:42,725
It's the kind the medieval doctors
wore in... during the Black death.

170
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,910
You said something about that.

171
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:48,641
You were talking in the cab
but mostly incoherent

172
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,161
But I did hear the word mask.

173
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,550
Anything else?

174
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:58,144
The bodies,
the blood and fire and...

175
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,756
... hell.

176
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,228
And there's a woman.

177
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:08,997
The woman, she seemed...

178
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:11,246
Seek and find.

179
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:13,958
Uh.
Well, seemed so dangerous.

180
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,697
No, you got to have somebody
we should call.

181
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:20,486
I do?
Why?

182
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:25,837
My wat...
Was I wearing

183
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,002
my watch when I was
brought to the hospital?

184
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,444
No.

185
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:37,094
You weren't wearing a watch.

186
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:40,873
It's important to me.
It was a gift from my parents.

187
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,430
Look, you should
go ahead and clean up.

188
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:47,897
Your clothes are covered in blood but
I think I got something that might fit you.

189
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:51,288
Once you get dressed,
we'll call the police, okay?

190
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:54,815
No. No.
The Consulate.

191
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:58,725
Right.
The Consulate.

192
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:06,822
Coffee.

193
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,999
Ignazio Busoni : I PRAY YOU ARE ALL RIGHT

194
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,685
Ignazio?

195
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:02,145
I'm sorry I couldn't meet as planned.

196
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,424
Now they're after me too.

197
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,891
What we stole

198
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:12,383
... is safely hidden, as am I.

199
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:14,724
"What we stole"?

200
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:18,460
Paradise Twenty-five.

201
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:26,104
Ignazio.

202
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:45,950
I've left your things
in the bathroom.

203
00:17:46,463 --> 00:17:48,163
Try these.

204
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,192
Whose are they?

205
00:17:50,511 --> 00:17:51,892
A friend.

206
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,677
Does he live here?

207
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:54,839
Sometimes.

208
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,317
Oh.
Sometimes, huh.

209
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:59,102
You're being rude.

210
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:00,424
I'm sorry.

211
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,588
I'm sorry, I'm not like this.

212
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:04,502
You kind of are.

213
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:56,211
I found this in my old jacket.

214
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,146
It's a biotube.

215
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,414
They're used for transporting
dangerous substances.

216
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,005
What are you doing with it?

217
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,862
I have no idea.

218
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,309
It's a high end unit.

219
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,473
Government issue.

220
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:15,987
It's called thumbprint recognition.
Security in case it's lost or stolen.

221
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:20,664
Tubes like this can only be opened
by a specified individual.

222
00:19:21,581 --> 00:19:22,808
Well, it sure hell isn't me.

223
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,142
- Then why do you have it?
- I don't know.

224
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,318
I'm getting the number
for the Consulate.

225
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:29,238
No, please.
Wait.

226
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:32,499
I have waited.
This isn't right.

227
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:34,078
Why do you have it?
Where did you get it?

228
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:35,495
Look, there is a simple way

229
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,509
to find out if this thing
belongs to me.

230
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,216
Then my thumb will open it
or it won't.

231
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,779
Open it, are you insane?

232
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,279
If it's a viral agent,
will it be released if I opened it?

233
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,798
No.

234
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:50,834
No, there'll be an inner seal
maybe even two.

235
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:55,101
Before I put myself in anyone's hands
I want to know what this thing is.

236
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:58,442
Uh, and what I'm involved with.

237
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,056
That make sense, doesn't it?

238
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:02,955
Yes.

239
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:06,063
So, we agree.

240
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:08,555
We're opening it.

241
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:31,867
Well, that explains
that it is mine.

242
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:37,163
This is a cylinder seal
made of ivory.

243
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:38,629
No.

244
00:20:40,392 --> 00:20:42,171
It's bone.

245
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,014
Human.

246
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:49,312
Three-headed, man eating Satan.

247
00:20:49,337 --> 00:20:52,088
A common image from the Middle Ages

248
00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:54,999
associated with the Black Plague.

249
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:57,279
The 3 gnashing mouths
are symbolic of

250
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:59,974
how effectively the plague ate
through the population.

251
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,806
Yet you can't remember
the word for coffee.

252
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:07,093
It explains my visions,
sort of.

253
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:12,357
- Do you hear that?
- Mm-mm.

254
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:15,096
This could be a Faraday pointer.

255
00:21:21,786 --> 00:21:24,600
So why-why this, huh?

256
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:40,300
It's Botticelli.

257
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:42,269
It's his map of hell.

258
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:46,007
He painted it as an
illustration of Dante's Inferno.

259
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:49,207
I studied Dante
when I was younger.

260
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,085
Probably in kindergarden.

261
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,537
I was a bit obsessed.

262
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,613
Dante defined our modern conception of hell.

263
00:21:56,638 --> 00:22:00,832
Our vision of it hasn't changed
since he defined it 700 years ago.

264
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:06,564
Botticelli drew it but...
Dante created hell as we know it.

265
00:22:06,907 --> 00:22:09,420
This is what I have been seeing.

266
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:11,761
Torment.

267
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:13,700
Sinners.

268
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:15,822
Branding the mongers.

269
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:18,982
Liars, covered with rashes.

270
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:21,970
Soothsayers with their heads
turned backwards.

271
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:25,291
- Serpents.
- The punishment for thievery.

272
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:28,930
Suffer, you sinners.
Pay for your sins.

273
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:31,655
So you have no idea
why you have this?

274
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,161
I think maybe
we call the consulate now.

275
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:37,574
Right.

276
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,126
Professor Langdon?

277
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:45,213
Hello, yes.
Speaking.

278
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,599
Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.

279
00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:50,752
You have?

280
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:52,812
Are you still in possession?

281
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:57,420
Mr. Langdon, do you have the tube?

282
00:22:57,604 --> 00:23:00,437
- Yes.
- Where are you located?

283
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:04,346
Professor, we can't help you
if we can't find you.

284
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,847
If that's the consulate,
how do they know?

285
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:08,602
Because they know.

286
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:13,485
What do we do?

287
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,093
Tell them you're over there.

288
00:23:25,176 --> 00:23:27,152
- Hello.
- Professor, we were cut off.

289
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:28,952
Yes, sorry.

290
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,155
Where are you located?

291
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,893
I'm at a hotel,
Pensione la Fiorentina.

292
00:23:34,918 --> 00:23:37,516
Stay in your room.
We're sending someone now.

293
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,036
I'll wait here,
room 39.

294
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,369
Okay.
We wait and see who they send.

295
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:56,629
Langdon accessed his email account from
an unmasked IP address here in Florence

296
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:58,635
- When?
- 7 minutes ago.

297
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,666
Via Dolorosa, number 12,
apartment 3C.

298
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,432
Via Dolorosa, how long?

299
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:04,379
12 minutes.

300
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:06,988
Go! I want that pointer back
and I want Langdon.

301
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,634
Aapartment 3C, let's get him.

302
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:10,569
Go, go, go, go, now!

303
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:19,892
Look at this.
This is odd.

304
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,706
This area here is
Dante's 8th level of hell.

305
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:25,636
It's called the Malebolge,
means evil ditches.

306
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:27,310
There's ten.

307
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:33,133
This letter "R" here,
is not in the original painting.

308
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:34,961
It's been added.

309
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,216
There's another one.

310
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:39,386
- Where?
- An "E".

311
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,058
On seducers whipped by demons.

312
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:43,535
- There's a "C" on the cheek of a...
- A grafter.

313
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:46,224
- ... a grafter.
- A conman trapped in a pool of boiling tar.

314
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:49,016
- A "V", "R".
- Ah, there.

315
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,701
- T.
- There, there, A.

316
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:53,673
What is that.

317
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:56,094
That's text.
Is that a name?

318
00:24:56,632 --> 00:25:05,473
THE TRUTH CAN BE GLIMPSED ONLY
THROUGH THE EYES OF DEATH.

319
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,841
ZOBRIST.

320
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,661
Bertrand Zobrist.

321
00:25:14,686 --> 00:25:18,162
- American billionaire, that must be nice.
- Hm.

322
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:19,985
Bioengineer

323
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,104
Notorious for radical views.

324
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:24,666
Here he is.

325
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:31,176
It took the earth's population
a hundred thousand years

326
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:33,100
to reach a billion people.

327
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:37,788
And then just a hundred more
to reach two billion.

328
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:44,241
And only fifty years to double again
to four billion people in 1970.

329
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:49,345
We're nearly at eight billion now.

330
00:25:49,473 --> 00:25:53,838
Using the example of a beaker.

331
00:25:53,863 --> 00:25:55,389
With a single bacterium.

332
00:25:55,414 --> 00:25:58,745
One that divides
and doubles every minute.

333
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,480
If you placed the first bacterium
into the beaker at 11 o'clock.

334
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:05,837
and it's completely full by 12.

335
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:10,078
At what time is the beaker
still only half full?

336
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:12,810
11:59.

337
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:16,786
That's what time it is for us.

338
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:23,980
In 40 years,
32 billion people... will fight to survive.

339
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,755
No fail.

340
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:31,244
We're a minute to midnight.

341
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:37,369
Every single global ill that plagues the Earth
can be traced back to human overpopulation.

342
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:41,528
But serious birth control measures
they don't stand a chance.

343
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,928
Outrageous!
Violation of my rights!

344
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:49,318
Invasion of my privacy!
Don't tell me what to do!

345
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:53,508
But still we keep attacking
our own environment!

346
00:26:53,533 --> 00:27:00,038
They have been 5 major extinctions
in the earth's history.

347
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,441
Unless we take bold immediate action

348
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:11,045
the sixth extinction
will be our own.

349
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:15,980
We're a minute to midnight.

350
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:19,032
Looks like he's got
a lot of followers.

351
00:27:19,057 --> 00:27:21,792
Yeah, from all over the world.

352
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:26,650
He is compelling.

353
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:31,255
The 2 year disappearance during which
some authorities feared Zobrist

354
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,463
may have designed
an opportunistic viral pathogen.

355
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:37,891
He created a plague.

356
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,441
But, why Dante?

357
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,016
Why this map of hell?

358
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,007
Is this supposed to be a puzzle
or a challenge?

359
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,243
Or a suicide note.

360
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:52,525
He killed himself 3 days ago.

361
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:02,328
The levels.

362
00:28:03,947 --> 00:28:07,149
The levels are out of order,
that's what's been bothering me.

363
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:10,376
This circles of hell
had been rearranged.

364
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:12,933
It's the same woman
from the hospital.

365
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:16,374
We can't stay here.
We certainly can't trust the Consulate.

366
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,486
The letter are encrypted as committers,
that's not right.

367
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:20,953
If the plague exist, do you know
how many governments would want it?

368
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:22,651
Clerical profiteers, not there.

369
00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:24,789
- What they would do to get it.
- Someone who discord dead, no.

370
00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:26,851
A biological weapon.

371
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:28,925
The letters.

372
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:35,132
He has assigned a letter to each sin
and then changed their order.

373
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:37,019
He's made an anagram.

374
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:41,423
Yes.
Anagram.

375
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,213
Let's go.
I know another way out.

376
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,541
If you have phoned,
best leave it here.

377
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:58,846
They might track it.

378
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:02,555
The phone?
I'm not even wearing my own clothes.

379
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,353
Good.
Let's go.

380
00:29:10,044 --> 00:29:12,578
(What the hell are THEY doing here?!)

381
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:17,925
Robert Langdon!
World Health Organization! (WHO)

382
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:24,284
V, R, O.

383
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,769
I got to rearrange these letters,
CATROVACER.

384
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:29,833
COVER
CAT

385
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:32,787
God.
I used to be good at this.

386
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,973
Cerca trova.

387
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:42,894
It's a ten.
It means "seek" and "find".

388
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,189
Cerca trova.
Yes!

389
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,034
I know why
I am in Florence.

390
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:57,806
World Health Organization has landed, standby.

391
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:04,016
He's arrived.

392
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:07,604
Agent Bouchard, we and the
first officers are already here.

393
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,929
Bring me up to speed.

394
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:16,795
Bouchard is up there now.

395
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:44,600
- Where are we going?
 - The Palazzo Vecchio, near the Boboli Gardens.

396
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,221
There's no sign of him.

397
00:31:00,246 --> 00:31:02,774
Bouchard says Langdon is gone
and so is the pointer.

398
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,159
Well, I need better.

399
00:31:04,184 --> 00:31:07,249
I need better from you,
from you, from all of us.

400
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,789
Better!

401
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:12,978
Work faster. Work smarter.
Don't trust anyone.

402
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:15,358
Let's do that.

403
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:18,145
- Let's go.
- Yes.

404
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:42,680
- Identification.
- Vayentha.

405
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:45,860
- Go ahead.
- I need to speak to the provost.

406
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:47,348
Hold on.

407
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:50,742
The Mendacium.

408
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:59,766
So, the WHO beat you to
Mr. Langdon, Vayentha.

409
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:01,336
The provost isn't going to like that.

410
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,898
I know.
He's going to want to live with it.

411
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,513
Tell him this isn't Berlin.

412
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:07,770
He tries anything
and I will find him.

413
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:10,930
Try to reacquire and
make contact in 60 minutes.

414
00:32:10,955 --> 00:32:13,285
Did you hear me?
I am not disposable.

415
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:18,285
Vayentha, get the Faraday pointer
before the government does.

416
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:19,838
Shit.

417
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:44,394
- Mr. Sims.
- Mm.

418
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:46,614
There's been a deviation.

419
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,973
Sorry to hear that.

420
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:50,152
- What operation?
- Florence.

421
00:32:50,184 --> 00:32:53,324
Our new players seemed
to have gone off script.

422
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:56,256
How unprofessional.

423
00:32:56,281 --> 00:33:01,275
And now the WHO has
overtaken our position.

424
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:08,740
Tell Vayentha,
if she values her position

425
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:10,544
she will remove Langdon.

426
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:12,695
Body not found.

427
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,257
Or better yet,
a mugging gone awry.

428
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:18,981
A blade, I think.
Cash gone, wallet remains.

429
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:23,577
Let's have a quick identification
and move on. Move on, move on.

430
00:33:25,135 --> 00:33:28,508
Professor Langdon is
out of frame.

431
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:37,202
- And in possession of the tube?
- Yes.

432
00:33:37,227 --> 00:33:39,695
He has the Faraday pointer.

433
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:46,200
He was such a good frame.

434
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,641
- What is Vayentha's condition?
- Intact but anxious.

435
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:51,253
She should be.

436
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:58,849
What in god's name
has this client gotten us into?

437
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:02,600
No, no, no.
This is uh... rhetorical.

438
00:34:04,815 --> 00:34:07,251
When are we due to release
the client's video?

439
00:34:08,022 --> 00:34:09,346
It just arrived.

440
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,723
His instructions were to
upload it in 24 hours.

441
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:13,186
I want to look at it now.

442
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:14,817
But, the client, Mr. Zobrist.

443
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:18,165
The client, client, is dead.
I want to see the video.

444
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,662
That's a violation of our protocols.

445
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:29,150
We're not the government.
We get things done.

446
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:31,020
Mr. Arbogast.

447
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:35,800
Chief among the attributes that makes us
so very good at our job

448
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:39,525
is that as far as the world
is concerned, we don't exist.

449
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,304
If this video implicates or
even mentions us in anyway,

450
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,018
I want to stop it's release.
For the benefit of all our clients.

451
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,836
You asked me to avoid abnormalities
in procedure, that's all.

452
00:34:49,861 --> 00:34:54,118
What about Mr. Zobrist
has ever remotely resembled normal.

453
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:56,963
- Well, I...
- Also rhetorical.

454
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:58,759
Bring me the video.

455
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:04,266
In the Vecchio's Hall of the
Five Hundred is a famous mural,

456
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,763
Giorgio Vasari's Battle of Marciano.

457
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:09,702
Near the top of the mural
is a coded message

458
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:11,520
which is one the art world's
most famous puzzles.

459
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:12,919
And what's the message?

460
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,632
Cerca trova.

461
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:17,157
Seek and find.

462
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,291
At the hospital,
I kept saying I was sorry.

463
00:35:19,316 --> 00:35:20,715
Very sorry, over and over.

464
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,283
Well, maybe that's not
what I meant.

465
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:24,993
The name of the artist, Vasari.
I could have been saying Vasari.

466
00:35:25,018 --> 00:35:28,130
That's good.
You seem clearer.

467
00:35:28,155 --> 00:35:30,730
- I am.
- What's your middle name?

468
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:33,693
Well, I am.

469
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:35,535
Mm-hm.

470
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:38,695
Zobrist is dead
but if his plague is real...

471
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,650
And this map is a trail
he has left so someone can find it.

472
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,159
Who?

473
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:48,098
Well, someone who believes
the same as he does.

474
00:35:48,123 --> 00:35:49,475
And that's why you have it.

475
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,123
Well, I don't remember
ever meeting Zobrist.

476
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,167
There's a lot you don't remember.

477
00:35:53,488 --> 00:35:56,769
Maybe they-
Maybe they came to you.

478
00:35:57,675 --> 00:35:59,291
Wanted your help with the part.

479
00:35:59,316 --> 00:36:01,284
- Because I lectured on Dante?
- Exactly.

480
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:05,554
They showed you this Faraday pointer,
tried to convince you of their cause.

481
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,131
- Mass murder?
- You said you found him compelling.

482
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:09,862
His argument.

483
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,655
Not his plan!
Zobrist is a psychopath.

484
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,199
Well, maybe they tricked you.

485
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:17,821
Sent...
someone you knew.

486
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:21,036
It's a minute to midnight.

487
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:30,496
- Is that for us?
- And what would you suggest?

488
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:46,338
Damn it!

489
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:50,145
Here, come on.
Follow me.

490
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,935
We could get there
through the park.

491
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:03,988
Okay, the-
the Palazzo Vecchio is this way.

492
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:12,506
We just flagged the car charged to
her credit card within the past hour.

493
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:28,641
There's a small gray door
to the mural.

494
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:30,746
It will take us into
the Vasari corridor.

495
00:38:30,771 --> 00:38:34,731
Right across the Ponte Vecchio,
into the Palazzo.

496
00:38:34,756 --> 00:38:36,379
That's the door, see.

497
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:37,640
Now!

498
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:55,928
Is the back secured.

499
00:38:55,953 --> 00:38:57,760
On all sides.

500
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:05,203
The Professor has become a liability, Vayentha.

501
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:09,783
The provost has issued a kill order.
Eliminate Langdon.

502
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:14,261
Fail, and you will be held accountable.
Am I making myself clear?

503
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:16,167
Copy that, sir.

504
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:35,037
There.

505
00:39:35,077 --> 00:39:38,977
That's the Vasari fresco,
The Battle of Marciano.

506
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:21,033
There. There.
Look. Look, look, look.

507
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:24,766
Okay, see the 2 farmhouses,
dead center up high,

508
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,744
come down to it's 4 o'clock.

509
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,189
It's a small green flag.

510
00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:31,407
- Cerca trova.
- Yeah.

511
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,037
Seek and find.

512
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:35,552
Seek and find.

513
00:40:35,577 --> 00:40:38,055
We sought it and
we found it.

514
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,961
So, now what?

515
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:42,442
The words Zobrist
added to the painting.

516
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:46,285
The truth can be glimpsed
only through the eyes of death.

517
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,261
Eyes of death.

518
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:52,361
Whose's eyes?

519
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:33,446
Was I given an injection?

520
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:34,340
When?

521
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:36,993
- At the hospital, with a hypertenol?
- No.

522
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:40,642
No, you were intubated.
Anything you got came through the IV.

523
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:43,934
Not at the hospital.

524
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:47,601
I was fully dress like this
at the back of some car...

525
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:49,882
at some point
in the last 2 days.

526
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,295
And something was injected
into my bloodstream.

527
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,211
and now I'm showing
signs of an illness

528
00:41:57,811 --> 00:41:59,299
What if?

529
00:42:00,864 --> 00:42:02,501
What if what?

530
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,950
Sienna, what if I'm the carrier?

531
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,988
No.

532
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,649
If you've got it
then I've got it too.

533
00:42:13,674 --> 00:42:17,423
And everyone we've come into
contact with has it and will likely die.

534
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:18,900
But if you don't.

535
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:23,363
If-If they gave you an anotic
or a hallucinogen or anything else.

536
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:26,769
Then we still have a chance
to save half the world.

537
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:30,298
It's worth a try, isn't it?

538
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,817
Professor.

539
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:46,040
Ah, it is you.
Why are you back so soon?

540
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:49,147
I have no idea
who this woman is.

541
00:42:49,172 --> 00:42:53,587
I almost didn't recognize you in that suit.
You've been shopping?

542
00:42:55,547 --> 00:42:57,833
Professor, you bumped your head.

543
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:01,673
In the shower, yes.
It's quite a toll.

544
00:43:01,698 --> 00:43:02,715
- Ayes.
- Yeah.

545
00:43:02,739 --> 00:43:06,730
I'm sorry.
This is Sienna, my niece.

546
00:43:06,832 --> 00:43:10,642
You're in Italy, Professor,
you don't have to say 'niece'.

547
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:12,142
- No. No.
- No, he's not.

548
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:16,391
Hello.
Marta Alvarez. Pleasure to meet you.

549
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:19,173
Is Ignazio with you again?

550
00:43:19,535 --> 00:43:21,883
- Ignazio?
- Yeah.

551
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,584
Ignazio couldn't make it
this morning.

552
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:37,708
I'm sorry to bother you, Marta.
But...

553
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:43,319
I can imagine you know why
I'm back. Again.

554
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,249
Really?

555
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:48,482
Of all the treasures in the Palazzo.

556
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:52,931
He and il Duomino spent almost an hour
with it up there last night.

557
00:43:53,017 --> 00:43:55,950
It's-It's so morbid.

558
00:43:55,975 --> 00:43:59,248
No. No.
It's cool.

559
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:02,897
Alright, come on.
I'm headed up that way.

560
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,823
He's an extremely resourceful man.

561
00:44:11,848 --> 00:44:14,889
I was told you were
as well, Mr. Bouchard.

562
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,537
So.
Tell me.

563
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:22,002
What do you think he's doing?

564
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,412
What you think you doing?

565
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:25,632
I brought you the pointer
and now it's gone.

566
00:44:25,657 --> 00:44:27,862
- You have lead.
- We losed him in the street.

567
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:29,883
Reacquired him at the doctor's apartment.

568
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:31,598
I can handle with some ground.

569
00:44:31,623 --> 00:44:34,281
- We don't need your help.
- What if he's injured.

570
00:44:35,541 --> 00:44:37,285
A head wound.

571
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:38,875
What?
You think he's confused.

572
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,488
- He doesn't know what he's doing?
- It's possible.

573
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:45,025
How far did he get
the night before he disappeared?

574
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,050
To the Hall of Five Hundred.

575
00:44:48,718 --> 00:44:50,710
So let's stop chasing him,

576
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:53,392
anticipate him instead.

577
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,530
Whoa, inspector.
Not so fast, please.

578
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:10,670
I'm about to burst.

579
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:14,060
Such a romantic date he takes you on.
To see a death mask.

580
00:45:14,085 --> 00:45:16,778
Yeah, they were common practice
in the 1500s.

581
00:45:16,803 --> 00:45:24,034
It's essentially just a plaster cast of someone's face,
made a few moments after that person dies.

582
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:25,975
"Through the eyes of death."

583
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:30,102
The person who was used for this mask,
the poet,

584
00:45:30,377 --> 00:45:32,043
Dante.

585
00:45:33,547 --> 00:45:36,082
It is a romantic story I supposed.

586
00:45:36,107 --> 00:45:40,061
Dante loved Florence,
he was prominent and powerful. But...

587
00:45:40,086 --> 00:45:42,956
The political winds changed
and he was exiled.

588
00:45:42,981 --> 00:45:46,254
They threatened to burn him
at the stake if he ever returned.

589
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:52,442
Actually, some people say Dante's exile
is the reason his death mask looks so sad.

590
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:56,566
No. No.
It was because of Beatrice.

591
00:45:56,591 --> 00:46:00,928
Dante revered her from afar but
he was obsessed with her his entire life.

592
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:04,297
Your niece is a romantic, Professor.

593
00:46:04,652 --> 00:46:09,600
They say Dante wrote in fact about
his journey out of hell to reach her.

594
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,605
But he never made it.

595
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:14,616
She married someone else.

596
00:46:14,715 --> 00:46:16,631
That happens.

597
00:46:16,656 --> 00:46:18,100
Does it?

598
00:46:18,382 --> 00:46:20,265
Who left who?

599
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:23,077
Things fall apart if
you don't look after them.

600
00:46:23,102 --> 00:46:26,569
Oh. We ask that you stay
behind the stanchions. Please.

601
00:46:26,594 --> 00:46:27,439
Thank you.

602
00:46:27,464 --> 00:46:30,570
Good timing, Professor.
We've only just opened.

603
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:36,397
Marta...

604
00:46:36,422 --> 00:46:37,776
Yes?

605
00:47:12,977 --> 00:47:14,669
There.
That's us.

606
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:20,687
That's Ignazio.

607
00:47:20,975 --> 00:47:22,356
I've known him for years.

608
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,569
He's the Dante scholar.

609
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:30,407
The mask's owner insists on the
stanchions to keep people back.

610
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:33,673
He doesn't even permit staff to open
the case without him present.

611
00:47:33,698 --> 00:47:36,591
So the mask is not owned
by the museum?

612
00:47:36,616 --> 00:47:38,638
No.
A private collector bought it from us,

613
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:40,988
and allows us to
display it in perpetuity.

614
00:47:41,013 --> 00:47:44,686
It's a common practice,
to raise funds.

615
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:46,463
Who is the collector?

616
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:49,957
Bertram Zobrist, the billionaire.

617
00:47:49,982 --> 00:47:54,905
His ideas were quite eccentric,
but still it's such a shame what happened.

618
00:47:55,862 --> 00:47:57,869
That's when I got the call.

619
00:48:26,305 --> 00:48:27,619
Oh.

620
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,210
Professor, I...
I don't know what to think!

621
00:48:31,235 --> 00:48:33,526
I am appalled!

622
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,473
- Professor.
- Professor Langdon.

623
00:48:46,498 --> 00:48:49,649
Look.
There's an explanation for all this.

624
00:49:02,174 --> 00:49:03,382
I'll be right back.

625
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,738
Marta, don't let them go.

626
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:24,967
Professor.

627
00:49:24,992 --> 00:49:28,906
Professor, I very much respect you
but I do not understand.

628
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:31,099
- Please sit down. I'm going to explain this.
- Why you have done this?

629
00:49:31,124 --> 00:49:33,925
- This is not okay.
- Marta, I do not know where the mask is.

630
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,696
But I'm going to do everything I can
to find it and return it to you.

631
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:39,693
Professor, what are you doing?
Professor, please. No.

632
00:49:39,718 --> 00:49:42,175
Professor, come back.
Don't do that.

633
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,575
Professor, please don't.

634
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,699
- Hey. Hey.
- Professor.

635
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:47,918
- Just don't follow us.
- Please, don't do this.

636
00:49:49,826 --> 00:49:51,535
Professor!

637
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,465
Let's just calmly
find a way out of here.

638
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,963
Why didn't you tell me about Ignazio?

639
00:50:10,245 --> 00:50:12,594
Would you help me
if you knew I was a thief?

640
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:14,215
You lied to me when
you asked for my help.

641
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,419
Well technically, I withheld.

642
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:21,359
If I really took that mask...

643
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:23,004
You did take the mask,
I just saw you.

644
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:26,643
This is not your problem.
You don't have to stay.

645
00:50:26,668 --> 00:50:29,868
Of course, I do.
Human lives are at stake.

646
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,629
I just want to know that
I'm on the right side.

647
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,029
You are.

648
00:50:33,653 --> 00:50:35,265
I swear.

649
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,775
Good.

650
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:39,615
Now let's find what
we're looking for.

651
00:50:39,897 --> 00:50:43,880
Call this Ignazio, and ask him
where he hid the mask.

652
00:50:49,118 --> 00:50:52,181
Ignazio's disappeared.
He had gone into hiding.

653
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:53,215
He said.

654
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,289
They were chasing him too
but he left a clue.

655
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:01,610
He gave me,
"Paradise Twenty-five".

656
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:05,058
That's a reference to Dante's Divine Comedy.
"Canto XXV." But...

657
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,704
- I need a copy of the book.
- A copy of the book.

658
00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:10,788
That's quaint.
I use Google.

659
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:14,179
They're closing down the museum,
only the main exit is going to be open.

660
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:17,121
Then I think
we'll go through Armenia.

661
00:51:43,418 --> 00:51:45,283
All exit doors are now sealed.

662
00:51:45,308 --> 00:51:47,086
This is the only way
in or out.

663
00:51:47,111 --> 00:51:50,507
What about hidden exits?
Tunnels, concealed doorways?

664
00:51:50,532 --> 00:51:54,369
It's a 700 year old Palazzo, Signore,
there are a number of them.

665
00:51:54,394 --> 00:51:55,907
Show me.

666
00:52:13,989 --> 00:52:15,603
ARMENIA

667
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:23,257
Professor.
How worldly.

668
00:52:23,282 --> 00:52:24,957
Secrets of the Palazzo Invisibile.

669
00:52:24,982 --> 00:52:27,742
It's a great tour,
you should take it sometime.

670
00:52:29,216 --> 00:52:31,589
We should be safe here
for a minute.

671
00:52:38,566 --> 00:52:39,886
Go.

672
00:52:44,038 --> 00:52:46,273
By then with other voice,
with other fleece...

673
00:52:46,298 --> 00:52:50,993
I shall return as poet and put on,
at my baptismal font, the laurel crown...

674
00:52:51,018 --> 00:52:52,048
Baptismal font.

675
00:52:52,073 --> 00:52:54,794
Il Duomo.
The Cathedral where Dante was baptized.

676
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:58,735
That's where Ignazio works.
That's where he hid the mask.

677
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:06,793
They're going to think
we're heading down to the exit.

678
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:10,349
Then we go up.

679
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:28,468
Alright.

680
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:33,041
We're right above the
Hall of Five Hundred.

681
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:36,301
There's a stairway leading down
to the street on the other side.

682
00:53:38,103 --> 00:53:40,462
One step at a time.

683
00:53:50,003 --> 00:53:51,388
Okay?

684
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,382
Are you afraid of heights?

685
00:53:56,542 --> 00:53:57,799
A little.

686
00:53:57,824 --> 00:54:00,670
I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.

687
00:54:01,734 --> 00:54:03,568
So, don't look down.

688
00:54:03,593 --> 00:54:06,890
Or do.
I can't never remember which.

689
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,332
It's not that hard.

690
00:55:00,366 --> 00:55:01,941
Sienna!

691
00:55:11,779 --> 00:55:13,494
Are you alright?

692
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,156
- You okay?
- Yeah.

693
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:18,326
Alright, just...
crawl along that beam there.

694
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:21,199
And I'll meet you on the
far side, by the ladder.

695
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,741
Sir.

696
00:55:29,766 --> 00:55:33,453
Give me a six men stationed here.
Safeties off.

697
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:46,648
You're being stupid now, Professor Langdon!

698
00:55:47,814 --> 00:55:49,617
Get out, go.

699
00:55:52,508 --> 00:55:56,040
They needed you but now
they changed their minds.

700
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,351
Get these people out.
Get them out and clear the room.

701
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,439
Give me that.

702
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:52,046
These doors, here.

703
00:56:52,071 --> 00:56:54,662
Eastern side.
That's where they're headed.

704
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:56,698
Go, move.
Quick!

705
00:57:46,983 --> 00:57:50,365
Bouchard.
Agent Bouchard, come in.

706
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:56,114
What is your location?
Agent Bouchard, come in.

707
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:57,760
<font color="#ff8080">REBIRTH</font>

708
00:57:57,785 --> 00:58:01,390
That same word is on the envelope
the video arrived in,

709
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:04,381
along with the date.
The date is tomorrow.

710
00:58:04,406 --> 00:58:08,282
Well, thank you,
that was not lost on me.

711
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:12,410
The darkest places in hell
are reserved for those

712
00:58:12,435 --> 00:58:15,932
who refuse to act in
times of moral crisis.

713
00:58:16,131 --> 00:58:20,682
Dante's hell isn't fiction anymore,
it's a prophecy.

714
00:58:20,774 --> 00:58:24,083
We have created
our own hell on earth.

715
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:25,872
Oh my.

716
00:58:25,897 --> 00:58:29,171
The warnings have been obvious,
the solutions ignored.

717
00:58:29,196 --> 00:58:31,694
So, I took action.

718
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:35,899
If you are watching this,
it means the Inferno virus was released

719
00:58:35,924 --> 00:58:38,061
last night at midnight.

720
00:58:38,343 --> 00:58:41,228
It's now being carried to
every corner on Earth.

721
00:58:41,253 --> 00:58:43,052
Oh my.

722
00:58:43,077 --> 00:58:47,405
Within 6 days of it's released,
the virus will replicate itself.

723
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:51,435
And every man, woman and child
on Earth expect the current...

724
00:58:52,144 --> 00:58:56,376
the current population
to recall by half.

725
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:59,688
The survivors will witness

726
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:05,874
horrors...
unknown to this planet.

727
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:09,072
But I want them to know why.

728
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:13,940
That this was our doing
and this is our salvation.

729
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:15,874
Now is the time.

730
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:18,842
Today is...

731
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:20,394
There's more.

732
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:22,601
I think I've got the gist.

733
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,884
It appears our organization has spent

734
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:27,734
the last several years
in the employ of a madman

735
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:31,394
who now intends to commit a mass murder
using a deadly plague of his own creation

736
00:59:31,426 --> 00:59:34,326
in some point in the next 24...
Sorry.

737
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:36,870
Less than 12 hours.

738
00:59:37,213 --> 00:59:40,085
So, let's do our level best
not to fuck things up

739
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:44,008
any worse than we already have,
shall we?

740
00:59:44,563 --> 00:59:48,211
Without the Faraday pointer,
no one can find the virus.

741
00:59:48,236 --> 00:59:49,813
Where is Professor Langdon now?

742
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,501
He was with Dr. Brooks in the Boboli Gardens
but we seemed to have lost visual.

743
00:59:53,526 --> 00:59:56,189
And I'm afraid we have
no contact from Vayentha.

744
00:59:56,214 --> 00:59:57,732
I see.

745
00:59:58,296 --> 01:00:00,723
I'm going to Florence myself.

746
01:00:11,643 --> 01:00:15,493
Test her for signs of contagion
and quarantine this girl.

747
01:00:16,944 --> 01:00:18,763
If we don't find Langdon very soon,

748
01:00:18,788 --> 01:00:22,074
we are going to be looking at
a great many more dead bodies.

749
01:00:45,836 --> 01:00:47,507
Are you alright?

750
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:50,519
It's weakness.

751
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:53,468
Just weakness, god damn it.

752
01:00:54,203 --> 01:00:56,051
We'll just take a moment.

753
01:00:56,076 --> 01:00:58,257
Did you see her down there?

754
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:00,005
Yes.

755
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,189
Everything I've done, every bit of
ward and studies since I was eleven

756
01:01:03,214 --> 01:01:05,204
is to stop death, not cause it.

757
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:08,126
It was self defense.
Someone was trying to kill us.

758
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:10,799
I don't know if
I can finish this.

759
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:15,977
I understand if you can't.

760
01:01:16,972 --> 01:01:20,385
Look, Zobrist is the murderer,
not you.

761
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:22,890
You saved me.

762
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:25,913
You don't have to
take another step.

763
01:01:28,195 --> 01:01:30,023
Yeah, you're right.

764
01:01:30,965 --> 01:01:34,728
I did what was necessary and
I'll do it again if I need to.

765
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,217
I pray that you don't.

766
01:01:41,314 --> 01:01:43,917
Looks like it's close for repairs.

767
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,568
Here.

768
01:02:02,721 --> 01:02:04,098
There.

769
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:06,355
The baptismal font.

770
01:02:36,197 --> 01:02:38,246
Dante again.

771
01:02:38,271 --> 01:02:40,148
Always Dante, why Dante?

772
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,992
- Acrylic gesso.
- You mean paint.

773
01:02:43,017 --> 01:02:45,352
Water soluble paint.

774
01:02:46,103 --> 01:02:48,319
Smells like a wet dog.

775
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:56,266
Look at that.
It's a writing.

776
01:02:56,291 --> 01:03:02,589
"Seek the treacherous Doge of Venice,

777
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:09,002
- who severed the heads from horses."
- Venice.

778
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:12,949
Where Dante was infected
with the disease that killed him.

779
01:03:13,702 --> 01:03:18,304
"Kneel within the gilded museum
of holy wisdom,

780
01:03:18,329 --> 01:03:27,170
and listen for the sounds
of trickling water."

781
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:31,258
"Follow deep into the sunken palace,

782
01:03:31,283 --> 01:03:36,542
- where the chthonic monster waits."
- The plague itself.

783
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:38,392
Underwater.

784
01:03:39,575 --> 01:03:43,946
"Submerged in the
blood-red waters of...

785
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:53,694
... of the lagoon that reflects no stars."
- Professor.

786
01:03:54,584 --> 01:03:57,231
Could you please tell me
what the hell you are doing?

787
01:03:59,013 --> 01:04:00,543
Why haven't you called in?

788
01:04:00,568 --> 01:04:01,800
Who are you?

789
01:04:01,825 --> 01:04:05,794
Christoph Bouchard,
from the World Health Organization.

790
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:08,554
- We've met.
- We've met?

791
01:04:08,694 --> 01:04:11,987
You really don't remember?
It was just 2 days ago.

792
01:04:12,012 --> 01:04:14,206
He's suffering the effects
of a head wound.

793
01:04:14,243 --> 01:04:17,467
He can't remember the events
for the last 48 hours.

794
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:23,031
I'm the one who flew to Cambridge
and asked for your help.

795
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:25,698
I gave you the pointer
to decode.

796
01:04:25,723 --> 01:04:27,229
Mr. Langdon.

797
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:28,736
Yes.

798
01:04:29,452 --> 01:04:33,167
Okay.
I remember.

799
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:35,853
Who are you?

800
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:39,254
I was the ER doctor at the hospital
when the Professor came in.

801
01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:42,947
What is the last thing you remember?

802
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:46,772
I was on the street.
I think it was here.

803
01:04:48,582 --> 01:04:50,601
I was with a woman.

804
01:04:50,626 --> 01:04:53,986
- And I was given an injection.
- Elizabeth Sinskey.

805
01:04:54,011 --> 01:04:55,354
Elizabeth?

806
01:04:55,379 --> 01:04:57,272
From the World Health Organization.

807
01:04:57,297 --> 01:04:58,898
Do you know her?

808
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,326
I do.

809
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:03,966
But I haven't seen Elizabeth in years.

810
01:05:03,991 --> 01:05:05,736
She's the reason
I followed you alone.

811
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:06,633
What do you mean?

812
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:10,057
I believe Dr. Sinskey is working
with a foreign government

813
01:05:10,082 --> 01:05:11,937
to find and sell the virus.

814
01:05:11,962 --> 01:05:14,128
No. No. No.
That's not possible.

815
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:16,089
People change, Professor.

816
01:05:16,114 --> 01:05:18,739
I've been chasing
Bertrand Zobrist for 2 years.

817
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:22,330
And someone has been
working against me.

818
01:05:24,615 --> 01:05:27,677
Let's get to the point.
You know where the virus is?

819
01:05:27,702 --> 01:05:30,627
I assume you have
some sort of credentials.

820
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:32,764
Call WHO if you like.

821
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:35,750
Check me out,
but do it quickly.

822
01:05:40,314 --> 01:05:42,677
Venice.
We think it's Venice.

823
01:05:42,702 --> 01:05:43,863
Good.

824
01:05:43,888 --> 01:05:46,115
It's 2 hours by train.
Come on.

825
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,996
If I could find you,
so can the others.

826
01:05:49,888 --> 01:05:52,344
I'm buying you both
plane tickets to Geneva.

827
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:54,925
No, not Geneva.
He said Venice.

828
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:56,532
I have them.

829
01:06:05,036 --> 01:06:06,527
Excuse us.

830
01:06:07,383 --> 01:06:09,092
Watch yourself, please.

831
01:06:09,117 --> 01:06:12,771
- This is the plane to Geneva?
- Yes, but we just closed the door.

832
01:06:12,796 --> 01:06:15,794
Keep the plane at the gate.
We need to check every passenger.

833
01:06:15,819 --> 01:06:18,194
That would be a waste of time.

834
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,104
And we have very little of that.

835
01:06:31,102 --> 01:06:35,661
3 days ago, after 2 years
of searching, I found Zobrist.

836
01:06:35,686 --> 01:06:39,487
He killed himself.
But we took a package from his pocket.

837
01:06:39,512 --> 01:06:40,692
And what was that?

838
01:06:40,717 --> 01:06:43,694
The Faraday pointer
with the map of hell.

839
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:48,309
A puzzle, specifically designed
for his followers to solve.

840
01:06:48,334 --> 01:06:49,950
We brought it to you.

841
01:06:49,975 --> 01:06:51,755
And you want to
process it accordingly,

842
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,699
but you were kidnapped.

843
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:57,323
Professor Langdon.

844
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,260
- You were with Dr. Sinskey at the time.
- Elizabeth, yes.

845
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:12,483
Did she tell you about any
third party interest in the virus?

846
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,174
- I don't remember.
- Did she have financial problems?

847
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,342
Uh, I don't know.

848
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,985
Did she carry more
than one cellphone?

849
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:20,969
I don't know.

850
01:07:20,994 --> 01:07:22,098
- Think.
- He doesn't remember.

851
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:28,453
Then tell me who can remember, Professor!
Enough with the "I don't know, I don't remember."!

852
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:33,775
The "gilded museum,"
is that Saint Mark's.

853
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,598
All of Venice is a museum.

854
01:07:35,623 --> 01:07:40,097
St. Mark's has the Horses of Constantinople,
they're bronze statues.

855
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:41,855
Can I see that?

856
01:07:45,788 --> 01:07:47,691
I wouldn't touch it.

857
01:07:47,716 --> 01:07:49,856
I wasn't planning to.

858
01:07:58,003 --> 01:07:59,531
Professor.

859
01:08:01,622 --> 01:08:03,407
Professor Langdon.

860
01:08:03,432 --> 01:08:05,137
Professor Langdon.

861
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:07,181
Professor Langdon.

862
01:08:08,146 --> 01:08:10,005
Yes.

863
01:08:11,274 --> 01:08:13,205
Hello, Robert.

864
01:08:15,215 --> 01:08:16,998
Elizabeth.

865
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,542
It's been a long time.

866
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,422
Too long.

867
01:08:27,343 --> 01:08:29,289
What brings you here?

868
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,880
The WHO needs your help.

869
01:08:34,447 --> 01:08:35,550
My help?

870
01:08:35,575 --> 01:08:38,077
I hope you still
remember your Dante.

871
01:08:41,603 --> 01:08:43,428
What just happened?

872
01:08:49,016 --> 01:08:50,731
Are you alright?

873
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:53,611
Could you get some water?
He could be dehydrated.

874
01:08:53,636 --> 01:08:57,641
Some food, maybe some fruit
or something from the machine.

875
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:01,074
Quickly.
Thank you.

876
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:11,725
- Is he lying?
- Through his teeth.

877
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,757
He was not the one who came
to Cambridge to see me.

878
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:32,090
Bouchard, I need help, quickly.
I think he's collapsed.

879
01:09:41,533 --> 01:09:43,523
I can't open the door.

880
01:09:44,936 --> 01:09:46,506
Langdon?

881
01:09:47,268 --> 01:09:48,848
Are you okay?

882
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,661
Langdon, are you okay?

883
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,232
You're telling me that
for 2 years,

884
01:10:13,257 --> 01:10:16,486
 you and your organization
have been working against me.

885
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:17,645
That is correct.

886
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:20,233
To shield Bertrand Zobrist
and his research.

887
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:23,555
- To hide him, to protect him.
- Regrettably, yes.

888
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:26,910
And that all of my attempts
to prevent him from initiating

889
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:31,085
a worldwide pandemic
have failed because of you.

890
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:33,334
An incisive sum-up, yes.

891
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:39,765
And now you have the temerity to ask
that I simply decide to trust you?

892
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:44,122
I'm terribly sorry,
I didn't see any other way.

893
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:51,513
Who exactly does
your group work for?

894
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:56,597
Our clients, of course.

895
01:10:56,647 --> 01:11:00,694
We are a private security firm.
A very successful one.

896
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,586
May I ask,

897
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:06,551
the gentleman who is with you,
an agent Bouchard,

898
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:08,943
where is he now?

899
01:11:10,347 --> 01:11:12,844
We don't know.
We lost track of him.

900
01:11:13,393 --> 01:11:15,748
Then the situation is
worse than you think.

901
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:18,587
There is only one reason
he wouldn't move on your puppet,

902
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:20,739
he wants Mr. Langdon to himself.

903
01:11:20,764 --> 01:11:21,684
Why?

904
01:11:21,709 --> 01:11:24,884
To find the virus and sell it
to the highest bidder I assume.

905
01:11:24,917 --> 01:11:27,991
Leverage, blackmail,
you know, the usual shit.

906
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:31,150
I don't think we have anything
further to discuss, Mr. Sims.

907
01:11:31,175 --> 01:11:34,415
And I have less than 8 hours
to find this pathogen, excuse me.

908
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,828
From what I understand,
you knew the Professor sometime ago.

909
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:42,450
First hand knowledge.

910
01:11:44,062 --> 01:11:46,093
You care about him.

911
01:11:47,164 --> 01:11:53,484
You would even ally with an unscrupulous character
such as myself to protect him, wouldn't you?

912
01:11:57,111 --> 01:12:01,239
My organization has the resources
to find the Professor.

913
01:12:28,486 --> 01:12:31,628
If you wanted to start a plague,
this is where you do it.

914
01:12:31,653 --> 01:12:33,071
Yep.

915
01:12:33,561 --> 01:12:37,337
20 million people a year come here
from every corner of the globe.

916
01:12:37,362 --> 01:12:41,302
During the Black Death,
the Venetians made all the ships

917
01:12:41,327 --> 01:12:43,189
anchored in the harbor
for 40 days,

918
01:12:43,214 --> 01:12:45,286
before they would allow
the crews into the city.

919
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:48,225
Making sure that they were not
carrying the Plague.

920
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,415
The word "Quarantine"
comes from the Italian.

921
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,258
"quaranta",
"forty".

922
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,212
It's nice to have you back, Professor.

923
01:12:57,118 --> 01:13:00,768
There, the horses.

924
01:13:06,895 --> 01:13:10,863
These were recreations, the originals
are in a museum for preservation.

925
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:14,003
We should be quick.
Bouchard knows we are coming here.

926
01:13:16,913 --> 01:13:20,534
Ask that guide, if the heads have
ever been severed from these horses?

927
01:13:20,559 --> 01:13:23,741
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

928
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,590
- Excuse me.
- Please excuse me.

929
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:27,024
Please.

930
01:13:35,519 --> 01:13:37,200
According to the tale,
during the Crusades,

931
01:13:37,225 --> 01:13:40,250
the horses were looted
from Constantinople.

932
01:13:46,918 --> 01:13:49,967
But they were too large to be
loaded on board the ships,

933
01:13:52,047 --> 01:13:54,501
so their heads were removed
and reattached.

934
01:13:54,526 --> 01:13:56,012
By whom?

935
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:59,009
The doge who lived forever,
Enrico Dandolo.

936
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:01,893
- Enrico Dandolo.
- The doge who lived forever.

937
01:14:01,918 --> 01:14:03,505
Of course, Enrico Dandolo.

938
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:05,785
Dandolo tricked the Venetians into the Crusades.

939
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:10,692
He was supposed to sail his ships to Egypt,
but he sacked Constantinople instead.

940
01:14:10,717 --> 01:14:12,853
I'm sorry.
Of course.

941
01:14:12,878 --> 01:14:15,476
"The gilded museum of holy wisdom."

942
01:14:16,506 --> 01:14:18,485
Are we in the wrong basilica?

943
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,589
We're in the wrong country.

944
01:14:21,229 --> 01:14:23,514
Dandolo passed,
but he was not buried here.

945
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:25,155
So where was he buried?

946
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:27,146
Hagia Sophia.

947
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:29,879
- Istanbul.
- Istanbul.

948
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,759
There's always a way out.

949
01:15:18,978 --> 01:15:20,525
Here.
Here.

950
01:15:27,534 --> 01:15:29,586
See if you could get that open.

951
01:15:32,372 --> 01:15:34,120
I got your foot.

952
01:15:50,108 --> 01:15:51,881
Can you get it?

953
01:16:05,139 --> 01:16:06,560
Is there someone there?

954
01:16:06,585 --> 01:16:08,300
Please help.

955
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:14,977
Yes.

956
01:16:15,374 --> 01:16:16,834
Give me a hand.

957
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:19,154
- One hundred.
- Yes! Yes.

958
01:16:19,179 --> 01:16:21,713
- A hundred euro.
- Here. I got it. I got it.

959
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,742
Quick. Quick. Quick.

960
01:17:15,995 --> 01:17:17,530
What are you doing?

961
01:17:18,754 --> 01:17:23,005
You called him a murderer,
a psychopath.

962
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:25,602
What?

963
01:17:25,627 --> 01:17:28,716
But history will call us saviors.

964
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:35,139
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

965
01:17:36,566 --> 01:17:38,940
I'm not afraid to die, Robert.

966
01:17:42,308 --> 01:17:44,810
Doing nothing terrifies me.

967
01:17:44,835 --> 01:17:50,220
The path, and the pointer,
he left that all for you, Zobrist.

968
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,315
- You knew him?
- Knew him?

969
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:56,739
I loved him.

970
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,656
You're wearing his suit.

971
01:18:00,825 --> 01:18:03,102
No.
Sienna, no.

972
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:04,802
Thank you, Robert.

973
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,553
Thank you for everything.

974
01:18:10,827 --> 01:18:14,618
No. No.
Sienna, no!

975
01:18:15,347 --> 01:18:16,864
Sienna!

976
01:18:17,404 --> 01:18:20,253
No, Sienna!
Sienna, no!

977
01:18:48,342 --> 01:18:51,783
Slow down, slow down.
You're too fast.

978
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:16,324
Oh, come on.
Come on.

979
01:19:16,349 --> 01:19:18,523
This took me 3 days.

980
01:19:18,548 --> 01:19:20,309
Too easy.

981
01:19:20,394 --> 01:19:22,461
THE
GOLDEN
AGE

982
01:19:30,731 --> 01:19:32,283
I love it.

983
01:19:43,471 --> 01:19:46,465
A link before you exist,

984
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,182
an idea.

985
01:19:52,309 --> 01:19:54,548
And now it's real.

986
01:19:56,410 --> 01:20:01,462
Love awakens the soul to act.

987
01:20:06,338 --> 01:20:11,634
That's not fair.
Quoting Dante to me.

988
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:18,478
But it's beauty, not love.

989
01:20:33,465 --> 01:20:35,001
What?

990
01:20:38,215 --> 01:20:40,461
It's a minute to midnight.

991
01:20:43,194 --> 01:20:45,859
Sooner than I expected.

992
01:20:49,462 --> 01:20:51,363
Where're we going?

993
01:20:57,877 --> 01:20:59,410
Oh.

994
01:21:00,949 --> 01:21:03,012
I see.

995
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:11,322
We planned it together,
we designed it together,

996
01:21:13,175 --> 01:21:15,691
but this part
only belongs to you.

997
01:21:15,716 --> 01:21:20,121
It's just safer if
you don't know where.

998
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:25,432
What if they find you first?

999
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:30,245
What then?

1000
01:21:34,504 --> 01:21:37,323
If you want to know,
you're not alone.

1001
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:40,464
You got to start by trust me.

1002
01:21:40,489 --> 01:21:43,570
Unless we take bold immediate action

1003
01:21:43,595 --> 01:21:48,449
the sixth extinction
will be our own.

1004
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,696
You were right.

1005
01:22:05,644 --> 01:22:08,309
I'm going to make
you another path.

1006
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:12,538
Inferno will be at the end.

1007
01:22:12,563 --> 01:22:17,846
If something should happen to me,
the first clue will be deliver to you.

1008
01:22:17,871 --> 01:22:20,800
I know you'll do
what has to be done.

1009
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:23,400
Seek and find.

1010
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,462
You're not alone.

1011
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:34,379
So.

1012
01:23:34,404 --> 01:23:37,983
The beautiful young woman
went for the bad guy.

1013
01:23:38,865 --> 01:23:41,026
That happens.

1014
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:44,466
You look disappointed.

1015
01:23:45,923 --> 01:23:47,510
I'll give you a minute.

1016
01:23:47,534 --> 01:23:52,527
Elizabeth is not the one
who wants the virus to sell.

1017
01:23:53,108 --> 01:23:54,828
You are.

1018
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:57,834
You've been used.

1019
01:23:58,512 --> 01:24:03,534
Elaborate schemes created by people
to get you to do what they want.

1020
01:24:04,895 --> 01:24:06,822
But me,

1021
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,016
I'm very direct.

1022
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:13,794
And this is a moment of
great opportunity for me.

1023
01:24:13,819 --> 01:24:17,072
So, where is the virus?

1024
01:24:22,074 --> 01:24:24,275
Come on, Professor.

1025
01:24:24,621 --> 01:24:27,316
How much life is
there in the world?

1026
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:31,225
How much more is fighting
to be war?

1027
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:36,869
Nothing wrong with thinning
the herd once in a while.

1028
01:24:42,506 --> 01:24:44,276
It's healthy.

1029
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:48,870
I've seen many acts of god.

1030
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:54,133
I mean, typhoons, cholera.
And you know what?

1031
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:57,912
Sometimes it hits the right people.

1032
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:01,983
- That's inhuman.
- Humanity is inhuman.

1033
01:25:02,008 --> 01:25:05,545
Life maybe cheap,
but if it means to add it on our scale,

1034
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:08,321
no one ever stops
paying for that.

1035
01:25:15,892 --> 01:25:19,109
I'm going to ask you
for the last...

1036
01:25:22,658 --> 01:25:24,753
Terribly sorry.

1037
01:25:27,441 --> 01:25:29,639
Didn't see any other way.

1038
01:25:30,643 --> 01:25:35,071
Must do this quickly.
The less blood the better.

1039
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:37,525
Who are you?

1040
01:25:38,518 --> 01:25:41,118
Oh, a facilitator.

1041
01:25:41,143 --> 01:25:44,358
Among other things
my company creates illusions.

1042
01:25:44,383 --> 01:25:46,780
You never had
a real head wound.

1043
01:25:49,076 --> 01:25:54,054
- But I lost my memory.
- Chemically induced.

1044
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:57,710
We gave you an injection
of benzodiazapenes.

1045
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:03,136
Sorry, it can produce a skin rash.
It should fade in a day or so.

1046
01:26:06,707 --> 01:26:08,878
All this was a...

1047
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:10,358
This was a fake?

1048
01:26:10,383 --> 01:26:13,450
I prefer created reality.

1049
01:26:13,475 --> 01:26:17,595
My agents kidnapped you.

1050
01:26:17,627 --> 01:26:20,308
- They had to do it all real quickly.
- By killing me?

1051
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:24,087
I apologize unreservedly, Mr. Langdon.

1052
01:26:31,082 --> 01:26:33,782
I did lose and
experience sees it.

1053
01:26:34,963 --> 01:26:38,964
It does a great deal of situation
I've employed in my line of work.

1054
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:43,486
Look, hear me what I know.

1055
01:26:43,511 --> 01:26:46,233
I know I've behaved terribly.

1056
01:26:49,045 --> 01:26:53,775
But a puzzle needed solving,
who better to solve it than you.

1057
01:26:54,322 --> 01:26:56,232
Gladsome apparently.

1058
01:27:09,626 --> 01:27:11,859
Not my best work.

1059
01:27:12,445 --> 01:27:15,103
But it will do for the Italians.

1060
01:27:15,991 --> 01:27:21,125
Zobrist had followers everywhere
when Sienna first came to me for help.

1061
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:23,114
Or so I thought.

1062
01:27:23,139 --> 01:27:27,726
She came to us with serious concerns
shortly after Zobrist died.

1063
01:27:28,806 --> 01:27:31,979
Somehow, she knew Zobrist hired us

1064
01:27:32,004 --> 01:27:35,645
She said he was doing biological work
that could be fallen into the wrong hands.

1065
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:38,827
She didn't mention a plague.
But we heard enough to be alarmed.

1066
01:27:38,852 --> 01:27:42,727
So we agreed to work with her
to find Zobrist's project.

1067
01:27:42,752 --> 01:27:47,385
And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in,
we saw an opportunity.

1068
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:49,659
It was Elizabeth
who came to see me.

1069
01:27:49,684 --> 01:27:51,007
Yes.

1070
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:54,979
Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer
from agent Bouchard.

1071
01:27:55,004 --> 01:27:57,221
She brought it
to you to decode,

1072
01:27:57,246 --> 01:28:00,078
and she even secured it
with your thumbprint.

1073
01:28:00,103 --> 01:28:01,520
That left us with no choice,

1074
01:28:01,545 --> 01:28:04,182
so we took you from her
on the street.

1075
01:28:05,927 --> 01:28:10,175
The hospital scenario encouraged you
to trust Dr. Brooks.

1076
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,779
When you called to the Consulate
it was answered by our friend.

1077
01:28:14,804 --> 01:28:16,308
Professor Langdon?

1078
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,909
Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.

1079
01:28:18,934 --> 01:28:20,225
Are you still in possession?

1080
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:22,282
You have the pointer,
we have you.

1081
01:28:22,307 --> 01:28:26,195
It was all working seamlessly
until Miss. Brooks stole you away.

1082
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:29,421
To make sure
the virus is released.

1083
01:28:30,502 --> 01:28:32,454
It appears.

1084
01:28:33,169 --> 01:28:35,938
Young people are disappointing.

1085
01:28:37,169 --> 01:28:40,640
I find them become
tolerable around 35.

1086
01:28:43,179 --> 01:28:45,566
You're going to thank Dr. Sinskey.

1087
01:28:53,224 --> 01:28:55,200
I've been so worried.

1088
01:28:56,855 --> 01:28:58,605
Are you alright?

1089
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,931
- I'm fine.
- Are you?

1090
01:29:00,956 --> 01:29:02,757
I'm okay.

1091
01:29:03,226 --> 01:29:05,029
I'm alright.

1092
01:29:06,153 --> 01:29:07,835
Thank god.

1093
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:13,557
- Do you know where the virus is?
- Istanbul.

1094
01:29:18,109 --> 01:29:20,103
Now's the time.

1095
01:29:20,576 --> 01:29:22,840
Today is rebirth.

1096
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:25,528
Inferno is salvation.

1097
01:29:30,983 --> 01:29:33,414
I am so sorry I brought
you into this, Robert,

1098
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:37,821
- after all these years.
- No. I'm glad you did.

1099
01:29:38,428 --> 01:29:42,049
I met him, you know.
Zobrist, 2 years ago.

1100
01:29:42,074 --> 01:29:43,741
He asked for my help.

1101
01:29:43,766 --> 01:29:47,089
He wanted the WHO to
endorse mass sterilization

1102
01:29:47,114 --> 01:29:49,434
in drinking waters and staple foods.

1103
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:53,891
So I threw him out of my office,
put him on the watch list.

1104
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:57,090
He disappeared and...

1105
01:29:58,759 --> 01:30:02,196
I suppose that's when 
he severed his ties since.

1106
01:30:03,055 --> 01:30:07,334
I should probably have... have
I don't know.

1107
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:08,111
What?

1108
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:12,606
You always blame yourself for things 
that weren't your fault.

1109
01:30:14,539 --> 01:30:16,840
You're very sweet.

1110
01:30:33,105 --> 01:30:35,435
Here, a doorway.

1111
01:30:46,871 --> 01:30:50,911
I wish it would have happened differently,
back then.

1112
01:30:52,838 --> 01:30:56,758
We didn't look after it.
It fell apart.

1113
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,037
Is that a regret?

1114
01:31:01,284 --> 01:31:03,558
Only when I think about it.

1115
01:31:09,634 --> 01:31:13,093
Would you have say the same things
happened in doorways,

1116
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:17,349
at the borders,
right along the edges.

1117
01:31:19,446 --> 01:31:24,206
Ancient fishermen learned to sail
where the warm water met the cold.

1118
01:31:24,231 --> 01:31:28,618
The little fish would reach the edge
of the warm water and they stopped.

1119
01:31:28,643 --> 01:31:31,555
And the big fish would come out 
of the cold water and they eat them.

1120
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:34,019
And the fishermen.

1121
01:31:34,341 --> 01:31:36,613
Well, they caught everyone.

1122
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:43,103
Doorways.

1123
01:31:45,678 --> 01:31:49,819
Not one part of you 
has changed, Robert.

1124
01:31:53,086 --> 01:31:55,458
You talk too much.

1125
01:31:57,137 --> 01:32:01,739
And then,
not at all

1126
01:32:02,599 --> 01:32:04,271
Elizabeth.

1127
01:32:05,909 --> 01:32:11,587
I couldn't ask you
not to go to Geneva.

1128
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:15,008
I couldn't.

1129
01:32:15,033 --> 01:32:18,782
I didn't want to ask you 
to leave Cambridge.

1130
01:32:24,257 --> 01:32:26,737
Was that how it happened?

1131
01:32:28,356 --> 01:32:30,978
I don't trust my memory anymore.

1132
01:32:31,918 --> 01:32:34,255
I never forget anything.

1133
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,384
Well, that's a gift.

1134
01:32:36,409 --> 01:32:39,830
No.
It isn't.

1135
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:57,131
Leave him alone!
What are you doing?

1136
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:58,144
Leave him alone!

1137
01:32:58,169 --> 01:32:59,910
Turn around!

1138
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,650
Don't look at me! 
Look away.

1139
01:33:09,466 --> 01:33:11,510
Don't look.

1140
01:33:18,024 --> 01:33:19,884
Robert!

1141
01:34:14,789 --> 01:34:17,309
I'm a friend of the poet.

1142
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:38,085
For what did Zobrist die?

1143
01:34:38,110 --> 01:34:40,505
That others may live.

1144
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:46,282
I've come very far to 
make sure nothing interferes.

1145
01:34:46,307 --> 01:34:50,392
The delivery system we designed will discharge 
the viral agent by midnight tonight.

1146
01:34:50,417 --> 01:34:53,003
But there are others who
are on their way to stop me.

1147
01:34:53,028 --> 01:34:54,534
I need to find it 
before they do

1148
01:34:54,559 --> 01:34:58,113
and trigger an explosion 
to ensure it's released.

1149
01:34:58,138 --> 01:35:00,022
How do we help?

1150
01:35:02,622 --> 01:35:04,073
During the Plague of Justinian,

1151
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:08,105
5000 people died everyday 
in the streets in Istanbul.

1152
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:11,543
A border between East and West.

1153
01:35:11,568 --> 01:35:14,007
Which is why he chose it.

1154
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:17,344
If the bag is intact, 
we can contain it.

1155
01:35:17,369 --> 01:35:20,399
But if someone ruptures it 
before we get there

1156
01:35:20,868 --> 01:35:26,396
95% of the earth's population
will be infected in 47 days.

1157
01:35:58,669 --> 01:36:00,658
Professor.
Doctor.

1158
01:36:00,683 --> 01:36:03,820
My name is Mirsat,
I'm the curator here.

1159
01:36:13,035 --> 01:36:15,248
Have you completely
evacuated the building?

1160
01:36:15,273 --> 01:36:18,745
Well, to the extent that we can
but the place is massive.

1161
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:21,503
Could you tell me specifically
what it is you're looking for?

1162
01:36:21,528 --> 01:36:23,697
The tomb of Enrico Dandolo.

1163
01:36:23,722 --> 01:36:25,726
Of course, this way.

1164
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:39,380
"Kneel within the 
gilded museum of holy wisdom,

1165
01:36:39,729 --> 01:36:43,987
and listen for the sounds
of trickling water."

1166
01:36:47,138 --> 01:36:51,768
"Follow deep into the sunken palace."

1167
01:36:55,033 --> 01:36:57,118
I hear water flowing
through these stones.

1168
01:36:57,143 --> 01:36:58,905
Where does it go?

1169
01:36:58,930 --> 01:37:01,275
It's just drainage. 
It goes to the city cistern.

1170
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,553
We're looking for a large, 
underground space,

1171
01:37:03,578 --> 01:37:06,472
perhaps with columns,
artificially lit from within.

1172
01:37:06,521 --> 01:37:08,936
That's simple. 
The ancient system,

1173
01:37:08,961 --> 01:37:11,814
sixth century, Yerebatan Sarayi.

1174
01:37:11,839 --> 01:37:13,908
Also called, "The sunken palace."

1175
01:37:13,933 --> 01:37:15,453
Take us there.

1176
01:37:15,478 --> 01:37:17,451
His words can only
mean one thing.

1177
01:37:17,476 --> 01:37:20,507
Yerebatan Sarayi.
The Sunken Palace.

1178
01:37:20,532 --> 01:37:24,853
Once we descend, you'll see 
exactly what he described.

1179
01:37:29,328 --> 01:37:31,425
How do I use it?

1180
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,389
There's a cap 
in the padial integrate.

1181
01:37:35,414 --> 01:37:38,850
The device also has a
detonation button.

1182
01:37:38,875 --> 01:37:42,330
A call from this cellphone 
will trigger the explosion.

1183
01:37:42,354 --> 01:37:44,217
And that's enough
to break the bag?

1184
01:37:44,243 --> 01:37:46,701
The walls are cement all around.

1185
01:37:46,726 --> 01:37:51,179
You need both bombs, different angles,
as far apart as you can.

1186
01:37:51,204 --> 01:37:53,305
That's what break the bag.

1187
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:03,292
History says the Black Plague
caused misery and death.

1188
01:38:03,317 --> 01:38:05,588
But, what they don't tell us,

1189
01:38:05,613 --> 01:38:10,462
is that it also produced a leaner population,
and gave birth to the Renaissance.

1190
01:38:10,487 --> 01:38:14,253
We are rushing as fast as we can
into the seventh circle of hell.

1191
01:38:14,277 --> 01:38:15,901
Suicidal but profitable.

1192
01:38:15,926 --> 01:38:18,621
Why is suffering later 
preferable to suffering now?

1193
01:38:18,647 --> 01:38:23,648
What if we embrace it.
And then maybe pain can save us.

1194
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:29,311
You're getting this, aren't you?
I can that you are.

1195
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:32,535
Now I need to know 
that I'm not alone.

1196
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,645
Too many damn people.

1197
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:49,964
He has chosen well.

1198
01:38:49,989 --> 01:38:54,191
I need schematics of all
conduits in and out of the cistern.

1199
01:38:54,457 --> 01:38:57,513
Full isolation and containment protocols.

1200
01:38:57,538 --> 01:39:01,619
Physical and chemical barriers along with...
Wait.

1201
01:39:03,942 --> 01:39:05,766
This is the city's water supply?

1202
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:07,854
Oh, not anymore.
We've modernized.

1203
01:39:07,879 --> 01:39:09,028
But there is water.

1204
01:39:09,053 --> 01:39:11,270
Yes. 
It eventually filters down into the earth.

1205
01:39:11,295 --> 01:39:12,635
Why are all these people here?

1206
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:16,108
It is a tourist attraction.
The acoustics are excellent.

1207
01:39:16,133 --> 01:39:19,334
Tonight is the summer solstice concert,
very popular.

1208
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:22,219
People come from all over
the world to hear it.

1209
01:39:22,488 --> 01:39:25,316
He created a bioaerosol.

1210
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:27,811
So it will spread in the air.

1211
01:39:27,836 --> 01:39:30,144
- Empty the place.
- No.

1212
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:31,993
Contain it.

1213
01:39:32,616 --> 01:39:36,211
Jam all communications down there.
No messages get in or out.

1214
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:37,575
Got it.

1215
01:39:39,326 --> 01:39:41,086
Shall we go in?

1216
01:39:44,933 --> 01:39:47,555
Robert, you don't have to
come down, you know.

1217
01:39:48,026 --> 01:39:49,697
Yes, I do.

1218
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:09,936
"Blood-red waters 
of the lagoon that reflects no stars."

1219
01:40:09,961 --> 01:40:12,089
My god, this is a labyrinth.

1220
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:13,865
How many sections?

1221
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:17,090
There are dozens, Professor,
dozens.

1222
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:20,029
Let's find it.

1223
01:40:20,133 --> 01:40:23,004
Check the other section.

1224
01:40:23,029 --> 01:40:24,595
Check them all.

1225
01:40:24,702 --> 01:40:26,285
Spread out.

1226
01:40:36,705 --> 01:40:38,829
Cut off cellphone service now.

1227
01:40:38,854 --> 01:40:41,394
- No communications.
- Yes, sir.

1228
01:40:53,676 --> 01:40:55,613
Here. This way.
Medusa.

1229
01:40:55,638 --> 01:40:56,864
Greek spirits, why?

1230
01:40:56,889 --> 01:41:01,473
It belongs to a specific category of
Greek spirits. Chthonic monsters.

1231
01:41:01,498 --> 01:41:03,786
- This is it?
- Yes.

1232
01:41:03,811 --> 01:41:07,217
The color, the columns, it's exactly 
what we saw in the video

1233
01:41:07,242 --> 01:41:10,213
This is the area,
so spread out, check the pillars.

1234
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:12,422
I'll take the wall lining.

1235
01:41:12,447 --> 01:41:13,894
Under the walkway.

1236
01:41:13,919 --> 01:41:17,886
Should you find anything,
report to me immediately.

1237
01:41:18,268 --> 01:41:21,160
Lives are at stake,
try to find it.

1238
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:40,394
- What's going on?
- Sir, I need you to step aside.

1239
01:42:33,092 --> 01:42:37,320
I got it. It's here.
In this right corner.

1240
01:43:17,922 --> 01:43:19,336
Don't.

1241
01:43:42,195 --> 01:43:43,702
Hurry.

1242
01:43:47,059 --> 01:43:48,566
Quickly!

1243
01:44:13,486 --> 01:44:15,198
Sienna!

1244
01:44:17,495 --> 01:44:19,040
Sienna!

1245
01:44:39,816 --> 01:44:41,841
Sienna.
Sienna.

1246
01:44:41,866 --> 01:44:43,440
There are too many
of us down here!

1247
01:44:43,465 --> 01:44:45,776
You won't get to that
band before we do!

1248
01:44:45,801 --> 01:44:48,873
No. 
But I can make sure it breaks.

1249
01:44:48,898 --> 01:44:51,771
Don't do this, Sienna, don't.
You'll be murdering innocents.

1250
01:44:51,796 --> 01:44:53,678
Yes. 
People will die

1251
01:44:53,703 --> 01:44:56,674
a lot of them
and crisis will be averted.

1252
01:44:58,554 --> 01:45:00,046
It's what nature demands.

1253
01:45:00,071 --> 01:45:02,889
The problem won't suddenly slow down,
it should be solved permanently.

1254
01:45:02,914 --> 01:45:07,055
Killing billions to save lives.
That's the logic of tyrants.

1255
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:10,425
- For the greater good, humanity...
- Geniuses don't come with special rights.

1256
01:45:10,450 --> 01:45:14,209
No, they come with the responsibility
to take action when others won't!

1257
01:45:14,234 --> 01:45:16,007
You want to do something, fine.

1258
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:19,575
Then scream at the top of your lungs.
And invent and live.

1259
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,029
If you loved humanity,
if you love this planet,

1260
01:45:23,054 --> 01:45:25,078
you would do anything
to save it.

1261
01:45:25,103 --> 01:45:29,555
The greatest sins in human history 
were committed in the name of love.

1262
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:32,100
No one will go down this act 
and call it love.

1263
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:33,724
They'll be alive.

1264
01:45:34,716 --> 01:45:37,307
What does it matter
what they say about us.

1265
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:43,308
<font color="#80ffff">No Signal</font>

1266
01:48:13,521 --> 01:48:15,187
Don't shoot the box!

1267
01:48:30,649 --> 01:48:32,531
Robert.
Here.

1268
01:48:49,182 --> 01:48:51,252
Are you alright?

1269
01:48:51,277 --> 01:48:52,376
Fine.

1270
01:48:52,401 --> 01:48:55,481
Where's the box.
Where's the box.

1271
01:49:40,247 --> 01:49:43,435
It's contained, no breach.

1272
01:49:45,177 --> 01:49:47,738
The virus has been contained.

1273
01:49:53,931 --> 01:49:57,349
The target is contained,
be prepared for transport.

1274
01:50:53,232 --> 01:50:55,988
She thought she was 
saving the world.

1275
01:50:57,694 --> 01:50:59,687
So did they all.

1276
01:51:10,077 --> 01:51:12,588
So, what will happen to the...?

1277
01:51:12,613 --> 01:51:16,351
We'll take it back to Geneva for test, 
there will be an annunciation.

1278
01:51:16,797 --> 01:51:19,213
We'll have to generate
another gene sequences first

1279
01:51:19,238 --> 01:51:21,832
to get an idea 
what we are dealing with.

1280
01:51:23,723 --> 01:51:26,015
There' a lot of work 
to be done.

1281
01:51:30,462 --> 01:51:33,848
And you, Cambridge?

1282
01:51:37,085 --> 01:51:38,584
Yeah.

1283
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:43,511
Dr. Sinskey?

1284
01:51:47,426 --> 01:51:50,091
Life tore us apart again.

1285
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:54,818
Like Dante and Beatrice.

1286
01:51:58,547 --> 01:52:00,812
I have something for you.

1287
01:52:14,306 --> 01:52:17,085
I picked this up
the night you were taken.

1288
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:20,047
I seem to remember 
it was important to you.

1289
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:26,627
Yes. 
Yes, it is.

1290
01:52:30,632 --> 01:52:34,828
Do you ever think 
about what could have happened

1291
01:52:34,853 --> 01:52:36,770
for you and me?

1292
01:52:38,226 --> 01:52:39,784
I do.

1293
01:52:43,565 --> 01:52:47,038
I guess life must have 
it's mysteries, Professor,

1294
01:52:47,063 --> 01:52:49,229
even for us.

1295
01:53:23,226 --> 01:53:27,121
- ' Scusati, do you speak English?
- Yes.

1296
01:53:27,146 --> 01:53:29,991
Have you seen Marta Alvarez,
the museum staff?

1297
01:53:30,016 --> 01:53:33,473
Marta isn't here just now.
She's had her baby.

1298
01:53:33,498 --> 01:53:36,527
She had her baby?
Aw, that is great.

1299
01:53:36,552 --> 01:53:37,761
Great news.

1300
01:53:37,786 --> 01:53:40,502
Well, you might tell someone that 
the lights on the Dante mask

1301
01:53:40,527 --> 01:53:42,475
should be turned on. 
Because I can barely see it.

1302
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,739
I'm sorry, sir, 
the Dante mask is no longer here.

1303
01:53:45,764 --> 01:53:47,165
It was stolen.

1304
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:49,890
Really?
I was just looking at it.

1305
01:53:50,876 --> 01:53:52,408
Excuse me.

1306
01:54:15,883 --> 01:54:20,944
