1
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,206
Jack!

2
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:06,085
- Gotta go!
- Jack, don't go! Jack!

3
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,612
Sorry! Sorry!

4
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:07,438
Look out!

5
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,303
Shit!

6
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,423
Ssh...!

7
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:32,972
Open up!
I'm an American citizen seeking asylum!

8
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,190
Open up!

9
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:40,437
- May I see your passport, sir?
- If I had one, I wouldn't need asylum!

10
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:47,945
- Please, you've gotta let me in.
- Let me make a phone call.

11
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:01,625
Oh, man!

12
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,093
Pratt, I'm requesting asylum.

13
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:07,596
Mr Moore, this is not the place
to hold this discussion.

14
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:12,136
This used to be the Pakistani embassy.
Before that it was wired by the PRC boys.

15
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:15,180
Follow me.

16
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:21,270
This, however, is entirely bug-free.

17
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:25,733
Mr Moore...

18
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,235
- Peyton Reed.
- Jack.

19
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:32,364
The Ambassador has been
summoned by the Ministry.

20
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:36,243
This has the makings
of a full-scale incident.

21
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:39,747
A full-scale incident!

22
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:44,627
I'm sorry I didn't call for an appointment!

23
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:52,301
Do the two of you have any idea
of what I've been through?

24
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,388
No. I am not leaving here.

25
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:00,351
- No-one said you should leave.
- I'm not going.

26
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:02,151
- Of course not.
- You're in.

27
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:05,981
- But getting out is another story.
- You got other people out.

28
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,109
It took a year to get those physicists out.

29
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:13,072
And the Chinese Army
threatened to storm the embassy.

30
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:16,665
And that was just asylum.
You're charged with murder.

31
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,788
If this becomes a dick-measuring contest,
they'll never let you leave.

32
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:30,089
What?

33
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:32,341
What is it?

34
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,683
Your attorney is here.

35
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:37,846
- She wishes to see you.
- I advise no contact.

36
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:45,646
- Yuelin put up your guarantee.
- I thought the embassy put it up.

37
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,697
In China, bail is not about money.
It's reputation.

38
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:52,820
To have you released today,
Shen Yuelin put up her career, her future.

39
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,492
It was really quite unique.

40
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:11,255
Yuelin...

41
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:14,466
Your shoulder.

42
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,510
It's all right.

43
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:21,724
If I'd known what you did for me,
I wouldn't have left.

44
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,913
I'm glad you left.

45
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:25,561
- Glad?
- Yes.

46
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,983
Because I am not sure I could have saved
you from the decision of the court. And I...

47
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:35,779
I could not have lived with that.

48
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:41,452
Why did you risk your life for me
if you didn't believe me?

49
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:45,956
I always assumed the worst about you.

50
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,417
I have never questioned.

51
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:51,670
I have always accepted things.

52
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:55,466
It is the same as when I was a child.

53
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,765
Why?

54
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,927
I was blind. I was mute.

55
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:03,772
When you were a child...

56
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,061
It was during the Cultural Revolution,
wasn't it?

57
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:09,104
Yes.

58
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,444
What is it?

59
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,199
I went to school until they closed down,
and everything went mad.

60
00:11:22,826 --> 00:11:26,288
I do not know if you could understand this,
Jack Moore.

61
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,248
Try me.

62
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:33,128
I...

63
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:35,965
I watched...

64
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,760
I watched my father be humiliated,
and I said nothing.

65
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:44,932
I watched my father be spat on.
I did nothing.

66
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,437
I even watched my classmates
pour black ink over his head,

67
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:53,190
one after another

68
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:55,234
and after another.

69
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:00,614
What did I do?

70
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:05,077
I hid my head in shame
while he was dragged away.

71
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,794
I never questioned.

72
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,006
I was blind.

73
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:22,261
I'm very sorry that
I did not believe your innocence.

74
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,058
But now I do.

75
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:32,229
I do.

76
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:03,677
Somebody alerted the press.

77
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:08,098
Let's get you out before your face
is on the cover of Time and Newsweek.

78
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:10,596
Wo men.

79
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:21,398
Wo men guanxi.

80
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,483
I thought you were through.

81
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:08,112
Evidence is missing here,
such as Hong Ling's locket.

82
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:11,490
Please do not make me go
to the Ministry ofJustice

83
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,952
and have them order you
to deliver this material.

84
00:16:15,244 --> 00:16:18,247
The Ministry cannot find
something that doesn't exist.

85
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:21,250
I'm going to allow you to save face
by speaking English.

86
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:29,883
A certain general has a personal interest
in seeing some of this evidence returned.

87
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,888
Lf, by chance, an arresting officer
pocketed this evidence,

88
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:37,731
and it is not returned,

89
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:41,729
then even an attorney as good as I am
cannot ensure your wellbeing.

90
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:49,778
I suggest you search again. Anything you
might find can be brought to the court.

91
00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:58,806
I need your counsel.

92
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,814
I want you to walk away from this.

93
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:04,853
I'm trying to access evidence
which would help prove your innocence.

94
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:06,820
Walk away now.

95
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:10,859
Why didn't you? The smart thing
would have been to stay at the embassy.

96
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:14,154
Yeah. And move past it.
Yes, I do that really well.

97
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,199
Why did you not?

98
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:26,292
Did you ever see little girls play soccer?

99
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:30,379
Little silly bundles of energy
just swarming all over each other and

100
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,133
tripping on each other, and

101
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,304
hair ribbons left on the ground

102
00:18:38,387 --> 00:18:40,097
Your daughter.

103
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:42,433
Yeah, they were, um...

104
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:54,403
They were driving back from a game
when it happened... the accident.

105
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:56,870
And you were...?

106
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,366
Oh, I was in Tokyo. I was, um...

107
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:06,874
I was closing a deal. I could've finished it
the day before if I'd wanted to...

108
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:12,504
- You cannot blame yourself.
- No, I didn't. I didn't. I set it aside.

109
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:16,926
I just moved past it.
Built a wall around it.

110
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,183
I hired somebody to close up the house
in San Francisco. I got on a plane,

111
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:28,354
went somewhere to do something.

112
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:32,733
And I did it again and again

113
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:35,402
and I ended up here.

114
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:40,032
But what you leave behind
catches up with you.

115
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:45,496
Took me a long time to learn that.

116
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:50,209
If I had stayed in the embassy,
you would have been in danger.

117
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,170
I am not moving past this.

118
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:00,886
Jack...

119
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,224
You once offered to resign.

120
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:10,688
I want you to do that.
I want you to do that now.

121
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:18,570
My duty is to prove your innocence.

122
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:20,656
It is also...

123
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,409
It is also my wish.

124
00:20:25,494 --> 00:20:26,954
Courage.

125
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:28,956
Yong qi.

126
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,439
Stop. What are you doing here?

127
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:58,152
I am the court-appointed lawyer.
This is my identification.

128
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:00,995
Why was I not notified?

129
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,997
You don't look like this picture.

130
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:06,744
Do not touch me, you pig!
Do not obstruct my investigation!

131
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:08,912
Wait!

132
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,750
Lfyou mess up the crime scene,
you will bear responsibility!

133
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:15,628
You better be careful!

134
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:51,098
Yuelin?

135
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:06,238
Why did you come here?

136
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:08,699
I am hero.

137
00:23:09,158 --> 00:23:13,370
A record of calls made to and from
her cellphone, and a printout at home.

138
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:18,083
Peng! Where did you get this?

139
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,134
My friend Mai.

140
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:22,963
She say I am the world's greatest lover.

141
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:25,257
And now I am hero, too.

142
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:30,471
Peng, how did you talk your way
past the security man outside?

143
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:35,059
I did not have to. There was nobody there.

144
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:41,482
Come, Peng, you leave now. Go on, leave.

145
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:21,689
It doesn't brighten the situation that
your attorney got roughed up last night.

146
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,276
My attorney got what?

147
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:29,071
She was a trace roughed up.
A little bruised is all.

148
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:32,032
Bruised? What...? By who?

149
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:36,203
She didn't know who. She was in the hotel
where the victim expired.

150
00:24:36,745 --> 00:24:38,212
She's just shook up.

151
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:40,714
- Stop.
- There's no stopping it now.

152
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:44,336
When you left sanctuary,
you overshot any point of return.

153
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:48,465
- What are you saying?
- You left the embassy out on a limb.

154
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:52,845
The embassy out on a limb?!
What about her?!

155
00:24:53,262 --> 00:24:57,391
- You didn't make our job any easier.
- All right, all right! Meishi!

156
00:24:57,766 --> 00:25:00,894
- What about her?
- I told you not to talk to her.

157
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,023
She's the one putting herself
on the line for me!

158
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:06,150
She's not our job.

159
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:13,490
She's out there all alone, isn't she?

160
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:20,581
Yes.

161
00:26:07,336 --> 00:26:09,088
What happened?

162
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:12,299
- I have the records.
- Are you all right?

163
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:16,637
Whoever called Hong Ling that night
also spoke to an officer - Huan Minglu.

164
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:20,314
It doesn't matter. I don't want you hurt.

165
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:24,061
I have requested his presence
in court today. It does matter.

166
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:28,107
It will matter.

167
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:34,328
Why are you doing this?

168
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:36,949
You could be taken from your house,

169
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,834
from your grandmother.

170
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:43,497
You could be sent away, or put here,

171
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:45,874
or worse.

172
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:50,045
So why are you doing it?

173
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:56,427
I'm doing this because

174
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:59,513
I do not wish to be silent any more.

175
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:26,457
Supervising judges.
They are here to monitor.

176
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,383
It means today is the day.

177
00:27:29,418 --> 00:27:32,421
Procurator General Yang,
next to General Hong.

178
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:34,757
And many of the Party elders.

179
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:41,221
This final session of our People's Court

180
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:45,225
hearing criminal case 4116

181
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:47,561
is now open.

182
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:52,358
Court is in session.
Advocate Shen Yuelin.

183
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:56,946
Presiding Chairman, I wish to summon
Huan Minglu to the witness stand.

184
00:27:56,981 --> 00:27:59,740
He has not been introduced as a witness.

185
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:02,743
He may know what happened
to Hong Ling.

186
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:07,665
- This appears to be a diversionary tactic.
- This is pure manipulation of the facts.

187
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,427
Advocate Shen Yuelin, request denied.

188
00:28:13,462 --> 00:28:17,758
I have evidence that Huan Minglu attacked
the accused and me in Dazhalan...

189
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:23,472
That is outside the scope
of this proceeding.

190
00:28:23,507 --> 00:28:26,183
And attempted to murder the accused...

191
00:28:27,977 --> 00:28:29,944
I must protest once more...

192
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:33,107
This evidence suggests
the accused is innocent.

193
00:28:33,482 --> 00:28:37,736
Advocate Shen Yuelin, there is a
procedure for bringing unrelated charges.

194
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:44,326
When will that be? After my client
is sentenced? Or after he is executed?

195
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:46,961
Answer me, please.

196
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:50,874
Enough. We must call an end to testimony
only indirectly related.

197
00:28:53,502 --> 00:28:55,504
Presiding Chairman...

198
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,798
Please sit down.

199
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:04,597
No, Presiding Chairman.

200
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,892
What did you say?

201
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:11,186
A man's life is at stake.

202
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:14,857
Not an American life. Not a Chinese life.

203
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:17,693
A man's life.

204
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:23,157
In such circumstances, what I am asking
is not an unreasonable request.

205
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:29,788
I will decide what is reasonable
and unreasonable.

206
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,208
Now sit down.

207
00:29:37,046 --> 00:29:38,881
I said sit down!

208
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:43,594
The matter is decided. The court
is not interested in such witnesses.

209
00:29:47,556 --> 00:29:48,891
I am.

210
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:53,103
- You are what?
- Interested in hearing. How about you?

211
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:58,067
I have already ruled.

212
00:30:05,074 --> 00:30:06,540
Why not?

213
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:09,370
Presiding Chairman, the vote is 2 to 1.

214
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:14,500
With the approval of the court,
I summon Huan Minglu as a witness.

215
00:30:29,598 --> 00:30:32,226
What's happening? What's going on?

216
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:42,576
I've lost the sound again!

217
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:45,906
It's okay.
The Procurator General wishes to see me.

218
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:49,118
- Why do they want you?
- Trust me. It will be okay.

219
00:30:49,153 --> 00:30:51,036
I'll be right back.

220
00:30:58,127 --> 00:30:59,628
Sit down.

221
00:31:19,648 --> 00:31:21,442
Please sit down.

222
00:31:29,658 --> 00:31:31,201
Be seated.

223
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:40,586
I declare the People's Beijing Intermediate
Court hearing criminal case 4116

224
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:43,964
once again open.

225
00:31:45,674 --> 00:31:48,302
The defence advocate is not present.

226
00:31:48,677 --> 00:31:52,389
- Nor is her legal aide.
- Then the witness should step down.

227
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:54,433
Presiding Chairman... Wait.

228
00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:56,306
Ting, ting, ting, ting.

229
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:58,145
Yes, Accused Moore?

230
00:31:58,187 --> 00:32:00,654
I believe I'm entitled
to question this witness.

231
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:04,151
Your right to question
has been previously established.

232
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:07,988
You may do so, briefly and to the point.

233
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:11,033
You do not want a cigarette?

234
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,786
I do not smoke, Procurator General.

235
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:16,622
Your father smoked.

236
00:32:33,722 --> 00:32:35,557
I cannot sign it.

237
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:39,520
Huan Minglu, at approximately 2am
on the morning of the murder,

238
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,900
records show you received a call
from an unlisted cellphone.

239
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:48,487
- You remember who made that call?
- Irrelevant!

240
00:32:49,738 --> 00:32:51,705
Proceed, Accused Moore.

241
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,287
Be direct, before even your friends, the
People's Assessors, lose their patience.

242
00:32:57,746 --> 00:33:00,207
Do you remember who called you?

243
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:02,216
It was a wrong number.

244
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:05,754
Wrong number?
Then why did the call last five minutes?

245
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:10,009
Maybe it was someone talkative,
like the accused!

246
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,805
Presiding Chairman, can you instruct the
witness to wipe the smirk off his face?

247
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,933
The time has come to end this circus.

248
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:21,186
No... He is not guilty. I will not bargain.

249
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:26,609
I cannot sign it.

250
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:30,321
Then you'll be dismissed of your duties,
and disciplined.

251
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:36,493
Accused Moore, get to the point
before I dismiss the witness.

252
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:40,497
Have you ever served as a guard
for any government official?

253
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,583
Yes.

254
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,462
Have you ever met Minister Lin Shou?

255
00:33:47,296 --> 00:33:48,262
Irrelevant.

256
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:51,842
Your behaviour is an
embarrassment to our People's Court.

257
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:54,768
No, Procurator General.

258
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:58,474
The shame is on those who abuse power
by ignoring the facts.

259
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,276
Do you know what you are speaking of?

260
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:06,398
A government official who's deliberately
obstructed this investigation

261
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:11,320
and who I believe is an accessory
to Hong Ling's murder.

262
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,697
What?

263
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:19,411
Have you ever met General Hong
or his daughter Hong Ling?

264
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:23,749
Irrelevant. I have already ruled against
this line of questioning.

265
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:28,796
Huan Minglu, as an officer in the PSB,
did you ever work in a prison such as...

266
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,592
Beyond the scope of this hearing.

267
00:34:33,627 --> 00:34:35,844
Are you finished, Accused Moore?

268
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,811
No, I am not finished.

269
00:34:37,846 --> 00:34:41,558
On April 1 Oth, did not you and
two accomplices rough me up?

270
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:45,521
- Beyond the scope of this hearing.
- Sustained.

271
00:34:45,854 --> 00:34:48,231
On April 11th,
as I was sitting in a PSB car...

272
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:50,609
...did you not attack me and
my attorney?

273
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,611
No.

274
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:53,827
Irrelevant.

275
00:34:53,862 --> 00:34:57,366
- I have not finished questioning.
- I have lost my patience.

276
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:00,828
Why will you not let this witness
answer my questions?

277
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,999
He just sits there, laughing at me!

278
00:35:05,374 --> 00:35:07,334
Laughing and lying!

279
00:35:09,378 --> 00:35:13,215
And where's my attorney now?
Was she causing too much trouble?

280
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:14,848
You are in contempt.

281
00:35:14,883 --> 00:35:19,430
Why not just let her go and stay with me,
cos you've already measured my coffin!

282
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,856
I said you are in contempt!

283
00:35:22,891 --> 00:35:26,729
You think I give a shit?!
What will do you?! Shoot me twice?!

284
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:30,357
Let my attorney go and take me!

285
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:34,653
I haven't any money, but I got some shoes!
Take my shoes to pay for the bullet!

286
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:38,907
Put a nice drop cloth down here!
Put a bullet right in the back of my head!

287
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:42,411
Do it right here! Bang!
Right in the back of my head!

288
00:35:42,446 --> 00:35:44,378
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

289
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:47,381
Do it right here, right now!
I don't wanna wait!

290
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:50,419
Your client was found
with my daughter's blood on his hands.

291
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:51,921
He was framed.

292
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:52,887
By whom?

293
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:54,882
By someone in power.

294
00:35:54,924 --> 00:35:56,800
- Enough!
- No!

295
00:35:58,052 --> 00:36:00,436
Let Advocate Shen Yuelin continue.

296
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:04,683
She is aware of the consequences to her
if the charge remains unprovable.

297
00:36:06,977 --> 00:36:09,980
What is it about where these
telephone records lead

298
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:11,999
that everyone is afraid to face?

299
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:14,260
Make all the records available.

300
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:16,663
We have lived in silence too long

301
00:36:16,698 --> 00:36:19,031
with courtrooms within courtrooms.

302
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:22,660
Why can we not conduct our affairs
in daylight?

303
00:36:23,494 --> 00:36:26,705
Why can we not trust the people
to witness them?

304
00:36:26,997 --> 00:36:29,937
Why can we not allow their voices
to be heard

305
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:32,878
rather than crushing them
into muteness?

306
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:39,426
I am willing to pay the price ifl am wrong.

307
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:43,639
Are you willing to pay the price
ifl am right?

308
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,564
We will proceed to final arguments

309
00:36:53,524 --> 00:36:55,526
if Procurator Ma is prepared.

310
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,528
Presiding Chairman...

311
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,866
As Shen Yuelin's aide,
I wish to enter new evidence.

312
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:06,120
May I have permission?

313
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:17,506
For you.

314
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:22,970
Your lawyer is very persuasive.

315
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:50,080
Presiding Chairman,
I wish to call an additional witness.

316
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:52,099
This has no precedent.

317
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:54,084
I have already ruled.

318
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,985
Presiding Chairman,

319
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:22,738
I apologise to the court.

320
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:26,867
I request the court's permission
to call an additional witness.

321
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:30,544
I have already ruled.

322
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:33,144
The foreigner is mocking our court.

323
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,709
Presiding Chairman, I implore you...

324
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:40,756
I recognise I have tried the court's
patience. It will not happen again.

325
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:47,596
This witness is in a position to have
unique knowledge of the facts of this case

326
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:55,145
Not to call him would call into question
the proceedings of this case altogether.

327
00:38:56,605 --> 00:39:00,276
Please, Presiding Chairman, please...
just one more witness.

328
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,576
Request denied.

329
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:06,615
The Procurator General has given
permission to call another witness.

330
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,081
I would like to call Minister...

331
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:25,843
Presiding Chairman,
I would like to call Lin Dan.

332
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,931
There is no foundation for this witness.

333
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:35,894
Lin Dan, please take the witness stand.

334
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,712
You made use of
the criminal code I gave you.

335
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:05,716
No, speak English. I know you can.

336
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:10,429
Congratulations on your appointment.

337
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:12,646
Principal Chinese programming partner

338
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:15,684
in HoffCo Telekomm's joint venture
with China.

339
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,227
Thank you.

340
00:40:18,187 --> 00:40:20,648
- Wonderful opportunity.
- Yes.

341
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:24,944
Would it be accurate to say that my own
company, McAndrews Communications,

342
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:29,573
- was HoffCo's principal competitor?
- I suppose so.

343
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,666
You suppose so. Okay.

344
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:37,289
Is it also accurate to say that you had
no guarantee of an equivalent... payoff...

345
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,919
"Payoff" has a negative connotation.

346
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:45,506
Let me rephrase.

347
00:40:45,714 --> 00:40:49,009
McAndrews did not offer you
an equivalent position.

348
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:53,264
It was not discussed. This has nothing
to do with Hong Ling's murder.

349
00:40:54,223 --> 00:40:56,190
It has everything to do with it.

350
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:59,979
Was my indictment responsible
for McAndrews losing that deal?

351
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,197
Why does the court permit this?

352
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,277
You used her.
You used her and sacrificed her

353
00:41:06,735 --> 00:41:09,738
to sabotage the deal your father
was completing with McAndrews

354
00:41:09,773 --> 00:41:12,741
with whom he was friends.
Could've left you out in the cold.

355
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:14,510
These are not questions.

356
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:16,210
All right, but this is.

357
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:18,747
What was your relationship
with Hong Ling?

358
00:41:18,782 --> 00:41:21,250
I had no relationship with Hong Ling.

359
00:41:21,285 --> 00:41:22,918
None at all?

360
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:26,297
Would you like to reconsider
that statement?

361
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:30,593
I knew her. I knew of her family.
But there was no relationship.

362
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:32,553
No relationship.

363
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,930
How do you explain this?

364
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:40,769
Hong Ling's locket.
She wore it the night of the murder.

365
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,147
It just turned up.

366
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:50,654
Inside

367
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,616
is a picture of General Hong.

368
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:55,492
Inside of that

369
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:59,246
there is a charming photograph
of Hong Ling

370
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:02,041
and

371
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:04,585
you.

372
00:42:04,793 --> 00:42:07,588
Accused Moore, let me see this evidence.

373
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,386
Please share that
with the People's Assessors.

374
00:42:15,304 --> 00:42:17,806
They seem a little more interested now.

375
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:19,767
Also, Procurator Ma,

376
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:22,061
you're not smiling so much.

377
00:42:24,313 --> 00:42:27,816
Why is there a photo of you and Hong Ling
inside her locket?

378
00:42:27,851 --> 00:42:29,783
There was no relationship.

379
00:42:29,818 --> 00:42:32,488
I knew her the way many men knew her.

380
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:35,824
- The way you knew her.
- But you did know her?

381
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:37,368
Answer me.

382
00:42:38,327 --> 00:42:41,997
I knew her a long time ago.
I had not talked to her since...

383
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,300
I can't remember when.

384
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:49,803
Advocate Shen Yuelin,
enter the phone records into evidence.

385
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:54,051
On the night Hong Ling was killed,
three calls were made from this number

386
00:42:54,343 --> 00:42:56,310
- and two received.
- Objection!

387
00:42:56,345 --> 00:42:59,640
The first call was from Hong Ling
early that night.

388
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:04,520
Then, around 2am, a call was made
to a number registered to Huan Minglu.

389
00:43:04,853 --> 00:43:06,320
You are out of order.

390
00:43:06,355 --> 00:43:10,484
At 3.1 Oam, a second call was made
to a number registered to Hong Ling.

391
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,904
- What do these telephone numbers...
- Sshh!

392
00:43:14,363 --> 00:43:17,574
At 5.41 am,
a call was received from Huan Minglu.

393
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:22,288
At 5.46am, a two-minute call was made
from this number to police headquarters.

394
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:27,501
- This is chaos!
- I will have you removed from the court.

395
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:30,879
- Lin Dan, do you own a cellphone?
- Yes or no?!

396
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:32,214
I do.

397
00:43:32,881 --> 00:43:35,349
Can you tell us the number of that phone?

398
00:43:35,384 --> 00:43:39,013
Mr Moore, I am not a secretary,
and I rarely call myself...

399
00:43:39,388 --> 00:43:42,266
Is the number of your cellphone 517-857?

400
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:44,858
No, it is not.

401
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:47,896
You're sure?
Even though you rarely call yourself?

402
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:49,898
Yes, I am quite sure.

403
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,943
Who do you think has that number?

404
00:43:53,402 --> 00:43:54,903
517-857.

405
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:04,163
Is the telephone number yours,
Minister Lin Shou?

406
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:14,214
It is my number.

407
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:21,639
Don't, Father.

408
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:23,898
Don't what?

409
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:26,644
I am not afraid.
Why are you afraid?

410
00:44:28,145 --> 00:44:31,065
You used your father's phone because
a minister's records can be withheld.

411
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,276
Hong Ling was supposed to set me up,
wasn't she?

412
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:38,280
Whatever it was, she changed her mind.

413
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:42,117
Then someone got in there
and drugged me with chloroform.

414
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:44,787
Isn't that what happened?

415
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:46,545
Was it...

416
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,540
Was it Huan Minglu?

417
00:44:48,582 --> 00:44:51,085
Such speculation is out of order.

418
00:44:52,586 --> 00:44:54,255
She resisted.

419
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:57,633
And she ended up dead.

420
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:03,305
He killed her, didn't he?

421
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:07,101
She got killed and I got set up!

422
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:10,104
I wasn't there. Ask him.

423
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,563
Da guar.

424
00:45:12,606 --> 00:45:14,650
What did he just say?

425
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:19,905
Da guar? That's what Hong Ling said
that night. She said it over and over.

426
00:45:21,615 --> 00:45:23,158
Da guar...

427
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:25,327
...wo men de...

428
00:45:27,621 --> 00:45:29,588
He is saying da guar.

429
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:32,918
Hong Ling said
"Da guar wo men de guanxi wan la".

430
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:38,173
It means "Big shot" - an important
businessman - "Big shot, our deal is off".

431
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:41,093
Or maybe

432
00:45:43,637 --> 00:45:45,973
"Our relationship is over."

433
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,435
Lin Dan, are you known to your friends
as Da Guar?

434
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:55,399
Are you known to your friends
as Da Guar Lin Dan?

435
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,236
The court is dismissed.

436
00:46:00,154 --> 00:46:01,655
Presiding Chairman...

437
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,621
I lost sound!

438
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:05,909
I request that my client
be released immediately!

439
00:46:07,161 --> 00:46:08,704
Da Guar...

440
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:13,334
- He said it again!
- Don't let them take you out of here!

441
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:18,672
- What's he saying?!
- Huan Minglu's the killer!

442
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:21,050
Take Huan Minglu into custody.

443
00:46:23,677 --> 00:46:25,144
Did he confess?

444
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:27,973
He just said it was all Lin Dan's idea!

445
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:30,726
Lin Dan, I will see you privately.

446
00:46:34,188 --> 00:46:38,442
Hong Ling was supposed to drug you,
then photograph you with a young girl.

447
00:46:39,693 --> 00:46:43,906
Presiding Chairman, you must reconvene
the court and set my client free!

448
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:49,161
Arrest Lin Dan instead!
Did you hear what I said?! Arrest him!

449
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:17,439
He said he's sorry he caused you
so much trouble.

450
00:47:22,736 --> 00:47:26,323
In keeping with the laws
of the People's Republic of China

451
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:30,995
the guilty parties have now
confessed to the crime

452
00:47:31,745 --> 00:47:33,914
of conspiracy and murder,

453
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:36,715
namely, the death of Hong Ling.

454
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,462
The Court thanks the Party and
government leadership involved

455
00:47:44,758 --> 00:47:47,553
for their diligence and professionalism.

456
00:47:47,761 --> 00:47:51,807
The justice accorded will be swift,
as it will be fair and impartial.

457
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:59,565
Her tragic murder would not
have been solved had it not been...

458
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:03,319
Mr Moore!

459
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,796
We never had any doubt.

460
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:18,959
We were always there for you
behind the scenes.

461
00:48:19,835 --> 00:48:22,671
You really believe this shit, don't you?

462
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:25,215
What did you say?

463
00:48:25,341 --> 00:48:27,217
I said go to hell.

464
00:48:30,846 --> 00:48:33,891
I have to take my grandmother
to the country.

465
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:37,061
You should see me. I love to be there.

466
00:48:37,353 --> 00:48:39,063
I'll miss you.

467
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:47,321
There are so many beautiful
and remarkable things here.

468
00:48:48,364 --> 00:48:49,990
Yes. I know.

469
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:58,332
When I was a child,
I would come to this park and play.

470
00:49:01,877 --> 00:49:04,505
Do you know why the bamboo is here?

471
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,633
It is waiting for the wind to touch it.

472
00:49:08,384 --> 00:49:10,636
It is filled with emotions.

473
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:16,850
Listen to the sounds
and you can feel them.

474
00:49:29,989 --> 00:49:31,657
Come with me.

475
00:49:32,491 --> 00:49:34,368
You know I cannot.

476
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:41,625
Change your mind. I know you can.
I've seen it.

477
00:49:45,004 --> 00:49:47,881
For now, especially now, I must stay here.

478
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:52,636
I am needed to make it better.
You understand?

479
00:49:55,514 --> 00:49:56,724
So

480
00:49:57,516 --> 00:49:59,810
do we just say goodbye now?

481
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,772
Like nothing has happened?

482
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:06,275
No.

483
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:10,029
Something did happen.

484
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,990
My life has changed.

485
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:15,576
You have opened me up.

486
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:22,917
You are a part of my life now, Jack Moore.

487
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,881
And I will never be the same.

488
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,300
Neither will I.

489
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:35,012
Because I hope
I'm a part of your life now,

490
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:39,350
wherever we are.

491
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,853
Wherever we are.

492
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:56,075
Zaijian?

493
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:01,038
Zaijian.

494
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,793
You should go.

495
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:07,920
Yeah.

496
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:44,832
Remember, everything is different now.

497
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:49,420
Now you have someone
on the other side of the world

498
00:51:50,629 --> 00:51:52,339
who is family.

499
00:51:57,136 --> 00:51:59,513
You will always have a family.

500
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,110
Vous aurez toujours une famille.
