(Police radio chatter)

12
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,623
Brought you some coffee.

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,790
I figured I wasn't the only one
who could use it.

00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,126
Well, thank you, partner.

00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:57,395
(Chuckles)
Well, at least we didn't dress alike.

16
00:00:57,463 --> 00:00:59,029
Well, I thought about that,

17
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:00,865
but plum doesn't really work for me.

18
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:02,867
Mm-hmm.

00:01:04,903 --> 00:01:06,437
Oh, he's running behind.

21
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,472
Jeannie's having a bad case
of morning sickness.

22
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:10,274
Just tell him to stay home.

23
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:11,742
It's just one dealer doing another.

24
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:13,577
And you know that why?

25
00:01:13,645 --> 00:01:14,711
I'm guessing because we've
worked this area

26
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:15,845
a lot longer than you.

27
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,614
Ah. Actually, he's right.

28
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:19,916
No one comes down here
except for dealers and addicts.

29
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:22,719
Well, he certainly wasn't dumped here.

30
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:24,853
Any I.D.?

31
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,522
(Peter) Uh, yeah. Driver's license.

32
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,591
Johnny Vasquez,

33
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:31,394
age 37, from Camden.

34
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,296
Did you see that sawdust on his boots?

35
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:34,430
Yeah, we're, uh, canvassing the area

36
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,865
for construction sites now.

37
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:40,202
Muzzle imprint, stellate laceration,

38
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,736
powder burns around the entry wound.

39
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:45,440
And we have a...

40
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:48,610
white gold charm
with the number 3 on it...

41
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:50,111
(Rustles paper)

42
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,079
and a New York phone number.

43
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:55,850
Hard contact,
penetrating gunshot wound...

44
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:58,251
this was an execution.

45
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,758
(Megan)
The bullet fragmented upon impact.

46
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,360
That helps explain
the raccooning of the eyes.

47
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:09,095
Ballistics is gonna have
a field day with this one.

48
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,398
I have a small laceration
in the mid-knuckle...

49
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:12,998
(Camera shutter clicks)
of the right hand.

50
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,100
(Clicks) Looks inflamed.

51
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,469
Maybe he put up a fight.

52
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,603
Not last night.
That's a couple of days old.

53
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,405
Detective, no food or drink.

54
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,406
You know that.

55
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,241
(Sighs)

56
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,576
(Sighs)

57
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,411
How's Jeannie? Feeling better?

58
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,513
If by better you mean exhausted
and peeing all the time,

59
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:28,780
she's great.

60
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,382
Is she drinking a lot of fluids?

61
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,317
Orange juice, 2 gallons a day.

62
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,819
Weight gain?

63
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:36,120
You trying to get me killed?

64
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,522
Can we stick to the business at hand?

65
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,358
(Ethan) He has receding gums,
which suggests

66
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,360
- chronic drug abuse.
- Help me roll him.

67
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,328
(Morris clears throat)
He is a drug dealer.

68
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,729
That much we know.

69
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:46,330
Spent some time in prison.

70
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:47,698
Currently on parole.

71
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:48,966
(Megan) There's some kind of white powder

72
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,034
on his posterior neck.

73
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:53,471
Looks like some hairs.

74
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:55,473
Hmm.

75
00:02:58,076 --> 00:03:00,110
Three of 'em.

76
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:01,878
Well, since he's so...

77
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:04,113
follicularly challenged,

78
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:08,485
I would assume that the hairs
are from the killer, right?

79
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:14,924
(Grunts)

80
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:17,225
Now let me guess.

81
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:19,160
You want me to run that to the lab,

82
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:20,763
put it through Codis, right?

83
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:24,800
Thank you.

84
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:26,735
I told you, detective.

85
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,239
How do you women do it?

86
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:32,573
How do we do what?

87
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:34,141
Survive pregnancy.

88
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,710
There are days that Jeannie would...

89
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:37,612
trade places with this guy.

90
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,714
Well, hopefully, she has a good partner.

91
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:41,449
(Peter) So crime lab said that

92
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:42,817
the sawdust found on Vasquez's boots

93
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:44,184
is not natural.

94
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:45,653
It's compressed.

95
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,121
And that is interesting how?

96
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:49,289
You obviously don't
spend time in dive bars.

97
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:52,659
They use sawdust to clean up spilled beer.

98
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:55,495
I know at least two near the crime scene.

99
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:58,865
(Bottles clink)

100
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:02,101
Excuse me. You know Johnny Vasquez?

101
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,704
Yeah, he's the bar manager.

102
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:06,973
He should be in around noon.

103
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,508
Afraid he won't be.
Johnny was murdered last night.

104
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:10,944
(Sighs)

105
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:11,945
Oh, my God.

106
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:13,679
Look at me.

107
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:15,781
Your eyes are glassy,
your pupils are dilated.

108
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:16,782
You're high, aren't you?

109
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,684
No.

110
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:20,053
Was Johnny your dealer?

111
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,486
Jo... Johnny's really dead?

112
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,088
It hurts, I know.

113
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:24,756
Now you're gonna
have to find another one.

114
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:27,692
Johnny looked after me.

115
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,494
He was gonna introduce me to this guy

116
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,263
that he knew in the music business

117
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,564
to start my career.

118
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:34,967
Um, I sing, you know?

119
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:36,501
Sublimely, I'm sure.

120
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,235
Now who else was he supplying?

121
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,770
I... I don't know anything about that.

122
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,272
Yep, all right.

123
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,639
No, no, I tell you what,

124
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:44,041
why don't you give us the names

125
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:45,977
of everyone you know that
had dealings with Johnny,

126
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,511
and we won't arrest you?

127
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,313
(Billiard balls clatter)

128
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:51,415
(People speak indistinctly)

129
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:54,351
Prison records show
that the wrist fracture

130
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:56,052
was from a fight nine months ago,

131
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,387
just before he got out.

132
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:58,888
Autopsy was unremarkable.

133
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,323
This guy was no drug addict.

134
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:01,824
(Ethan) Which is weird,

135
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:04,560
because prelim tox results
were positive for cannabis,

136
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,730
cocaine metabolites, and methadone.

137
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:10,699
Methadone to kick
a heroin habit he didn't have?

138
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:12,667
Check out this white powder on his neck.

139
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:14,203
It's a mixture

140
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,005
of magnesium oxide and cornstarch.

141
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,474
It's used in latex gloves
to prevent stickiness.

142
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,175
Gentlemen, we have a puzzle...

143
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:22,144
a drug dealer with drugs in his system

144
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,846
who didn't abuse drugs.

145
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:27,181
Look, I've been trying to get
ahold of his parole officer.

146
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,183
Maybe that'll shed some light.

147
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,792
Yeah.

148
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,861
Charlie.

149
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,996
The boy wonder. (Laughs)

150
00:05:43,064 --> 00:05:44,631
How long has it been, huh?

151
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:46,066
It's been too long.

152
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:47,634
Look at you in your cushy office.

153
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,136
Yeah, well, you know...

154
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:51,071
You don't miss, uh,
mold and peeling paint?

155
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,140
Well, I don't miss being shot either.

156
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:54,707
(Chuckles) Shoulda ducked, partner.

157
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:57,043
I told you that banger was our man.

158
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,411
(Chuckles)

159
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,548
(People speaking indistinctly)

160
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:04,316
So, uh... (Chuckles)

161
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:05,684
(Sets frame down)

162
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:06,985
you like it here?

163
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,987
You're stalling.

164
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,689
(People continue speaking indistinctly)

165
00:06:10,757 --> 00:06:13,991
Did you call the parole office
about a Johnny Vasquez?

166
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,065
(Indistinct conversations)

167
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,401
Megan, I don't believe
you know my old partner

168
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:24,569
from the police force.

169
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:25,903
This is Charlie Meeks.

170
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,473
Nice to meet you.

171
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,776
I wish I could say the same.

172
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:35,145
Charlie may know the victim.

173
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:38,082
We already have an I.D.
His name is Johnny Vasquez.

174
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,287
Johnny Vasquez was his cover name.

175
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:45,688
His real name is Eddie Castillo.

176
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:46,789
He was my partner.

177
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,726
He's a cop.

178
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,133

181
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,445
Okay, listen up.

182
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:08,949
Eddie Castillo was my partner.

183
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:11,152
No one's going home,
no texting your mother,

184
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,988
until we find whoever killed Eddie.

185
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:15,956
Medical Examiner's Office informs us

186
00:07:16,024 --> 00:07:18,525
we're looking for somebody
with dark brown hair,

187
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:21,394
probably near the docklands.

188
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:24,530
Anything you need to nail
this guy, you got it.

189
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:26,299
Captain says so.

190
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:27,600
So come on. (Claps hands)

191
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,302
Let's go. We're bringing this guy down!

192
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:30,703
Come on! (Indistinct conversations)

193
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:33,472
Your troops seem
a little hopped up out there.

194
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,708
Eddie was a good man, a good cop.

195
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,676
I think what she's trying to
say is, emotions are high.

196
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:40,913
You may want to remind your men
to follow procedure.

197
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,414
We know how to do our job.

198
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:43,748
How can I help you do yours?

199
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,851
Answer some questions.

200
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,853
I assume, as part of his cover,

201
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,888
that detective Castillo
had to take drugs?

202
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:52,824
Because we found several in his system.

203
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:55,359
He would do anything
to maintain his cover.

204
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:58,329
He even did a stint in prison
to build up his street cred.

205
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,864
What was Eddie investigating?

206
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:02,033
Someone was extorting the docklands.

207
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,901
They're using low-level drug dealers

208
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:06,871
to shake down bars, restaurants,
even high-level dealers.

209
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,072
Eddie set himself up as a mark.

210
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,174
Apparently, a little too well.

211
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,343
Ballistics is still working on the bullet.

212
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,078
It goes without saying,
this is our top priority.

213
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:17,214
Anything new on our end,
and you'll be the first to know.

214
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:18,581
Thank you.

215
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,016
(Sam)
So you get anywhere with that number?

216
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,351
It's just an answering machine,

217
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,719
but it does belong to a Ray Jones,

218
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,553
music producer.

219
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,421
Mm. So our poor torch singer
did have a fan.

220
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:27,522
Maybe.

221
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,225
(Cell phone rings) Ah.

222
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,426
(Sam speaking indistinctly)
Lopez, that better not be my O.J.!

223
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:33,695
You got 4 gallons in there.

224
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,232
It is for the wife. Put it away.

225
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,466
(Sam continues speaking indistinctly)

226
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,567
Put it away.

227
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,768
- Jeez Louise. Greedy.
- Thank you.

228
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:42,270
(Beeps)

229
00:08:42,338 --> 00:08:43,872
(Chuckles)

230
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,674
A unit responded to a call
from The Wonderland Bar.

231
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:51,145
Seems like our torch singer
just tried to rob the place.

232
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:53,181
<i>So, Kirsten,</i> <i>where were you going?</i>

233
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:56,049
<i>Officers said you had</i>
<i>your bags packed in the car,</i>

234
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:57,751
<i>tank full of gas.</i>

235
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:00,487
You're the ones who forced me
to dime out Johnny's contacts.

236
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:02,555
You think I'm gonna stick around?

237
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:05,325
But first a quick stop
to rob your employer.

238
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:06,960
See,

239
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:08,962
this is what we call a telling act.

240
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,298
You need money, you steal.

241
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:12,831
You need drugs...

242
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,901
You think I killed Johnny?

243
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,870
Well, I can't say it would shock us.

244
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:20,172
J... Johnny said he had

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,108
a friend in the music business

246
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,143
who would listen to my demo.

247
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:26,245
I didn't go in there to steal.

248
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,346
I just...

249
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,614
When I saw the money,

250
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,983
I... I thought it would help me
get outta here.

251
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:36,587
Start fresh, you know?

252
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:39,891
I... I couldn't help myself.

253
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:43,361
(Sam) Mm.

254
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,130
I always knew this day would come.

255
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:48,732
(Megan) It must have been very difficult,

256
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
living with the constant stress.

257
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,202
It was just the opposite.

258
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,405
It was the most liberating relationship

259
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:56,073
I've ever been in.

260
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:58,042
Nothing got swept under the rug.

261
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:01,144
We both knew that every day
together could be our last.

262
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:03,212
Did he ever talk about his work?

263
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,614
The undercover stuff? No.

264
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:08,051
Police gossip? I got an earful,

265
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:11,520
especially about Meeks.

266
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,323
With all his womanizing and drinking,

267
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,024
I always thought he'd be the one
to walk into a bullet.

268
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:19,061
(Indistinct conversations)

269
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,728
Mrs. Castillo,

270
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:22,564
we're trying to sort out
which of our findings

271
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:24,199
are part of Eddie's cover

272
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,968
and which weren't.

273
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:27,802
Uh, we have some prison records

274
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,172
that say that he broke his wrist
in a prison fight.

275
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,373
Is that true?

276
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,639
No.

277
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,541
He broke it on our first trip together,

278
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,477
snowboarding in the Poconos.

279
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,479
The doctors put him in a cast,

280
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:40,481
and he was back out on the slopes...

281
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,383
to be with me.

282
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:45,152
We also found a white gold charm

283
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,254
in one of Eddie's pockets

284
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:49,222
with a number 3 on it.

285
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,691
(Indistinct conversations continue)

286
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:53,793
My anniversary present.

287
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,896
(Sighs)

288
00:10:56,964 --> 00:11:00,300
We were supposed to have dinner,
but he never showed.

289
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,903
I think a part of me knew at that moment.

290
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:10,175
Can I have my anniversary present?

291
00:11:10,243 --> 00:11:12,644
They're sending me to a hotel
for my protection.

292
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:14,746
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be there for.

293
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:17,516
And I... I... I'd really like to have it.

294
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,651
I'm very sorry.
It's still in police evidence.

295
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:23,687
But we'll get it to you
as soon as we can.

296
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,523
(Indistinct conversations continue)

297
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,958
Okay.

298
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:29,660
(Keyboard keys clicking)

299
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:31,762
(Ethan) Okay. Check this out.

300
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,265
There's an irregular fragment
of foreign material

301
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,766
in the knuckle laceration,

302
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:38,368
and it's not biological.

303
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:40,803
You know how your case ends, right?

304
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:42,672
Yeah, we catch a cop killer.

305
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,673
Mnh-mnh.

306
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:44,674
Unemployment.

307
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:45,842
For me?

308
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,344
For all of us.

309
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,312
A cop killer case?

310
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,980
This is a lose-lose situation.

311
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:53,815
One tiny thing goes wrong,
and whose heads are gon' roll?

312
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,418
Don't let anything go wrong.

313
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:57,053
Hmm. What about the hairs on the body?

314
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,454
You got anything yet?

315
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:01,190
Yeah, Codis matched it to

316
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:02,691
a Quentin Whitsett,

317
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,693
2-time felon.

318
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:05,694
Okay.

319
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:07,296
Here's a thought,

320
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:10,031
next time you ID a cop killer,

321
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,399
lead with that.

322
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:15,836
Quentin Whitsett. That son of a bitch.

323
00:12:15,904 --> 00:12:17,939
- I take it you know the man.
- Yeah.

324
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,907
What kind of history
you got with this guy?

325
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:21,809
I busted him for possession
six months ago.

326
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,945
He filed harassment charges.

327
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:25,679
That's why I don't want you
anywhere near him.

328
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,214
Captain...

329
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:29,749
he executed my partner.

330
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,918
There is no way I'm not going.

331
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:35,722
Okay, as backup.

332
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,458
S.W.A.T. has tactical command.

333
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,560
You take whoever you need,

334
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:41,327
but you bring him in.

335
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,662
I thought we'd already ID'd Whitsett.

336
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,832
We did, but hair is
a nutritional timeline

337
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,035
that shows relative health,
sickness, and drug use.

338
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,437
So?

339
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,206
Curtis, you still have those records up?

340
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,907
According to his parole records,

341
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,441
Whitsett wasn't doing drugs.

342
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,410
As of the last one three weeks ago,

343
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,312
he tested negative 25 times.

344
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,680
So how come his hair sample
tested positive

345
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,449
for chronic drug use?

346
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,950
Here's another question for you...

347
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,385
does it strike anyone else
as odd that all three hairs

348
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,122
are 1.5 inches in length?

349
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,557
That's the sample size
the crime lab uses.

350
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,926
I knew this case was trouble. I told you.

351
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:17,928
Wait a second. So you're saying that...

352
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,296
I'm saying that they're Whitsett's hairs,

353
00:13:19,364 --> 00:13:21,232
but they had to have come
from police evidence

354
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:22,633
in a prior case.

355
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,303
And the last time
that Whitsett was busted was...

356
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,404
six months ago, arresting officer...

357
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:30,039
Charlie Meeks.

358
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:33,510
No way. You seriously think that

359
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:36,112
Charlie is framing Whitsett
for his partner's murder?

360
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,647
I think someone is,

361
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:39,649
and the police are about
to bust down Whitsett's door.

362
00:13:39,716 --> 00:13:41,584
If one of them's behind this,
what do you think

363
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,786
the chances are
that Whitsett's gonna survive?

364

368

Baker.

369

Have you got Whitsett yet?

370
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,003
They're about to take him down now.

371

- What?

372
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,674
He's being framed. Call it off.

374

Peter says call of the bust.

375
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:10,678
We can't call it off.

376

And where the hell do you get off

401
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:15,205
Hi. My idea.

402
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:16,906
Our evidence was compelling,
and as I understand it,

403
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,309
your tactical operation went to hell

404
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,844
when Meeks decided to play cowboy.

405
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,946
I put Meeks on leave.

406
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:24,546
But as for your compelling evidence...

407
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:27,349
every hair 1.5 inches
automatically came from our lab?

408
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,151
I don't think so.

409
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,886
The hair tested positive for cocaine.

410
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:32,921
And yet your own parole reports

411
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:34,990
have Whitsett clean as of three weeks ago.

412
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:36,424
He could've gotten
a haircut six months ago,

413
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:38,827
and the night of the murder,
put on the same hat or jacket.

414
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,128
Whatever. (Mutters)

415

an undercover cop.

420
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,510
Someone's setting me up.
I didn't kill anybody.

421
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:58,879
Your hair was found on the body,

00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:51,075
he got shot in the head.

496
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,776
Wait a second. Y... you were
in the area last night?

497
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:56,446
I was waiting in my car
about 5 miles away.

498
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,181
With no alibi for the shooting?

500
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:03,386
Well, how about my word?

501
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:06,489
Or does that not count with you anymore?

502
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:07,890

Ethan tied the gold filling
fragment to Meeks.

505
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:26,140
But since you already know that,

506
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,676
I'm just wondering why I
didn't hear about it from you.

507
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:30,078
I wanted to talk to my partner first.

508
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:31,145
I'm your partner.

509
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,381
He's your ex-partner.

510
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,983
And his partner is lying
in a refrigerated drawer.

511
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,285
- Charlie didn't kill him.
- Why?

512
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:38,586
Because he says so?

513
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:39,820
I spent six years
putting my life in his hands

514
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,154
on a daily basis,

515
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,457
so, yeah, because he says so.

516
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:45,492
- I know he didn't do it, Megan.
- No, you don't.

517
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,394
Get your emotions out of this.

518
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,064
If you go after Meeks, I can't
be with you on this one.

519
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,632
Okay? I'm sorry.

520
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,967
It's not about divided loyalties.

521
00:19:54,034 --> 00:19:54,934
You work for me.

522
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,236
Not on this one.

523
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,917
(Indistinct conversations)

524
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,821
(Conversations stop)

525
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:16,088
(Sighs)

526
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:17,589
I've noticed you have a knack

527
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:19,825
for rubbing people the wrong way.

528
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,693
And I've noticed that you

529
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:25,831
have got something wrong
with your department.

530
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:29,368
The gun is a match. I will give you that.

531
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,369
But don't you think it's odd
that the only evidence

532
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:33,204
that wasn't planted on Eddie's body

533
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:34,940
was the gold filling from his knuckle,

534
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:36,341
and that belongs to Meeks?

535
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,809
So now Meeks planted the gun too?

536
00:20:37,876 --> 00:20:39,244
You said it yourself,

537
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:40,778
someone's extorting the docklands,

538
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:42,814
somebody that you can't
ID or get close to.

539
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:44,916
And you think it's Meeks?

540
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:46,551
Well, I've know the man for 15 years.

541
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:47,784
And he's many things,

542
00:20:47,852 --> 00:20:49,286
but a dirty cop isn't one of 'em.

543
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:50,587
Okay, fine. Let me prove his story.

544
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:51,888
Let me examine the murder weapon.

545
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:53,157
Well, you were copied
on the crime lab report,

546
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:54,191
weren't you?

547
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:55,592
(Chuckles) Oh.

548
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,561
I am asking you to take
the tiniest leap of imagination,

549
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:59,596
and all you want to do
is pin it on Whitsett.

550
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:01,531
Hmm. I'm beginning to wonder why.

551
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,566
Well, I'm beginning to wonder
what that guy said

552
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,634
when you were running
your fingers through his hair

553
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:07,403
that's making you want to
stick your neck out for him.

554
00:21:07,471 --> 00:21:08,972
I didn't say he was a good guy.

555
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,606
I just said that you do not have enough.

556
00:21:10,674 --> 00:21:12,408
Well, I don't agree,
and neither does the D.A.

557
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:15,111
Whitsett's being arraigned as we speak.

558
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:19,181
(Indistinct conversations)

559
00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:20,915
Fine.

560
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:24,919
Then I am recommending
mandatory drug tests

561
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:26,388
for the entire department.

562
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:27,655
What drug test?

563
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,291
This is a drug-related case.

564
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,159
An undercover officer posing
as a drug dealer was murdered.

565
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:33,795
Police evidence from a prior drug bust

566
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:35,863
was planted to frame a suspect.

567
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:39,367
So everyone of your people
agrees to be tested

568
00:21:39,434 --> 00:21:41,535
or Internal Affairs will make them.

569
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:43,204
Hmm.

570
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,982
(Clears throat)

571
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,984
Please tell me you did not just threaten

572
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:01,221
an entire homicide squad
with mandatory drug testing.

573
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,355
They wouldn't let me see
the murder weapon.

574
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:03,623
You just alienated

575
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,857
the only people
who could make that happen.

576
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:06,292
Come on.

577
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,192
You don't think Internal Affairs
will take our side?

578
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,028
We don't have a side.

579
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,696
If you have to have the gun,
you send Peter.

580
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,198
I'm sure his standing over there

581
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,633
is a lot better than yours at the moment.

582
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,369
Peter and I are not...

583
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,105
quite seeing eye-to-eye on this one.

584
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,008
Peter.

585
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,608
Do I understand correctly,

586
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,244
you're refusing to work this case?

587
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,611
Would you do an autopsy on a friend?

588
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,213
I'd prefer not to.

589
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,416
Well, that's what you're
asking me to do to Meeks.

590
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,217
And if there were evidence
proving that he was innocent,

591
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,318
would you go after it?
(Elevator bell dings)

592
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,486
Of course.

593
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,720
Good. Then go get the murder weapon

594
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:37,955
from the police so we can test it.

595
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,390
Test it to prove what...
(Clicks button)

596
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,925
that Meeks planted it?

597
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,893
Peter, I'm not asking.

598
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,929
You're either on our team or you're not.

599
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,396
And frankly, I'm okay with
whichever choice you make,

600
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,165
but you're gonna make it, now.

601
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,038
(Knock on door)

602
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:56,739
(People speaking indistinctly)

603
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:58,741
Dr. Megan Hunt,

604
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:00,743
this is my wife... Jeannie Morris.

605
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,645
I have heard so much about you.

606
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,146
Oh, really?

607
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:05,347
Don't worry. I've known
Buddy long enough to know

608
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:06,482
who he likes and who he doesn't,

609
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,417
even though he complains about both.

610
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:10,053
- I'm standing right here.
- Well, it is very nice to <i>finally</i> meet you.

611
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,187
(Chuckles)
Please. Sit.

612
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:12,688
There's more?

613
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:13,956
Oh, relax.

614
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:16,491
We'll talk about you another time, Bud.

615
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,561
Jeannie, if it's all right with you,

616
00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:21,063
I would like to give you a spot test

617
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,564
for your blood sugar level.

618
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:25,200
Uh, sure. Why?

619
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:27,768
Well, Bud has mentioned
some of the difficulties

620
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:30,204
that you've been having,

621
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:32,239
and I'm sure you're being monitored

622
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:33,641
by your own doctor.

623
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:35,142
(Clicks)

624
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,276
But...

625
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:37,712
(Whirs)

626
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:40,081
have you been tested
for gestational diabetes yet?

627
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:42,349
Um, it's scheduled for my next visit.

628
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:43,883
Put pressure on that.

629
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:45,318
Well, I didn't want to alarm Bud

630
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:47,754
or you unnecessarily...

631
00:23:47,822 --> 00:23:48,755
(Beep)

632
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:50,356
but your level is high.

633
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:54,060
So... you need to make
that next visit tomorrow.

634
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:59,499
(People speaking indistinctly)

635
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:02,400

636
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:07,339
Review this later.

(Clears throat)

638
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,776
Peter Dunlop.

639
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:12,811
A fool's errand is beneath you.

640
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:15,147
And not cooperating is beneath you, sir.

641
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,414
Yeah. You know what I think?

642
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,439
I think you shouldn't have left the force.

643
00:24:19,518 --> 00:24:20,518
You ever think about coming back,

644
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,719
I can make that happen.

645
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:22,820
No, thanks.

646
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:23,955
(Chuckles)

647
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:25,322
She must be something special,

648
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,992
this Dr. Hunt.

649
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,927
What do you mean?

650
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:31,928
Well, you can't be there for the work.

651
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,430
Staring at dead bodies all day isn't you.

652
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:36,667
Staring at her on the other hand...

653
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:38,935
now that I can understand.

654
00:24:39,003 --> 00:24:41,638
What is it that you really want
to ask me, captain?

655
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:44,908
You want his gun?

656
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:47,377
Tell me about Megan Hunt.

657
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:50,512
(Knocks)

00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:53,883
As requested.

659
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,185
Thank you.

660
00:24:56,252 --> 00:24:57,720
And you didn't have to send Kate.

661
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:58,888
I didn't.

662
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,823
But now that I know,

663
00:25:00,891 --> 00:25:05,093
I... wish you'd changed your mind yourself.

664
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:07,428
You want to know who Charlie is?

665
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:09,064
Sure.

666
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:12,600
We were investigating a gang murder.

667
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:14,468
We went to interview the suspect's wife,

668
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:16,104
and the kids are out the front crying,

669
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:17,672
and I say to her,

670
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,674
"when was the last time
you saw your husband?"

671
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:21,241
And then from the garage comes this guy

672
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:23,310
with a 9-millimeter Glock.

673
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:26,413
And I take one in the shoulder,
but Charlie, he just...

674
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,481
he stands there, toe-to-toe,

675
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:30,751
and he takes this guy out.

676
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:35,788
I have not changed my mind
about anything.

677
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:39,458
(Footsteps receding)

678
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:41,493
(People speaking indistinctly)

679
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:43,596
(Sighs)

680
00:25:45,232 --> 00:25:47,834
Fire in the hole!

681
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:51,403
Ow!

682
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:53,404
Ow!

683
00:25:53,472 --> 00:25:55,607
(Ethan) Dr. Hunt, are you okay?
What happened?

684
00:25:55,674 --> 00:25:57,109
The gun bit me.

685
00:25:57,176 --> 00:25:59,177
It's called Beretta bite.
(Sighs)

686
00:25:59,245 --> 00:26:00,746
If you're not familiar
with how to handle it,

687
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:01,747
the slide can give you a nasty cut.

688
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:02,981
(Click)

689
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:05,751
That's good. Maybe it bit
our killer, too.

690
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:08,152
The crime lab went over
this gun and found nothing.

691
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,486
I didn't see anything in that report

692
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:11,088
about an ultrasonic alcohol bath.

693
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:13,891
Hey, and then maybe we could
get our neutron phase analyzers

694
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:16,526
to create a 3-d hologram
of the actual event. I mean...

695
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:18,629
Forgive him. Three double espressos.

696
00:26:18,696 --> 00:26:19,830
Caffeine calms me.

697
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:21,132
It's not working.

698
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:23,267
(Kate)
The ultrasound would lift any residual

699
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:24,934
biological material from
the weapon, including yours.

700
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:26,302
(Lopez) Good evening, doctors.

701
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,004
Sorry for the interruption,

702
00:26:28,072 --> 00:26:30,606
but here's a little gift
from the boys in blue.

703
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,143
In the spirit of cooperation,
we pooled our urine samples.

704
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,543
Oh, my God.

705
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:35,979
Congratulations...

706
00:26:36,046 --> 00:26:37,847
pissing off an entire
law enforcement agency.

707
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:40,015
We'll let you get back to work now.

708
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,124
Think I'll let you handle this one.

709
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,860
Departments at war?
Somebody's going down.

710
00:26:58,469 --> 00:26:59,869
(Megan) How's Ethan doing?

711
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:02,704
Well, he won't be welcome
back to the lab for a while.

712
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:04,706
That bottle had a whole witch's brew

713
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:07,242
of caffeine, mood elevators,
and antidepressants,

714
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,344
but no illegal drugs.

715
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:11,446
There's nothing from
the alcohol bath either,

716
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:14,483
except for my own blood and epithelials.

717
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,950
I was thinking about that.

718
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:18,452
The lab report says the gun
was boxed at the scene.

719
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,821
And ballistics would return
the gun to the same box

720
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,823
to maintain chain of custody.

721
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,824
So the box is...

722
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,326
Is also evidence.

723
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,060
Uh, relax, superwoman.

724
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,029
I already beat you to it.

725
00:27:29,097 --> 00:27:30,898
Please tell me you found
something in that box.

726
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,599
A minute piece of latex.

727
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:36,068
Uh, it must have gotten caught
in the slide of the gun.

728
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:38,271
We're running it now for biologicals.

729
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,841
This is pretty damn good, Curtis.

730
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:44,043
Who's your daddy?

731
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:52,184
I... I don't get it.

732
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:54,186
Did somebody bail me out?

733
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:56,188
Unexpectedly, the charges were dropped.

734
00:27:56,255 --> 00:27:58,691
So I'm free to go.

735
00:27:58,758 --> 00:28:00,158
Yeah.

736
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:02,894
But there's something you should
know before you leave.

737
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:05,396
Johnny wasn't who you thought he was.

738
00:28:05,464 --> 00:28:07,865
His real name was Eddie Castillo.

739
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,400
He was an undercover cop.

740
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:10,868
(Indistinct conversations)

741
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:12,670
A cop?

742
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,238
I don't believe it.

743
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:16,708
He was lying to me the whole time.

744
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:18,075
Not about everything.

745
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:19,410
(Rustles paper)

746
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,411
This is the number you were looking for.

747
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,613
Eddie had it on him when he died.

748
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:25,915
The name is Ray Jones.

749
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:28,752
He heard your demo tape. He liked it.

750
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,756
He's expecting your phone call
<i>if</i> you can get clean.

751
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:35,058
These people might be able to help.

752
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,860
(Indistinct conversations continue)

753
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:38,862
Oh, my God. Seriously?

754
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:43,233
Johnny...

755
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,535
he should be here for this.

756
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:48,537
I'll never get to tell him thank you.

757
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:50,206
Actually...

758
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:52,508
you can if you want to.

759
00:28:52,576 --> 00:28:54,609
(Indistinct conversations continue)

760
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,747
First a cop killer, now a dirty cop?

761
00:28:58,814 --> 00:28:59,948
It's making me nervous.

762
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:01,183
(Scoffs) Nervous?

763
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:02,617
You know, trying walking a urine sample

764
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:03,952
the size of a big gulp
down to the toxicology lab,

765
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,854
then we'll talk nervous.

766
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:07,990
Anything on the piece of latex
from the gun?

767
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:10,557
We found D.N.A.,
but it was heavily degraded,

768
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,726
and only a partial profile,

769
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,395
so we can't match it exactly to Meeks.

770
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,331
I thought that we find data
and then draw conclusions.

771
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:20,134
(Mouth full) What he meant was,
there is no way to exclude Meeks

772
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:22,103
unless he does something
I'm not asking him to do.

773
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,104
What is that?

774
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:24,471
Give us a blood sample

775
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,440
so we could run a full,
fresh D.N.A. profile.

776
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,809
Please.

777
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:32,045
I don't understand how this helps.

778
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:34,047
Detective Meeks,

779
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,982
if you unraveled the double helix ladder,

780
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,884
it would stretch from here
to the moon and back

781
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:39,319
over 300 times.

782
00:29:39,387 --> 00:29:42,388
However, the D.N.A.
that we found in the gun box

783
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:45,958
has just a few rungs.

784
00:29:46,026 --> 00:29:47,793
We need the whole ladder to find a match.

785
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,162
(Chuckles)
Well, are those few rungs of D.N.A.

786
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,730
you found in the box

787
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:53,732
unique enough to match only one person?

788
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,900
(Sighs)

789
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:56,802
That is a very astute question.

790
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,602
And the short answer is, yes.

791
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,371
(Chuckles)

792
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,739
Peter.

793
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:04,742
(People speaking indistinctly)

794
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,678
Trust me.

795
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:11,015
(People continue speaking indistinctly)

796
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,016
Okay.

797
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:15,518
Come on. Let's do it.

798
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:19,122
(People continue speaking indistinctly)

799
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,460
(Elevator bell dings)

800
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:24,694
So let me get this straight.

801
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:26,196
You trust him, but you don't trust me?

802
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:27,730
When that test comes back negative,

803
00:30:27,798 --> 00:30:29,065
what are you gonna say?

804
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:30,532
That I followed the evidence
where it led me,

805
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,934
with no apology.

806
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:33,102
Where's that gotten you? Nowhere.

807
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,203
All we're doing is ruling people out.

808
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:35,438
At least I'm still trying.

809
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:36,939
Oh, okay, Megan, maybe I deserve that,

810
00:30:37,007 --> 00:30:39,175
but it's a big city,
and whoever this guy is,

811
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:42,678
we're not gonna get him through
a process of elimination.

812
00:30:42,745 --> 00:30:46,681
(Indistinct conversations)

813
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:48,516
Bud.

814
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:51,386
Thank you so much

815
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:55,357
for the collective urine sample
from the precinct.

816
00:30:55,424 --> 00:30:57,959
Yours was particularly potent.

817
00:30:58,027 --> 00:30:59,427
I had nothing to do with that.

818
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:01,561
I thought it was a sick joke
and I told 'em so.

819
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,663
Right.

820
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:06,533
I just came by to thank you
for talking to Jeannie.

821
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:09,203
The doctor says she does
have gestational diabetes,

822
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,338
and that it's manageable with diet.

823
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:13,907
Oh, she'll be fine.
She just needs a little T.L.C.

824
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:15,542
Yeah, well...

825
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,611
(Exhales) I owe you.

826
00:31:18,678 --> 00:31:21,447
There is something you can do for me.

827
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:25,518
(Indistinct conversations)

828
00:31:25,585 --> 00:31:27,253
You're not gonna like it.

829
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:29,455
(Sighs)

830
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:38,796
(Indistinct conversations)

831
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:40,165
You wanted to see me?

832
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,966
Close the door.

833
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,801
(Indistinct conversations continue)

834
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,407
I just want to know where your head is.

835
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,510
I brought you the gun like you asked.

836
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,479
And?

837
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,015
Sometimes I want to strangle Megan.

838
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,750
I know the feeling. Believe me.

839
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,252
(Clears throat)

840
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:04,288
But I have never once doubted
her commitment to this job.

841
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:08,158
And I hope I never doubt yours again.

842
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,099
(Indistinct conversations)

843
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,600
(Door closes)

844
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,371
(Bell) Whitsett... I don't care
what the damn M.E. says,

845
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,572
you gotta...

846
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:24,739
Yeah.

847
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:26,141
Hey, speaking of.

848
00:32:26,209 --> 00:32:27,909
(Meeks) What's going on?

849
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:29,945
Did the test come back?

850
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:31,547
I'm cleared, right?

851
00:32:31,614 --> 00:32:32,814
Charlie Meeks, you're under arrest

852
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:34,249
for the murder of Eddie Castillo.

853
00:32:34,317 --> 00:32:36,618
You have the right to remain silent.

854
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:39,253
Anything you say can and will
be used against you... (Handcuffs clicking)

855
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:40,956
- You set me up.
- ...in a court of law.

856
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:42,057
- What the hell are you doing?
- You have the right to an attorney.

857
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:43,658
Lopez, back up. He had no choice.

858
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:45,835
This is crazy. I didn't kill Eddie!

859
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:47,395
He was my partner.

860
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:48,997
Do you understand these rights
as I've presented it to you?

861
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:50,565
I didn't do it!

862
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,639
I don't need to tell you the seriousness

863
00:32:57,706 --> 00:32:59,040
of the charges that Meeks is facing

864
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:00,274
or the trouble it's gonna be
for this department.

865
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:02,510
What I need from each of you
is a statement

866
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:04,546
describing Meeks' involvement
in this case.

867
00:33:04,613 --> 00:33:06,380
If you have no knowledge
of his involvement,

868
00:33:06,448 --> 00:33:08,716
I need you to write that down
and sign your name.

869
00:33:08,784 --> 00:33:10,451
If you were at the crime scene,

870
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,252
if you were at the raid
at Quentin Whitsett's house,

871
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,954
or you engaged detective Meeks

872
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:15,956
in a conversation about this case,

873
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:17,424
then you need to write that down

874
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:19,660
and sign your name.

875
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:22,729
We'll do this one at a time
in the interrogation room.

876
00:33:33,541 --> 00:33:34,507
(Door closes)

877
00:33:34,575 --> 00:33:36,042
What the hell are you doing?

878
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,777
You couldn't at least give me a heads-up?

879
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:39,412
It was your idea.

880
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,681
My idea? What, to arrest
Charlie for murder?

881
00:33:41,748 --> 00:33:43,583
- Peter.
- What?

882
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,451
Trust me.

883
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:47,719
Check out the monitor.

884
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:51,790
They're signing statements. So what?

885
00:33:51,857 --> 00:33:53,692
Process of elimination.

886
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,994
We bust Meeks to sell the idea
we need everyone's statements,

887
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:59,030
then bring 'em in, make 'em sign
before the camera.

888
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:00,465
Well, what are you looking for?

889
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:01,899
Beretta bite.

890
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:03,401
And you were right about Charlie.

891
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:05,503
His D.N.A. did not match the fragment

892
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:07,138
from the gun.
(Sighs)

893
00:34:07,206 --> 00:34:09,273
But it's gotta belong to somebody.
(Sighs)

894
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,891
<i>Signed, sealed, delivered.</i>

895
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:32,694
I was just hoping it wasn't
gonna be from one of us.

896
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:37,266
Uh, not so fast, detective.

897
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:38,699
What? It's all there, captain.

898
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,302
You left out the part
about killing Eddie Castillo.

899
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,271
It's you, you son of a bitch.
You're the dirty cop.

900
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:44,339
You are a disgrace.

901
00:34:44,406 --> 00:34:45,740
Captain, come on. This is crazy.

902
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:47,642
You thought you were being so careful

903
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,177
by wearing rubber gloves,

904
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:52,013
but when you planted Whitsett's
hairs on Eddie's neck,

905
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,015
you left a trace of cornstarch.

906
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:55,682
And you failed to familiarize
yourself with the gun

907
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,684
before you shot him in the head.

908
00:34:57,752 --> 00:34:58,985
That's how you got the mark on your hand.

909
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,521
I pinched it in a door.

910
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:02,289
I don't think so.

911
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:03,957
We have a D.N.A. fragment on the gun box.
(Handcuffs clicking)

912
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:05,259
A fragment?

913
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:08,128
You can always give us
a full sample if you like.

914
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:09,296
(Handcuffs jangle)

915
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:12,465
I don't think so.

916
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,133
(Sam) You know what really bugs me?

917
00:35:14,201 --> 00:35:16,269
Guys who don't clean up after
themselves in the break room,

918
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:18,604
leaving unwashed glasses
with their D.N.A. on it

919
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:20,373
still lying around.

920
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,075
I'll bet you you're sorry you
stole my wife's O.J. now, right?

921
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:26,511
(People speaking indistinctly)

922
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:27,912
Get him outta here.

923
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,416
(People continue speaking indistinctly)

924
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:33,385
(Man) Lopez, man, what's going on?

925
00:35:33,452 --> 00:35:36,221
(People continue speaking indistinctly)

926
00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:42,926
(Door opens)

927
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:44,828
(Morris) Hey, Jeannie.
(Door closes)

928
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,163
(Exhales deeply)

929
00:35:52,937 --> 00:35:54,305
(Sniffles)

930
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:04,247
So this is dinner?

931
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:05,582
(Sighs and sniffles)

932
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:06,816
(Whimpers)

933
00:36:06,883 --> 00:36:08,251
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't... don't...

934
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:09,985
don't cry.

935
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:12,222
No, I... I...

936
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:14,389
I love beans.

937
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:16,024
I just love 'em.

938
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:18,560
Don't worry about it.

939
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:20,762
First the genetic counselors
scare you to death

940
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,731
with all the things that
could go wrong with the baby,

941
00:36:22,798 --> 00:36:25,467
and now there's something wrong with me.

942
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:27,402
I am stressed out.

943
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,638
I'm practically useless at work.

944
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,372
(Voice breaking) And now I get to spend

945
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,174
the next four months praying to God

946
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:34,876
I don't deliver prematurely.

947
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,079
This is supposed to be, like,
this fresh start for us,

948
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:39,480
and instead, it's...

949
00:36:39,548 --> 00:36:40,982
it's nine horrifying months
of dodging bullets,

950
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,051
and I don't want to put this on you, but...

951
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,153
But you're going to, so...

952
00:36:48,656 --> 00:36:51,691
Every day you walk out of that door...

953
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,460
I am waiting

954
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,395
for the same phone call

955
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,265
that Eddie Castillo's wife got.

956
00:36:58,332 --> 00:37:00,533
(Sniffles and exhales)

957
00:37:09,676 --> 00:37:11,043
(Whispering) Shh.

958
00:37:11,111 --> 00:37:12,311
(Sniffles)

959
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,080
Shh.

960
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,715
Shh.

961
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:19,818
(Exhales deeply)

962
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:21,219
(Door opens)

963
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,133
Sometimes, you know, I wondered,

964
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:38,435
how well I knew the real Eddie when...

965
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:40,470
he was so good at pretending
to be someone else.

966
00:37:40,538 --> 00:37:43,107
But then I'd catch a look,

967
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:46,410
see him smile, watch him sleep, and...

968
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:49,280
and I'd feel his essence, but...

969
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:52,182
I don't feel anything now.

970
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:54,717
He really is dead.

971
00:37:58,522 --> 00:38:00,890
There is a poet named...

972
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,425
Thomas Campbell

973
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:04,194
who said...

974
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:09,331
"To live in hearts we leave behind"

975
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:11,633
"is not to die."

976
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:17,639
Here's your anniversary present.

977
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,845
(Crying)

978
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:32,954
(Laughs)

979
00:38:34,957 --> 00:38:37,391
(Cries)

980
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:41,828
(Cries)

981
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:48,835
I'm gonna miss you so much.

982
00:38:48,903 --> 00:38:51,738
(Crying)

983
00:38:56,276 --> 00:38:59,245
(Guitar playing ballad)

984
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:02,147
(Indistinct conversations)
