1
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,202
Read this, puta.

2
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,486
Thanks.

3
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,871
Want a date, honey?

4
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,339
Money, money, money.
Check this out.

5
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,908
You want to stop?

6
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,682
No.

7
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,159
Tubes, my boy, what's up?

8
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,461
What?

9
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,463
What's taking so long?

10
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,465
It's gonna take a few minutes.

11
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,500
We ain't got a few minutes.
We got to get busy.

12
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,736
Why don't you do what you
got to do so we can get busy?

13
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,371
Do me a favor. Here.

14
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,972
Calm down. Relax.

15
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,240
I'm gonna show you
how to do this.

16
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,868
I'm gonna show you how
to test this. Like that.

17
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,215
Right. It's dope.

18
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,149
It's dope, Tito.

19
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,384
You ever get the feeling
you was being watched?

20
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,448
Damn.

21
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,464
You got any soda, man...

22
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,466
like some root beer
or something?

23
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,968
I hurt my leg playing ball.

24
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,196
I got these aspirins
I want to take.

25
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,640
Now, what the fuck is he...

26
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,509
Tell him to turn this shit off.

27
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,945
What kind of help you got?
Watching cartoons?

28
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,436
Tell my man to turn the tv
off and get me a soda.

29
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,118
And make sure it's cold.

30
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,425
I like my shit cold,
especially when I play ball.

31
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,585
You play ball, Tito?

32
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,163
You don't look
like you play no ball.

33
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,864
But nice gloves.
I like those.

34
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,366
Hey, Jump.

35
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,367
What's up?

36
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,501
It's copacetic.

37
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,036
Now maybe you satisfied.

38
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,272
No. Maybe now I want
to check out another one.

39
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,974
What the fuck I look like,
Joe Neckbone?

40
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,709
Trust ain't one
of my stronger qualities.

41
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,710
You know what I'm saying?

42
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,844
You fucking disrespect me.

43
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,945
I guarantee the shit.

44
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:13,946
To hell with testing.

45
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,710
Let's get to the large
plus ten percent.

46
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,188
Did he say ten percent?
Wait a minute, Tito.

47
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,190
We had a deal. What's up?

48
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,359
What ten percent
you talking about?

49
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,361
Transportation costs, amigo.

50
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,062
I got expenses.

51
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,163
Well, take the train...

52
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,531
if you got expenses
in transportation.

53
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,533
Why you want to be greedy?

54
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,968
You fuck the sucking greed.
That's our price.

55
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,804
No one else even talks to you
goddamn motherfucking coños.

56
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,203
Now take it or leave it.

57
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,575
Why you want to talk
to me like that?

58
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,599
Take it or leave it?

59
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,274
Take it or leave it?

60
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,215
I take it.

61
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,520
'Cause I like you,
I'm gonna take it.

62
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,511
Pack the shit up.

63
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,752
You in power, Tito.

64
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,931
You the king.

65
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,809
Where's my soda?

66
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,868
What the fuck is this?

67
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,462
They're for
the bullet holes, puta.

68
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,907
Room service, motherfuckers!

69
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,722
There's somebody
here to see you.

70
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,983
What's in the cup?

71
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,829
Root beer.

72
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,732
You want some?

73
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,677
There's some things I don't do.

74
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,945
Welcome back home, Frank.

75
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,207
Check him out.

76
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:53,953
Congratulations, Frank.

77
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,954
Check him out.

78
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
Congratulations, man.

79
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,723
Them Colombian motherfuckers...

80
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,725
they took permanent vacation
in hell...

81
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,885
if you know what I mean.

82
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,396
Wow. I must have been
away too long...

83
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,489
because my feelings are dead.

84
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,765
I feel no remorse.

85
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,662
It's a terrible thing.

86
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,041
I heard being in jail makes
you feel like that.

87
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,476
I got a present for you.

88
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,477
Check it out.

89
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,739
They were King Tito's...

90
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,208
but he don't need them
where he is now.

91
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,819
I thought maybe you would
donate them...

92
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,787
to a clothing drive
or something.

93
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,961
Having a good time,
huh, Jump?

94
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,862
I been waiting years for this.

95
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,095
Emilio Zapa sends his regards.

96
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,599
You know how I love money.

97
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,599
Well, help yourself.

98
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,916
Is the meeting set with Dalesio?

99
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,184
Downtown.

100
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,386
You need to let me
bust a cap...

101
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,488
in that moonheaded
motherfucker's ass.

102
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,522
Word!

103
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,857
He's a fucking glitter boy.

104
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,592
He's looking
to get sprayed, laid...

105
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,161
played, and slayed.
Know what I'm saying?

106
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,719
I heard that.

107
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,670
You gonna come down, say hello?

108
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,273
You hobnob with them homos,
you want to.

109
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,876
I'm going downtown,
find me a girl...

110
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,138
get my knob polished.

111
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,569
Time for a real party.

112
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,516
Jim.

113
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,186
How come you never
came to see me?

114
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,322
Who wanted to see you in a cage?

115
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,398
Of course.

116
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,875
Later.

117
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,568
Champagne. Let's break out.

118
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,295
It's King Tito's.

119
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,853
King Tito's gloves.

120
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,536
It's a good thing he's dead
'cause I'd take that glove...

121
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,731
I'd wrap it right round his...

122
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,800
Sex.

123
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,035
And it's how much?

124
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,471
Wait for the paperback,
and you can get it.

125
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,607
It's too fucking much for me.

126
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,975
You should read that book, Joey.

127
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,042
Why?

128
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,044
Because I think you
might learn something.

129
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,613
What?

130
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,448
How to be good?

131
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,817
Joey, just don't say a word, OK?

132
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,885
Why not?

133
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,553
Because I don't want
you to say anything.

134
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:15,888
But we're going home, right?

135
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,753
I know. I'm tired already.
Where is he?

136
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,163
Welcome home, Frank.

137
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,559
Good to see you.

138
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,651
Nice to see you.

139
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,566
Thanks for everything.

140
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:05,797
To freedom.

141
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:07,805
Come on.

142
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,480
Bill, nice to see you.

143
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,482
Bill, Charlie, you know Frank.

144
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,617
How are you?

145
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,618
Good of you to come.

146
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,953
Judge, how are you?
Nice to see you.

147
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,955
Listen, I want to
introduce you to...

148
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,422
I'm gonna say hello
to your junior partner.

149
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,985
Hiya, Frank.
Good to see you.

150
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,972
You should
be more careful...

151
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,140
of the affairs
you attend, counselor.

152
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,977
One is known by
the company one keeps.

153
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,144
Ain't that right, Joey?

154
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,646
Pete, how are you?

155
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,314
Hey, Frank. Welcome home.

156
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,975
Hello, Frank.

157
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,022
Welcome back.

158
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,923
You know everybody here,
I think.

159
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,897
Pete, how's the family...
Brian, Dennis?

160
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,332
Better than when
you left town, Frank.

161
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,500
They're all working.

162
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,835
How about you?

163
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,496
Back from the dead.

164
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,174
Frank White. I've heard
a lot about you...

165
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,677
and it's all bad.

166
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,813
Don't believe everything that
Pete writes in the columns...

167
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,542
because... well...

168
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,353
I've been reformed.

169
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,422
A lot of people
will be happy to hear that.

170
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,424
Huh, Pete?

171
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,120
What can we expect from
the reformed Frank White?

172
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,094
I want to be mayor.

173
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,740
Thinks I'm kidding.

174
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,980
But first, I want
to talk to Arty Clay.

175
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,548
Why don't you relax?

176
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:59,051
We're supposed to be having
a good time here.

177
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,819
Tell him I got things
on my mind.

178
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,187
I want to
talk them over with him.

179
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,211
The guy's a fucking animal.

180
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,423
He ain't gonna meet with you.

181
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,448
Maybe you can do one
of his lieutenants at best.

182
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,618
Tell him...

183
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,798
Frank White wants to talk
business with him.

184
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,467
Just tell him
that all I want to know...

185
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,798
is where and when.

186
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,573
You know, counselor,
they did a wonderful job...

187
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,574
with this gentleman.

188
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,201
He's better than ever.

189
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:26,978
If you'll excuse me...

190
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,548
I'll see you people
in a little while...

191
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,243
if I'm still around.

192
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,189
Look at you.

193
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,220
Look at you.

194
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,368
What's the matter?
You're not glad to see me?

195
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,029
You belonged
where they put you.

196
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,140
Maybe this time you'll
stay out of trouble.

197
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,876
That depends on how
good my lawyers are.

198
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,478
I thought people like you...

199
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,412
didn't believe
in the legal process.

200
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,642
I thought people like me
were the legal process.

201
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,022
You know what?

202
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,099
You know what
I'd like to do to you?

203
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:28,738
I would like to take
you on the subway.

204
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,753
What can I do for you?

205
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,458
Tell Arty
I need to speak to him.

206
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,265
Wait here.

207
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,254
Sure.

208
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,272
There's some yarm out there
that wants to talk to you.

209
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,293
Ace is still the better.

210
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,328
Arty, you're still...

211
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,522
What's happening here?

212
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,090
You got aces?

213
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,628
Two hundred.

214
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,472
Two hundred?
I got to see your two.

215
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,474
All right. One shot.

216
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,741
Last ticket.

217
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,976
Johnny, give me
something good here.

218
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,144
Take it easy.

219
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,476
Arty. Gentlemen.

220
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,682
- Who goes?
- Arty.

221
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,460
I bet two hundred.

222
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,461
Go ahead.

223
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,964
I got a message
from Frank White.

224
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,454
He wants to sit down.
He wants to talk.

225
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,227
You tell him I don't
talk to nigger lovers.

226
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,673
Let's go. What's down?

227
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,742
He says he's got things
on his mind...

228
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,977
that he wants to discuss
with you...

229
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,604
and he wants to know where
and he wants to know when.

230
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,649
You tell him in fucking hell,
that's where.

231
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:18,850
He's gonna wish his lawyer...

232
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,485
left him fucking
the Sambos in the joint...

233
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,487
when I get through with him.

234
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,456
I was making money
off them Colombians.

235
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,923
That's right.

236
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,350
If that's what you want me
to tell him, I'll tell him.

237
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,722
It ain't clear enough?

238
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,067
You tell
that son of a bitch...

239
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,969
he made a big
mistake with me.

240
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,604
And you tell him
something else!

241
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,062
This is what
Arty Clay has to say.

242
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:47,511
You tell him personally
from me!

243
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,413
Stay outta here!

244
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,054
Come on, sit down.
Let's go.

245
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,817
Come on, you go.

246
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,511
I missed you.

247
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,264
Your watch and your wallet,
blood.

248
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,635
How about that?

249
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,025
Come by the Plaza Hotel.

250
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,893
I got work for you.

251
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,861
Ask for Frank White.

252
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,432
Come on.

253
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,180
It's up to me, right?

254
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,580
You guys are in trouble.
I bet two hundred.

255
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,520
Hurry up, will you?

256
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,022
I'm down a lot of money here.

257
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,489
Let's play cards.

258
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,023
I got your message, Arty.

259
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,872
You stupid son of a bitch.

260
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,574
You running games here?

261
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:31,176
I want to play.

262
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,745
Sure, Frank, play.
Bring your friends.

263
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,747
I want to play with Arty.

264
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,749
Come on.
Let's go, will you?

265
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,307
Jump deals.

266
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,611
Blackjack. House out.

267
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,426
You got some balls coming here.

268
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,859
Pick up the card.

269
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,474
Come on.
Pick up the card.

270
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,941
Pick it up.

271
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,190
From here on, nothing goes down
unless I'm involved...

272
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,283
no blackjack,
no dope deals, no nothing.

273
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,163
A nickel bag
gets sold in the park...

274
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,562
I want in.

275
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,169
You guys got fat while everybody
starved on the street.

276
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,738
It's my turn.

277
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,277
You think you're gonna
live long enough...

278
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,711
to spend that money,
you fucking hump?

279
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,824
If any of you...

280
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,497
are tired of
getting ripped off...

281
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,964
by guys like that...

282
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,006
You come with me.

283
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,809
I'm at the Plaza Hotel.
You're welcome.

284
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,310
You're all welcome!

285
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,073
To join!

286
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,677
Man or ghost,
I'll kill you again.

287
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:24,369
Ed.

288
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,975
Aiesha, how you doing?

289
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,549
I'm very upset about
what happened today.

290
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,117
I told you, Frank,
I did the best I could...

291
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,419
and you know that.

292
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,586
Edward.

293
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,588
I told you I tried
to make it work, Frank.

294
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,090
Hello, counselor.
How are you?

295
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,258
Alisha, how are you?

296
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,592
Aiesha.

297
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:45,029
The city councilman
was just explaining to me...

298
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,131
why that hospital
in the South Bronx...

299
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,367
didn't survive
the fiscal cut this afternoon.

300
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:52,370
I'm telling him
about how disappointed I am.

301
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,138
I was explaining to Frank...

302
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,807
that there simply wasn't
money in the budget...

303
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,841
to fund that facility.

304
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,443
In a city
of twelve million people...

305
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,544
I find that hard to believe.

306
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,512
I hoped we could do better.

307
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,181
I hoped so, too, Frank...

308
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,917
but there simply was
no money in the budget.

309
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,251
If you think it's so easy...

310
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,980
why don't you try
funding it yourself?

311
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,447
Maybe I will.

312
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,655
How about sixteen million
by the end of the quarter?

313
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,130
Tell your friends
they'll have the money.

314
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,470
Counselor, you're
this man's legal advisor.

315
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,972
Why don't you explain to him
the hard financial facts...

316
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,640
of running a municipality.

317
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,476
I know what this city needs...

318
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,977
and privileged districts...

319
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,280
shouldn't be the only ones
with hospitals.

320
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,982
Forget it, Frank.

321
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,418
I want that place kept open.

322
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,552
Forget it.

323
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,854
The city can't afford it
and neither can you.

324
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,189
The city doesn't know
where to look for the money.

325
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,991
Let me give you some
very expensive advice...

326
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,186
go someplace where
you can stay out of trouble.

327
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,930
I thought
that's what I pay you for.

328
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,315
Hello, Frank.
I want to talk to you.

329
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,817
I don't think so.

330
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,987
Come on. O'Neill can wait
for two old friends, can't he?

331
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,889
I'm not your friend.

332
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,891
Come on, Frank. We missed you
while you were away.

333
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,559
Thought about you, too.

334
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,061
I heard a rumor about you.

335
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,228
What's that?

336
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,396
I heard you got AIDS...

337
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,731
getting dicked
up your ass in prison.

338
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,899
That's what I heard.

339
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,701
I thought about you every time
I jerked off, dickhead.

340
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,070
Why don't we
just take this outside.

341
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,073
Next time, wear a tie.

342
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,307
Get Abe.

343
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,774
Here we go.

344
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,214
Excuse us, folks.

345
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,681
Excuse us. Easy, easy.

346
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,958
What the hell is this?

347
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,359
We're taking him in
for questioning.

348
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,361
On what grounds?
This is harassment, Bishop.

349
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,830
You're welcome to come along.

350
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,560
Even your client's
got a right to counsel.

351
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,441
Come on. Get out!

352
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,941
Look inside.

353
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,407
Let's go.

354
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,254
What's that?

355
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,755
You tell me.

356
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,090
I don't know.

357
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,324
This is the only chance
you get, White.

358
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,392
What's it gonna be?

359
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,393
Are you arresting me?

360
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,394
Oh, fuck. Here we go.

361
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,395
If so, do it.

362
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,397
If not, I got people
waiting for me.

363
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,331
Shut the fuck up, motherfucker!

364
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,970
Hey, Frank.

365
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,172
All right, that's it.

366
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,673
Come here, Frank.

367
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,175
Here, Frank, meet somebody.

368
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,442
Meet somebody, huh?

369
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,977
Piece of shit!

370
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,479
That's it!

371
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,514
I'll kill the motherfucker!

372
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,816
No, I'm gonna cap him.
Let me cap the mo...

373
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,977
Get in the fucking car!

374
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:32,823
This how you do things?

375
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,259
I know what you're up to, White.
Forget it.

376
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,061
I'm gonna make you and
your friends disappear...

377
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,029
long before that.

378
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,834
Welcome home, fuck face.

379
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,337
Gilley, get in the fucking car.

380
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,339
Last fucking time, you fuck.

381
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,008
We're onto your fucking ass.

382
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,976
Give your friends that message.

383
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,490
Ladies and gentlemen...

384
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,858
can I have
your attention, please?

385
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,849
The best man
has something to say.

386
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,864
First of all, I'd like
to thank Tommy Flanigan...

387
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,767
for being the only black male
at an Irish wedding.

388
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,868
Are you comfortable, Tom?

389
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:51,869
I'm from the South.

390
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:52,870
Are you comfortable?

391
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,105
Real comfortable.

392
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,573
All my buddies here,
all my brothers.

393
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,767
He's sweating.

394
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,244
Joe Mulligan,
father of the bride.

395
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,746
Come on up here, Joe.

396
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,548
Joe provided these
lovely decorations for us.

397
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,913
Where'd you get these, Joe,
an A.A. Meeting?

398
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,819
Not only that, he paid
for the whole thing.

399
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,755
The whole two hundred dollars.

400
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,291
Joe, by the way,
put your shotgun away.

401
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,451
The test came back negative.

402
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,465
Roy Bishop, do I detect
a little Afro Sheen...

403
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,763
on that unusually
wavy hair of yours?

404
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,806
Tip... Kathy...
to the finest couple...

405
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,874
I've ever had
the pleasure to know.

406
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,275
Join me, folks.

407
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,743
They're the only couple...

408
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:33,971
that's still together
in this neighborhood.

409
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,415
I wish you health, wealth...

410
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,518
happiness,
a lot of babies, no cops.

411
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,787
We don't need no more
degenerate donkeys...

412
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,388
running around with guns.

413
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,890
All bullshit aside...

414
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,892
and may I speak
for everybody...

415
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,627
we love you.
God bless.

416
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,128
Hear, hear.

417
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,630
Here's to youse.

418
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,731
How did I do?

419
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,166
I'm proud of you.

420
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,635
Hey, Father,
thank you for coming.

421
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,001
Let's get Father laid.

422
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,510
Give me a real drink.

423
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,512
Get Dennis
a drink over here.

424
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,945
Get the house a drink.

425
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,473
The bar's not open now.
You pay.

426
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,566
That's my wife!

427
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,505
It was a fucking joke!

428
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,340
Would you relax?
Virginia, come here.

429
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,509
Come here. Excuse me.

430
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,010
Tip, take a tip.

431
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,512
Gilley's after your wife.

432
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,514
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

433
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,015
Hell, it's more than obvious.

434
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:48,886
He'll find the vampire marks
sunk into her neck.

435
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,218
Get outta here!

436
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,160
What's what, my friend?

437
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,661
How you doing?

438
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,163
What's what? Terrific.

439
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,165
Yeah? How come
you're not dancing?

440
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,135
I'm gonna leave that
to the father of the bride.

441
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,636
Are you sure you're gonna
make it through the night?

442
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,405
Aw, shit. You kidding?

443
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,939
I'm the one that
needs the honeymoon.

444
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,407
All they do is stay in bed
all fucking night.

445
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,578
Do me a favor.

446
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,280
Give this to the kids.

447
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,481
I got a million things to do.

448
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,616
Wish them my love.

449
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,117
You sure you won't come in?

450
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,585
Nah. I got
a million things to do.

451
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,586
I'll see you during the week.

452
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,455
You take it easy.

453
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,922
Take care, Pops.

454
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,357
You can tell your boyfriend
to forget about it.

455
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,794
He ain't got enough money.

456
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,295
Maybe he'll surprise you.

457
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,729
I don't like
his fucking surprises.

458
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,025
He's got a lot of nerve
even sending you here.

459
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,612
You could step
all over that shit...

460
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,081
and still get
a hundred twenty a gram.

461
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,481
And I got
two hundred twenty pounds of it.

462
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,854
Comes to fifteen mil,
street value.

463
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,813
And I want guarantees
nobody in this town can give.

464
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,425
Especially him.

465
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:16,233
Look, Larry, why don't you
set the terms?

466
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:18,869
I'll go back, and I'll tell
Frank.

467
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,872
If you two see eye to eye,
we'll make a deal.

468
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,109
If not, everybody goes
their own way still friends.

469
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,577
What do you say?

470
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,704
That cocksucker
ain't got no friends.

471
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,581
And before I even think...

472
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,083
of sitting across
some table with him...

473
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,085
he got to know one thing...

474
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,815
I ain't no fucking greaseball
named Arty Clay.

475
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,391
You got it.

476
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,261
And he pays for your cut.

477
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,802
Why don't you stick around?

478
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,532
I got "Frankenstein"
coming on next.

479
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,312
Stop fucking with my lady.
You know what I'm saying?

480
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,948
I told him, stop fucking
with my bitch.

481
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,883
And when he started
crying like a bitch...

482
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,085
he got fucked like a bitch.

483
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,211
You know what I'm saying?

484
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,324
We're gonna shoot the bitch!

485
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,758
We'll just shoot the bitch!

486
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,760
Hey, Joe. What you want?

487
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,062
Don't forget the hot sauce.

488
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,263
You want white meat, right?

489
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,821
- No dark meat!
- No problem.

490
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,459
Don't shoot me!

491
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,845
Can I help you?

492
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,880
Can you help me?
Yeah, you can start...

493
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,350
by giving me fifteen pieces
of chicken, motherfucker.

494
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,352
Mix it up. I want barbecue,
and I want crispy.

495
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,319
You getting this all down?

496
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,956
I want six pieces of corn...

497
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,627
and I want, uh... yeah,
give me eight spareribs...

498
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,391
and give me
twelve pieces of shrimp.

499
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,434
Some onion rings.

500
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,336
You want tartar sauce
or ketchup on those?

501
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,871
I want tartar sauce.

502
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,773
You got any potato salad?

503
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,108
No, we ain't got potato sal...

504
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,376
Get away from the games!
All right?

505
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,741
You ain't got no money.
Just get away from the games.

506
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:09,647
What the fuck
is the matter with you...

507
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,781
talking to them like that?

508
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:11,849
They ain't got no money.
Is that it?

509
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,850
Yeah, that's it.

510
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,219
Make sure you get my food,
get it now...

511
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,788
and don't be drooling on it.

512
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,289
And I better not get
none of that cat.

513
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,449
I want chicken.

514
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,129
Here you are.

515
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,131
Y'all go play the games.

516
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,393
No offense, ma'am...

517
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,658
but you make sure
they get what they want.

518
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,073
Go ahead.

519
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,802
Y'all go play them games. Hear?

520
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,280
What's happening
with the food?

521
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,549
What's up? I ain't got
all day, you know.

522
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,484
That'll be 56.70, total.

523
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,187
Did I say I was finished?
I want something to drink.

524
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,955
Maybe I want some birch beer.
You got birch beer?

525
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:52,956
No, we don't have
no birch beer.

526
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:53,991
You don't even know
what that shit is.

527
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,359
You got any root beer?

528
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,493
We ain't got no root beer,
either.

529
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,262
- How much is this?
- 56.90

530
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,664
56.90? Fuck you very much.

531
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,166
Hey, scumbag, guess what?

532
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,667
You're under fucking arrest.

533
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,135
Yeah, motherfucker?
How about that?

534
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,900
Police!

535
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,711
It's all over, Jimmy.

536
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,646
You're under arrest
for the murder of Miguel Mata...

537
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,282
Salvador Tito,
and Rafael Santodomingo.

538
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,017
You have the right
to remain silent.

539
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,452
Shut the fuck up.

540
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,554
What's this?
Did you use this on Mata?

541
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,956
Yeah, same one
I'm gonna use on you, punk.

542
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:28,258
Laugh now, motherfucker,
but for the rest of your life...

543
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,493
you gonna be somebody's bitch.

544
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,828
Some motherfucker named Bubba.

545
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:31,895
But you're
a motherfucking bro!

546
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,464
Don't you slap me,
motherfucker.

547
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,598
I'm gonna slap
the black off you.

548
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,066
Take the cuffs off,
you motherfucker!

549
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,267
I'm gonna finish
his ass off!

550
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,670
This is the happiest day
of my life. You know why?

551
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,405
'Cause we got a real,
live, talking witness.

552
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,840
I don't leave no witnesses!

553
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,705
Oh, yeah, motherfucker?
Well, you must be getting old.

554
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,911
I'll teach you
to fuck with my friend.

555
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,879
I'm gonna fuck you up!

556
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,070
Without private assistance...

557
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,231
everything we've seen
will close down.

558
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,042
I can't stress enough how much
your help could mean...

559
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,744
to the thousands of families...

560
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,507
that depend on us
for medical care.

561
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,907
Please, just look around.

562
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,285
Look, Larry...

563
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,265
the most anybody's
gonna give you for your stuff...

564
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,562
is thirty grand a key.

565
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,868
That's about
three million dollars...

566
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:45,969
on a bulk sale.

567
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,971
So whoever buys it's
gonna turn around...

568
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,606
cut it, bag it,
and sell it on the street...

569
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,675
for a hundred twenty,
a hundred fifty a gram.

570
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,478
That's a hundred fifty thousand
dollars a key...

571
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,413
five times what they paid you.

572
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,983
So now your quintal's worth
fifteen million dollars...

573
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,487
a markup of
eleven million something...

574
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,655
that you get no part of.

575
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,690
I know you don't
have the manpower...

576
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,660
to peddle
the uptown streets, but I do.

577
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,597
You put up the stuff,
I put up the guys to sell it.

578
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,622
I take the heat
and the risk...

579
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,168
if there is any.

580
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,503
We divide the difference...

581
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,206
setting aside something
for places like this.

582
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,639
What do you say?

583
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,713
If I was into
socialized medicine...

584
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,840
I would have stayed
in the Peking province.

585
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,174
I want cash for my goods.

586
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,688
How much?

587
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,690
Three million up front...

588
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,191
like you said...

589
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,695
with another half a mil
when you unload it.

590
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,697
That's a lot of money.

591
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,959
I got a lot of shit.

592
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,190
Make up your mind.

593
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,273
You know something, Frank?

594
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:59,509
This conversation
made me realize...

595
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,670
just how fucking crazy
you really are.

596
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,629
It's all set up.

597
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,197
I don't think you should
go down there alone.

598
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,433
I don't trust
that crazy Chinese guy.

599
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,601
Know what I mean?

600
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,769
It's Enrico Mata.

601
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,237
They got him recovering
in a hospital somewhere...

602
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,239
with a police guard
around him 24 hours.

603
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,208
He's agreed to testify
for them in court.

604
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,210
They got Jump cold
this time, Frank.

605
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,445
It's Murder-One.

606
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,213
Did Abe get them set bail?

607
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,715
A million dollars apiece.

608
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,717
So go sign him out.

609
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,252
Posting that kind
of money's gonna raise...

610
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,720
more problems
than it solves, Frank.

611
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,255
Also, I want you to get Abe...

612
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,723
to talk to some of
those friends of his...

613
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,325
see if they can't get
this cop transferred...

614
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,726
or retired or something.

615
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:25,228
I want him out of my way.

616
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,630
He's chief
investigating officer...

617
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,698
on a multiple homicide.

618
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,166
It's stupid
to even think about it.

619
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,133
Ask him...

620
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:37,205
before I blow Bishop's brains
all over his fucking wing tips.

621
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:42,346
Get some guys and pick him up.

622
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,007
You got it, Frank.

623
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,325
Hope you had a good time.

624
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,597
My old man's back.

625
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:01,655
That's right.

626
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,904
Captain Crunch
and that doughnut crew is here.

627
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:10,240
Yo, fellas, what's up?
Long time no see.

628
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,508
Bishop, we having
a party downtown.

629
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,577
Why don't you bring Howdy Doody
and the Chocolate Wonder?

630
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:14,778
I hear your mother's
gonna be there.

631
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,513
We having a real
good time down there.

632
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:17,480
You know what I'm sayin'...

633
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,097
Give me some.

634
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,592
Black man.

635
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,232
Some flowers for your witness.

636
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,412
Jimmy, we got business to do.

637
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,647
We got business to do.

638
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,516
Get some cheap ones.

639
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,143
And you can kiss my ass, too.

640
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:56,520
I'll see you downtown.

641
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,487
You'll be all right?

642
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:02,491
What?

643
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,419
Proud of yourself, counselor?

644
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,067
If you got a problem,
take it to the judge.

645
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,193
Come on! Let's go!
