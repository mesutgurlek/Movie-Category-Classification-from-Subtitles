1
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,241
LAGU berkumandang...
# Bring out what's been in me #

2
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,799
# Far too long #

3
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,301
# And, uh... #

4
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:54,639
# That's all I've been dreaming of #

5
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,166
# Do me, baby #

6
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:00,338
# Like you never done before #

7
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:03,758
# Ahh, ooh, give it to me #

8
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,833
# Till I just can't take no more #

9
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:12,884
# Come on, do me, baby,
like you never done before #

10
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:16,815
# Ahh, ooh, I want you, babe #

11
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:20,271
# Like I just can't take no more #

12
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:23,127
# Ooh, ahh #

13
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:26,608
# Hooh-ooh ooh! #

14
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:29,683
# Ooooooooh! #

15
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:31,224
Whoo!

16
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,271
What the hell are you doing?

17
00:01:32,314 --> 00:01:33,721
What the hell?!

18
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:35,891
I didn't tell you to go!
Goddamn!

19
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,358
- It was him!
- It was you!

20
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,339
Shit! Oh, man!

21
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:42,287
Ain't nobody listenin' today.

22
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,810
Ladies, you just dented
a '81 Cutlass Supreme.

23
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,541
I need to see your license
and registration.

24
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:49,138
Brother, you OK? You cool?

25
00:01:57,402 --> 00:01:59,923
Ten minutes.
Doors open on my signal.

26
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:01,391
I'm glad you're here, Lee.

27
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:03,736
I always feel better
with you watching my back.

28
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,837
I'm just doing my job,
Mr. Ambassador.

29
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,730
Stay close today, Lee.

30
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,875
We're making history.

31
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,408
This is bullshit!
Do you know who I am?

32
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,556
My family owns
half of Rodeo Drive.

33
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,089
Do you know who I am?

34
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:21,236
Detective James Carter, LAPD.

35
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:23,064
My family owns half of
Crenshaw Boulevard.

36
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,026
I want a lawyer.

37
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,488
You need a personal trainer.

38
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,808
This license says 180 pounds.

39
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:28,185
You weigh more than
the damn car, girl.

40
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,488
- I have a thyroid condition.
- Well, stop eating thyroids.

41
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:34,453
Look, can't you just,
like give us a warning or something?

42
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:37,875
That depends.
You girls like Chinese?

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,264
Excuse me.

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,412
Carter.

45
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:44,914
Lee, we are on for tonight.

46
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,826
I just picked up two girls who wanna
play hide the little Asian policeman.

47
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,421
I can't talk now. I'm in the car
with Ambassador Han.

48
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,054
Trust me, these girls
are sushi grade.

49
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:54,297
- We gotta hit this!
- I have to go. I'm sorry.

50
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,739
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

51
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:58,042
You're mad because of what happened
when we was in New York.

52
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,091
I don't want to talk about that.

53
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:01,369
It was three years ago.
When you gonna let it go?

54
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:03,793
Let it go? Isabella was my girlfriend.

55
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:04,764
Lee, we're friends, man.

56
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:05,942
Just come out with me one night.

57
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,891
The mu shu's on me.

58
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:09,526
Lee!

59
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,223
Ha.

60
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:13,171
My mom says hi.

61
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,849
World Criminal Court

62
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:43,261
The Chinese triads now have
half a million members...

63
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:45,662
in over 100 countries.

64
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:49,209
And these are not street kids shaking down
local merchants.

65
00:03:49,248 --> 00:03:53,372
These are businessmen who have built
a $50 billion empire...

66
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:57,052
of extortion, drugs,
sex and slavery.

67
00:03:57,088 --> 00:04:02,173
We must cut off the head of this snake
before it swallows us whole.

68
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,280
As chairman of
the World Criminal Court...

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,030
I have entrusted my good friend
Ambassador Han to lead the fight...

70
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,933
against the largest criminal
organization in the world.

71
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

72
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:28,027
Chairman Reynard,
ladies and gentlemen.

73
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:33,978
The triad society
is built on secrecy.

74
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:38,142
Nobody knows who these men are,
who controls them, who leads them.

75
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,512
Nobody has known for 500 years.

76
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:44,190
But today, I stand before you
with a secret of my own.

77
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:48,732
Today, I will disclose information
that affects everyone in this room.

78
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:53,211
After years of searching,
I believe I've finally located Shy Shen.

79
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:57,470
Mr. Ambassador,
Shy Shen does not exist.

80
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,355
Excuse me, who is this Shy Shen?

81
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,881
With all due respect, sir, I le--

82
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:13,986
Everybody down!

83
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,546
Call an ambulance!

84
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:16,635
Someone get a doctor.

85
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:18,650
Ambassador down,
Ambassador down.

86
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,033
Stay with him.

87
00:05:34,341 --> 00:05:35,486
Yugh!

88
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:55,166
Uh-uh-uh. Keepin' these
till I see you tonight.

89
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:57,507
Attention all units, shots have been fired
at the World Criminal Court building.

90
00:05:57,542 --> 00:05:59,484
The Chinese Ambassador
has been shot.

91
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,932
Chinese Ambassador?
Move your asses over.

92
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,908
- Move over!
- What? Whoa. Shit!

93
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:42,591
What're you doing?!

94
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:43,974
Lee!

95
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,630
- Where the hell is he goin'?
- Ah!

96
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:54,527
LAPD! Get the hell outta the way!

97
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:56,226
People are crazy.

98
00:06:57,992 --> 00:07:00,032
I'm-a give your ass a ticket
when I come back!

99
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,192
Lee, I'm comin'!

100
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:34,180
Ugh!

101
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:40,994
Don't move!

102
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,046
Hello, Lee.

103
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,338
Don't move, Kenji.

104
00:07:57,405 --> 00:08:00,805
Lee, what're you waiting for?
Shoot me!

105
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,659
Maybe this will help.

106
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:16,591
Drop the gun or I'll shoot!

107
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:19,554
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

108
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,413
Kenji!

109
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:29,699
You see?
I know you too well.

110
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,783
Aaaah!

111
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:41,997
- Ugh!
- Aaaah!

112
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,732
- Ungh.
- Lee, you OK?

113
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:51,878
We almost killed your ass.
Why you didn't move?

114
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,510
Ohh.

115
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:57,347
I'd like for you to meet our dates
for this evenin'. Masha and Zoe.

116
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:58,317
Urgh.

117
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,779
Fat one's yours.

118
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:07,147
How many times
do you want me to say it? I'm sorry.

119
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:08,939
I'm sorry I ran you over, man. Damn!

120
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:10,219
- Not now, Carter.
- Aww.

121
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:13,102
All right, hold it right there.
Don't say a word, Carter.

122
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,110
Captain Diel, I had nothin'
to do with this.

123
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:17,192
All I did was borrow a car,
backed up Lee.

124
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:18,180
Tell him, partner.

125
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,630
I need to see Ambassador Han.

126
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:21,768
The Ambassador
is just out of surgery.

127
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:24,295
The bullet missed his heart.
He's gonna be OK.

128
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:25,896
Captain, you have to give me
back my shield...

129
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,724
and put me on this case.
I made one little mistake.

130
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,864
- Take a brother off the bench.
- One little mistake?

131
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,562
You handcuffed two women
and stole their car.

132
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,127
Isn't that why we have insurance?

133
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:34,761
Everyone has
an off day, Captain.

134
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,320
Last month you put
six Iranians in jail for a week!

135
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,848
You and I both know
them Iranians was terrorists.

136
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:41,960
They were scientists at UCLA!

137
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,015
Big deal.

138
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:44,365
'Cause they cure cancer in rats...

139
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,189
that doesn't mean
they won't blow shit up.

140
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:47,851
Let me find the person
who shot Ambassador Han.

141
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,758
Relax, Carter. The LAPD won't be leading
this investigation.

142
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,710
The Ambassador
is my responsibility.

143
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:55,371
Well, then maybe you could
tell me exactly how that shooter got away.

144
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:57,680
Thought so.

145
00:09:57,713 --> 00:10:01,008
The Ambassador's daughter
is coming to see her father right now.

146
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,895
Make sure nothing happens to her.

147
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:04,969
Don't worry, Captain,
we're gonna make you proud.

148
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,951
And try not to think about
your wife leaving you.

149
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,423
She'll come back.

150
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:09,873
Soo Yung's here?

151
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:11,563
I haven't seen her
since she was ten years old.

152
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:13,576
She lives in Los Angeles now.

153
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,723
Let's go to the gift shop
and get her a little teddy bear.

154
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:19,307
And a bra.

155
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:20,295
- Lee!
- Soo Yung.

156
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:21,964
I'm so glad you're here.

157
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:25,229
- Detective Carter.
- Soo Yung.

158
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,917
- It's been so long.
- So long, Soo Yung.

159
00:10:27,955 --> 00:10:29,132
So--So young.

160
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:32,809
- How is he?
- He's out of surgery.

161
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:34,760
They said he'll be OK.

162
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:38,893
Soo Yung, I'm sorry.

163
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,892
It was my fault.
I didn't get to him fast enough.

164
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,442
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,223
I want you both
to promise me something.

166
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,226
I want you to find the man
who did this to him.

167
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,267
I want you to find him because
I don't think he'll stop...

168
00:10:56,308 --> 00:10:57,650
until my father is dead.

169
00:10:58,612 --> 00:10:59,921
Soo Yung.

170
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:01,898
I need to hear you say it.

171
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:04,782
OK, I promise.

172
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:05,768
And so do I.

173
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:11,374
Thank you.

174
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:15,668
Soo Yung, your father was addressing
the court before he was shot.

175
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,083
Two weeks ago, my father
mailed me an envelope.

176
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:21,012
He said if anything ever
happened to him...

177
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:23,184
- I should give it to you.
- Where is it?

178
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:26,833
I put it in my locker
at the kung-fu studio where I teach.

179
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:31,277
It's at 8347 First Street...

180
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:33,172
Chinatown.

181
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:45,742
Go home, Carter.
This has nothing to do with you.

182
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:47,855
I made Soo Yung a promise,
the same as you.

183
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,382
This is the business of China.

184
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,878
Well, for your information,
I'm part Chinese now.

185
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:54,805
That's right, Lee.
For the last three years I've studied...

186
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,780
the ancient teachings of Buddha,
earning two black belts...

187
00:11:56,822 --> 00:11:58,611
in wushu martial arts,
spending every afternoon...

188
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:00,884
at the Hong Kong Garden massage parlor
on Pico and Bundy.

189
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,228
I am half-Chinese, baby.

190
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:04,651
If you're half-Chinese,
I'm half-black.

191
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:07,597
I'm your brother and I'm fly.
You down with that, Snoopy?

192
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,100
That's dope, isn't it?

193
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:12,045
Sorry, Lee, you can't be black.
There's a height requirement.

194
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:13,233
Same as riding the Matterhorn.

195
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:14,286
Go home, Carter.

196
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:15,637
I can't leave you, Lee.

197
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,964
Can't leave my brother.

198
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:42,482
All right, listen up!
I need everyone's attention.

199
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,783
I'm Detective Carter,
this is Inspector Lee.

200
00:12:45,816 --> 00:12:48,599
We need to see Soo Yung's
locker right now.

201
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:51,285
No one's allowed in the back
without the master's permission.

202
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:55,184
Maybe you didn't hear me.
We need to see that locker.

203
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,232
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Carter.

204
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:58,964
Lee, I got this.

205
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:02,198
Hey! Heh heh. Kids.

206
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:05,049
Listen. Violence will solve nothin'.

207
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:08,213
Now, as the Chinese say, all great battles
are won without fightin'.

208
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,428
- Sorry.
- OK?

209
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:10,676
I don't know him.

210
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:11,729
Now, let's just calm down
and put this--

211
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,916
- Haa!
- Ow!

212
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:14,361
God da--

213
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:19,250
OK...

214
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,917
I tried talkin'.

215
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:24,373
Hoo! Now I'm about to beat
the puberty out of y'all.

216
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:27,128
You ain't gonna see it comin'.
You ain't gonna see it comin', come on!

217
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:29,171
Waaa! Whoo!

218
00:13:29,212 --> 00:13:31,099
Runnin' for your lives.

219
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:33,717
About time y'all showed
some respect around here.

220
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,658
- Huh?
- Carter, wait for the master.

221
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:44,950
Whoa! Damn!

222
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:47,573
Heh, I'm sorry, man.
I thought this was the bathroom.

223
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:48,789
Sorry.

224
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,763
Lee, I got a big problem, man.

225
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:54,074
This boy's on steroids.
He got a head like Barry Bonds.

226
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:55,253
- Oh, no.
- Come on, man.

227
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,234
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaah!

228
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,291
Ah!

229
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,154
Carter, are you OK?

230
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:01,847
Lee, Lee, get him, Lee!

231
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:02,833
Ooh!

232
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,436
Ahhh! Ah!

233
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,786
Ah!

234
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,283
Urgh!

235
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:08,885
Lee, let's get the hell outta--

236
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,387
Aah! My bunions!

237
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,365
Yah! Hyah! Mm! Ungh!

238
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:15,348
- Grr! Rargh!
- Ha ha ha.

239
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,626
Urgh! Whoo!

240
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:19,036
Oh! Aaaah!

241
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,109
Come on, man, let me go.
I love Chinese people!

242
00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:22,677
Aaaah!

243
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:23,831
Wait. I don't--

244
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,532
Ah!

245
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,093
Urgh!

246
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:37,239
How do you say "surrender"
in Chinese?

247
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,933
Aaaah!

248
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,157
OK. I'm about to slice you up
like a giant California roll!

249
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:44,442
Raaah!

250
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,198
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Ha ha ha. Funny black man.

251
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,613
Ooh--Oh! Shit!

252
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,619
I'm not playin' no more.

253
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:56,281
Ahh!

254
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:58,261
Aaah!

255
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,619
- Lee, let go!
- Carter!

256
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,655
Grrrrr!

257
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:11,835
Down! Put us down!

258
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:15,260
Let me down! I'm sorry!

259
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,435
- Aaaaah!
- I'm sorry, man!

260
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,327
How the hell did we
get in this mess?

261
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:21,629
- Ugh!
- Agh!

262
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:35,615
May I help you?

263
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,519
We'll be asking
the questions, old man.

264
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:39,609
- Who are you?
- Yu.

265
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,340
- No, not me. You.
- Yes, I am Yu.

266
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:42,784
Just answer the damn questions.

267
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,443
- Who are you?
- I have told you.

268
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,456
- Are you deaf?
- No, Yu is blind.

269
00:15:46,498 --> 00:15:47,676
I'm not blind, you blind.

270
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:50,016
- That is what I just said.
- You just said what?

271
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,602
- I did not say what, I said Yu.
- That's what I'm asking you.

272
00:15:52,642 --> 00:15:54,496
- And Yu is answering.
- Shut up!

273
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,424
- You!
- Yes?

274
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:56,472
Not you, him!

275
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:57,659
- What's your name?
- Mi.

276
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:59,127
- Yes, you!
- I am Mi.

277
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,058
He is Mi, and I am Yu.

278
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,960
And I'm about to whup your old ass, man,
'cause I'm sick of playin' games!

279
00:16:04,003 --> 00:16:07,101
You, me, everybody's ass
around here! Him!

280
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:08,414
- Carter, Carter.
- I'm-a kick his ass.

281
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,824
- I'm sick of this.
- Carter, let me handle this.

282
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:10,971
- Lee. No, Lee. No!
- Carter!

283
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,636
Go.

284
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,555
Master...

285
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,056
My name is Inspector Lee.
We have a key to Soo Yung's locker.

286
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,420
Some men came here this morning.
They had guns. They emptied her locker.

287
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:24,794
I could not stop them.

288
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:25,795
You must go to her at once.

289
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:26,472
Why?

290
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:30,162
They said she would end up
like her father.

291
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,062
Let's go.

292
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:32,986
Thank you.

293
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:34,522
I don't know what the hell
you feedin' him...

294
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:37,378
- but he is too damn big!
- Carter. Go.

295
00:16:57,669 --> 00:16:58,651
Where is everyone?

296
00:16:58,693 --> 00:17:00,187
Where's all the damn cops?

297
00:17:06,053 --> 00:17:07,427
- Lee.
- Where's security?

298
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,704
They were called away.

299
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:10,814
W--What's wrong?

300
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:12,479
Carter.

301
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,364
Aw, this ain't good.

302
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:17,536
They're coming for him.

303
00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:19,003
What do we do?

304
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,324
No.

305
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,580
No!

306
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:41,243
Don't move, or I'll
blow your ass cheeks off.

307
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,597
Get back.

308
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:43,907
Ugh!

309
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,662
Who sent you?

310
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:48,956
Oh!

311
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,294
Don't move!

312
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:57,958
Lee, throw me a gun!

313
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:59,202
- Huh?
- Throw me a gun!

314
00:18:01,896 --> 00:18:03,521
- Damn, Lee!
- Huh?

315
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,469
Lee! I thought you had my back!

316
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,177
Aaaaaah!

317
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:41,637
Ugh!

318
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:47,687
Soo Yung, one more!

319
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:51,305
Hyah!

320
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,116
Aaaaah!

321
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:57,569
Lee, I'm in trouble!
I need some assistance.

322
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:00,583
Here.

323
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:03,108
It's empty.

324
00:19:03,147 --> 00:19:04,325
What?

325
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:08,071
Hah!

326
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:14,602
You see? I always got your back.

327
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:16,130
Why the hell you give me
an empty gun, then?

328
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,059
I didn't know.

329
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,230
You almost got me killed, Lee.

330
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:24,418
- Ah! Ahh!
- Who are you? Who sent you?

331
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:29,890
What the hell is that?

332
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:30,947
I think he's speaking French.

333
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:32,876
French? What kind of
Chinaman speak French?

334
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:34,338
Tell him to stop playin' around
and talk right.

335
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,941
How can I tell him?
I don't speak French.

336
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:37,963
Ah!

337
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:39,753
Talk right, man.

338
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:42,211
No! You're Asian.
Stop humiliatin' yourself.

339
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:46,407
Shut the hell up.
Shut up. Come here.

340
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:48,617
We're gonna need a few minutes
alone with this guy.

341
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,791
Find someone here
who speaks French, please.

342
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:53,642
Speak English!

343
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:58,284
Uh, this is Sister Agnes
from the chapel upstairs.

344
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:00,968
She speaks fluent French
and has agreed to interpret for you.

345
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:02,794
Sister, we appreciate you doin' this.

346
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,758
My pleasure.

347
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,179
Sister Agnes,
please ask who sent him.

348
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,637
He says you're both making
a big mistake.

349
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,612
That one day soon
you'll beg for mercy.

350
00:20:16,654 --> 00:20:17,996
He also said--

351
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:19,591
What?

352
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:22,052
Please, Sister, we have to know.

353
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,142
There's lives at stake.

354
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,704
Well, he used the N-word.

355
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:27,718
What? The N-word?

356
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,766
- You tell this little motherf--
- Carter!

357
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,742
She's a nun.

358
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:37,518
Sister, you tell this piece of S-word
that I will personally F-word him up.

359
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:48,070
Did he say "Negro"?

360
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:51,013
He used the N-word again, but this time
he mentioned your grandmother.

361
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:53,707
You tell him
that his mama's a H!

362
00:20:53,744 --> 00:20:56,810
Carter, I believe "whore" is
spelled with a W.

363
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:59,052
Right. W. And his sister's a W.

364
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:00,942
And his grandmama's
a two-bit W...

365
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:02,886
who makes double
'cause she got no teeth!

366
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,619
You tell him I said that.

367
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:17,392
Did he say it again?

368
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:19,335
No. This time he called...

369
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,931
this gentleman a word
that means "cat"...

370
00:21:21,969 --> 00:21:24,588
and another word that rhymes
with "maggot."

371
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:25,673
What?!

372
00:21:26,513 --> 00:21:29,448
Well, you tell him he's an A.W.

373
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,912
Uh, Lee,
"hole" is spelled with a H.

374
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,547
I have a dictionary upstairs.

375
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:35,015
Just call him an asshole.

376
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,504
He says you've both been marked
for death, like Han and the girl.

377
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:45,230
Ooh. Sister, turn your back.
You don't want to see this.

378
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:47,208
Who is Shy Shen
and how do we find him?

379
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,618
Tell us right now or I'll cut your B's off
and shove 'em in your mouth.

380
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:51,823
- His beads?
- His beads, Sister.

381
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:53,266
His hairy, stinkin' beads.

382
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:54,727
Tell me somethin' now.

383
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,138
Lee, give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Lee.

384
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:01,778
It's over, brother. It's over. OK.

385
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:03,338
Who is Shy Shen?!

386
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:04,328
What did he say, Sister?

387
00:22:04,371 --> 00:22:05,746
He said "shoot me."

388
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,199
Lee, there's no bullets in here.

389
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:12,683
- I'm sorry.
- I am trying to kill somebody, man.

390
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:15,309
Damn. OK.

391
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:16,525
You better tell me
something right now.

392
00:22:16,564 --> 00:22:17,644
I'll send you right to heaven, man.

393
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,026
- I don't even care no more.
- Carter.

394
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:22,094
I'm marked for death.
I ain't got nothin' to lose.

395
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,980
That's right, Sister. Call the Lord and tell
him he 'bout to have some company.

396
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,868
Carter, stop.

397
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,787
Tell me something!

398
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,730
- Carter, enough.
- Oh, she's almost done.

399
00:22:30,773 --> 00:22:33,108
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned!

400
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:34,896
He says wait!

401
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:40,116
- What did he say?
- 50 Franklin D. Roosevelt.

402
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:41,261
Genevieve.

403
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:43,024
Thank you.

404
00:22:45,301 --> 00:22:46,545
Nice workin' with ya, Sister.

405
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,076
Anytime, brother.

406
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:51,636
50 FDR.

407
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,524
- It's an address.
- It's a wild goose chase.

408
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:55,947
Every city in America has
a street named after Roosevelt.

409
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,062
- And who is Genevieve?
- I don't know.

410
00:22:58,102 --> 00:23:00,655
Soo Yung, we're getting you
out of here.

411
00:23:00,694 --> 00:23:02,255
- Why?
- It's not safe for you here.

412
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:03,472
I won't leave him.

413
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,103
We have no choice.

414
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:31,191
- Soo Yung.
- Mr. Reynard.

415
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:33,903
I'm glad your father is OK.

416
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:35,603
My people won't leave his side.

417
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,266
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

418
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:38,547
So, let's go.

419
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,755
- Ah.
- Wh--Where am I going?

420
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:44,021
We're getting out of Los Angeles.
It's not safe for us.

421
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,096
Just a few days, Soo Yung.
I promise.

422
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:48,690
You'll come with me
and my family to Paris.

423
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:53,710
OK.

424
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:58,645
Wait.

425
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,007
You made me a promise.

426
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:05,432
Don't forget.

427
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,364
My God.

428
00:24:18,778 --> 00:24:21,429
We got a assassin in custody
who only speaks French...

429
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:23,953
a limo blows up
at the French Consulate...

430
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:27,769
and the next meeting of the World Court
is in Paris, two days from now.

431
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:28,980
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

432
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah.

433
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,733
That we go to Fiji,
we hide out for a year...

434
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,526
maybe change our names,
get jobs as bartenders...

435
00:24:33,563 --> 00:24:34,839
and I'm-a call you Kiko.

436
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,592
We have to find Shy Shen
before he finds us.

437
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,001
We're going to Paris, aren't we?

438
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,692
Yes. Tonight.

439
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:53,850
Did you know the average French woman
is naked 34 percent of the time?

440
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,574
We are not going there
to meet women.

441
00:24:57,852 --> 00:25:00,503
You have to forget about her,
and let me hook you up.

442
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,323
Hook me up?
After what you did to Isabella?

443
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:04,949
It was an accident.

444
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,330
Besides, you never even
slept with her.

445
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,785
Thanks to you.
It was going to happen.

446
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:10,170
But you just had to ruin it.

447
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:11,382
What did I do that was so terrible?

448
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,875
You shot my girlfriend.
In the neck!

449
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,193
There's nothing else to say.

450
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,341
It's not like she died.

451
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:19,283
So she has droopy eyes.
So she works at El Poco Loco.

452
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:20,732
That was temporary.

453
00:25:20,764 --> 00:25:23,186
As soon as she could blink,
the Secret Service took her back.

454
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:26,131
You know what your problem is?
You need to relax, have some fun.

455
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:28,726
You have too much rice in your diet.
You're constipated.

456
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:30,226
I never should have brought you.

457
00:25:30,268 --> 00:25:31,610
Face it, you need me, brother.

458
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:34,941
I don't need anyone.
And please don't call me brother.

459
00:25:34,973 --> 00:25:35,921
What is this?

460
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:38,071
Underground gentleman's club
in Paris.

461
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,833
"Club La Passe"? Forget it.

462
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:41,942
Check out the address.

463
00:25:41,983 --> 00:25:44,284
"50 Franklin D... Roosevelt."

464
00:25:44,317 --> 00:25:46,521
Like I said, you need me.

465
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:51,065
'Scuse me. Can we have one
gefilte fish and some Ex-Lax?

466
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,828
Where the bags at, man?

467
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:03,541
Excuse me, gentlemen.

468
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,485
Commissaire Revi of the DST.
Would you please come with me?

469
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:07,771
Why?

470
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:10,425
Just need to ask you
a few questions.

471
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:13,846
Oh! Oh! Man!
Goddamn, man!

472
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:17,597
Oh! Man, this is by far the worst airport
I ever been to.

473
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:19,192
Oh!

474
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:20,726
- Ooph!
- Ah, man!

475
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:23,037
Now that I have your attention,
why don't you tell me...

476
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:25,111
what you cops are looking for
here in Paris.

477
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,388
I told you, man. We on vacation.

478
00:26:27,424 --> 00:26:28,831
Just taking in the sights.

479
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:31,199
Gentlemen, this is my city...

480
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:33,883
and I'm responsible
if two stupid cops come here...

481
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,474
and get their heads
blown off by the triads.

482
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:40,473
Now, I can't force you to leave,
but I can make the suggestion.

483
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:45,051
After all, I found this dirty little gun
inside your jacket.

484
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,886
Which means you could both
do 20 years in my jail.

485
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,423
Do we understand each other?

486
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,472
Do we understand each other?

487
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:57,531
Excellent. It was wonderful
meeting you both.

488
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:01,054
So we can go now?

489
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,878
This will just take a moment.

490
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,604
Welcome to Paris.

491
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:06,048
Oh, shit.

492
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,112
Ohh. Ohhh.

493
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:20,349
- Ahh.
- Where you go?

494
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:22,274
- Ugh.
- 50 Franklin, uh...

495
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:23,321
D. Roosevelt.

496
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:25,151
No. Get out.

497
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,747
- What?
- I don't drive his kind.

498
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:28,248
- My kind?
- Americans.

499
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,600
I don't drive Americans.

500
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,544
- But I'm Chinese.
- Yeah, but you're with him...

501
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:33,310
and they're the most
violent people on earth.

502
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:35,584
Always starting wars,
always killing people.

503
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,212
Americans make me sick.

504
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:39,193
Look, man, we are not
in the mood for this.

505
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:41,853
Me and my partner just got violated
by a small Frenchman.

506
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:43,385
Wearing a very large ring.

507
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:46,875
You're a pathetic bunch of criminals
who always resort to violence.

508
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,322
Always push around the little guy.

509
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:50,080
Hey, that stuff ain't true.
America's not violent!

510
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,971
Come on, America is a joke.

511
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,891
You lost in Vietnam,
you lost in Iraq.

512
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,345
You can't even beat the Europeans
in basketball anymore.

513
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:57,795
The Dream Team is dead.

514
00:27:57,828 --> 00:28:00,098
Ha ha. I didn't hear you, man.

515
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:02,433
Talk about the NBA again,
I dare ya. I double-dare ya.

516
00:28:02,468 --> 00:28:04,639
Even your skinny women disgust me.

517
00:28:04,677 --> 00:28:06,465
- Halle Berry.
- Wh--? Aw, hell no.

518
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,645
Now you done gone too far.

519
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,179
You want violence,
smelly Frenchman? Huh?

520
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,879
Do you want violence?
Well, you got it!

521
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,805
- Carter, put the gun down.
- Say you love America.

522
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:15,138
I love America.
Please, don't kill me.

523
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:16,450
Sing the national anthem!

524
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:20,189
Not that one, man!
Sing the American one.

525
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:21,539
Don't know it.

526
00:28:21,573 --> 00:28:25,850
# Oh, say can you see #

527
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:29,628
# Oh, say can you see #

528
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:33,216
# By the dawn's early light #

529
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:36,123
# Ah-doo da-doo-dee light... #

530
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:06,918
Wait for us here, George.

531
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:22,430
Ooh la la. Lee.

532
00:29:22,472 --> 00:29:23,999
Carter, stay focused.

533
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,666
We're looking for Genevieve.

534
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:28,901
Let's split up.
I'll take the women.

535
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:54,855
Carter. James Carter.

536
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:02,146
I know you probably don't understand
a word I'm saying...

537
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:03,430
but I gotta tell you...

538
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:05,768
you're the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in my life.

539
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:07,941
And I'd like to strip you down
and butter you...

540
00:30:07,978 --> 00:30:09,833
like a slice of Wonder Bread.

541
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:13,478
And shave your armpits and pour honey
all over your naked body.

542
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:16,515
And for the next two weeks
pretend I was a hungry bear.

543
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:20,811
Well, James Carter,
I happen to speak six languages.

544
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:22,437
One of 'em English?

545
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,987
Are you in or out?

546
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:31,072
Money plays.

547
00:30:31,115 --> 00:30:33,002
Sir, it's a thousand-euro minimum.

548
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:34,442
How much I'm short?

549
00:30:34,475 --> 00:30:36,363
930 euros.

550
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:38,468
- Heh.
- It's OK.

551
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:40,199
Let him play.

552
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:41,251
Thank you.

553
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,535
<i>Changez.</i>

554
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:43,500
<i>- Changez.
- Changez.</i>

555
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:44,481
<i>Changez?</i>

556
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,680
I'm looking for Genevieve.

557
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:09,766
Maybe I can help you.

558
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,460
Do you know what
I hate about cops?

559
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:19,143
Even when they're
with a woman...

560
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:22,443
they can't stop thinking
about getting their man.

561
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:25,129
Who is Shy Shen?

562
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,443
See what I mean?

563
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,977
Come upstairs, cop.
I'll give you what you want.

564
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:39,468
<i>- Hit me.
- Monsieur, this is baccarat.</i>

565
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:40,681
I know that!

566
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:42,923
You think I don't know
baccarack when I play it?

567
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:44,683
When I was a kid,
me and my friends and I...

568
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,345
used to hang out in front of
the Magic Johnson Theater...

569
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:48,488
and play baccarack all night long.

570
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:50,414
Now hit me.

571
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,280
Three kings.
Read 'em and weep.

572
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,502
Three kings is a zero.

573
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,925
You have the worst possible hand.
You lose.

574
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,429
What?

575
00:32:10,032 --> 00:32:11,559
<i>Ah, madame has a 7.</i>

576
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,935
She wins 100,000 euros. Bravo.

577
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:16,522
Mr. Carter, it appears you have
brought me luck.

578
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,862
I'd like to bring you
breakfast in bed.

579
00:32:22,736 --> 00:32:24,165
Excuse me.

580
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:33,967
Way to go, Lee.

581
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:36,106
Today, my boy becomes a man.

582
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,565
Why are you helping me?

583
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:41,903
Maybe I'm helping myself.

584
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:43,760
How do I find Genevieve?

585
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:46,063
I see you like to get right to it.

586
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,691
Do you know Shy Shen?

587
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,345
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

588
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:52,655
Yes, please.

589
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:56,592
Someone's gonna die here tonight.

590
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,184
And it's you.

591
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:04,462
- Huh! Huh!
- Ugh!

592
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,506
- Huh!
- Ahh!

593
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,700
Unh!

594
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,113
- Unh!
- Ah!

595
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:15,307
- Uh!
- Urgh! Ah!

596
00:33:15,347 --> 00:33:18,544
Ohh! Ah! Oh!

597
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,881
Ugh! Grrrrr!

598
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:24,043
Ohhh!

599
00:33:24,084 --> 00:33:25,578
Ohhh!

600
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,791
Ah! Ahhh!

601
00:33:27,827 --> 00:33:29,967
- Nngh! Guh!
- Oh! Ah!

602
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:31,083
- Gnnh!
- Ahhh!

603
00:33:42,164 --> 00:33:44,368
Come on, crouching tiger,
don't hide that dragon.

604
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:45,899
- Uh!
- Aaah!

605
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:00,494
Do it, Lee.
You tear that ass up.

606
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,389
- Ahh!
- Oh, oh!

607
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:14,349
You are a super freak!

608
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,700
Carter!

609
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:16,912
Oh!

610
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,226
- Run!
- Oh!

611
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,809
- Ahh!
- Sorry.

612
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:27,603
- You got a boyfriend?
- Carter!

613
00:34:29,815 --> 00:34:31,222
Start the car.

614
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:33,622
- Start the car!
- Drive fast!

615
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,464
Carter. Look!

616
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:59,154
Uh, George?
We need you to go faster, man.

617
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:00,305
No. Forget it.

618
00:35:00,344 --> 00:35:03,476
You wanna kill me,
then go ahead, kill me.

619
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:05,487
- Ahh!
- Drive faster!

620
00:35:07,993 --> 00:35:09,717
Please! I'm scared!

621
00:35:09,753 --> 00:35:11,279
George, you watch
American movies?

622
00:35:11,321 --> 00:35:12,336
- Yeah.
- OK, man. All right.

623
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,384
Listen, you're a super-spy.

624
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:16,913
A super-spy.

625
00:35:16,953 --> 00:35:19,604
Now drive this cab.

626
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:21,234
- Come on.
- OK.

627
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:23,832
I'm a super-spy.

628
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,953
Oh, shit, George. Go!

629
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:42,191
- Aah!
- George...

630
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:43,892
When I tell you to,
hit the brakes.

631
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:48,826
Now!

632
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:55,349
Oh, they got guns, Lee!

633
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,111
- Ungh!
- Ah!

634
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:01,144
- Ungh!
- Back up!

635
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:12,438
Argh!

636
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:15,539
Way to go, George.

637
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:18,873
It's OK.

638
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:23,832
Uh!

639
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:24,816
Aah!

640
00:36:25,757 --> 00:36:26,705
Hey!

641
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:36,628
I got this one.

642
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,193
Aah!

643
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:41,334
Oh! Whoa! He's got my leg!

644
00:36:42,012 --> 00:36:43,923
Aaaah!

645
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:45,459
Lee! God!

646
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:50,008
- Aaaaah!
- Hold m--

647
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:51,093
Ah!

648
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:57,879
Get your own damn cab.

649
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:06,716
Ow!

650
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,125
Lee!

651
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:09,784
- Urgh!
- Yah!

652
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:12,378
Yeah! Whoa!

653
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:13,723
- Ungh!
- Oh!

654
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:16,509
The French are neutral!
This is not my fight!

655
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:17,491
This is not--!

656
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:24,120
Ah! Lee, I'm alive.

657
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,014
My whole life flashed in front of me.

658
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:27,706
In three years I'll be married
to a Chinese woman.

659
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:30,427
We had three kids looked just like you,
only a little darker.

660
00:37:30,463 --> 00:37:31,390
- Carter.
- What?

661
00:37:31,424 --> 00:37:33,179
Put your hands up.

662
00:37:33,215 --> 00:37:35,037
What you talkin' 'bout?

663
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:36,827
Whoa!

664
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,968
Some people say the modern world
was invented...

665
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,684
when the French built
these sewers.

666
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:01,853
10 million gallons pumped
through every hour.

667
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:05,020
A marvel that no one ever sees.

668
00:38:05,057 --> 00:38:07,098
Welcome to Paris, Lee.

669
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:08,511
Lee, you know this clown?

670
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:12,255
Go on, Lee. Tell him who I am.
Don't be shy.

671
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,231
<i>Introduce him
to your shyong dih.</i>

672
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:16,924
<i>Shyong dih? Your brother?</i>

673
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,488
He doesn't talk about me much.

674
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,465
In fact, he's spent his whole life
trying to forget me.

675
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:24,026
How would it look if Hong Kong's
great Inspector Lee...

676
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:26,586
had a brother on the wrong side
of the law?

677
00:38:26,626 --> 00:38:29,015
You're not my brother anymore.

678
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:30,426
Are you forgetting about Zhenzhou?

679
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:32,052
Yes, I forgot.

680
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:35,461
You spared my life in Los Angeles.

681
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:39,207
You should have shot me in that alley.
But you didn't pull the trigger...

682
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:41,508
because you can't escape your past.

683
00:38:42,143 --> 00:38:44,343
I didn't kill you because
I'm not an assassin.

684
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:47,706
Let me repay the favor, Lee.

685
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:51,359
I'll allow you to live, if you
promise to leave Paris tonight.

686
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,046
You got a deal. Thank you
for showin' us the sewer.

687
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,636
Listen, that's a badass suit.
Let's get the hell outta here.

688
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:59,163
What about Han and his daughter?

689
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,862
There is nothing I can do for them.

690
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:04,607
- I have no choice.
- Then I have no choice.

691
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:07,644
Well, I guess he's stayin'.
Who wanna take me to the airport?

692
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:11,709
We'll always be brothers, Lee.

693
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:14,137
In this life and the next.

694
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:19,972
Tell me, Kenji, who's Shy Shen?

695
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,352
Some secrets are worth dying for.

696
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,459
Oh. OK. A--All right. OK.

697
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:30,914
Lee, what the hell is goin' on?

698
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:37,892
Go!

699
00:39:37,926 --> 00:39:39,714
Hey, which way, man?

700
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,526
- Shit, Lee, it's locked!
- Over here!

701
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,184
- Lee!
- We have to jump!

702
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,604
- Ooph.
- Oh, that's the sewer!

703
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:58,589
- Hell no, Lee!
- No choice!

704
00:39:58,631 --> 00:39:59,809
- I'd rather die.
- Come on!

705
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,625
Oh!

706
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:07,103
Shi-i-i-i-i-it!

707
00:40:11,046 --> 00:40:12,672
I'm gonna kill you, Lee!

708
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,236
<i>Bonjour. Welcome to
the Plaza Athenee.</i>

709
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,318
How may I help you?

710
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,360
It's great to see you again.
It's been too long.

711
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,807
Yes, far too long, sir.

712
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,688
Listen, I need a big suite,
two beds, two showers...

713
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,103
a massage therapist, some new clothes
and a case of Old Spice.

714
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:41,315
It's all your fault.
How come you didn't tell me about Kenji?

715
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:43,523
It was none of your business.

716
00:40:43,561 --> 00:40:47,303
In case you missed it, man,
people are tryin' to kill me.

717
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:50,054
I'm covered in shit and some French cops
whupped my ass...

718
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:51,365
with some Yellow Pages, man.

719
00:40:51,402 --> 00:40:52,928
So don't tell me it ain't
none of my business.

720
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:54,397
You're lucky we're not
in Hong Kong.

721
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:55,870
Phone book is twice as big.

722
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:58,018
Why you didn't tell me
you had a brother, man?

723
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:02,884
Oh, hell, no--

724
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:04,670
<i>- Lady.
- Oui?</i>

725
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:07,234
This damn dog just pissed on me.

726
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:08,866
Good girl.

727
00:41:11,465 --> 00:41:14,051
You know what I think?

728
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:17,057
I think you feel sorry for this guy.

729
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:19,007
Maybe Kenji didn't get away in LA.

730
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,883
Maybe you let him go.

731
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:27,233
The yakuza killed his family in Tokyo.
He was sent to China when he was 7.

732
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:31,553
He was put in Chenzhou,
the orphanage where I grew up.

733
00:41:31,595 --> 00:41:33,667
We kept each other alive.

734
00:41:33,706 --> 00:41:36,903
You protected each other.
And you're still protectin' him.

735
00:41:38,411 --> 00:41:40,200
<i>I call him shyong dih.</i>

736
00:41:40,235 --> 00:41:42,625
He was like my brother.

737
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,642
And then I left him.

738
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:46,593
You was adopted.
What choice did you have?

739
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:48,642
He ended up on the streets.

740
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:51,650
You could never understand.

741
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,218
I understand, man.
I got a brother.

742
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:54,208
My little brother Perry.

743
00:41:54,252 --> 00:41:56,391
We used to be best friends.
Now we don't even speak.

744
00:41:56,428 --> 00:41:59,047
He think I tipped off the cops
about his chicken fights in his garage.

745
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,473
Can you believe that?
My own brother think I'm a snitch.

746
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:03,240
Just 'cause my chicken lost
in the semifinals.

747
00:42:03,276 --> 00:42:04,204
I didn't even really care.

748
00:42:04,236 --> 00:42:05,447
- Carter.
- Fight was fixed, man.

749
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:07,371
My bird was fightin' a chicken
that didn't make his weight.

750
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:08,419
And he still went the distance.

751
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,762
He had a lotta heart.
And he was delicious.

752
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:14,113
It's best if I do this on my own.
This fight is personal.

753
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,651
Lemme help you, man.
I'm-a tell you right now...

754
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:17,154
whatever Kenji's
tellin' you, it ain't true.

755
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:19,816
- He ain't your brother.
- And you are not my brother.

756
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,315
Huh.

757
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:26,436
Fine.

758
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,649
I'm not your brother.

759
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:42,789
# What have I got to do
to make you love me? #

760
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:49,643
# Sorry seems to be
the hardest word #

761
00:42:52,815 --> 00:42:54,441
- # It's sad #
- # So sad #

762
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:56,137
# So sad #

763
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:59,852
# It's a sad, sad situation #

764
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:04,197
# And it's getting more and more absurd #

765
00:43:05,327 --> 00:43:07,269
Wow. Holy smokes!

766
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:08,806
- # It's sad #
- Crash landing!

767
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:11,717
- # So sad #
- Short Round... step on it!

768
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,575
Okey-dokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

769
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:17,161
# Always seems to me #

770
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,378
# That sorry... #

771
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:22,190
Yes, I would like to order
some fried chicken, please.

772
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,494
Oh, and some sweet-potato pie.

773
00:43:25,488 --> 00:43:26,437
<i>Merci.</i>

774
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,814
Enjoy your mu shu, sir.

775
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,758
<i>- Merci.
- Goodbye.</i>

776
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:34,219
# East Coast girl are 'ip #

777
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:38,664
# I really dig those styles

778
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:42,087
# And southern girls

779
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:45,872
# They knock me out
when I'm down there #

780
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:48,939
# The Midwest
farmers' daughters #

781
00:43:48,977 --> 00:43:52,490
# Really make you feel all right #

# And the northerns girls

785

# I wish they all could be California #

786
00:44:06,995 --> 00:44:10,410
# I wish they all
could be California-- #

787
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:12,393
Hm. "Genevieve."

788
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,330
Phew.

789
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,753
- Oh.
- Hello, Inspector.

790
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:29,104
Minister Reynard.

791
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:31,888
They want to kill me.
Me and my family.

792
00:44:31,923 --> 00:44:33,898
A dozen agents
from the French secret police...

793
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:36,842
have already been murdered...
only this last month.

794
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,371
We are at war with the triads,
right here in my own city.

795
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:41,004
Who is Shy Shen?

796
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:44,240
Ah, Shy Shen--uh--
Shy Shen is not a person.

797
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:45,705
It's a list.

798
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:47,888
- A list?
- Yes.

799
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:50,772
Every 5 years, the triad bosses
come together...

800
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:54,100
for an election, and during that ceremony
they choose the men...

801
00:44:54,133 --> 00:44:56,402
who will lead the triads.

802
00:44:56,436 --> 00:44:58,576
- Dragon heads.
- Yes.

803
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,784
13 dragon heads who will control...

804
00:45:00,821 --> 00:45:03,439
the largest criminal organization
in the world.

805
00:45:03,477 --> 00:45:08,016
And their 13 names are inscribed
on the list known as Shy Shen.

806
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:10,835
A list which has been handed
down and kept secret...

807
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:13,586
from generation to generation.

808
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:16,174
If the names on that list
were ever to get out...

809
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:19,312
well, the secret society
wouldn't be so secret anymore...

810
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,220
and they would all end up in jail,
or dead.

811
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:23,920
And the list is somewhere in Paris?

812
00:45:23,957 --> 00:45:28,300
A young lady named Genevieve
made contact with Ambassador Han...

813
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:30,252
and we believe she knows where it is.

814
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:35,599
I'm asking for your help, Inspector.

815
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:38,671
Finish what Ambassador Han started.

816
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,533
Get to the girl before the triads do
and you'll get Shy Shen.

817
00:46:08,344 --> 00:46:09,588
Ha ha ha!

818
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,268
<i>Ca va, oui, oui, voulez-vous.</i>

819
00:46:21,304 --> 00:46:23,726
I don't understand.
Who are you?

820
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:25,711
<i>- Who am I?
- Oui.</i>

821
00:46:25,752 --> 00:46:29,429
I'm Bubbles.
The new costume designer!

822
00:46:29,464 --> 00:46:31,439
Has anyone seen Genevieve?

823
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,172
Uh, she has her own
dressing room.

824
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,616
Ah.

825
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,426
Wait. Bubbles.

826
00:46:38,649 --> 00:46:40,210
Uh, do we look OK?

827
00:46:50,586 --> 00:46:51,764
No. No, no.

828
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:53,362
These costumes are terrible!

829
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:56,085
Ladies, please, we have work to do!

830
00:47:34,108 --> 00:47:37,556
First, I will dress the blondes.

831
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:45,818
And then...

832
00:47:45,852 --> 00:47:48,024
the brunettes.

833
00:47:50,844 --> 00:47:53,147
And finally...

834
00:47:53,181 --> 00:47:54,707
the hybrids.

835
00:47:59,325 --> 00:48:03,636
The Lord have truly bless you all
with tremendous talent...

836
00:48:03,677 --> 00:48:05,335
trust me.

837
00:48:06,878 --> 00:48:11,351
And some of you have
what I like to call...

838
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,685
silver-dollar potential.

I don't want you to pay.

Please, I'm begging you.
Let me be your driver.

You'll never be an American, OK?

00:52:42,762 --> 00:52:44,868
I'll drink this shit all day if I have to.

Hold on.

914
00:53:00,363 --> 00:53:02,819
So you think she stole this
Shy Shen list from the triads?

915

Only one way to find out.

We need her to talk.
Get her relaxed.

918
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:10,564
Maybe open up some wine
from the minibar.

919
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,065
Wow.

920
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:17,131

Wait, let me go with you.

926
00:53:28,685 --> 00:53:30,954
Some things a man has to do
on his own.

927
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,157
You OK?

928
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:40,229
Kenji must have figured out
what I've done.

929
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:42,244
I'm as good as dead.

930
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,084
You stole the list, didn't you?
You tried to sell it to Han?

931
00:53:47,438 --> 00:53:51,050
You don't get it.
I'm one of them.

932
00:53:51,086 --> 00:53:53,639
And if I'm dead, you're dead.

933
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:05,613
Hey, we're safe.
No one knows we're here.

934
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:06,890
Just relax.

935
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:10,243
No one is safe.

936
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:11,629
I'm marked.

937
00:54:11,663 --> 00:54:12,808
Trust me.

938
00:54:12,847 --> 00:54:14,308
Now why should I trust you?

939
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,107
As the Chinese say...

940
00:54:18,863 --> 00:54:20,107
What does that mean?

941
00:54:20,143 --> 00:54:22,826
"A donkey's lips will not fit
on a horse's mouth."

942
00:54:24,783 --> 00:54:26,344
I'm not sure how that applies.

943
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:31,787
Well, I was just thinking
you had nice lips.

944
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,269
That's all.

945
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:38,984
You saved my life today.
Thank you, Carter.

946
00:54:39,024 --> 00:54:41,642
Oh, please. Call me James.

947
00:54:41,681 --> 00:54:42,989
Or Stallion.

948
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:46,254
No one's saved me
in a long time.

949
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:47,629
How can I repay you?

950
00:54:47,665 --> 00:54:49,191
You got 20 bucks?

951
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:53,222
How 'bout ten?

952
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,305
Oh, man. Mmm.

953
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:57,417

- What?

954
00:54:57,456 --> 00:54:58,766
- I'm bad.
- I'm bad too.

955
00:54:58,801 --> 00:54:59,881
I'm a bad girl.

956

Hallelujah!

957
00:55:09,618 --> 00:55:11,505
Oh, yeah.
That's it, baby. Yeah. Uh-oh.

958
00:55:11,538 --> 00:55:13,131
Ha ha. Oh, yeah. That's it, baby.

959
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:15,504
Oh, yeah. Bite that ear.
Punish that ear.

960
00:55:15,538 --> 00:55:16,847
Do what you wanna do.

961
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:18,737
Oh, baby--Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

962
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,177
My nipples are sensitive.
Be careful down there.

963
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,316
I've never been with
an American man before.

964
00:55:22,355 --> 00:55:23,434
Neither have I.

965
00:55:23,474 --> 00:55:25,896
I feel so safe with you.
Do you want me?

966
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:29,135
Ha. How you say "Twice now
and once in the shower" in French?

967
00:55:29,171 --> 00:55:31,505
Wait here. I'm going
to the bathroom.

968
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:33,426
Make myself more comfortable.

969
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,305
You need some matches?

970
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:39,022
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

971
00:55:41,843 --> 00:55:42,988
Hello, room service?

972
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:45,035
Send me up a bottle of honey
and some Red Bull.

973
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:14,996
Do you like it?

974
00:56:15,028 --> 00:56:17,996
No wonder Lance Armstrong
came all the way here to ride a bike.

975
00:56:19,093 --> 00:56:20,554
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

976
00:56:24,406 --> 00:56:25,715
<i>Oui, baby, oui!</i>

977
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,877
Oh, yeah.

978
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:34,100
<i>Voulez... vous
coucher avec moi, baby?</i>

979
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:36,589
<i>Je t'aime.</i>

980
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,874
<i>Voulez-vous.</i>

981
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,251
Oh, yeah.

982
00:56:39,285 --> 00:56:41,871
<i>Je t'aime, baby, je t'aime!</i>

983
00:56:44,598 --> 00:56:46,125
Freeze! Don't move!

984
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:48,949
Ah! Shit! Damn!

985
00:56:56,566 --> 00:56:57,995
- I'm shot.
- It's OK, it's OK.

986
00:56:58,038 --> 00:56:59,315
It's just a flesh wound.
It's OK. Gen--

987
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:00,463
Genevieve, Genevieve,
let me help you.

988
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:01,430
- Let me help you, baby.
- I'm terribly sorry.

989
00:57:01,462 --> 00:57:02,608
- I'm OK.
- Where you going?

990
00:57:02,647 --> 00:57:04,436
Je--Damn.

991
00:57:04,471 --> 00:57:06,707
So we even now, huh?
Is that it?

992
00:57:06,744 --> 00:57:08,336
I shoot your girl,
you shoot my girl?

993
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:09,935
I was trying to save your life.

994
00:57:09,976 --> 00:57:11,088
Well, you couldn't wait five minutes?

995
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:12,982
We--We was about to
make love, man!

996
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:13,943
And you ruin it.

997
00:57:13,975 --> 00:57:17,042
They will be coming for us.
We have to get out of here now.

998
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,087
You hear that?
We have to get out of here now.

999
00:57:19,128 --> 00:57:21,015
- Damn, Lee! Damn you.
- Sorry.

1000
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:22,871
Next time I'm getting
my own damn room.

1001
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:27,286
Get them out, George.

1002
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:29,873
These people are danger,
they're bleeding.

1003
00:57:29,911 --> 00:57:31,439
How can you bring them
to our home?

1004
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,098
Paulette, there is something
you should know.

1005
00:57:34,136 --> 00:57:35,762
I'm not what you think I am.

1006
00:57:37,304 --> 00:57:38,679
Are you telling me you're gay?

1007
00:57:43,257 --> 00:57:46,934
I'm trying tell you... l'm an American spy.

1008
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:48,463
Ha. You a spy?

1009
00:57:48,505 --> 00:57:50,479
Yes, I'm working undercover
with the police.

1010
00:57:50,521 --> 00:57:51,666
We're about to crack a big case!

1011
00:57:51,706 --> 00:57:54,356
Shut your mouth, George.
Not another word.

1012
00:57:54,394 --> 00:57:57,525
You're a stupid cab driver,
like your father was a stupid cab driver.

1013
00:57:57,562 --> 00:57:58,969
What kind of case could you crack?

1014
00:57:59,002 --> 00:58:00,278
Can't talk about it.

1015
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:06,291
From this moment on, don't ever ask me
about my business!

1016
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,359
Come with me, schmuck. Now.

1017
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,072
We need to get out of the city.

1018
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:20,213
We're not going anywhere till you tell us
exactly what's going on.

1019
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,745
Did you steal that list
from the triads?

1020
00:58:21,787 --> 00:58:24,787
Genevieve, we cannot help you
until you tell us the truth.

1021
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:26,768
Where is Shy Shen?

1022
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:30,576
It's right here.

1023
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:33,817
Holy mother of Jesus!
She's a man.

1024
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:36,404
I went to second base
with a damn Frenchman.

1025
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:37,753
<i>It's The Crying Games.</i>

1026
00:58:37,787 --> 00:58:39,610
<i>I'm Brokeback Carter. Oh, God.</i>

1027
00:58:39,643 --> 00:58:41,334
I'm not a man. It's just a wig.

1028
00:58:41,372 --> 00:58:43,511
You sure about that? Huh?

1029
00:58:43,548 --> 00:58:45,206
Lee, go over there
and check the hardware.

1030
00:58:45,243 --> 00:58:47,415
If she got anything in her bag
bigger than a three-iron...

1031
00:58:47,452 --> 00:58:48,696
we gonna beat his ass!

1032
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:51,187
I'm a woman, James.
A woman who needs a way out.

1033
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:52,472
You have to help me.

1034
00:58:52,508 --> 00:58:54,451
- You have Shy Shen?
- No.

1035
00:58:54,492 --> 00:58:56,401
I am Shy Shen.

1036
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:07,548
In ancient times, when the triads
would select new leaders...

1037
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:10,297
they would secretly tattoo
the names onto a woman...

1038
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,330
a woman who could carry
the list of Shy Shen...

1039
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:16,918
to the 35 provinces of China.

1040
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:20,307
When her journey ended
and the new leaders were informed...

1041
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,449
the woman would be beheaded
and buried forever.

1042
00:59:23,486 --> 00:59:25,820
No records, no witnesses.

1043
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,512
What type of tradition is that?

1044
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:29,654
Have these guys ever heard of
a damn fax machine?

1045
00:59:29,695 --> 00:59:32,444
Kenji made me do it,
said it was a great honor.

1046
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:35,348
I wanted to do it for him.
For the brotherhood.

1047
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,951
Then why did you
send the names to Han?

1048
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,445
Because I thought the World Court
could protect me.

1049
00:59:39,486 --> 00:59:42,170
But now I see... nobody can.

1050
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,476
You are messed up
in some weird shit, lady.

1051
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,332
I mean man.
Whatever the hell you are.

1052
00:59:46,367 --> 00:59:47,709
I'm a woman!

1053
00:59:47,742 --> 00:59:50,939
And they will send a army to kill me.
To protect their way.

1054
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:53,147
You know what?
We can't fight no army, Lee.

1055
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:55,255
Who gonna protect me? I mean us?

1056
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,334
I know a place.

1057
01:00:06,528 --> 01:00:08,830
I won't be here
when you come out. I'm sorry.

1058
01:00:08,863 --> 01:00:12,693
My wife says I can't be a spy,
that I have to be home for dinner.

1059
01:00:12,736 --> 01:00:15,900
The truth is I'm a driver.
Nothing more.

1060
01:00:15,937 --> 01:00:17,595
This is my destiny.

1061
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:20,185
I will never know what it's like
to be an American.

1062
01:00:20,224 --> 01:00:22,974
Never know what it feels like
to kill for no reason.

1063
01:00:23,009 --> 01:00:24,699
George, it's OK.

1064
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,193
Thank you.

1065
01:00:27,233 --> 01:00:29,437
<i>Au revoir. And good luck.</i>

1066
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:31,775
<i>- Au revoir.
- Bye, George.</i>

1067
01:00:39,777 --> 01:00:41,469
Minister Reynard.

1068
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:43,768
We have it.

1069
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:48,993
The Shy Shen list?
This is incredible.

1070
01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:50,302
Some people said it was a myth.

1071
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:53,022
Naw, it's no myth.
I've seen it. Felt it.

1072
01:00:53,058 --> 01:00:54,814
Kissed it.
But I didn't French kiss it.

1073
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,760
You do understand
how dangerous this is?

1074
01:00:56,803 --> 01:00:58,177
I was gonna use protection.

1075
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,933
Can we go to the police?

1076
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:02,588
The triads control
too many of them here.

1077
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,863
We have to get you
out of the country.

1078
01:01:05,826 --> 01:01:07,103
Now, my dear...

1079
01:01:07,138 --> 01:01:10,881
would you mind taking off that wig
and showing us Shy Shen?

1080
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:12,769
We never told him she was the list.

1081
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:23,581
Look at that. 13 names linked
to centuries of tradition.

1082
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:26,653
The only real proof
that their secret world exists.

1083
01:01:33,796 --> 01:01:35,422
Ugh!

1084
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,119
Genevieve, get their guns.

1085
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:48,260
I told you he was bad.
Didn't I tell you?

1086
01:01:48,293 --> 01:01:49,951
No.

1087
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:51,068
Well, I was thinkin' it.

1088
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:52,418
The explosion at the embassy.

1089
01:01:52,453 --> 01:01:54,111
As head of
the World Criminal Court...

1090
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:56,254
it would make sense
for me to be a target.

1091
01:01:56,293 --> 01:01:57,754
Why did you come to my room?

1092
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,936
Genevieve was going to be killed.

1093
01:01:59,973 --> 01:02:04,130
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

1094
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:06,337
Now, it will end another way.

1095
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:09,407
Ha ha. It's over, Reynard.

1096
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:11,835
You know what it's like
for old men in prison?

1097
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:14,813
They call you "pops."
They make you work in the library.

1098
01:02:14,854 --> 01:02:17,123
Your best friend? Gonna be a mouse.

1099
01:02:18,854 --> 01:02:21,888
I'm not going to prison.

1100
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:24,065
You have a phone call, Inspector.

1101
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:32,032
Hello, brother.

1102
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:33,729
I'd like to make a trade.

1103
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:37,509
Some friends of mine came across
something in Los Angeles.

1104
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:39,877
Something very valuable.

1105
01:02:40,839 --> 01:02:42,400
Lee.

1106
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:44,414
Help me, please.

1107
01:02:47,304 --> 01:02:48,897
Do we understand each other?

1108
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:50,015
What do you want?

1109
01:02:50,055 --> 01:02:51,714
Shy Shen.

1110
01:02:51,752 --> 01:02:54,502
You and Genevieve
will meet me alone tonight.

1111
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:58,846
If I see your partner
or any other cops, the girl dies.

1112
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:00,866
Where?

1113
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:05,890
Jules Verne restaurant, midnight.
Don't be late.

1114
01:03:38,613 --> 01:03:41,213
He brought the girl.
Send the elevator down.

1115
01:04:12,523 --> 01:04:15,011
Welcome to the party, Lee.

1116
01:04:16,107 --> 01:04:18,528
Tonight we celebrate
the return of Shy Shen...

1117
01:04:18,572 --> 01:04:21,420
and the return of my brother.

1118
01:04:21,452 --> 01:04:23,045
Where is Soo Yung?

1119
01:04:30,796 --> 01:04:31,909
Ungh.

1120
01:04:39,244 --> 01:04:40,805
This sword has a past.

1121
01:04:40,845 --> 01:04:44,423
And like ours, it has seen
much pain, much blood.

1122
01:04:44,461 --> 01:04:46,054
Urgh!

1123
01:04:48,109 --> 01:04:51,655
Hundreds of years ago
the triads would kill their enemies...

1124
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:53,930
with 100 cuts to the body.

1125
01:04:53,965 --> 01:04:57,348
They would be very careful to avoid
any major arteries...

1126
01:04:57,389 --> 01:05:00,935
so that the victim would stay alive
for as long as possible.

1127
01:05:02,158 --> 01:05:05,541
You have just experienced
your first cut.

1128
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,649
If anything happens to Soo Yung--

1129
01:05:10,062 --> 01:05:13,543
You could never kill me, Lee.
We both know that.

1130
01:05:13,582 --> 01:05:15,589
You know nothing about me.

1131
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:20,103
I know you have no wife,
no children, no family.

1132
01:05:20,142 --> 01:05:23,339
Your life ended when we were kids,
back in Chenzhou.

1133
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:31,461
You have nothing. Just like me.

1134
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:34,382
I wouldn't say nothin'!

1135
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,974
He has me.

1136
01:05:41,007 --> 01:05:43,146
His brother from another mother.

1137
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:50,766
Where is she?

1138
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,490
Enjoying the view.

1139
01:05:56,048 --> 01:05:57,226
Soo Yung!

1140
01:05:57,264 --> 01:05:58,824
Lee!

1141
01:06:00,336 --> 01:06:01,831
Help.

1142
01:06:03,984 --> 01:06:05,194
Let her go.

1143
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:06,695
What the hell is wrong with you?

1144
01:06:06,737 --> 01:06:08,232
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

1145
01:06:08,274 --> 01:06:09,833
Get her in here!

1146
01:06:10,737 --> 01:06:12,559
Carter, drop the gun.

1147
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,967
Get her off that damn rope,
or I'm shootin' you...

1148
01:06:14,001 --> 01:06:15,594
and the damn Temptations.

1149
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:16,714
Right now!

1150
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:20,423
Oh, no! Lee!

1151
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,247
Lee.

1152
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:24,906
- Do it!
- Put her down!

1153
01:06:24,946 --> 01:06:26,473
I'm serious!

1154
01:06:27,537 --> 01:06:28,879
I'm not playin'!

1155
01:06:28,914 --> 01:06:31,335
You ain't my damn brother.

1156
01:06:31,377 --> 01:06:32,458
Kenji.

1157
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:34,385
- Drop the gun.
- No.

1158
01:06:34,418 --> 01:06:35,466
Drop it, Carter.

1159
01:06:36,467 --> 01:06:37,896
Shit.

1160
01:06:37,938 --> 01:06:39,531
Damn it.

1161
01:06:43,635 --> 01:06:45,522
- Tonight I lose a brother.
- Aah!

1162
01:06:52,915 --> 01:06:54,376
Get him, Lee!

1163
01:06:56,276 --> 01:06:57,901
Gonna get your ass kicked, Kenji.

1164
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,956
Come on, kill him already!

1165
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,969
Lee, he might be your brother,
but turn him into your sister.

1166
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:38,988
Watch out!

1167
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:45,262
Yeah!

1168
01:07:45,301 --> 01:07:46,959
Bring your little ass here.
Come here.

1169
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:51,629
Aaaargh.

1170
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:52,946
Give me your hand.

1171
01:07:57,558 --> 01:07:58,987
Nnngh!

1172
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,892
Ah!

1173
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:07,540
- Grrrah!
- Aaaah!

1174
01:08:08,663 --> 01:08:11,281
Lee? Lee!

1175
01:08:11,318 --> 01:08:13,424
- Gnn!
- Hold on, I'm comin'!

1176
01:08:20,919 --> 01:08:22,348
Get the hell off me.

1177
01:08:28,503 --> 01:08:29,681
Oh.

1178
01:08:39,992 --> 01:08:41,585
Yeah, Lee!

1179
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:44,147
Whoo!

1180
01:08:45,176 --> 01:08:46,321
Whoa!

1181
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:24,273
Yaaaaah!

1182
01:09:30,331 --> 01:09:31,858
Ah! Ahhhh!

1183
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:34,233
Ahh... ah...

1184
01:09:34,267 --> 01:09:36,023
Ahhhh! God da--

1185
01:10:07,931 --> 01:10:09,273
Enough, Kenji!

1186
01:10:09,308 --> 01:10:10,901
Grrrargh!

1187
01:10:18,396 --> 01:10:20,731
Aaaaah!

1188
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,677
Rrrraaaargh!

1189
01:10:38,653 --> 01:10:39,962
Rrrraargh!

1190
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:43,321
Hoh hoh hoh hoh
hoh hoh hoh!

1191
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:48,316
# Everybody was
kung-fu fightin' #

1192
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:50,555
# The man was fast as ligh-- #

1193
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:52,183
Soo Yung!

1194
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,369
Aaaaah!

1195
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:06,708
What are you waiting for? Do it!

1196
01:11:10,463 --> 01:11:11,674
Ah!

1197
01:11:13,343 --> 01:11:14,871
Ungh!

1198
01:11:19,391 --> 01:11:20,984
Let go.

1199
01:11:21,024 --> 01:11:22,398
Or we're both gonna die.

1200
01:11:22,432 --> 01:11:23,992
No! I can save you.

1201
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,806
Ungh. Grrn.

1202
01:11:30,849 --> 01:11:32,125
Guh.

1203
01:11:33,632 --> 01:11:34,744
Goodbye, Lee.

1204
01:11:34,784 --> 01:11:35,995
No, Kenji!

1205
01:11:40,289 --> 01:11:42,362
No!

1206
01:11:46,337 --> 01:11:47,449
Aaah!

1207
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:52,825
Ah...

1208
01:11:57,377 --> 01:11:58,805
Gah!

1209
01:11:59,617 --> 01:12:00,730
Unh.

1210
01:12:02,658 --> 01:12:05,276
Aaaah!

1211
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:12,319
I'm comin', Soo Yung!

1212
01:12:16,963 --> 01:12:18,904
Oh, my God!

1213
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:22,391
What the hell am I doin' up here?

1214
01:12:23,683 --> 01:12:25,373
Aah! Help.

1215
01:12:28,323 --> 01:12:30,657
Stay cool, lady.
This doesn't have to end this way.

1216
01:12:32,003 --> 01:12:34,556
Don't do it. Don't do it, lady.

1217
01:12:34,595 --> 01:12:36,286
Don't you do it!

1218
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:38,520
Think about what you doin'.

1219
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:39,992
Please.

1220
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:41,726
Please. No.

1221
01:12:41,764 --> 01:12:43,290
Hey. Hey!

1222
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:46,594
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

1223
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,450
No.

1224
01:12:50,403 --> 01:12:51,614
Please.

1225
01:12:51,652 --> 01:12:54,107
Aaah! Oh, no! No!

1226
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:55,937
No!

1227
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:57,434
Aaaah!

1228
01:12:57,476 --> 01:12:58,524
Ah!

1229
01:12:58,565 --> 01:13:00,419
Aaah!

1230
01:13:00,452 --> 01:13:02,241
Ah! Aaah!

1231
01:13:02,276 --> 01:13:03,771
Ah! Aaaaaaah!

1232
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:05,089
Oh! Oh.

1233
01:13:05,124 --> 01:13:06,073
Oh.

1234
01:13:19,236 --> 01:13:20,764
Huh!

1235
01:13:21,381 --> 01:13:23,836
Uh! Uh!

1236
01:13:23,877 --> 01:13:25,885
Uh!

1237
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:32,350
Lee! You shoulda seen us, man.
We whupped their ass.

1238
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,528
Soo Yung!

1239
01:13:34,565 --> 01:13:36,159
I'm OK.

1240
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,197
Oh, shit!

1241
01:13:40,934 --> 01:13:42,341
Call the police.

1242
01:14:16,104 --> 01:14:17,052
Ungh!

1243
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:31,456
Ohhhhh!

1244
01:14:36,074 --> 01:14:37,218
Ah... yah!

1245
01:14:37,256 --> 01:14:38,533
Yeah!

1246
01:14:38,569 --> 01:14:39,779
Whoa! Whoa!

1247
01:14:39,817 --> 01:14:41,890
Whoa-oa! Whoa!

1248
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:43,555
Rah! Hah! Carter!

1249
01:14:43,593 --> 01:14:45,000
- Hold on!
- Aaah!

1250
01:14:45,609 --> 01:14:48,129
Ah! Yaaaaah!

1251
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,543
- Aaaaah!
- Aaah!

1252
01:14:49,578 --> 01:14:51,171
Gnn.

1253
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:52,192
Ah! Oh!

1254
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:54,274
- Hang on!
- Lee! Reel me in.

1255
01:14:54,314 --> 01:14:56,583
- I got you!
- Black people don't fly.

1256
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,244
Get me up. Get me up.

1257
01:14:58,282 --> 01:15:00,223
Come on, man. Hurry up.

1258
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:01,477
Ungh.

1259
01:15:01,514 --> 01:15:04,361
Oh! Lee! Get me outta here!

1260
01:15:04,394 --> 01:15:07,394
Ungh. Argh. Ah.

1261
01:15:07,434 --> 01:15:08,514
Don't let go of that flag!

1262
01:15:08,555 --> 01:15:10,180
- Argh.
- Ah!

1263
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,226
Ungh.

1264
01:15:12,266 --> 01:15:13,542
Ah!

1265
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,684
- Ah.
- Thank you, Lee.

1266
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,369
Carter! Hold on to the flag!

1267
01:15:22,411 --> 01:15:23,841
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1268
01:15:23,884 --> 01:15:25,924
- Aaaaah!
- Aaaaah!

1269
01:15:27,275 --> 01:15:30,439
- Aaaaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

1270
01:15:30,475 --> 01:15:31,937
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

1271
01:15:31,979 --> 01:15:32,994
Aaaah!

1272
01:15:33,035 --> 01:15:35,010
Aaaaaaaah!

1273
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:45,737
Lee, I'm gonna kill you
if we don't die!

1274
01:15:47,564 --> 01:15:50,282
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

1275
01:15:50,316 --> 01:15:53,480
Oh, dear Lord, please!
Baby Jesus, help us!

1276
01:15:55,213 --> 01:15:58,923
- Aaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaah!

1277
01:16:00,717 --> 01:16:02,724
Lee! Where you at?

1278
01:16:02,765 --> 01:16:05,034
I'm drownin'! I'm drownin'!

1279
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:07,458
Get this thing off me, Lee!

1280
01:16:11,757 --> 01:16:13,252
- Carter.
- What?

1281
01:16:13,294 --> 01:16:15,977
I'm not constipated anymore.

1282
01:16:25,006 --> 01:16:27,014
Put your hands up.

1283
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:28,133
Genevieve.

1284
01:16:28,174 --> 01:16:30,313
Hey, man, you're the head
of the World Court.

1285
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:32,489
What you gonna do,
shoot us down like animals?

1286
01:16:32,526 --> 01:16:33,803
We're police officers.

1287
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,588
Yes. And you two
just killed this girl.

1288
01:16:36,623 --> 01:16:37,964
Blew her brains out.

1289
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,065
- Carter!
- Don't do it!

1290
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:03,982
Carter.

1291
01:17:04,016 --> 01:17:06,437
- You all right?
- Put the gun down.

1292
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,171
I followed you.

1293
01:17:10,064 --> 01:17:12,235
Case closed.

1294
01:17:18,896 --> 01:17:20,489
Good job, man.

1295
01:17:30,866 --> 01:17:32,557
Hey, man! You touch me again...

1296
01:17:32,593 --> 01:17:34,088
you gonna owe me
dinner and a movie.

1297
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,209
Congratulations.

1298
01:17:35,249 --> 01:17:38,217
It appears we have finally
brought down the triads.

1299
01:17:38,257 --> 01:17:39,915
- We?!
- You didn't do shit.

1300
01:17:39,954 --> 01:17:41,230
My butt still hurts.

1301
01:17:42,226 --> 01:17:43,655
The Americans and the French...

1302
01:17:43,698 --> 01:17:46,219
need to work together
in the spirit of brotherhood.

1303
01:17:46,258 --> 01:17:48,113
Together, we can do anything.

1304
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:49,707
Anything! Ha ha ha.

1305
01:17:49,746 --> 01:17:51,753
He's right, Lee.
Together, we can do anything.

1306
01:17:51,793 --> 01:17:52,776
You go this way...

1307
01:17:52,818 --> 01:17:54,280
And I'll go that way.

1308
01:17:57,523 --> 01:17:58,449
# War #

1309
01:17:58,483 --> 01:18:00,523
# Huh, yeah #

1310
01:18:00,563 --> 01:18:02,450
# What is it good for? #

1311
01:18:02,482 --> 01:18:03,977
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1312
01:18:04,018 --> 01:18:05,775
# Uh-huh #

1313
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:06,739
# War #

1314
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:08,593
# Huh, yeah #

1315
01:18:08,627 --> 01:18:10,798
# What is it good for? #

1316
01:18:10,835 --> 01:18:12,361
- # Absolutely #

1317
01:18:12,403 --> 01:18:13,897
# Say it again, y'all #

1318
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:14,867
# War #

1319
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,038
# Huh, look out #

1320
01:18:17,076 --> 01:18:19,017
# What is it good for? #

1321
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,467
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1322
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,426
# Listen to me #

1323
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,704
# Ohhhh, war! #

1324
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:25,774
That's right, Lee.
For the last 3 years...

1325
01:18:25,812 --> 01:18:27,754
I've studied the ancient teaching
of booty. Ev--

1326
01:18:27,796 --> 01:18:29,771
Oh, booty. Ha ha ha ha!

1327
01:18:29,812 --> 01:18:31,219
Cheese!

1328
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:32,845
- Ha ha ha!
- "Cheese"?

1329
01:18:32,884 --> 01:18:35,153
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- What?

1330
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:37,327
- Freeze.
- Oh, freeze!

1331
01:18:38,228 --> 01:18:40,650
As soon as she could blink,
the s--seafood service--

1332
01:18:40,693 --> 01:18:42,449
- Seaf--seafood--
- Secret Service.

1333
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:43,728
As soon as sh--she could blink...

1334
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:45,619
the sheafood shervish--
Uh, swa--

1335
01:18:45,653 --> 01:18:46,765
Secret Service.

1336
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:49,172
The ssssseaf--

1337
01:18:49,205 --> 01:18:50,896
Secret, not seafood.

1338
01:18:50,933 --> 01:18:52,274
I know seafood.

1339
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:53,554
- I know secret.
- Secret.

1340
01:18:53,589 --> 01:18:55,116
- Secret.
- Secret. See?

1341
01:18:55,157 --> 01:18:57,906
But when everything together,
it become a seafood!

1342
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,948
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

1343
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,680
Action!

1344
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:03,888
- I'm sorry! So sorry.
- It came off.

1345
01:19:03,926 --> 01:19:05,268
Action!

1346
01:19:05,302 --> 01:19:06,796
- Oh, shit. You all right?
- Yeah, good.

1347
01:19:06,838 --> 01:19:09,456
That was my... Muhammad Ali swing, man!

1348
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:11,217
Yeah, baby!

1349
01:19:13,622 --> 01:19:14,637
Ooh.

1350
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:16,588
- Oh.
- Whoa.

1351
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:18,288
- That's the one, Mama.
- That would have been it.

1352
01:19:18,327 --> 01:19:19,406
I'm sick of you, Kenji.

1353
01:19:19,446 --> 01:19:22,708
You been tryin' to kill us
ever since the start of this damn movie.

1354
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:25,676
- Raaaaah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1355
01:19:25,718 --> 01:19:27,213
Ah!

1356
01:19:27,894 --> 01:19:28,974
Ah!

1357
01:19:29,015 --> 01:19:29,963
Action.

1358
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:32,592
Action.

1359
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:34,446
Action.

1360
01:19:34,487 --> 01:19:35,763
Ooph!

1361
01:19:35,799 --> 01:19:37,076
You OK?

1362
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:40,620
So her eye is a little
droopy now and she's--

1363
01:19:40,663 --> 01:19:42,606
So she's working for
El Loc--Lar El Poco.

1364
01:19:42,647 --> 01:19:43,890
- Ha ha ha.
- I'm sorry.

1365
01:19:43,928 --> 01:19:45,236
It's El Pollo Loco.

1366
01:19:45,272 --> 01:19:47,890
So sh--now she works at
El Lolo Poco.

1367
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:49,073
El Pollo Loco.

1368
01:19:49,112 --> 01:19:51,152
El Lo--Loro Poco. Uh.

1369
01:19:51,192 --> 01:19:52,271
El Poco Loco.

1370
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:53,392
El Loco Poco.

1371
01:19:53,432 --> 01:19:55,734
So--so she works at Elo--Loco Poco,
so what?

1372
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:57,741
Ha ha!

1373
01:19:57,784 --> 01:19:59,955
And... So she works for
El L--Loro Poco.

1374
01:19:59,992 --> 01:20:02,032
- Ha ha ha.
- El Pollo Loco.

1375
01:20:02,073 --> 01:20:03,599
- No, we gonna go past that...
- Ha ha ha!

1376
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,818
...'cause I'm not gettin' that tonight.

1377
01:20:04,856 --> 01:20:06,034
El Pollo Loco.

1378
01:20:06,072 --> 01:20:07,829
El--Ohh! Jackie!

1379
01:20:07,864 --> 01:20:09,391
- El Pollo Loco!
- Whoo!

1380
01:20:16,857 --> 01:20:18,133
The mom's gone.

1381
01:20:19,257 --> 01:20:20,784
Maybe we should
put on a dirty movie.

1382
01:20:20,826 --> 01:20:22,102
Lee!

1383
01:20:22,137 --> 01:20:24,145
- I like the ones with a story.
- What?

1384
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:26,455
- I like the one with a locker-room scene.
- What?

1385
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:27,919
I like the one with a prison scene.

1386
01:20:27,962 --> 01:20:29,272
I like the one with a shower scene.

1387
01:20:29,306 --> 01:20:30,713
I like the ones with a white girl.

1388
01:20:30,746 --> 01:20:32,088
I'm into feet.

1389
01:20:32,122 --> 01:20:33,747
I like the one with the horses.

1390
01:20:33,786 --> 01:20:35,379
- What's that mean?
- Damn.

1391
01:20:35,418 --> 01:20:36,563
What he teach me?

1392
01:20:36,602 --> 01:20:37,748
That's it, one more, one more.
Last one.

1393
01:20:37,786 --> 01:20:39,127
Are you teaching me a bad word?

1394
01:20:39,163 --> 01:20:40,624
I like the one with hairy woman.

1395
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:41,745
What's wrong with you?

1396
01:20:41,787 --> 01:20:42,899
I don't know. Brett Ratner tell--

1397
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,826
- teach me that.
- He'll teach you anything.

1398
01:20:44,858 --> 01:20:46,451
And you're not my brother.

1399
01:20:46,491 --> 01:20:49,241
I'm not your brother?

1400
01:20:49,275 --> 01:20:51,184
All the stuff we've been through?

1401
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:54,261

01:22:41,376 --> 01:22:47,770
# I have less than an hour #

1438
01:22:49,377 --> 01:22:56,566
# I have less than an hour #

1439
01:22:56,608 --> 01:22:58,037
# Mmm #

1440
01:22:58,081 --> 01:22:59,510
# Oh, oh, oh #

1441
01:22:59,553 --> 01:23:03,644
# Funny how time flies
when you're having fun #

1442
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:05,088
# Yeah, you know #

1443
01:23:05,121 --> 01:23:07,543
# But I got to do
what must be done #

1444
01:23:07,586 --> 01:23:10,007
# We're on a winning streak,
we survived the killing streets #

1445
01:23:10,049 --> 01:23:12,439
# Now you at the crap table
where the real villains meet #

1446
01:23:12,482 --> 01:23:14,205
# Number 7 might get you to heaven #

1447
01:23:14,242 --> 01:23:16,543
# You break the bank,
just might make you a legend #

1448
01:23:16,577 --> 01:23:18,912
# 'Cause after 11
you plan to get some poker face #

1449
01:23:18,946 --> 01:23:21,085
# Genie eyes, light green,
sipping on Bellinis #

1450
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:22,977
# You play your cards right,
she'll let you touch #

1451
01:23:23,009 --> 01:23:25,279
# She be a devil in disguise, lady incubus #

1452
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:26,743
# Better know who to trust #

1453
01:23:26,786 --> 01:23:29,918
# She might roll with thugs
who roll bodies up in Asian rugs #

1454
01:23:29,955 --> 01:23:31,362
# I'm-a rush up and move on 'em #

1455
01:23:31,394 --> 01:23:32,604
# Put the ooze on 'em #

1456
01:23:32,642 --> 01:23:35,938
# The crews do somethin' new
and formal, yeah #

1457
01:23:35,971 --> 01:23:40,510
# I have less than an hour #

1458
01:23:40,546 --> 01:23:43,329
# Ohh, time rolls away, baby #

1459
01:23:43,363 --> 01:23:49,343
# I have less than an hour #

1460
01:23:49,379 --> 01:23:53,208
# Whoo, mmm #

1461
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:59,395
# I'm in the pursuit
of my own personal power #

1462
01:23:59,428 --> 01:24:02,843
# And I only have an hour #

1463
01:24:02,843 --> 01:25:10,843
