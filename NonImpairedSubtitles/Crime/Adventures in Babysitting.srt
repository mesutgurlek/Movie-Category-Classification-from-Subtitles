1
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:18,065
 Well, he walked up to me
and he asked me if I wanted to dance

2
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:24,751
 He looked kind of nice
and so I said I might take a chance

3
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,586
 When he danced he held me tight

4
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:33,864
 And when he walked me home
that night

5
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,666
 All the stars were shining bright

6
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:38,829
 And then he kissed me

7
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:44,502
 Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again

8
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:51,546
 I wanted to let him know
that he was more than a friend

9
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:57,146
 I didn't know just what to do

10
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:00,587
 So I whispered I love you

11
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:03,833
 And he said that he loved me too

12
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:06,865
 And then he kissed me

13
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:12,064
 He kissed me in a way
that I've never been kissed before

14
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:19,468
 He kissed me in a way
that I want to be kissed for evermore

15
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:25,545
 I knew that he was mine
so I gave him all the love that I had

16
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:32,311
 And one day he took me home
to meet his mom and his dad

17
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,744
 Then he asked me to be his bride

18
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:41,865
 And always be right by his side

19
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:44,587
 I felt so happy I almost cried

20
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:47,068
 And then he kissed me

21
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:54,148
 And then he kissed me

22
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,826
 And then he kissed me

23
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:03,547
- [car horn]
- Oh, God. He's here.

24
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,869
[door bell]

25
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:10,710
OK Chris, just relax.

26
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,143
Tonight is going to be the greatest
night of your life.

27
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:18,471
Hi.

28
00:02:23,673 --> 00:02:25,629
Hi, Chris.

29
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:28,904
- l'm a little bit overdressed.
- No, it's just...

30
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:32,829
l got to cancel.

31
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:39,065
My little sister got sick and my
parents are going out tonight.

32
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:41,468
Well, l could come over and help out.

33
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:44,821
We could make some chicken soup
or something.

34
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:46,830
No, you don't want to be there.

35
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:50,502
She's contagious.
l don't want you to get sick.

36
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:56,308
We'll do the French restaurant thing
next week, OK?

37
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:57,991
OK.

38
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,151
When?

39
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:03,381
l don't know. Friday, Saturday.

40
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:06,311
l got to get going.
My sister's waiting for me.

41
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,902
You're upset about tonight,
aren't you?

42
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,386
No.

43
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,227
Well, yeah, a little.
But l understand.

44
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:20,949
You know, Chris...

45
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:24,227
Girls like you come along
once in a lifetime.

46
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,024
Whoa!

47
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:33,470
Contagious.

48
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:39,747
- Contagious?
- Yeah, that's what he said.

49
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:42,103
He's lying.

50
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,143
Brenda...!

51
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:45,946
l don't know why you're making
such a big deal about him.

52
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:48,667
He's the best thing that's ever
happened to me.

53
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:51,307
He's the only thing that's ever
happened to you.

54
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,151
That's why we've got to get out.

55
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:56,982
lt's like a Dairy Queen.
You only get one flavour.

56
00:03:57,113 --> 00:04:00,071
You know, l asked you over here
to cheer me up.

57
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:03,947
- l feel worse.
- Oh, Chris, l'm sorry.

58
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:05,552
[phone rings]

59
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:09,791
l'm just in a really bad mood.
My parents are driving me crazy.

60
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:11,505
My stepmom is such a pain.

61
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:15,182
lf l don't get out of the house l'm
going to spike her Tab with Drano.

62
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:17,269
Don't do that.

63
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:19,861
[knock on door] Chris?

64
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,949
- Hi, Brenda.
- Hi.

65
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:23,552
Hi, Mom.

66
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:25,106
That was Mrs Anderson.

67
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:28,191
She wants to know if you can babysit
for her tonight.

68
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:32,233
- No. Tell her l can't.
- Why not?

69
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:35,345
- Wait, aren't we doing something?
- l have to go home.

70
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:39,543
Because l want to stay home
and be depressed.

71
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:42,141
Sit for the Andersons.
That'll depress anyone.

72
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:45,029
l'm too old to babysit.

73
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:50,346
 Sometimes you know
what you're looking for

74
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:58,025
 Sometimes you don't make it
out the door

75
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:04,351
 This time I know what I'm doing

76
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:08,264
 I'm not fooling
cos I just can't stop

77
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:11,829
 Trying to get a hold on you

78
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,142
Guess what, Brad?

79
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:22,912
Mom is going to kill you for wearing
skates indoors.

80
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,422
Mom's got to catch me first.
Guess what?

81
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,070
l don't care, winghead.

82
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:30,423
Mom got Chris to babysit for me.

83
00:05:31,313 --> 00:05:33,190
Chris?

84
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:35,869
Oh, my...

85
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,869
- Sara!
- Bye!

86
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:45,431
 The night was long
and the road was rough

87
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:50,831
[mutters] Chris is coming!

88
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:53,672
Would you get out of the way?
Chris is coming.

89
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:59,424
 Now that I've found you
I'll hold on tight

90
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:04,422
 Never gonna let you
out of my sight

91
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:08,502
Oh, no.

92
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:12,144
Hi, Chris. Come on in.

93
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:18,429
Thanks a million for this.
l'm sorry about the short notice.

94
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,783
No problem.
l'm glad l could help.

95
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,386
Sara.

96
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:37,183
- Did you take my Clearasil again?
- l ran out of brown.

97
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,907
Great. How am l supposed
to cover up my zits?

98
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,786
- You want some orange?
- l can't use paint.

99
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:46,587
What do you think?
l figure it's my best yet.

100
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:49,705
l got the sun rays and the cape
and the special helmet...

101
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:53,667
Great! You wasted all my Clearasil
on another picture of Thor?

102
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:56,271
Thor's my hero.

103
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:58,702
- Thor's a homo.
- ls not.

104
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,589
- Yeah, he is.
- ls not.

105
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:07,225
- Thor's a complete homo.
- Take it back, Brad.

106
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,264
Take back what you said about Thor.

107
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:12,863
Take it back, Brad.
Take back what you said about Thor.

108
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:15,427
You are going to kill somebody
with these things.

109
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:18,545
Take back what you said about Thor!

110
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:20,228
No.

111
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,390
lf you don't take it back,

112
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:27,949
l'll tell Chris about all those love
poems you write about her.

113
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,462
All right, Sara. l'm sorry.

114
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:33,232
- Thor's not a homo.
- Thank you.

115
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,071
- Hi, Chris.
- Hi.

116
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:37,149
[laughs]

117
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:40,666
Hi.

118
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,066
Hi.

119
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:46,071
- You didn't just hear what my...
- No.

120
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:47,751
Cool.

121
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:50,782
Boy, you look great. l mean, really.

122
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:55,190
Your hair. Your eyes.

123
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,269
What about them?

124
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:02,029
They're so well placed.

125
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,867
- Brad, relax.
- Relax.

126
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,749
Take your coat?

127
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:11,706
Sorry. l'm sorry.

128
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,427
- l didn't...
- Thank you.

129
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:20,110
Boy, this is a really cool coat.
No way is this from Sears.

130
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,622
This is way too cool.

131
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:25,586
- lt was my grandpa's.
- He's got great taste.

132
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,624
He's dead.

133
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:33,344
Brad, stop fawning all over Chris.

134
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:35,429
Come on in the kitchen, honey.

135
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:41,425
- Yeah, she did.
- We played bridge the other night.

136
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:44,149
- Hi.
- Hiya, Chris.

137
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:48,741
- Brad did it.
- Clean it up.

138
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:50,832
Sure, mom.

139
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:53,706
All right, Chris.
l left some notes for you.

140
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,030
We're going to be at a reception
at the Associates Centre. Here.

141
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:00,463
Sara is not to wear her skates
in the house.

142
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:03,107
Now, Sara, Chris is in charge, OK?

143
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,746
Sure.

144
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:06,591
Can we go to Häagen-Dazs?

145
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,023
Well, yes.
But don't go too late, all right?

146
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:14,791
Brad will stay at his friend Daryl's
tonight, so don't worry about him.

147
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:17,507
This one is just getting over
a very bad cough...

148
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,385
lt's been almost two weeks.

149
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,788
..so l want her to take some of this.

150
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:26,145
Give her a spoonful in about an hour
and another before she goes to bed.

151
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,833
Will you stop eating chocolate?

152
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:31,387
You're going to have zits
all over your face.

153
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:34,192
Mom...!

154
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:36,062
Jesus!

155
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:45,343
- You guys have a good time.
- We should be home by one.

156
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,592
- OK.
- Take good care of my baby.

157
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:51,824
l'll guard her with my life.

158
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,151
Bye.

159
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,549
Goodbye.

160
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,231
Brad, into the kitchen
and clean up that mess.

161
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,309
[rhythmic knocking]

162
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,309
That's the back door. l'll get it.

163
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,788
Come on, Chris.
Let's go watch some TV.

164
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,269
[knocking]

165
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:25,710
- Are you coming over or what?
- No, not any more.

166
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:27,751
- Chris is here, isn't she?
- No.

167
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:30,341
Yes she is.
That's why l'm sleeping here tonight.

168
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:31,986
- l don't think so.
- Come on.

169
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:35,025
- Did you get her clothes off yet?
- Don't be crude. Get back.

170
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:37,462
You fall in love
and suddenly you're a classy guy.

171
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,948
- l have not fallen in love.
- What's she wearing?

172
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,587
- Clothes. Now get out.
- You got to see the new Playboy.

173
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:45,864
There's this girl in it
and she looks exactly like Chris.

174
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:47,944
She's got these humongous...

175
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,228
Oh, God...!

176
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:00,349
- Who was at the door?
- Stray dog.

177
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:02,031
What?

178
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,228
- Are you going to go to college?
- Huh?

179
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:13,589
Oh, great!

180
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:15,946
Thanks, mom.

181
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,825
- You're going to college?
- No.

182
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,909
- Thank God.
- Calm down.

183
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:22,024
[phone rings]

184
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,791
Maybe it's Mike.

185
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:24,823
Hello?

186
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:27,069
Will you accept a collect call
from Brenda?

187
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:30,105
- Oh. Yeah, sure.
- Chris?

188
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:33,665
- Chris, it's Brenda.
- Brenda?

189
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,908
Chris!

190
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,706
- Brenda, what's wrong?
- Oh Chris, l'm in trouble.

191
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,745
- You're always in trouble.
- No, l'm really in trouble.

192
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:43,671
- I did it.
- You spiked her Tab with Drano?

193
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:46,705
No, l ran away from home.

194
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,471
You what?

195
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:51,710
- Where are you?
- l'm at the bus station downtown.

196
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,232
Brenda...!

197
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:56,504
- Look, just don't go anywhere.
- l don't have any money.

198
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,431
l spent it all on the cab here.

199
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,828
- Chris, l need help.
- I know.

200
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:03,147
You're in my house!

201
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:06,231
lf l take a cab to the Andersons',
could you pay for it?

202
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:10,062
Oh no, that's going to be like $40.
l don't have $40.

203
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:13,143
Well, can you pick me up?

204
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:15,229
No, l'm babysitting.

205
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:18,666
I can't call anybody else.
My dad doesn't know.

206
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,784
He'd kill me if he found out.

207
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,583
l'm begging you.
lt's really scary here.

208
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:28,149
l've seen three people shoot up,
a bald Chinese lady with no pants on,

209
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:31,310
and there's this old guy outside
who wants his slippers.

210
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:34,748
Get out of my house!

211
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,549
You've just moved!

212
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:40,743
Please hurry up and get here.

213
00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:44,070
l've got my mom's car.
l can't drive it into the city.

214
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:48,709
Oh, my God. There's a man with a gun.

215
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,028
Get me the hell out of here.

216
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:53,906
Look, just hang up and sit down.

217
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,501
Don't move.
I'll be there in half an hour.

218
00:12:57,313 --> 00:13:00,783
Please hurry. l think he's going
to kill somebody. Maybe me.

219
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:03,271
Brenda?

220
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:07,508
l don't believe this. l do not.

221
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:10,147
- Who's Mike? He your boyfriend?
- Yes.

222
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:13,752
l've got to go downtown.
Brad, will you watch Sara?

223
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:15,909
No way.
What if the house explodes?

224
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:18,103
The house is not going to explode.

225
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,871
You leave him here and it will.

226
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:23,508
l will be gone an hour there
and back. That's it. OK?

227
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,305
- You guys go steady or what?
- What?

228
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:28,186
- Do you?
- Yes. Are you two listening to me?

229
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:30,429
My mom is paying you good money
to watch me.

230
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:32,145
Brad can watch you.

231
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:35,709
Why would my mom pay you good money
for Brad to watch me?

232
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,266
Sara...

233
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:39,782
- Why can't we just all go?
- Because.

234
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:43,030
- Do you like him a lot?
- No. Yes.

235
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,671
Well, which is it?

236
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,351
Yes. l like him a lot.

237
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:50,909
No, Sara, your parents would die if
they found out l took you into town.

238
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:54,867
They'd die if they found out you left
me here alone with him.

239
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:56,949
Well, who's going to tell them?

240
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:04,752
- Anybody have to go to the bathroom?
- [both] Nope.

241
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:11,709
Come on, let's go.

242
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:15,632
Now, if anybody asks,
we went for ice cream.

243
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:19,705
- Road trip?
- Jesus!

244
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:22,989
Where are you going?

245
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:25,908
- Downtown.
- The city?

246
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,149
- Hey, can l go?
- No, Daryl. Go home.

247
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:30,229
- Who is this kid?
- Stray dog.

248
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,671
Daryl Coopersmith.

249
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,833
- And you're Chris Parker, right?
- Go home.

250
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,143
- You must be a great babysitter.
- What is he talking about?

251
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:44,582
Mr and Mrs Anderson
must really trust you

252
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:47,102
to take little kids into the city.

253
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:50,673
- Alone.
- Yeah, isn't it great?

254
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:52,667
lt is so great

255
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:56,229
that l'll get my mom to talk
to the Andersons about you.

256
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,787
- Then maybe you can babysit for me.
- Stop it.

257
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:02,064
And then maybe we can
drive off to New York just for kicks.

258
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,309
- Chris...
- Daryl...

259
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,742
- You think?
- What am l supposed to do?

260
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,909
Get in the car and run him over.

261
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,910
- Let him come.
- Daryl!

262
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,263
Sorry, can't talk. Got to run.

263
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:16,349
Will you just get in the car?

264
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:19,629
All right!

265
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:24,826
Now boys, l swear if you give me
any grief over the next 60 minutes

266
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:28,548
l swear to God l'll kill you.
Dead. Murdered. Stabbed.

267
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:33,065
- Raped?
- l am too old for this crap.

268
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:39,989
 25 miles from home, girl

269
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:43,025
 My feet are hurting mighty bad

270
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,823
[Daryl] Mike what?

271
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:48,831
- [Chris] Mike what what?
- What are we talking about?

272
00:15:48,953 --> 00:15:51,592
- What's his last name?
- Todwell.

273
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:53,704
- Are you writing a book?
- Mike Todwell?

274
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,347
- Do you know him?
- They go out.

275
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,389
He's got a red Camaro, right?

276
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:02,585
Oh gee, Daryl.
Are you a gearhead and a sex fiend?

277
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,951
A lot of people have Camaros.

278
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:09,702
But do a lot of people have the
license plate SO COOL?

279
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:12,752
That's Mike.

280
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:16,263
He's the guy who beat me up for
touching his car, which l didn't do.

281
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,623
- That was him?
- Mike wouldn't do that.

282
00:16:18,753 --> 00:16:20,505
- Yes, he would.
- He would not.

283
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:23,511
He did. He kicked my ass.
Want to see the footprint?

284
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,748
[all] No.

285
00:16:26,673 --> 00:16:27,867
Look.

286
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:29,949
That's where Thor lives!

287
00:16:31,513 --> 00:16:32,389
Thor?

288
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:34,947
All the superheroes live in the city.

289
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:38,588
Spider-Man, Daredevil
and Captain America.

290
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:42,023
But Thor's the best.
He fights the forces of darkness.

291
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,829
Forces of darkness, beware.

292
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:59,104
So the babysitter goes upstairs and
the sound keeps getting louder.

293
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:02,305
Scrape, scrape, scrape.

294
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:04,389
The babysitter stops
at the kid's room.

295
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:06,583
She reaches for the doorknob.

296
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:10,069
Her hand is trembling,
her heart is beating fast.

297
00:17:10,193 --> 00:17:12,707
Sweat pours down her face.

298
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,346
She opens the door... [gasps]

299
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:16,941
and the kids are safely
in their beds.

300
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:19,509
l'd like to be safely in her bed.

301
00:17:21,553 --> 00:17:24,272
- What are you guys doing back there?
- Uh, um...

302
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,349
Nothing. Nothing at all.

303
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:28,429
Nothing. Really.

304
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,103
That was my dad's, stupid.

305
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,508
You shouldn't have
brought it along, stupid.

306
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,828
- So what happens?
- OK.

307
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:41,105
But when the babysitter looks more
closely at the kids, she sees that

308
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,303
- they don't have any faces!
- Oh, my God!

309
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,993
- lt's just a pool of mushy goo.
- Like Spaghetti-O's?

310
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:49,025
- Spaghetti-O's with meat.
- Yuk!

311
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,667
The babysitter screams
and turns to run,

312
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:55,786
but there's this big giant hairy guy
standing right in front of her.

313
00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:57,312
He raises his arm,

314
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:00,982
but there's a big metal hook

475
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:43,904
Hi! Nice to meet you.

476

lt's a nice place you got here.
Really. l love it.

- Yeah, it's... great.

00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:52,510
Look.

479
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:55,511
We sort of took a wrong turn
somewhere,

480
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:58,431
and if you don't mind,
we'd like to get out.

481
00:30:58,553 --> 00:31:00,509
Mm-hm.

482
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,391
Damn.

483
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:11,309
Hey, don't hold it in, Graydon.
Go and get pissed, man.

484
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,424
You boosted a Caddie full of kids?

485
00:31:14,553 --> 00:31:17,192
They got in the car
while l was still in there, man.

486
00:31:17,313 --> 00:31:20,862
Was l supposed to put them out on the
street? They would have been killed.

487
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:25,384
They know where our operation is.
They could go to the cops.

488
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:27,791
Sir.

489
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,709
No, we wouldn't go to the cops.

490
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:33,670
How am l supposed to know that?

491
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:39,506
Uh...

492
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,390
Uh... Hey, we can put it in writing.
We'd all sign it.

493
00:31:43,513 --> 00:31:45,583
- We can take it to a notary...
- Shut up.

494
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:50,465
Take the Brady Bunch upstairs.

495
00:31:54,193 --> 00:31:56,661
We'll take care of them
after the meeting.

496
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:00,511
All right, you guys go on home.
Clear out of here!

497
00:32:11,393 --> 00:32:14,749
Don't worry. We'll get home.
This has all just been a big mistake.

498
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:18,627
- But what about Brenda?
- That was her parents' mistake.

499

Oh, Chris, please hurry
and pick me up!

502
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,784
- lt's dead.
- Kind of like us.

503
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:12,586
- What?
- We're really in trouble.

504
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:16,702
- We're going to die here.
- No, we're not.

505
00:33:21,273 --> 00:33:25,152
Oh, no. No, we are not climbing up
there. lt is much too dangerous.

506
00:33:25,273 --> 00:33:27,867
Look at that.
You could poke your eyes out.

507
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:32,387
Yeah, well,
they might poke our brains out.

508
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:34,151
Dallas gets the Ferraris,

509
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:37,663
there's one Lamborghini to Phoenix
and Cleveland needs four Porsches.

510
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:40,307
- Forget that.
- But they got an order.

511
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:44,949
l said forget it. l didn't like the
way they've been running things.

512
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:47,909
Cleveland is dead.

513
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:41,589
We can go to that window.

514
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,108
- You got to be shitting me.
- Watch your mouth.

515
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:48,066
Watch my mouth?
You got to be shitting me.

516

- What if l fall?
- l won't let you fall.

517
00:34:57,153 --> 00:34:59,109
Thanks, Sara.

518
00:34:59,553 --> 00:35:01,509
Just be careful.

519
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:03,992
l don't think your parents will ever
ask me to babysit again.

520
00:36:04,113 --> 00:36:07,150
lf they do,
l'd ask them for a buck more an hour.

521
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:15,866
Well, multiple murder
or did Sara just cut off her finger?

522
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:18,985
- l got the answering machine.
- They went for ice cream.

523
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:21,104
They're OK. Chris can handle it.

524
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:24,828
Sure! Sara's probably hanging
from the rafters by now.

525

Where's the magazine?

- Get it.

535
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,029
Let's go. Come on. Hurry up.

They're not up there either.
They... got away.

- From the office.

Come on!

You're going to get us into
so much trouble.

544

545

Get the car.

Oh, come on. They're kids.

547
00:38:55,073 --> 00:38:58,429
What are you going to do,
run them down and kill them?

548

Get the car.

549
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:06,388
Got to get that magazine back. lt has
my notes for the Philadelphia order.

550

[henchman] That could

00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:43,711
- Oh, dear.
- What?

791
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:46,503
l am sorry. Your friend is dead.

792
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:48,066
Dead?

793
00:55:48,193 --> 00:55:49,706
Dead?

794
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,789
Dead?

795
00:55:52,753 --> 00:55:54,709
[Sara] Oh, Chris!

796
00:56:01,153 --> 00:56:03,030
Sara, what happened?

797
00:56:04,553 --> 00:56:06,350
[whispers] Brad.

798
00:56:06,473 --> 00:56:08,429
Brad!

799
00:56:14,273 --> 00:56:16,229
Daryl, why are you hugging me?

800
00:56:18,473 --> 00:56:21,112
Brad, don't you ever die on me. Ever.

801
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,908
OK. l won't.

802
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:28,103
What's going on?

803
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:29,951
What happened?

804
00:56:30,073 --> 00:56:33,270
Oh, dear, you're her friend.
She's fainted.

805
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:42,069
l had the worst nightmare.

806
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:44,629
We were stuck in this...

807
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:48,072
- lt's really happening.
- Some night, huh?

808
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:52,343
lt's all right.
l made a mistake, see? He's fine.

809
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:56,703
Now, you children,
you stay right here.

810
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:59,666
l'll send the nurse back
with the paperwork.

811
00:56:59,793 --> 00:57:01,749
Come on with me.

812
00:57:02,513 --> 00:57:05,903
Paperwork. She's going to want
to know my name and stuff.

813
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:08,149
- l'm going to call my mom.
- No, no mothers.

814
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:09,911
They'll kill us. No way.

815
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:13,582
Hey, you kids!
Where's my car, goddammit?

816
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,748
- Mr Pruitt!
- Heh-heh!

817
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:21,627
Babysitter! You want your car,
come on. lt's fixed. Let's go.

818
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:24,109
Hey, wait a minute there.

819
00:57:34,673 --> 00:57:37,745
- What are you doing here?
- l got a little banged up.

820
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:40,103
- Where's our car?
- At Dawson's garage.

821
00:57:40,233 --> 00:57:42,542
- ls her car OK?
- Yeah. l paid for the window.

822
00:57:42,673 --> 00:57:46,063
That's my fault. But Dawson's going
to make you pay for the tyre.

823
00:57:46,193 --> 00:57:47,990
- How much?
- 50 bucks.

824
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,101
- 50 bucks?
- Yeah, 50 bucks.

825
00:57:55,393 --> 00:57:57,065
- Here we go.
- Where are you going?

826
00:57:57,193 --> 00:57:59,787
- l'm a fugitive now, OK?
- Kind of like us.

827
00:58:01,113 --> 00:58:03,388
- Good luck, babysitter.
- You too, Mr Pruitt!

828
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,549
Hey, Pruitt, stop!

829
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:07,629
Hold it right there!

830
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:11,144
Where are we going to get 50 bucks?

831
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:13,741
Maybe we could sell Daryl. You think?

832
00:58:16,153 --> 00:58:18,348
We will think of something. Come on.

833
00:58:22,393 --> 00:58:25,226
- Chris, l got to make.
- You got to what?

834
00:58:25,353 --> 00:58:28,390
l got to go to the bathroom.
l've really got to go.

835
00:58:28,513 --> 00:58:31,186
- Just try and hold it, honey, OK?
- Sounds like a party.

836
00:58:31,713 --> 00:58:33,669
Looks like a party...

837
00:58:34,353 --> 00:58:35,911
lt is a party!

838
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:39,343
- Daryl, get back here.
- Sorry, can't talk. Got to run.

839
00:58:40,873 --> 00:58:43,910
Why do l have this feeling
we're never going to see him again?

840
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:47,025
Come on, Sara, you can go
to the bathroom in there.

841
00:58:47,153 --> 00:58:49,109
[music from inside]

842
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:53,549
 I've been trying to get to you

843
00:58:53,673 --> 00:58:55,425
 For a long time

844
00:58:55,553 --> 00:58:57,350
 Seems constantly that

845
00:58:57,473 --> 00:58:59,270
 You were on my mind

846
00:58:59,393 --> 00:59:03,022
 I was thinking about
a short-cut I might take

847
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:06,145
 Well, it seems like
I made a mistake

848
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:14,872
l really have to go to the bathroom.

849
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:18,148
- l have to go really bad.
- ln a minute.

850
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:28,469
- What?
- l don't believe it.

851
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:33,670
- l don't believe it.
- Who is it? Some high-lQ kids?

852
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:35,749
No, stupid, it's Miss March.

853
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:42,225
There's Daryl.

854
00:59:42,353 --> 00:59:44,309
No way!

855
00:59:47,593 --> 00:59:49,390
- lt is Miss March.
- What?

856
00:59:49,513 --> 00:59:51,743
This is amazing. Could you sign this?

857
00:59:51,873 --> 00:59:53,829
Right here.

858
00:59:57,793 --> 01:00:00,353
- l can't believe it.
- Can't believe what?

859
01:00:01,073 --> 01:00:03,064
- This is not me.
- lt sure is you.

860
01:00:03,193 --> 01:00:05,149
lt is not.

861
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:12,187
- What's your name?
- lt's not Shaylene.

862
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:17,268
- She's not Shaylene.
- Wait a minute.

863
01:00:17,393 --> 01:00:19,907
Guys, come on. Think about this.

864
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:23,143
Do you honestly believe
a Playboy centrefold

865
01:00:23,273 --> 01:00:24,831
would have nothing better to do

866
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:28,025
than to show up at a Kappa party
with a bunch of kids?

867
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:32,870
- Yeah.
- Maybe.

868
01:00:33,953 --> 01:00:35,909
Where's your brain?

869
01:00:41,473 --> 01:00:43,429
Told you it wasn't her, stupid.

870
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:45,949
Sorry.

871
01:00:47,633 --> 01:00:49,225
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

872
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:51,471
l've really got to go, Chris.

873
01:00:52,673 --> 01:00:55,983
- Where's your bathroom?
- lt's right that way.

874
01:00:56,113 --> 01:00:57,466
l'll...

875
01:00:57,913 --> 01:00:59,869
l'll take Sara to the bathroom.

876
01:01:01,513 --> 01:01:03,469
One, two, three!

877
01:01:07,513 --> 01:01:09,469
Aagghh!

878
01:01:11,113 --> 01:01:13,069
[bell rings]

879
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:19,351
- Hey, guys.
- l must be hallucinating.

880
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:22,226
Does anybody else see
a talking penis?

881
01:01:27,393 --> 01:01:29,384
Hey, speaking of penises,

882
01:01:29,513 --> 01:01:31,902
do you know
how the Playboy Unabashed Dictionary

883
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:33,989
defines oral gratification?

884
01:01:35,433 --> 01:01:37,185
l do.

885
01:01:43,553 --> 01:01:46,863
l haven't seen you around campus
much. You a freshman?

886
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,869
Sophomore.

887
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:51,751
You can't be a junior.

888
01:01:51,873 --> 01:01:53,943
l'm a senior.

889
01:01:54,073 --> 01:01:56,587
- ln high school.
- ln high school?

890
01:01:57,473 --> 01:01:58,747
Yeah.

891
01:02:00,193 --> 01:02:02,502
- l can't believe it.
- What?

892
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:08,106
The prettiest girl at the University
of Chicago is in high school.

893
01:02:09,473 --> 01:02:11,509
- Oh, that was good(!)
- No, l mean it.

894
01:02:12,033 --> 01:02:13,102
Yeah?

895
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,985
[song comes to an end]

896
01:02:21,753 --> 01:02:23,709
Want to dance?

897
01:02:24,393 --> 01:02:27,351
- l don't have time.
- She'll be in line for a while.

898
01:02:28,033 --> 01:02:30,342
- OK.
- l'm Dan. Dan Lynch.

899
01:02:30,473 --> 01:02:33,749
I'm going to slow it down now and do
a song I wrote for the woman I love.

900
01:02:33,873 --> 01:02:35,101
Do it, Bobby.

901
01:02:38,753 --> 01:02:41,187
 I go through each day

902
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:45,192
 Hoping for something

903
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:47,269
 Some little sign

904
01:02:49,273 --> 01:02:51,468
So, you're babysitting these kids?

905
01:02:52,153 --> 01:02:55,623
Huh! l don't think you can call it
babysitting.

906
01:02:55,753 --> 01:02:59,462
 I see my future in your eyes

907
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:07,424
lf they end up as drug addicts and
mass-murderers it's my fault.

908
01:03:07,553 --> 01:03:11,148
Look, don't worry about it.
Everything's going to be OK.

909
01:03:11,273 --> 01:03:14,071
- l think you're doing a great job.
- You do?

910
01:03:14,193 --> 01:03:17,390
Sure l do. l mean,
you've gotten the kids this far.

911
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:20,343
They're still alive. [laughs]

912
01:03:20,473 --> 01:03:22,429
lt could be a lot worse.

913
01:03:23,473 --> 01:03:25,429
lt could be.

914
01:03:25,553 --> 01:03:27,589
 I know how quickly time flies

915
01:03:27,713 --> 01:03:31,626
 I see my future in your eyes

916
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:37,545
 I see my future in your eyes

917
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:41,266
 Yes, I've felt the sorrow

918
01:03:41,393 --> 01:03:44,305
 And I've heard the crying

919
01:03:44,433 --> 01:03:48,585
 Believe me, I've tasted the tears

920
01:03:54,993 --> 01:03:57,188
lt's always the same.

921
01:03:57,313 --> 01:04:02,023
All he cares about are the Bears,
the Bengals, the Dolphins.

922
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:05,909
What about the love?

923
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,389
The romance?

924
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:10,746
And the sex?

925
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,429
l care about those things.

926
01:04:15,713 --> 01:04:17,431
Deeply.

927
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,509
l'm so lonely.

928
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,430
How could a righteous babe like you
be lonely?

929
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,666
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

930
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:31,624
Really?

931
01:04:31,753 --> 01:04:33,709
Want to go to bed?

932
01:04:40,953 --> 01:04:43,421
- l really have to go.
- No, no, no.

933
01:04:43,553 --> 01:04:45,589
Tell me how l can help.
What do you need?

934
01:04:45,713 --> 01:04:47,590
Well...

935
01:04:47,713 --> 01:04:49,988
Actually, l...

936
01:04:50,113 --> 01:04:52,707
- l need $50.
- No problem.

937
01:04:54,353 --> 01:04:55,945
Really?

938
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,504
All l got is a 20.

939
01:04:58,633 --> 01:05:00,908
- Oh, no, that's fine.
- No, wait right here.

940
01:05:01,033 --> 01:05:02,989
l'll be right back.

941
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,669
- He is getting us $50.
- Tha... That's terrific.

942
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:16,586
- Hi. We're going to get the money.
- Really?

943
01:05:16,713 --> 01:05:18,669
lsn't that great, Brad?

944
01:05:20,353 --> 01:05:23,072
- l could only get 45.
- Oh no, that's great.

945
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:24,831
- Thank you so much.
- Luann.

946
01:05:26,153 --> 01:05:27,745
What the hell are you doing?

947
01:05:27,873 --> 01:05:30,512
You've been replaced,
you big dumb bohunk.

948

01:19:32,113 --> 01:19:34,069
- Sara?
- Sara!

1109
01:19:38,873 --> 01:19:40,465
Sara's in trouble.

1110
01:19:42,473 --> 01:19:45,306
Hey! Stop! Don't go out there.

1111
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:49,869
Get back here.

1112
01:19:53,353 --> 01:19:55,264
Hey, kid, wait.

1113
01:19:58,793 --> 01:20:00,465
Jesus Christ.

1114
01:20:00,593 --> 01:20:02,265
Hey!

1115
01:20:04,713 --> 01:20:07,307
Come on back up here. Come on!

1116
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:14,141
- Which floor?
- We'll try this one first.

1117
01:20:41,873 --> 01:20:42,942
[cries out]

1118
01:21:06,873 --> 01:21:09,387
Oh God. We're at my parents' party.

1119
01:21:10,393 --> 01:21:12,349
[voices and light piano music]

1120
01:21:24,353 --> 01:21:26,628
Now kid, stay right where you are.

1121
01:21:27,713 --> 01:21:29,669
Don't move.

1122
01:21:30,673 --> 01:21:32,629
My parents. What are we going to do?

1123
01:21:32,753 --> 01:21:36,029
- l'm going out there to find Sara.
- You can't. They'll see you.

1124
01:21:36,153 --> 01:21:37,871
No they won't.

1125
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,302
Stay right here. l'll be right back.

1126
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:59,308
Be right back with the coats, honey.

1127
01:22:10,673 --> 01:22:12,629
[hums]

1128
01:22:23,713 --> 01:22:25,544
l don't believe it.

1129
01:22:25,673 --> 01:22:28,631
Len Lescher. Loyola Law?

1130
01:22:28,753 --> 01:22:30,311
Class of '68?

1131
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:34,385
- Sorry, wrong guy.
- Honey, we should be going.

1132
01:22:34,513 --> 01:22:37,789
- Nice meeting you.
- lt's getting kind of late.

1133
01:22:37,913 --> 01:22:39,505
Looking for something?

1134
01:22:39,633 --> 01:22:42,101
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh come on, honey.

1135
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:45,748
Just one more.
My diet doesn't start till next week.

1136
01:22:45,873 --> 01:22:48,387
- Well, we told Chris one o'clock.
- These are so good.

1137
01:22:48,513 --> 01:22:50,469
Excuse me.

1138
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:53,869
- You tried one of these?
- What?

1139
01:22:54,953 --> 01:22:58,468
They are so delicious.
l've got to get this recipe.

1140
01:23:01,153 --> 01:23:03,951
Do you happen to know
the name of the caterer?

1141
01:23:04,073 --> 01:23:05,825
Caterer?

1142
01:23:12,753 --> 01:23:15,745
We didn't mean to
spring it on you like this.

1143
01:23:20,073 --> 01:23:22,029
Hello?

1144
01:23:27,993 --> 01:23:30,223
You'll excuse me.

1145
01:23:30,353 --> 01:23:32,662
Oh, my God. ls he OK?

1146
01:23:32,793 --> 01:23:34,704
Did you hurt yourself?

1147
01:23:35,913 --> 01:23:37,869
[whispers] Brad. Daryl.

1148
01:23:38,793 --> 01:23:41,148
- Where's Sara?
- She's out the window.

1149
01:23:41,993 --> 01:23:43,984
Take it easy. No rush.

1150
01:23:44,113 --> 01:23:44,989
What?

1151
01:23:45,113 --> 01:23:48,469
She must have gone upstairs and out
the window. She's out there now.

1152
01:23:48,593 --> 01:23:50,584
Mom? Dad?

1153
01:23:52,953 --> 01:23:55,023
Goddamn!

1154
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:13,508
Sara, just hold on, OK?
Don't be scared.

1155
01:24:15,153 --> 01:24:17,109
Daryl, Brad, loosen the rope.

1156
01:24:17,633 --> 01:24:19,191
Come on, hurry.

1157
01:24:20,713 --> 01:24:22,146
Let me give you a hand.

1158
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:23,786
Sara, grab the rope.

1159
01:24:23,913 --> 01:24:25,869
Easy, easy.

1160
01:24:27,233 --> 01:24:30,748
That's the most exciting thing
that's happened all night.

1161
01:24:32,513 --> 01:24:36,631
Just take it really slow.
Don't be scared of him, Sara.

1162
01:24:36,753 --> 01:24:39,426
OK, that's good. Don't look down.

1163
01:24:39,553 --> 01:24:41,623
OK, that's good.

1164
01:24:41,753 --> 01:24:43,391
Keep walking, that's right.

1165
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:45,708
Just walk right by him.

1166
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:47,710
Hold on.

1167
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,142
You're almost here. Hold on, Sara.

1168
01:24:50,793 --> 01:24:54,149
Just walk right up it.
You're almost there. Hang on.

1169
01:24:54,753 --> 01:24:57,426
OK, real close. Don't worry. Grab on.

1170
01:25:00,753 --> 01:25:02,709
Oh, Brad!

1171
01:25:04,593 --> 01:25:06,390
Sara?

1172
01:25:07,513 --> 01:25:10,391
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Can we go home now?

1173
01:25:11,113 --> 01:25:12,546
Not yet.

1174
01:25:20,153 --> 01:25:24,544
Look, l'm not going to hurt you,
all right? l just need the Playboy.

1175
01:25:35,033 --> 01:25:38,503
See, this is what they were after.
Some notes and stuff.

1176
01:25:39,193 --> 01:25:42,629
You know, that they need. l guess
they're pretty important to them.

1177
01:25:46,953 --> 01:25:48,909
- Don't say it.
- [Daryl laughs]

1178
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:52,267
- Wow!
- lt's pretty uncanny, huh?

1179
01:25:56,233 --> 01:25:57,985
She don't even compare to you.

1180
01:26:02,793 --> 01:26:05,261
- Well, what about him?
- Who?

1181
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:07,349
Come here.

1182
01:26:12,153 --> 01:26:14,906
- Help!
- Uh... yeah.

1183
01:26:17,153 --> 01:26:21,351
Leave him hanging out there for a
while. Let him sweat it out. Come on.

1184
01:26:23,913 --> 01:26:25,869
[laughter]

1185
01:26:30,993 --> 01:26:34,668
Give me the magazine
and get out of here.

1186
01:26:36,313 --> 01:26:38,269
l'll take care of the children.

1187
01:26:50,273 --> 01:26:52,946
You're right.
Babysitting is dangerous.

1188
01:26:53,073 --> 01:26:55,029
Come on.

1189
01:27:00,153 --> 01:27:02,951
? 25 miles from home, girl

1190
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:06,984
? My feet are hurting mighty bad

1191
01:27:07,113 --> 01:27:10,742
? Now I've been walking for
three days and two lonely nights

1192
01:27:10,873 --> 01:27:13,865
? You know that I'm mighty mad

1193
01:27:20,113 --> 01:27:22,069
Chris!

1194
01:27:23,713 --> 01:27:25,669
Oh, l'm so happy.

1195
01:27:28,633 --> 01:27:30,271
What took you guys so long?

1196
01:27:30,393 --> 01:27:33,703
You'll never believe
what l've been through tonight.

1197
01:27:39,073 --> 01:27:41,189
? I'm so tired

1198
01:27:41,313 --> 01:27:44,464
? But I just can't lose my stride

1199
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:48,388
l lost my skate. lt's not here.

1200
01:27:48,953 --> 01:27:52,263
- Maybe you left it some place.
- We gotta go back and find it.

1201
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,349
No, Sara honey, we can't.

1202
01:28:04,073 --> 01:28:05,665
- Brad?
- What?

1203
01:28:05,793 --> 01:28:08,353
Sara, that's not your parents' car,
is it?

1204
01:28:08,473 --> 01:28:10,145
- [all] Yes, it is.
- No!

1205
01:28:10,273 --> 01:28:12,628
- What are we going to do?
- Everybody duck.

1206
01:28:16,953 --> 01:28:19,467
Oh, my God, look at that lunatic.

1207
01:28:20,353 --> 01:28:24,187
Brad and Sara will be driving soon.
On the road with people like that!

1208
01:28:24,313 --> 01:28:27,828
- How fast do your parents drive?
- l don't know. About 45?

1209
01:28:27,953 --> 01:28:29,909
We'll go 80.

1210
01:28:35,473 --> 01:28:38,271
Brad, Sara, Daryl, upstairs now.
lnto your pyjamas.

1211
01:28:38,393 --> 01:28:42,306
- l don't have any pyjamas here.
- l don't care. Just go upstairs.

1212
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:45,304
- Go home.
- But l don't want to go home.

1213
01:28:45,433 --> 01:28:48,311
You have to. l'm sorry.
l'll call you tomorrow.

1214
01:28:51,553 --> 01:28:54,386
 Come on feet, don't fail me now

1215
01:28:54,513 --> 01:28:57,550
 I got ten more miles to go

1216
01:28:58,273 --> 01:29:00,229
 I got nine

1217
01:29:00,353 --> 01:29:02,025
 Eight

1218
01:29:02,153 --> 01:29:04,144
 Seven

1219
01:29:04,273 --> 01:29:05,501
 Six, six, six

1220
01:29:05,633 --> 01:29:09,103
 I got five more miles to go now

1221
01:29:09,233 --> 01:29:12,862
 Over up the hills
just around the bend

1222
01:29:12,993 --> 01:29:16,702
 Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride

1223
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:19,267
 I got to get to my baby again

1224
01:29:19,393 --> 01:29:22,305
 I got to keep on walking

1225
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:26,701
 I got to walk on

1226
01:29:30,313 --> 01:29:32,463
 I'm so tired

1227
01:29:32,593 --> 01:29:35,790
 But I just can't lose my stride

1228
01:29:48,873 --> 01:29:50,829
[front door opens]

1229
01:29:52,673 --> 01:29:55,233
- Hiya, Chris. Sorry we're late.
- Oh, that's OK.

1230
01:29:55,353 --> 01:29:57,230
Any problems?

1231
01:29:57,353 --> 01:30:01,062
No, not really. Well, Brad stayed
home and Daryl's sleeping over.

1232
01:30:01,193 --> 01:30:03,423
Daryl? Whoah!

1233
01:30:03,553 --> 01:30:05,783
What a nightmare for you.

1234
01:30:09,753 --> 01:30:12,790
- His head's been torn off.
- Gross!

1235
01:30:17,593 --> 01:30:20,187
- What happened?
- Everything is cool.

1236
01:30:22,233 --> 01:30:24,622
Chris, can we do this again
next Friday?

1237
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:26,823
Aaw, Sara...

1238
01:30:26,953 --> 01:30:28,944
l think l'm retired.

1239
01:30:29,073 --> 01:30:31,029
You've got to sit for me again.

1240
01:30:32,353 --> 01:30:35,186
- We'll see, OK?
- OK.

1241
01:30:35,313 --> 01:30:38,623
l know that seniors don't normally
hang out with freshmen,

1242
01:30:38,753 --> 01:30:40,903
so if l see you around school,

1243
01:30:41,033 --> 01:30:43,752
and l say hi and you ignore me
as usual, it's OK.

1244
01:30:44,633 --> 01:30:46,863
l don't ignore friends, Brad.

1245
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:53,941
[Daryl] Chris?

1246
01:30:54,993 --> 01:30:56,711
l'd just like to say thanks

1247
01:30:56,833 --> 01:31:00,189
for giving me what was probably
the greatest night of my life.

1248
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,789
So far.

1249
01:31:07,513 --> 01:31:10,152
- Me too.
- Me too.

1250
01:31:13,913 --> 01:31:15,062
Me too.

1251
01:31:18,793 --> 01:31:20,545
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

1252
01:31:20,673 --> 01:31:23,233
- Bye-bye. Drive safely.
- l will, thanks.

1253
01:31:39,233 --> 01:31:41,701
- Hi.
- Hi!

1254
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:46,385
How did you know l...

1255
01:31:46,513 --> 01:31:49,152
l thought the little girl
might be missing this.

1256
01:31:49,273 --> 01:31:51,150
She left it in the back seat.

1257
01:31:51,993 --> 01:31:54,427
You came all the way out here
just to return this?

1258
01:31:55,873 --> 01:31:59,070
Well, actually,
l was... going to ask you...

1259
01:31:59,193 --> 01:32:01,548
Oh, you came for the money.

1260
01:32:02,513 --> 01:32:04,469
No, no, no, no.

1261
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:07,709
l'm looking for a babysitter.

1262
01:32:09,033 --> 01:32:10,989
Really?

1263
01:32:11,593 --> 01:32:13,185
Well...

1264
01:32:13,313 --> 01:32:15,144
l think tonight was my last job.

1265
01:32:16,913 --> 01:32:18,551
Oh.

1266
01:32:18,673 --> 01:32:20,629
That's too bad.

1267
01:32:22,873 --> 01:32:24,591
Who was the babysitter for?

1268
01:32:26,433 --> 01:32:27,991
Me.

1269
01:32:33,873 --> 01:32:35,670
Maybe retirement can wait.

1270
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:40,389
Kiss him!

1271
01:32:45,873 --> 01:32:49,752
 Well, he walked up to me
and he asked me if I wanted to dance

1272
01:32:52,593 --> 01:32:56,711
 He looked kind of nice
and so I said I might take a chance

1273
01:32:59,793 --> 01:33:02,546
 When he danced he held me tight

1274
01:33:02,673 --> 01:33:05,824
 And when he walked me home
that night

1275
01:33:05,953 --> 01:33:08,626
 All the stars were shining bright

1276
01:33:08,753 --> 01:33:10,789
 And then he kissed me

1277
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,629
 And then he kissed me

1278
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:21,349
 And then he kissed me

1279
01:33:22,673 --> 01:33:25,631
 And then he kissed me ?
