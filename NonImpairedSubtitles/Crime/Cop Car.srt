1
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,328
Weiner.

2
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,433
Weiner.

3
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,253
Boobs.

4
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,207
Boobs.

5
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,313
Pussy.

6
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,285
Pussy.

7
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,260
Damn.

8
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,331
Damn.

9
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,170
God damn.

10
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,174
God damn.

11
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,412
Ass.

12
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,982
Ass.

13
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,518
Asshole.

14
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,355
Asshole.

15
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,626
Ass face.

16
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,797
Ass face.

17
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,238
How far do you think we've gone?

18
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,187
50 miles.

19
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,544
I think we're almost to the woods.
Come on.

20
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,896
Don't get rust poisoning.

21
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,695
Come on!

22
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,487
I thought it was an arrowhead.

23
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,825
Bitch.

24
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,260
Bitch.

25
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,995
Shit.

26
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,230
Shit.

27
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,199
Shithead.

28
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,378
Shithead.

29
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,181
Fuck.

30
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,442
Say it. Fuck.

31
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,111
That's the worst cuss.

32
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,313
Actually, my friend,
he's in eighth grade,

33
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,283
he says that it's just
a different language from Russia,

34
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,662
so it's fine to say it.

35
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,154
Oh, look.

36
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,934
- What?
- Snake hole!

37
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,113
I'm gonna leave mine in there
in case they try to escape.

38
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,146
Good idea.

39
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,360
Wanna see a magic trick?

40
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,289
- No way!
- Want some?

41
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,001
Yeah.

42
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,039
- We gotta ration it, though.
- Okay.

43
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,944
Two centimeters each a day.

44
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,846
Wait, why don't you keep it
in your pocket?

45
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:16,894
Pickpockets. Got my wallet in here, too.

46
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,601
- The creek should be right over...
- Get down!

47
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,336
What?

48
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,582
It's the cops.

49
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,487
We haven't even been gone that long.

50
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,306
- You're right.
- Did they see us?

51
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,585
I don't think so.

52
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,214
We can distract them.

53
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,261
Throw this on the far side
to make a noise.

54
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:26,470
Oh, crap!

55
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,655
- You hit it!
- Oh, shit!

56
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,724
- Shit!
- I hit a cop car.

57
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,526
Let's go!

58
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,362
Wait, wait, wait!
It has my fingerprints on it.

59
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:39,066
- Mine, too.
- Okay. Go get it.

60
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,768
No way.

61
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,436
Fine. Chicken.

62
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,283
Wait.

63
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,422
Go that way. It's better camouflage.

64
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,434
- There's no one in there.
- They could be hiding.

65
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,185
My dad says sometimes cops put
empty cop cars nears roads

66
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:21,508
so that people won't speed
'cause they think they're real cop cars.

67
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,887
But there's no road.

68
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,801
Do you see it?

69
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:30,995
I don't know. It could be any of them.
Come on. Let's just go.

70
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,865
I dare you to touch it.

71
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,634
The cop car?

72
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,703
No way.

73
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,475
If I do it, you have to do it.

74
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,416
Okay.

75
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,237
- Ready?
- Stay low just in case they're hiding.

76
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,456
Now!

77
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:16,306
Okay.

78
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,912
Your turn.

79
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,512
Oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap!

80
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,826
Oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap!

81
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,340
Come on, come on, come on!

82
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,390
No way!

83
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,017
Quick, get in.

84
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,513
Get in.

85
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,815
Nuh-uh.

86
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,428
- Why?
- Look.

87
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,190
So?

88
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,646
Hit the boosters!

89
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,915
There's a lot of bad guys behind us!

90
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,036
I'll shoot 'em!

91
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:59,059
- Did you kill 'em?
- No, look out!

92
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,695
You're driving us right off of a cliff!

93
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,784
No!

94
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,042
Where's the siren?
We need to get out of this lava!

95
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,722
Holy shit!

96
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,718
No way.

97
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,097
Which one?

98
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,668
The big one?

99
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,409
It fits.

100
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,249
Do you know how to drive?

101
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,652
Yeah, I know. "Mario Kart."

102
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,404
Yeah, me, too.

103
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,714
- Me first!
- Wait!

104
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,055
Try this one.

105
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,783
Awesome!

106
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,167
Why isn't it going?

107
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,758
It's moving. It's moving!

108
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,760
Quick, get in.

109
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,338
We're gonna get in trouble!

110
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,645
We already ran away. It doesn't matter.

111
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,579
What if someone sees us?

112
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,228
We'll just tell them we're cops.

113
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,764
Good idea.

114
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,961
This is our cop car now.

115
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:48,028
- Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit!
- Oh, shit, oh, shit!

116
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,363
Oh, shit!

117
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,466
Impossible!

118
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,813
This is our cop car!

119
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,880
This is our cop car!

120
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,049
This is our cop car!

121
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,329
- This is our cop car!
- Cop car!

122
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:56,780
Oh, shit.

123
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,785
Hello. Hey, hey, hey there.

124
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,622
Hey there, Miranda. Hello, Miranda.

125
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,690
Hey there, Miranda.

126
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,193
Hey. Hello, there.

127
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,629
- <i>Dispatch.</i>
- Hey there, Miranda. Mitch Kretzer.

128
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,864
<i>Hey there, Sheriff. Everything okay?</i>

129
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:15,468
- It's been better, I'm afraid.
- <i>Oh, no. What's wrong?</i>

130
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:19,872
Well, I seem to be having some trouble
with my radio. Not sure what it is.

131
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,742
<i>Is this the one in your patrol car
or the one you got in your truck?</i>

132
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,876
Patrol car.

133
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:28,781
Some kind of odd interference I'm getting,
maybe a trucker channel cutting through

134
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:33,052
or those boys out east with their remote
control airplanes. Who knows?

135
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:37,256
- Anything odd on your end?
- <i>No. No, not that I can think of.</i>

136
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,726
I tried to radio in to y'all ladies.
You didn't hear that?

137
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,895
<i>Oh, no. Must not be coming through.</i>

138
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:46,098
I see that.

139
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,274
I thought y'all was just giving me
the cold shoulder.

140
00:22:49,374 --> 00:22:52,004
- <i>Never, Sheriff.</i>
- Okay, well...

141
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,041
I'm gonna see if it's a short
in the receiver,

142
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,576
and in the meantime,
if you do need to reach me,

143
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,412
why don't you just go ahead
and call me on my cell?

144
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,948
<i>Are you sure you don't want me
to send Gary down there to have a look?</i>

145
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:06,385
No. No. I'm gonna see if I can
handle this one by myself.

146
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,256
- <i>All righty.</i>
- Thank you kindly.

147
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,069
Have a good day.

148
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,967
Any games?

149
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:51,474
<i>Nah.</i>

150
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,285
Now me.

151
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,222
<i>Last car, repeat.</i>

152
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:08,781
- What should I say?
- Be quiet!

153
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,650
They can't hear unless
I push down the button.

154
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,585
I know.

155
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,187
Say cops are... cops are...

156
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,590
cops drink diarrhea milkshakes.

157
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,693
Cops drink diarrhea milkshakes
and then poop double diarrhea.

158
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,362
- <i>Say "shit."</i>
- Okay.

159
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,097
<i>This is dispatch. Please repeat.</i>

160
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,758
Wait. But they're gonna know
we're not cops.

161
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,272
Yeah, you're right. They probably
know all the cops' voices.

162
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:45,817
Can I drive?

163
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,795
It keeps going when I take my foot
off this thing. Look.

164
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,865
- Why's it doing that?
- I don't know.

165
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,301
I know. You jump out and run around,

166
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:05,738
and I'll scoot over and be like,
"Hurry, get in!"

167
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,885
Okay. One, two, three, go!

168
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,111
That was awesome!

169
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,863
There's a lot of stuff back here.

170
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:06,198
- What do I do?
- What?

171
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,967
Look.

172
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,837
That's a real road. We can go
way faster on the real road.

173
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,317
Should I crash through the gate?

174
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:17,427
Nah.

175
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,992
I'll get it.

176
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,793
- Shit.
- Did that break it?

177
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:36,139
It must be titanium.

178
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:45,371
- Can you open the lock?
- No.

179
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:49,018
- Try hitting it with the car.
- Okay.

180
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,074
It's working.

181
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,033
A little further.

182
00:27:05,286 --> 00:27:07,815
I'm pushing as hard as I can.

183
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,241
It's working!
Push your foot down all the...

184
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,452
Serious shit!

185
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,354
Oh, shit!

186
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:42,359
- That was awesome!
- Yeah, that was so awesome.

187
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,922
Let's see how fast we can go.

188
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,358
Yeah, okay.

189
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:16,038
Okay, get it all the way up to the 100.

190
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,781
How fast am I going now?

191
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,445
Let me try.

192
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,109
It still won't stop.

193
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,631
Oh, I know. Pull on that shifter thingy.

194
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:41,020
Okay, R means go backwards
and P means stop.

195
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,966
Makes sense.

196
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:04,001
This is so awesome!

197
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:09,108
Look out!

198
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:33,132
Yeah!

199
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,885
Fuck you, Marcie!

200
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:02,131
Yeah.

201
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:05,267
Come on, bitch. Get on there.

202
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:09,438
Get on there. Come on. Come on.

203
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:11,817
Get on there, bitch.

204
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,620
Get on.

205
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:26,655
Okay, baby.

206
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,890
Okay, come to Daddy.

207
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,069
Come on, now.

208
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,540
God!

209
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:38,850
Oh, shit.

210
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,547
Come on, baby.

211
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:55,144
Come on, get on there. Get...

212
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,761
Got it.

213
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:57,666
- <i>Dispatch.</i>
- Miranda. Mitch again.

214
00:36:57,766 --> 00:36:59,801
<i>Hey there, Sheriff.
Any luck with that radio?</i>

215
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,791
<i>I'll tell you what,
you haven't missed a thing...</i>

216
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,306
Hey, we got any units
in the Jefferson area?

217
00:37:04,406 --> 00:37:07,809
- <i>Let me check.</i>
- I think I might have a 2-11 in progress.

218
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:11,623
Suspect on foot
somewhere in the vicinity...

219
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,817
in the vicinity of Widefield Drive
and Imperial.

220
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,986
Can you call that in for me? Code three.

221
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:20,699
<i>Sorry, Sheriff, I didn't catch
that last part. Widefield and...?</i>

222
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:25,071
Widefield Drive and Imperial.
Code three.

223
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,741
Roll the window down, sir.

224
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:33,713
License, registration,
proof of insurance, please.

225
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,152
Is there a problem?

226
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:47,326
I'm gonna need you to step
out of the car for me, please, sir.

227
00:37:53,787 --> 00:37:56,107
<i>Calling all units.
There's a 2-11 in progress.</i>

228
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:59,924
<i>Suspect on foot near Widefield
and Imperial. Code three.</i>

229
00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:04,633
Dispatch, this is 55.
I'm 10-95 at Imperial and Cherokee.

230
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:06,701
I can cover on that.

231
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:09,215
Just sit tight. I only need
to see your registration.

232
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,584
<i>55, copy.</i>

233
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,611
<i>Proceed to Widefield
and Imperial. Code three.</i>

234
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,192
10-4. Get those tags changed.

235
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:59,685
How are you doing today, ma'am?

236
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:04,436
- I'm good. Yourself?
- I'm fine. Kind of slow.

237
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:11,833
I swear I think I just saw
the craziest thing out there.

238
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,377
Okay, I'll be right back.

239
00:39:15,836 --> 00:39:17,583
Okay.

240
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,307
So you wanna come pick up?

241
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,522
Okay, what would you like?

242
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:07,668
Okay, enjoy your lunch. Okay, thank you.

243
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:12,104
Excuse me, Officers?

244
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:38,854
<i>...more than anyone!
Daniel trusts his own to arrive.</i>

245
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:42,167
<i>They'll go to everlasting life
or everlasting death.</i>

246
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,934
<i>Mitch, we're starting to get
some radio interference now, too.</i>

247
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,370
Yeah, I'm having a hell
of a time with my radio.

248
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,172
<i>It could be. It's the damnedest thing.</i>

249
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,674
<i>We just got a report
of a stolen sheriff's cruiser.</i>

250
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:01,977
A what?

251
00:41:02,077 --> 00:41:04,646
<i>Could be what's causing
the interference.</i>

252
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,742
Yeah, but everyone
is accounted for, right?

253
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,917
<i>Of course. It's just this lady
is sure she saw two kids</i>

254
00:41:11,017 --> 00:41:13,888
<i>driving a cruiser out on 110.</i>

255
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,824
Two kids.

256
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,859
How old?

257
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,493
<i>She says under 10.</i>

258
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:26,534
Under 10. Well...

259
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:28,603
Miranda, I think we can...

260
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:30,672
I think we can go ahead
and throw that one in the nut file

261
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:33,975
- since everyone's accounted for.
- <i>Of course.</i>

262
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,977
But I'll tell you what.

263
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:40,315
How about we all switch over to channel
seven until we get this sorted out?

264
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:44,496
<i>Well, we normally keep channel seven
open just in case...</i>

265
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,332
<i>There it is again.</i>

266
00:41:51,225 --> 00:41:53,520
Just for my own peace of mind.

267
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,097
<i>I hear you. I'll switch the rest
of the boys over to seven.</i>

268
00:41:56,197 --> 00:42:00,636
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just... just... just to be safe.

269
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,738
<i>Attention, all units,
10-6 to channel seven.</i>

270
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,875
<i>Attention, all units, please 10-6
to channel seven until further notice.</i>

271
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:12,080
- <i>Please confirm.</i>
- <i>This is 55 switching to channel seven.</i>

272
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,649
<i>This is 37 switching to channel seven.</i>

273
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:17,262
<i>45 switching to channel seven.</i>

274
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:21,122
<i>Please repeat.</i>

275
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:25,093
<i>This is unit 2-1 switching to seven.</i>

276
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:27,362
17.

277
00:42:28,062 --> 00:42:31,132
<i>Dispatch, this is 17
switching over to channel seven.</i>

278
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:34,513
<i>Confirmed. Dispatch
switching over to channel seven.</i>

279
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,806
Hello, ladies.

280
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,599
Hush. Hush.

281
00:43:04,699 --> 00:43:06,701
I said hush!

282
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,847
Hey. Hey.

283
00:43:39,499 --> 00:43:42,470
All right, kids. Fun's over.

284
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:46,741
I know who you are, and you are
in a whole hell of a lot of trouble.

285
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,087
Do you understand?

286
00:43:52,612 --> 00:43:57,385
It's downright stupid to steal
a police car, but you've done it.

287
00:43:57,485 --> 00:43:59,420
Now, what's done is done.

288
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,325
And what we're looking at
is a felony offense.

289
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:06,427
A felony offense.

290
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:10,832
And what that means
is guaranteed jail time.

291
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:13,101
The only thing that can help you now

292
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:18,473
is if that car is returned to me
in one piece.

293
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,608
And what that means...

294
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:24,646
<i>is you still have a chance
to work something out...</i>

295
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:29,951
<i>if you tell me right now where you are.</i>

296
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:32,664
<i>Do you understand?</i>

297
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:57,211
Keep going.

298
00:44:57,311 --> 00:44:59,381
A little further.

299
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:02,350
Oh, perfect, right there.

300
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,553
On three.

301
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:06,965
One...

302
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:10,836
two...

303
00:45:11,758 --> 00:45:13,628
Aim for the vest.

304
00:45:13,728 --> 00:45:16,007
...two and a half...

305
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:19,968
two and three quarters...

306
00:45:20,068 --> 00:45:21,870
Now!

307
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:23,805
Shit!

308
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:27,185
Maybe it's out of bullets.

309
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,123
I think the trigger's stuck.

310
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:43,633
Where's the little gun?

311
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,773
I don't know.

312
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:54,099
- I'll got get some more bullets.
- Okay.

313
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,501
What do you think this does?

314
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:13,587
I don't know.

315
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:31,672
<i>Once again,</i>

316
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:35,209
<i>to the two children
who have stolen my vehicle,</i>

317
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:37,378
<i>this does not have to be
a felony offense.</i>

318
00:46:37,478 --> 00:46:39,747
<i>Heck, it doesn't even have to be
a misdemeanor.</i>

319
00:46:40,147 --> 00:46:42,951
<i>What's important... is that car</i>

320
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:47,098
<i>gets returned to me immediately.</i>

321
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:50,919
What?

322
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:57,198
<i>If you do not know
how to use the radio, it's easy.</i>

323
00:46:57,298 --> 00:47:01,169
<i>You just pick up the mic and you hold down
the little black button and you can talk.</i>

324
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:03,404
<i>And when you're through,
you let go and I can talk.</i>

325
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:06,585
And no one else can hear.
This doesn't have to be...

326
00:47:08,808 --> 00:47:11,244
I just want my car back.

327
00:47:18,852 --> 00:47:22,601
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah, I'll go get the stuff.

328
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:26,961
- No.
- What?

329
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:29,564
I mean leave the car.

330
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:32,100
What? Why?

331
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,268
'Cause we're in big trouble.

332
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:36,704
We're not in trouble.

333
00:47:36,804 --> 00:47:39,540
You're just too scared to drive
fast enough to get away from them.

334
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,109
I drive fast!

335
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:45,046
You... you don't drive fast. I saw you.
You were only going 35, pussy.

336
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:47,548
No, I'm not!
I was driving as fast as you.

337
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:49,083
Grandma's boy! Hey!

338
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:51,870
- Screw you!
- Don't push me!

339
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:55,023
I'm gonna leave and you can go to jail
when the cops get here.

340
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,258
I'm not going to jail.

341
00:47:58,058 --> 00:47:59,971
Why not?

342
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:23,401
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh!

343
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:27,822
Please don't kill me.
It wasn't our fault.

344
00:48:27,922 --> 00:48:31,092
I'll do anything. I'll fucking do anything.
I'll... I'll fucking do anything.

345
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:34,095
Just don't kill me. Don't fucking kill me.
It wasn't... it wasn't our fault.

346
00:48:34,195 --> 00:48:36,831
I told... I told him,
I said, "You're fucking up.

347
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:39,700
Please. Dude, we gotta do it now."
And he said, "No."

348
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,970
My brother, where's...
where's my brother, you fuck?

349
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:47,942
You... you fuck. You don't...
you fucked... you killed him.

350
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:50,311
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

351
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:52,780
I'll fucking... I'll fucking...

352
00:48:53,509 --> 00:48:55,549
Do it!

353
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,947
Do it!

354
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:07,714
Are you a bad guy?

355
00:49:08,663 --> 00:49:11,380
I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy.

356
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,479
I'm a good... I'm a good guy.

357
00:49:15,635 --> 00:49:18,326
- Then why are you tied up?
- No.

358
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:26,465
Because I...

359
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:31,054
I need someone to rescue me.

360
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:33,821
You boys are gonna rescue me, right?

361
00:49:35,303 --> 00:49:37,001
Maybe.

362
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,098
You know who the bad guy is?
The sheriff.

363
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:47,435
He's a bad, bad guy.

364
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:48,981
Where is he?

365
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:58,779
Wait, hey. Hey, don't leave me in here!

366
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:00,941
Hey!

367
00:50:01,281 --> 00:50:04,253
The fuck? Fuck, don't leave me!

368
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:07,922
- I think he's a good guy.
- Yeah, me, too.

369
00:50:08,022 --> 00:50:10,502
Okay, let's let him out.

370
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:22,470
Listen up. We're gonna let you out, but you
gotta promise that you won't tell on us.

371
00:50:23,118 --> 00:50:25,640
Of course. I swear.

372
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,743
You can't tell my grandma
or his mom or any of our teachers.

373
00:50:28,843 --> 00:50:31,712
- Or my stepdad, Chris.
- I won't tell him.

374
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:34,125
I won't tell a soul.

375
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:45,237
Fuck.

376
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:50,398
This one's really tight.

377
00:50:50,498 --> 00:50:53,467
- Yeah.
- I think you need to cut 'em, all right?

378
00:50:53,867 --> 00:50:55,469
- Maybe we can shoot them off.
- No! No, no, no!

379
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:58,606
No, don't... don't... don't do that.

380
00:50:58,706 --> 00:51:00,107
All right?

381
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:04,049
Hey, hey, come here. You know what?

382
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:07,198
I'm looking at you boys. You seem tough.

383
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:10,485
You probably... you must have a knife,
right? Maybe a pocket knife on you?

384
00:51:10,585 --> 00:51:13,354
I had one, but it got tooken away
from me at school.

385
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:15,800
How about you? You got a knife?

386
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:20,018
Well, there must be something sharp
around here. Go on, take a look.

387
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:23,464
You, take a look. Yeah,
there might be something sharp in here.

388
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:24,865
Maybe later. We gotta go.

389
00:51:24,965 --> 00:51:30,171
No, no, don't... please. I need you,
I need you. Look, this really hurts.

390
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:32,856
And if you don't get me out,
I might... I might die.

391
00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:38,266
We can look.

392
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:41,015
Take a look. You can stay here.

393
00:51:41,714 --> 00:51:43,524
Hey,

394
00:51:43,624 --> 00:51:45,851
y'all best friends?

395
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,732
How old are you?

396
00:51:58,598 --> 00:52:01,902
I'm so glad to see you boys
instead of that sheriff.

397
00:52:02,002 --> 00:52:05,406
He's a really, really bad guy.
Believe me.

398
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:08,052
- I'm gonna hook you all...
- I found one.

399
00:52:12,412 --> 00:52:15,816
The tweezers and the toothpick
are missing, but it's got the knife part.

400
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:18,753
That's great, that's great.
Come here, come here.

401
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:20,798
Get to cutting.

402
00:52:23,287 --> 00:52:26,761
Listen, okay? You can't have
this cop car. It's our cop car.

403
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:29,463
We found it and we're not going
to let you have it, okay?

404
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,067
Deal. Don't worry, you can have it.

405
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:37,939
I don't care if I see another cop
car as long as I live. In fact...

406
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:41,141
I'm gonna give you boys
a whole bunch of money.

407
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,545
You like naked girls?
I'm gonna get you some Playboys.

408
00:52:44,945 --> 00:52:47,792
And some... and some candy.
You like candy?

409
00:53:49,242 --> 00:53:50,988
<i>Hello?</i>

410
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:54,915
<i>Is there anybody there?</i>

411
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:57,017
<i>Hello, Mr. Sheriff.</i>

412
00:53:57,117 --> 00:54:00,354
<i>My friend and me have your car.
I'm real sorry.</i>

413
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:04,325
<i>We don't want... want to get in trouble,
but we don't know how to get back.</i>

414
00:54:04,425 --> 00:54:07,673
<i>We're real scared.
We're out here all alo...</i>

415
00:54:10,864 --> 00:54:13,340
You boys sure had me.

416
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:17,304
Okay. All right.

417
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:19,540
All right, nothing to worry about now.

418
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,510
What's important is that
we get you boys home safe.

419
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,314
Now... you didn't touch
anything, did you?

420
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:31,829
A lot of dangerous equipment in my car.
You didn't open the trunk there, did you?

421
00:54:33,319 --> 00:54:35,689
- <i>No.</i>
- Okay. That's good.

422
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:37,100
That's... that's good.

423
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,585
Now, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to set yourself in the backseat.

424
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:42,797
Don't touch anything. Anybody comes by,
you just say help is on the way.

425
00:54:42,897 --> 00:54:45,132
You're doing a real special job
guarding the car for the sheriff.

426
00:54:45,232 --> 00:54:47,201
- Do you understand?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

427
00:54:47,301 --> 00:54:49,514
Okay. All right.

428
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,350
Now...

429
00:54:53,173 --> 00:54:55,376
you say that you don't know
how to get home.

430
00:54:55,476 --> 00:54:56,860
Do you know where you are?

431
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,447
- What street you're on?
- <i>No.</i>

432
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:01,815
Well, take a look around.
You see any street signs?

433
00:55:01,915 --> 00:55:05,619
- <i>No.</i>
- All right. Okay.

434
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,623
Well... well, the road that you're on,
is it a dirt road?

435
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,225
<i>No.</i>

436
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:13,260
Good. Good.

437
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,108
Now tell me, is it a hilly road?

438
00:55:16,864 --> 00:55:20,734
Is it a hilly road or is it a flat road?

439
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:24,371
- <i>Flat.</i>
- Okay. All right.

440
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:27,608
Now... now take a look around.
You see any houses?

441
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:30,554
Anything at all
that might help me find you?

442
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,815
<i>I see some windmills.</i>

443
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,584
A windmill.

444
00:55:36,684 --> 00:55:38,323
Well...

445
00:55:38,842 --> 00:55:40,421
that's great.

446
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:43,524
That's great. You know what?

447
00:55:43,624 --> 00:55:46,137
I think I know where to find you.

448
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,507
What's your name, son?

449
00:55:56,268 --> 00:55:57,605
Harrison.

450
00:55:57,705 --> 00:56:00,543
<i>And your little partner there,
what's his name?</i>

451
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:04,278
Travis.

452
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:09,883
<i>You boys did the right thing calling me.
You just sit tight. Help is on the way.</i>

453
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,586
<i>And don't you worry. You are not...</i>

454
00:56:12,686 --> 00:56:15,433
- In.
- <i>...in any kind of trouble.</i>

455
00:56:17,424 --> 00:56:19,893
Stop fidgeting, you little shit!

456
00:56:19,993 --> 00:56:22,666
That gun doesn't even work!

457
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:28,512
That's right.

458
00:56:45,684 --> 00:56:47,354
Look.

459
00:56:47,454 --> 00:56:49,667
He can't hear us.

460
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:54,161
What's he doing?

461
00:56:55,063 --> 00:56:57,141
I don't know.

462
00:57:05,304 --> 00:57:07,885
Maybe he's looking
to go to the bathroom.

463
00:57:13,178 --> 00:57:15,468
I hate him.

464
00:57:20,786 --> 00:57:22,923
I think he's trying to hide.

465
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:25,103
He sucks at hiding.

466
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:35,613
Why does he need both guns?

467
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,902
He's a gun hog.

468
00:57:46,678 --> 00:57:48,626
Here he comes.

469
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,340
Where are we going?

470
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:24,576
Are we going home?

471
00:59:19,084 --> 00:59:20,850
Hey!

472
00:59:37,857 --> 00:59:39,934
This sucks.

473
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,231
Yeah, this...

474
00:59:44,131 --> 00:59:46,411
fucking sucks.

475
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:16,073
Where'd he go?

476
01:00:18,464 --> 01:00:20,377
He's hiding.

477
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,776
He's gonna shoot us.

478
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,494
Maybe he won't.

479
01:00:48,027 --> 01:00:49,193
Okay.

480
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:53,567
Now, the man that owns this car is gonna
be here real soon. You understand?

481
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:57,404
And when he gets here, I need you boys
to do something for me. Okay?

482
01:00:57,804 --> 01:01:00,173
You can't tell him where I'm hiding.

483
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:02,469
He can't even know I'm here.

484
01:01:02,843 --> 01:01:05,546
- He's gotta think I'm still in the trunk.
- Why?

485
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:07,681
Shut up!

486
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:11,218
Just do what I said. Just keep quiet.

487
01:01:11,318 --> 01:01:13,553
Because if you don't,
you know what I'm gonna have to do?

488
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:17,557
- Shoot us?
- No, I won't.

489
01:01:17,657 --> 01:01:20,327
But what I will do is...

490
01:01:20,827 --> 01:01:23,931
- You... you got a mom and dad?
- My grandma.

491
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:27,067
- You got a pet?
- A guinea pig.

492
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:30,304
- You?
- Snake and a dog.

493
01:01:30,704 --> 01:01:34,641
- You live with your mom or dad?
- My mom and my stepdad.

494
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:39,279
What I'll do is go by your house.
And first I'll kill your dog.

495
01:01:39,379 --> 01:01:43,150
I'll take a hammer, hit him in the head
until the hammer's covered in brains.

496
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:47,754
And then I'll take that snake of yours
and I'll slit him open top to bottom.

497
01:01:47,854 --> 01:01:49,140
Then, your mom...

498
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,060
well, she'll probably have heard that
and she'll wonder, "What's going on?"

499
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,197
And when I see her,
you know what I'll do to her?

500
01:01:57,097 --> 01:02:00,267
Shoot her in the face.
And your stepdad, too.

501
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:03,270
Make both their faces into ground beef.

502
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,250
And you...

503
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:08,942
I'll take that...
what you call it, guinea pig?

504
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:11,812
And I'll throw him against the ground
as hard as I can.

505
01:02:11,912 --> 01:02:13,680
But that probably won't kill him.

506
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:17,063
And so while he's squirming
around down there, down in the dirt,

507
01:02:17,163 --> 01:02:21,655
I'll stomp him with my boot.
Crush that guinea pig of yours.

508
01:02:21,755 --> 01:02:23,924
And your grandma...

509
01:02:24,024 --> 01:02:26,960
I'll slit her throat
with a big ol' knife.

510
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,797
And she'll scream for you
to "Come on and help me,"

511
01:02:30,897 --> 01:02:33,544
but no sound will come out.
And you want to know why?

512
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:39,547
'Cause you can't scream
with a slit throat.

513
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,793
You understand?

514
01:02:43,743 --> 01:02:45,379
So...

515
01:02:45,479 --> 01:02:49,847
when the sheriff shows up looking
for his car, what are we gonna do?

516
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,296
Be quiet.

517
01:02:55,754 --> 01:02:57,501
Great.

518
01:03:10,936 --> 01:03:15,219
- You're eating a Slim Jim now?
- No. Look.

519
01:03:19,078 --> 01:03:21,592
Next time he comes back,
you should shoot him.

520
01:03:47,873 --> 01:03:49,967
Here he comes.

521
01:04:00,986 --> 01:04:02,800
Shoot him.

522
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:07,538
Shoot him.

523
01:04:12,364 --> 01:04:14,668
Shoot him.

524
01:04:19,805 --> 01:04:22,375
Why didn't you shoot him?

525
01:04:22,675 --> 01:04:24,555
You do it.

526
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:12,278
Should we tell?

527
01:07:12,378 --> 01:07:15,381
What if this guy kills our families?

528
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:17,990
He just wants his car back.

529
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,998
I don't know.

530
01:07:38,203 --> 01:07:40,524
Fuck! Fuck!

531
01:07:47,946 --> 01:07:50,583
You boys sure gave me a fright.

532
01:07:50,683 --> 01:07:52,732
Holy hell!

533
01:07:58,323 --> 01:08:01,417
What do you say we get you home safe?

534
01:08:19,945 --> 01:08:22,657
Okay, now you boys answer me, now.

535
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:25,323
Did you open up the trunk?

536
01:08:26,752 --> 01:08:28,888
Was there somebody inside the trunk?

537
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:32,392
Did you open the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?

538
01:08:32,492 --> 01:08:35,275
Did you open the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?

539
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:37,707
Did you open the trunk?

540
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,718
Boy, you answer me now...

541
01:08:42,147 --> 01:08:46,812
or I will shoot you dead
right through this door.

542
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,509
Tell me right now...

543
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:51,621
where is he?

544
01:08:55,747 --> 01:08:56,924
Son...

545
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:02,422
I am the only person out here
that you can trust.

546
01:09:03,022 --> 01:09:06,970
I'm the only one that can help you.

547
01:09:17,969 --> 01:09:20,050
Oh, fuck.

548
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:41,471
I knew it!

549
01:09:42,828 --> 01:09:46,472
You little shits! I knew I wasn't crazy!

550
01:09:47,534 --> 01:09:50,970
You think you can ride down this highway
and I won't know about it?

551
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:55,075
I know these roads like the back
of my hand! What's wrong with you?

552
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:59,446
Don't think you can play
dumb with me. I saw you.

553
01:10:00,046 --> 01:10:02,248
You almost ran me off the road.

554
01:10:02,548 --> 01:10:06,553
You are in so much trouble!

555
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:08,721
Get out of the car!

556
01:10:08,821 --> 01:10:11,758
Hey! I'm talking to you!

557
01:10:11,858 --> 01:10:14,127
Step outside the car.

558
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:16,185
Come on.

559
01:10:16,285 --> 01:10:19,432
Get out! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

560
01:10:19,532 --> 01:10:20,756
- Ma'am.
- Are you okay?

561
01:10:20,856 --> 01:10:23,317
I'm gonna need you to calm down.
I'm a police officer.

562
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:25,767
- Are you bleeding? I'm so...
- Ma'am!

563
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:29,476
- What?
- I'm gonna need you to stop talking.

564
01:10:29,576 --> 01:10:31,411
- All right? All right?
- Okay. Okay.

565
01:10:31,511 --> 01:10:33,472
- Just nod your head. Just nod.
- Okay.

566
01:10:33,572 --> 01:10:35,448
- Just nod it at me.
- All right.

567
01:10:36,385 --> 01:10:38,251
I've been injured by a perpetrator.

568
01:10:38,351 --> 01:10:42,088
He is the father of the two boys
that are inside this vehicle.

569
01:10:42,865 --> 01:10:44,324
You are okay.

570
01:10:44,424 --> 01:10:46,710
He has fled the scene
and everything is okay,

571
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,166
but I'm gonna need
your help with something.

572
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:52,099
All right? Now listen up.

573
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,147
After I was attacked,

574
01:10:54,247 --> 01:10:57,437
he threw my keys on the other side
of the road, way over there.

575
01:10:57,537 --> 01:10:59,911
And what I'm gonna need you
to do is go ahead,

576
01:11:00,011 --> 01:11:03,780
cross the road and see
if you can find my keys for me

577
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,859
so that I can radio for assistance.
You see, I cannot walk.

578
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:19,853
Do you understand?

579
01:11:22,227 --> 01:11:24,066
Yeah.

580
01:11:24,766 --> 01:11:27,600
Why don't I just call somebody
to come and get you?

581
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,070
No. No, no. No need to call.

582
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:35,219
Just head on over there
and see what you can find.

583
01:11:36,174 --> 01:11:38,077
Go on.

584
01:11:38,677 --> 01:11:40,417
- Go on.
- You okay?

585
01:11:40,517 --> 01:11:42,348
Yeah.

586
01:11:42,448 --> 01:11:44,694
- Go on.
- Okay.

587
01:11:47,753 --> 01:11:50,033
Just take a good look around there.

588
01:11:51,457 --> 01:11:55,362
It's gonna be hard to find them out here.
There's so much tumbleweed.

589
01:11:55,962 --> 01:11:57,797
Cover as much ground as you can.

590
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:01,412
Yeah, and... just keep
your eyes peeled, okay?

591
01:12:04,235 --> 01:12:07,384
- Okay?
- Okay!

592
01:12:18,049 --> 01:12:23,256
Are you the woman that reported
the children driving the cruiser?

593
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,492
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

594
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:30,029
Everyone said that I seen it wrong,
but I knew I saw them.

595
01:12:30,129 --> 01:12:32,932
Well, you did a real good thing, ma'am.

596
01:12:33,032 --> 01:12:34,570
It's... it's...

597
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:38,815
it's citizens like you that make
a difference in our community.

598
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:44,377
- Taking an active role.
- I don't see anything.

599
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:47,359
You didn't find anything?

600
01:12:47,559 --> 01:12:49,590
Nothing at all?

601
01:12:56,654 --> 01:12:58,635
Keep looking.

602
01:13:01,193 --> 01:13:03,262
Oh, my God.

603
01:13:03,362 --> 01:13:05,423
There's a man out there!

604
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:39,162
- Help!
- Help!

605
01:15:41,888 --> 01:15:43,696
Help!

606
01:15:56,267 --> 01:15:58,849
- Help!
- Help!

607
01:16:00,049 --> 01:16:02,761
Help!

608
01:16:17,589 --> 01:16:19,969
What time do you think it is?

609
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:24,477
I don't know.

610
01:16:25,297 --> 01:16:27,764
I gotta go to the bathroom.

611
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,580
We have to go.

612
01:16:39,277 --> 01:16:41,535
I think they're dead.

613
01:16:41,635 --> 01:16:44,660
I was gonna try to shoot out the window.

614
01:16:53,024 --> 01:16:55,556
Dang it, how do these work?

615
01:16:56,128 --> 01:16:58,131
Let me try.

616
01:17:07,605 --> 01:17:10,687
- Come on.
- Try like...

617
01:17:11,843 --> 01:17:13,724
Try to smash the window with it.

618
01:17:30,662 --> 01:17:32,675
Let me throw it.

619
01:17:44,274 --> 01:17:46,657
If this would just...

620
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:51,083
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know!

621
01:17:51,183 --> 01:17:53,463
My ears!

622
01:18:23,414 --> 01:18:25,295
Wait!

623
01:18:43,968 --> 01:18:46,416
I think something hit me.

624
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:54,670
You should've worn the bulletproof vest.

625
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,061
I know.

626
01:19:53,138 --> 01:19:56,693
- Where's the lights?
- It's by the shifter thing.

627
01:20:01,412 --> 01:20:03,758
It's not working.

628
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:07,654
It's okay. It doesn't hurt much anymore.

629
01:20:18,263 --> 01:20:19,666
<i>Boys.</i>

630
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:29,041
<i>Boys, I know you can hear me.</i>

631
01:20:29,141 --> 01:20:32,255
<i>Slow down, boys. It's all right.</i>

632
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:39,496
<i>I just... I just want my car back.</i>

633
01:20:56,067 --> 01:20:58,114
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

634
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:05,311
<i>You don't...</i>

635
01:21:09,514 --> 01:21:11,225
<i>steal...</i>

636
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:16,758
a fuckin'...

637
01:21:18,223 --> 01:21:20,247
cop car!

638
01:21:38,109 --> 01:21:40,790
We did it! Travis!

639
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,311
