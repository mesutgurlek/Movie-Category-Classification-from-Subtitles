about you to my friends

I told them that the reason
that you hate me so much

is because I had sex
with your mother.

MAHOGANY:
One-One.

957
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:27,149
That's not fair.
That wasn't fair.

958
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,690
Randy, I'm trying to sacrifice
my Iife for our Iove.

959
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,522
Stop being such a dick!

960
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,061
I'm not gonna Iet you Iose,
Maggie.

961
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,427
Here we go.

962
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,798
This is not very honorable!

963
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,509
I Iove you, Maggie.

964
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,754
Boring. Kill them.
Kill them both.

965
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,953
We're missing
Antiques Roadshow.

966
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,757
No.

967
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:18,772
Oh, crap!

968
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,941
Get to cover! Come on!

969
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:28,882
You want to play rough?
Okay! Go! Go! Go!

970
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:35,883
Stop it! Are you insane?
These are not replicas!

971
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:40,224
Well, some of them are,
but they're
Iimited edition replicas.

972
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,196
Backup's right outside,
they just signaled.

973
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,926
I didn't sneak in
two of these for nothing.

974
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,035
This is the FBI.

975
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,007
Oh, my God!
What?

976
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,610
Wait a minute,
I forgot something, guys.

977
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:06,677
What?

978
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,052
Come here, baby.

979
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:10,916
Wish me Iuck.

980
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,017
Good Iuck.

981
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:13,561
Get to the dock!

982
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,221
He took my Uzi.

983
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,008
Get away from the door!

984
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:32,341
Sweet.

985
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,440
Well, that was awesome of me.

986
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,782
Dude, I totally knew
you'd rescue me!

987
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:43,381
Okay! AII right! Okay!
AII right! As a friend!
As a friend, I rescued you.

988
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,483
Oh, right. Yeah. Right.

989
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,959
Follow me!

990
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,954
This way. Up the stairs!

01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,364
You gonna murder me
Iike you murdered my father?

Don't, don't, don't. Feng.

01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:16,552
Listen, you kill me now,

we're never gonna know
who Wong's best pupil is.

1001
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,592
WONG: For the record,

1002
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,657
I think we all assume
that it is Randy.

1003
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,264
You win, Wong.

1004

Let's settle this,
once and for all.

Just show it to the FBI.

It's over, Feng.

The Ping-Pong table

you can't turn it off?

But you missed the table!

1037
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,790
I changed the rules a Iittle.

1038
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,489
I should have told you.

1039
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,658
The way I play,
you could hit it off
anything you want.

01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:50,514
Big deal.
I never finished the training.

1069

What's that mean?
I have no honor or something?
