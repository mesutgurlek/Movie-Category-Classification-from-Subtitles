2
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Yeah.

3
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Shit.

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
Where is he?

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,500
Gotta go.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,500
What's the latest?

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,500
Nothing, they say the first
24 hours (?)...

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Did she understand?

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,800
It's not their fight.

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Did she understand?

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,500
It's not their fight.

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Where are Tess and Isabel?

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
It's not their fight.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Any change?

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
He's in critical condition,
but he's still alive.

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
- You know, if he doesn't...
- Is Stan there?

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
- Yeah, he's been there an hour.
- Stan'll us what's going on.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,500
(?) cardio(?) infarction.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,500
He's endured an incredible shock
to his system.

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,500
- Can he recover?
- Yes.

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
Will he recover?

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
It helps if they have
something to live for.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,500
Family.

24
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Friends then.

25
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Maybe that'll be enough.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,700
<i>Reuben, when it comes
to Willie Bank</i>

27
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,800
<i>you can't rely on contracts.</i>

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
<i>My lawyers say...
the ironclad.</i>

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Gimme some credit for
my business (?).

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,500
But you'll still think it's a good idea
neither does Rusty?

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,800
Well, I'm doing it.
It's done.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,500
And you tell Rusty that
I won't have to pull jobs...

33
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:54,800
to keep my hotel
solvent.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,800
Hey, Reuben...

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,800
You fellows are young.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,500
You don't understand.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Did you know that the Inuit people...

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,800
put their elders out on a ice foe to die...

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,500
when they're too
old to hunt?

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
- Thanks.
- That's just a myth.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
Well that ain't gonna happen to me.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,800
I can still hunt.
This is it.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
It's my chance.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
I used to mean something in this town.
I would walk into a restaurant...

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
if it was full, they'd snap out
a new table for me...

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
like that.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,800
Listen Reuben, if you're worried
about your place in history...

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
then let us get a street named after you...

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
or a boulevard.

50
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,500
We can talk about that
when I'm dead.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,900
Danny, I appreciate you coming
this far to see me...

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
but I gotta do this.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Reuben!

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,500
- Partner!
- Reuben!

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,800
So good of you to come.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Of course. Of course. I get
more items for my punch list...

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,800
I got so much energy, I can...

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
hardly sleep from the excitement.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Where are you at on the visas for the chefs?

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
My man in Washington says...

61
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,800
they'll be stamped
by the time we open.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,500
- No, no, no, not good enough.
- That's what I said.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
That's good.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,800
And the chandeliers?

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
My ex-wife's new brother-in-law...

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,800
You don't need the details.
It's done.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Half priced.
They're already at the warehouse.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,500
And because I know it mattered to you...

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
I appeared before the
City Council.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
The one-way street leading
away...

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
from the rear entrance, now...

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,500
leads toward the rear entrance.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,800
All roads lead to the "Midas".

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,800
This is perfect.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Great views up here.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,500
Where's the partner's desk gonna be?

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,500
No partner's desk.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,800
- Two desks.
- No two desks, one desk.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,800
One chairman's desk.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
One.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
The arrangement is changing.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Was changed.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,500
As a matter of fact there is no arrangement.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,500
Everybody said that you would
try to screw me.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,500
But you've done it to everyone
of your partners.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,500
But I defended you.
I said:

87
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,800
No, me and Willie Bank
been around long enough...

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
that we both shook Sinatra's hand.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,500
And there's a code amongst guys
that shook Sinatra's hand.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Screw Sinatra's hand.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,500
- Screw?
- You're deadweight.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Do you think I'm gonna carry you
and pay you at the same time?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Reuben...

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
you're out.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
Never.
This is my (?).

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Was. Was your (?).

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,500
- You signed it over to the corporation.
- For 50% interest.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,500
Which I'm gonna ask you
to sign over to me.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,500
For a small cash payment.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,800
- I'm not signing that.
- Yes.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
Get outta here.
I'm not signing that.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,800
What are you gonna do?
Throw me of the roof?

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,500
No, I don't want to.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
This is wrong. This is all wrong.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
You're leaving me with nothing.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
You know you're right.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,500
And it's rude.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Here.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
It's the first badge.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,500
Just got made.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,500
You changed the name.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
I like it better.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,500
Don't you?

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,800
<i>Reuben...</i>

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
<i>he always was too
trusted.</i>

116
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,500
<i>Is Saul.
Is.</i>

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,500
<i>Of course.
Is.</i>

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,500
<i>He tried talking him out
of it next time.</i>

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
<i>Look,
Bank hurt Reuben...</i>

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
<i>I know how that makes
me feel.</i>

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
<i>- I know what that makes me wanna do.
- Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.</i>

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,500
<i>I'm gonna get close to Bank
and I don't care if it gets messy.</i>

123
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,800
I'll drive you...

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
and get him leaving his barber.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Good, then I'll inject him.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Yeah and I'll find a spot
to get rid of the body.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,800
All valid ideas.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Great initiative.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,800
But...

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
But...

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Even though Bank stepped
over the line...

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,990
we have to do what's best
for Reuben.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Which means
we offer Bank...

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
a "Billy Martin".

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Wait a minute? And then what,
he goes for it? And that's it, he gets off?

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
- That's the rule.
- No, that's the rules...

137
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,500
for someone who understands the rules.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,800
which Bank don't,
because he already broke them.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,500
So he don't get the chance.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
For Reuben...

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,500
I think we give him a chance.

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,800
I need answers before
I ask questions.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
You get that?

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,500
Allright. Do it!

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,300
So...

146
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,500
some guys I take
seriously...

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,500
tell me you're a serious guy.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
Right.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,800
What I want...

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,500
what's most important to be is that Reuben
gets his share of the hotel restored.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
I'm here to give you a chance
to do that.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
You're gonna give me a chance?

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
Okay.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,800
It's a Billy Martin?

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,800
I pass.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,500
Last time I looked
and I look every morning...

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,500
it was my name listed as owner
on more valuable property...

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,500
in this state than anyone else
in history.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Which means you gotta
lot more to lose.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Well I don't lose.

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
People who bet on me
to lose, lose...

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
and they lose big.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
You come at me
you better know...

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
I move quick
and when i do...

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
I slice...

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
like a goddamn hammer.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
So you're not gonna make Rueben (?)?

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,800
If Reuben was too weak
or too stupid...

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,800
to see what was coming down...

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
then you know what?

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,800
He didn't belong here.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,800
He's made the right choice:

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,800
roll over and die.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,500
Let him be.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,500
How long do I have to
wait for a conduit?

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,500
I don't want the labor pains
I just want the baby.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,500
Six months later.

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Well...

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,800
thanks for coming.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
Thanks for the 100 Grant.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
This takes longer than
a day though.

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,800
Gonna have to re-negociate.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
That's fair.

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,500
I'd like some Sen Cha
or Genmaicha.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,800
Green tea.
Yes, sir.

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
And don't burn it.

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,800
Pour it just before boiling point...

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,500
- not after.
- Green Tea. Si signore.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,500
Graci.

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,800
Just us three?

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,500
- For now...
- Figured we talk to you first..

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Good lord.

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,800
How stuck I am?

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,800
Stuck.

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,800
Stalled really.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
Stuck.

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Run it from me.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Don't leave anything out.

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Give me the big picture.

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
- You wanna?
- It's all yours.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,500
- Where shall we start?
- Start with the hotel.

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,800
<i>Bank really put (?)
on this one.</i>

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
<i>Forget weekenders
and conventioneers.</i>

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,500
<i>He's built this place for the whales.</i>

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
<i>The (?)
of a Five Diamond Award.</i>

206
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,800
<i>The marble was handpicked in Italy...</i>

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,900
<i>and the chefs stolen from the highest
rated restaurants on the Michelin guidebook.</i>

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,800
<i>In the villas (?)
big players</i>

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
<i>the silverwear is
actually gold.</i>

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
<i>Bank's greatest strength
is also his weakness.</i>

211
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,800
<i>Ego.</i>

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
<i>He's been spending his days checking
and rechecking every inch of the property...</i>

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
<i>getting(?) ready for the grand
opening celebration.</i>

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,500
<i>It's a compulsion.</i>

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,800
<i>Bank's right-hand man
is a woman.</i>

216
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,800
<i>Abigail Sponder.</i>

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
We're gonna have to let you go.

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,800
Turn in your uniform.

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,800
I only gained 4 pounds.
You can't.

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,800
Yeah, well your bodymass index
is not what it supossed to be.

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,500
- But miss Sponder...
- Oh no, babydoll,

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,500
it's your butt that's the problem.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,500
You can't find a waitress
based on appearance, man.

224
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,100
That's just unconstitutional.

225
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,800
If they were waitresses.

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,800
Yeah, they're actually hired
as models who serve.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,800
So that Bank can monitor their
physical appearance.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,100
It's a cruel cruel practice.

229
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,500
So between Bank and Sponder
they got the place covered.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
- When is opening night?
- July the 3th.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
Got fireworks the stroke of midnight
the whole charade.

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,500
Are we going in now?
It's already open.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,800
No, it's a soft opening.

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,800
To test the place
before the grand opening.

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Yeah it's kinda like a out of town
preview...

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
on the (?) town.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,800
Soft opening? Grand opening?

238
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
When they opened the Flamingo...

239
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,800
one day it was closed
the next day it was open.

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,800
End of story.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,800
I know, I was there.

242
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,100
Well it's different now.

243
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,800
So when is opening night?

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,800
July the 3th.

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,500
Now the top casinos can clear
3 million dollars a day...

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,800
just on the floor.

247
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
Bank with his high level players...

248
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
and no limits is projecting 5.

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
Upon exchange for the loans
he had to give up...

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
six of the nine seats
on the board.

251
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,500
So he doesn't control his own company. And
a couple of the guys he brought in aren't friendly.

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,500
So he has to clear 500 million
in the first quarter...

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,800
or he gets dumped out of
his own hotel.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,500
(?) Bank wants another
Five Diamond Award (?).

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,800
Every hotel I ever (?)...

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,500
has one: a Royal Review
Five Diamond Award.

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
The Cigarou Inn:
five diamonds.

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,500
The Peloponnesian Monte Carlo:
five diamonds.

259
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,500
<i>The Grand Saphir, Singapore:
cinco diamantes.</i>

260
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,500
Atomano Crest, Tahiti...

261
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,800
I never not won one.

262
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,800
So, how are you gonne get the diamonds?

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,800
- We're not.
- We thought about it for a minute...

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,800
- Then we decided... It was...
- Impossible.

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,800
(?) (?) (?)

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,500
- Tell him about Debbie.
- Yeah, tell him about Debbie.

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,800
<i>Debbie is a concierge at the Bank.</i>

268
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
<i>She's very ambitious.</i>

269
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,800
<i>In a good way...</i>

270
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,800
<i>for us.</i>

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,500
<i>As soon as I said the words:
general manager and a (?)...</i>

272
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,800
<i>she was in.</i>

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,500
<i>I put a cherry on top
to make sure.</i>

274
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,800
<i>We found out who'd be
reviewing the hotel.</i>

275
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800
<i>We're gonna get to him
before Bank can.</i>

276
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,500
I feel bad.
Like torture.

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,500
This is war, kid.
There's gonna be collateral damage.

278
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
Iar restul se va întâmpla
at the airport.

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,800
- No, he doesn't know that.
- So what?

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,500
He has to know why you won?
You enjoy it? Who says?

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,500
Alright so you go through that
for 10 milion?

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
No. I do it for eleven mille.

283
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,900
Now, we found out
Bank is tapped into

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,800
the federal fingerprint
database.

285
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
Highly illegal.

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,800
We came up with a way
to piggyback his system...

287
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
in between
firewall checks.

288
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:55,000
Very interesting stuff out there.

289
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:56,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what else?

290
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,800
We're gonna get his whales.

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
How?

292
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:02,174
He talked to Denny Shields.

293
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,358
Denny Shields?

294
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,299
After he bragged about you guys
into (?) talking about how (?)?

295
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,490
We need him.

296
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,203
I should have kept my mouth shut.

297
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:13,006
And then I saw that guy walking around.

298
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,786
I didn't know who he was.
And I... Just some guy to me.

299
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:17,289
- And I guess I pissed him off.
- Denny, look...

300
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:20,089
you know what you gotta know who he was.

301
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,261
Just forget it. Let it go.

302
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:24,007
The other stuff I got taken
care of...

303
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,287
is all straight.

304
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:27,102
I got 18 whales,

305
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:30,002
I spoke to their handlers,
I spoke to their managers,

306
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:31,202
I spoke to their assistants.

307
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,003
Everyone of them is gonna (?).

308
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,703
We're gonna do it in two (?).

309
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:37,029
I'm gonna leave first
they're gonna follow.

310
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,517
- Okay.
- Okay.

311
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,717
But you gotta make sure they win
because these guys usually lose.

312
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:44,922
- And when they lose, they get (?).
- They're gonna win big.

313
00:15:45,055 --> 00:15:46,371
- How big?
- 500.

314
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:48,470
- One million.
- That night, just the (?)?

315
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,851
No, it's a reverse
Big Store.

316
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,267
Right...

317
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,978
- Doesn't matter if we win...
- As long as the casino loses, yes...

318
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,051
That could actually work.
So you need to (?)...

319
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:00,493
Craps, Black Jack,
roulette, slots.

320
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,008
This polymer reacts to
ultrasonic pulses...

321
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:08,064
but it's not metallic, so the compasses
on the table won't detect it...

322
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,641
and it don't effect the way
(?) mark the dice.

323
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,661
Now this...

324
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,092
(?) lighter?

325
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,942
<i>The dice are controlled from the
manufacturer all the way to the floor.</i>

326
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:22,457
<i>Which is why we went
all the way to the manufacturer.</i>

327
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,352
Could the climat control be switched on?

328
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,352
The climat control? You're crazy.

329
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,352
Cred cã va trebui sã...

330
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,276
ªtii ceva?
E periculos.

331
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:01,300
Pune-þi înapoi masca.

332
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,240
Periculos, e cel de-al
doilea nume al meu.

333
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,924
That's not your problem.

334
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,268
So you're jammed on
Black Jack.

335
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,355
We've embedded Livingston in
the Shuffle Company.

336
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:18,977
Now the tap will stimulate your EKG
much in the same way a lie would.

337
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,064
But you have to step on it
during the control questions.

338
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,564
Your name, birth date, so on.

339
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:26,036
So those levels will match the stress level
with your false answers.

340
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:27,136
I got it.

341
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,004
How much is this gonna hurt?

342
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,555
If you're doing it right,
it should be pretty excruciating.

343
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:35,005
<i>Is your birth date February 11, 1965?</i>

344
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:36,235
<i>Yes.</i>

345
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:39,004
<i>Are you wearing a white shirt?</i>

346
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:40,304
<i>Yes.</i>

347
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:44,005
<i>Have you ever been involved in
the commission of a crime?</i>

348
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,345
<i>Oh, no.</i>

349
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,334
<i>Have you ever defrauded or attempted
to defraud the gaming industry?</i>

350
00:17:50,173 --> 00:17:51,226
<i>No.</i>

351
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,320
- Alex...
- Solid.

352
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,203
I love technology.

353
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,503
- I guess to look at you I'd swear
you would be evasive... - But?

354
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,799
the machine says you're clean.

355
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,003
I'm just a little nervous.

356
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,743
I really want this job.

357
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,780
<i>You can relax now.
Welcome to Shuffle Royal.</i>

358
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,039
The Shuffle Royal.

359
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,139
Well I doubt I've heard the last of that one.

360
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,001
So if Black Jack is
not your problem...

361
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,811
it must be slots.

362
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,622
Progressors(?) run of computer
chips now.

363
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,370
You're gonna have to program in a trapdoor.

364
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,251
I can probably find you
someone to do that.

365
00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:32,003
Thanks Roman, we got somebody in
on the inside.

366
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,983
A great kid
named Eugene.

367
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:35,763
<i>Who's got a little
too much downtime.</i>

368
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,518
He's run up a nice little online gaming tap.

369
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,394
<i>He won't be able to keep
it a secret much longer.</i>

370
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:44,397
Now I have no...
Uh yeah, it's crazed.

371
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:45,398
How bad is it?

372
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:49,252
Uh, it's bad...
I-I owe 30.000 dollars.

373
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:52,814
<i>- So it may as well be a 100.
- Alright.</i>

374
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,948
Let's call it a 100.

375
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,020
Thanks Danny.

376
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:00,547
Eugene. My pleasure.

377
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,674
Now tell me how you're
gonna program that trapdoor.

378
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,645
<i>So if that's not the problem,
it must be roulette.</i>

379
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,499
<i>(?) is in for a scanner
on the shoe...</i>

380
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,229
<i>wired to a microcomputer
somewhere on your person.</i>

381
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,053
<i>It figures the probability where
the wheels will end within 3 digits.</i>

382
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,037
<i>Yeah, we-we tried that.</i>

383
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:25,001
<i>No offense, the way he
was dressed, didn't help.</i>

384
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:26,651
<i>Not very subtle, this guy.</i>

385
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,783
<i>- So you're stuck on roulette?
- No.</i>

386
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:34,082
<i>We're going lo-fi we think we can
get some loaded balls in there.</i>

387
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,077
Kidding?
How are you gonna deliver?

388
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,677
Two stages.

389
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:39,629
First we position a man of our own.

390
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,007
There's a gaming Expo the day
of the grand opening...

391
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,617
which Bank is committed to attend.

392
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:46,470
To show what a regular
guy he is.

393
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,154
Frank's suiting up as The Game.

394
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:51,018
The men who make the decisions
are very very hard to impress.

395
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:54,018
That's why I'm asking each and
every one of you to help me so...

396
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:58,007
by being the most classy, gentile...

397
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,497
ladies.

398
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,005
The image that we're looking for...

399
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:04,395
are tasteful elegance.

400
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,348
What exactly do you want us to do?

401
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:10,248
Raise your skirts up about 3 inches.

402
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,236
Second part.
We tie Frank to one of theirs.

403
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,636
A pit boss with sticky fingers.

404
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:18,187
How much for these?

405
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,007
Is Willie Bank know
you're stealing his gold flatware, Neil?

406
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,415
How do you know my name?

407
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:33,391
Well we know a lotta names.

408
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:35,778
Your wife, Mary...

409
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,942
your kids, Leanne and Dolly.

410
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,954
We know that you are
the pit boss at the casino.

411
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,276
You don't wanna...

412
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,796
- I mean, I don't...
- We don't wanna hurt you.

413
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,986
We wanna help you.

414
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:48,412
We wanna double your salary.
All in one night.

415
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:52,308
What do you need me to do?

416
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,802
Right now, nothing. Go home,
do your job.

417
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,274
And at the appropriate moment
somebody'll present himself to you.

418
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:59,847
- Enough said?
- Enough said.

419
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:03,349
Who is the shill at the Expo
to rope Bank?

420
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,232
- We're still looking.
- We'll find someone.

421
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,132
Make sure it's somebody
he really despises.

422
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:10,106
Back to macro.

423
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:13,106
What is your exit strategy?

424
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,009
The players won't be on the scam...

425
00:21:17,013 --> 00:21:19,939
so they'll all think
it's their lucky night.

426
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,001
But you never get them out of
the door with all their winnings...

427
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,701
they'll dump it all back.

428
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:26,388
That's Vegas
and that's your problem.

429
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:28,258
Well the exit strategy is A problem...

430
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,358
it's not THE problem.

431
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,841
The problem is security.
We're drawing a blank.

432
00:21:32,855 --> 00:21:34,476
It's a little spooky.

433
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:36,229
(?) aren't on the grey market,
the black market...

434
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:38,229
or any other market.

435
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,900
And all I keep hearing, is there's
never been a system like this.

436
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,912
Now I've found out where they designed it,
but I can't even get in the building.

437
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:45,306
I've blown all my buy money,
my bribe money...

438
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:48,606
4 of my best ideas and
I am nowhere.

439
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,583
But not only I'm nowhere,
I'm pretty sure I'm being followed.

440
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,028
<i>Do you have anything?</i>

441
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,950
Yeah, I think I have a name,
but I don't even know if it's right.

442
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:57,824
- They're calling it...
- The Greco.

443
00:21:58,408 --> 00:21:59,730
The Greco Player Tracker.

444
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:02,846
They've put it in Vegas.

445
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,611
- Well I give you back the 100 Grant.
- Why?

446
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:10,606
Danny,

447
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,267
I like you.

448
00:22:12,752 --> 00:22:15,505
And you, Rusty.
I mean you got style.

449
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,627
You're brillant, got loyalty.

450
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,110
You two are (?), but...

451
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,210
even they went off to blow.

452
00:22:24,498 --> 00:22:26,553
You're analogue players
in a digital world.

453
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,309
You're done.

454
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:34,418
Believe me, I would love to
go up against Greco...

455
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,000
and crush him.

456
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,973
But it can't be beaten.

457
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,002
It can't be hacked...

458
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,242
and it can't be beaten.

459
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:44,420
Not even by you?

460
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,479
Oh with 18 months...

461
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,979
nothing else on my plate
no other jobs, no women or distractions...

462
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,867
maybe.

463
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:55,248
- You know everything about this thing.
- Everything.

464
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,337
Except where it was being
deployed.

465
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,232
The inventor is an old schoolmate of mine.

466
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,934
His name is Greco Montgomery

467
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:05,650
The pompous ass named
it after himself.

468
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,905
Greco?

469
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,740
Roman?

470
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:12,970
Yeah, you've obviously never served
time in a Britsh boarding school.

471
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,792
So what's so tough about this thing?

472
00:23:15,396 --> 00:23:18,783
It's an artificial intelligence
security system.

473
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:21,509
He must be field-testing.

474
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:23,479
You mean it has a brain?

475
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,717
A hell of a brain.

476
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,000
It doesn't only think...

477
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,684
it reasons.

478
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:34,500
<i>(?) every permutation in every weight
in every seat in the entire casino.</i>

479
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:36,074
<i>Hand by hand.</i>

480
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,071
That's why this
security cameras

481
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,071
that measure pupil dilation.

482
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:43,412
And determine if a win
is legitimate or expected.

483
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:45,007
It gathers biofeedback...

484
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,777
player's hartrates,
body temperatures...

485
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:50,285
it measures on a second by
second basis...

486
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:52,864
whether the standard variations
of gaming(?) algorithm...

487
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:54,064
are holding...

488
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,464
or are being manipulated.

489
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,070
The data is analyzed in real-time...

490
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:00,133
in a field of exabytes.

491
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:02,555
Exabytes?

492
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:05,006
- You know what a terabyte is?
- Yeah. It's a...

493
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:07,306
- An exabyte is a million terabytes.
- Right.

494
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,514
MacGreco is housed
in an impregnable room.

495
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:13,184
Shock mounted...

496
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,884
temperature controlled and it locks down
if it even sensors it is under attack.

497
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,536
If it locks down, there wouldn't
even be able to get out of the room.

498
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,712
Couldn't we just shut it off?
You know, cut the wires?

499
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,000
That could work.

500
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:29,350
Better still you'd just kick
the plug out of the socket.

501
00:24:29,351 --> 00:24:32,000
- Seriously.
- No, short of walking into that room...

502
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,705
with a bloody magnetron around your neck.

503
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,325
You know what a magnetron is?

504
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:38,679
Something that screws up the Greco.

505
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,973
Aha...

506
00:24:40,358 --> 00:24:41,660
short of that.

507
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,386
I'm kinda shocked this is
where we are, because...

508
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,252
- This is a problem.
- That's what I said.

509
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:50,052
But if we could somehow...

510
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:52,862
No there is no if...
It can not be shut off.

511
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,964
I mean you'd need a real natural
disaster an actual act of God.

512
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:57,496
- But if we could...
- You can't.

513
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,126
- But if we did?
- You can't.

514
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,643
You could.

515
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,623
Don't flatter.

516
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,911
If we could, how long
would it take to reboot?

517
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,654
Because it's so sophisticated
3,5 minutes.

518
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:12,004
Would be enough.

519
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:13,604
Pick a natural disaster.

520
00:25:17,052 --> 00:25:18,782
Get me a laptop.

521
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,163
Now the drill access is through
a sewer main of Paris Drive.

522
00:25:23,164 --> 00:25:26,370
Grind along here into the
northwest corner of the hotel.

523
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:27,378
Here.

524
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,456
Probably about 6,00 Rpm

525
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:30,956
so you won't wake all the neighbors.

526
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,013
When it reaches the resident's frequency...

527
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,313
the building acts like a tuning fork.

528
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,370
To the people inside it will
feel like an earthquake.

529
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,010
<i>That should knock out
the Greco.</i>

530
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,336
<i>And that's your exit strategy.</i>

531
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:18,447
- Hey Bash?
- I'm up here.

532
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:25,683
- Hey!
- Here you go.

533
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:28,489
Hey, where the mags?

534
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,443
- Linus...
- I can't find those things.

535
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:34,706
I need them.
I can't leave.

536
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:36,001
- Why are you such a...
- I'm sorry...

537
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:37,381
ask somebody else.

538
00:26:37,382 --> 00:26:40,082
- Ask Livingston.
- You're such a wowser.

539
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:45,698
Look, read this to Reuben.

540
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:52,869
I've done research. Positive
messages get through.

541
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,076
I can't say this.

542
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,476
No, no I'm saying it.
You're just a vessel.

543
00:26:57,477 --> 00:27:00,039
Come on Basher, look,
why don't you take a break?

544
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,339
I'll watch all the equipment.
You'll go read it to him.

545
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,699
Shit.

546
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,186
You know we never digging
the tunnel...

547
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:08,886
they had teams of guys
monitoring this.

548
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,002
Yeah?
How many?

549
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,074
Teams.

550
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,510
That's a 5.6.

551
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,643
If you don't think a 5.6
is possible...

552
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:26,730
or even likely. Then quit frankly you don't know
much about the (?) senior report...

553
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:29,497
specifically the Saxon
and the Mohabi block.

554
00:27:30,986 --> 00:27:33,826
I know what you're hoping
then it'll be just a blind trust(?)...

555
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,762
<i>See that, that's Rusty.</i>

556
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,989
He's doing an Irwin Allen.
See that?

557
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:43,034
He's not deaf, Linus.

558
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:46,168
<i>- Why am I here?
- Close your hotel.</i>

559
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:47,268
<i>Permanently.</i>

560
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:48,880
<i>What?</i>

561
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:50,566
We haven't even opened yet.

562
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,400
- What are all those people downstairs?
- Well, it's a soft open.

563
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:55,000
It's like an out of town preview...

564
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:57,141
What do you think? You just come in
here to tell me to close my hotel.

565
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,489
I'm not gonna close my hotel.

566
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,072
Sir, if you just let me come in with
my team and (?) here for a few days.

567
00:28:01,073 --> 00:28:03,263
- No.
- I can proof what I'm saying.

568
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:07,025
No hey, there is no way we are exposing
our exclusive clientele to a bunch of...

569
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,014
Scientists?

570
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,032
We wouldn't want that, would we?

571
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,255
Let's just hope for the best, shall we.
That should be enough.

572
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,123
Take this.

573
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,123
It's a standard torsion seismograph.

574
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,761
If there is a foreshock
it will register...

575
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:25,113
and you just might have
time te evacuate.

576
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,167
I don't want this thing on my desk.

577
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,664
No sir, let me tell you what you don't want.

578
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:32,001
Your hotel on the cover of Time magazine...

579
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:34,001
in a twisted heap of steel and glass.

580
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:36,001
You and your customers are
underneath it. Headline reads:

581
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:38,001
Who's to blame?

582
00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:40,394
That's what you don't want.

583
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,855
Okay...

584
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,003
Put an evacuation plan on paper.

585
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:48,733
Will do, sir.
Consider it done.

586
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,713
I do thank you for your time.

587
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,389
If you really wanna put yourself to
good use... Why don't you hit the tables?

588
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,000
I don't gamble, sir...

589
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,840
neither should you
not with people's lives.

590
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,558
I'll screen the meetings more careful
the next time. I'm sorry, Mr. Bank.

591
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:10,339
<i>And now we have a camera
in Bank's office.</i>

592
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,401
I see you, Reuben.

593
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:31,355
A letter from Basher.

594
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,125
Dear Reuben...

595
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,469
as the band said: two hearts
beat as one.

596
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,565
When men have been
in battle together...

597
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,265
they are bonded like the flower
and the soil and the sun...

598
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:50,399
and like the moon catches the light...
Reuben, I'm gonna go ahead on and leave this...

599
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,985
here.

600
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:58,600
I see you, pall.

601
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:10,000
So she says:
What did I do? What did I do?

602
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,773
I said:
What do I look like, a pancake eater?

603
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:15,696
- So you just left her down on the floor?
- Right on the floor.

604
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,050
- For how long?
- The next morning.

605
00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:19,989
Good.

606
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,693
Yeah.

607
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,681
Thanks Debbie.
Pack your swimsuit.

608
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:08,175
I don't wanna see any slack
faces in front of the house.

609
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,696
- Only happy faces, no slack faces.
- Right.

610
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,180
Go!

611
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,761
- Go! Go!
- Right.

612
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,949
I'm sorry.

613
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,560
Sorry.

614
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,060
Mr. Shields, where are you going?
We got you (?) grand opening.

615
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:39,736
A friend of mine, a very serious man...

616
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:42,044
told me very seriously...

617
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,944
that'll be a good idea
if I left the hotel.

618
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,907
I'm taking his suggestion.

619
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:48,131
He can't be too serious...

620
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:50,331
if he knew what I got in store for you now.

621
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:52,266
Willie, I'm outta here.
Thank you.

622
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:55,132
- See you Willie.
- I really hate to see you go, man.

623
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:56,100
Let's go.

624
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:01,261
Bank here.

625
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,804
Confirmed?

626
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:05,939
Bine.

627
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,150
- Where?
- The gentleman in the Trilby, sir.

628
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,800
The what?

629
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:16,167
The Dr. Dolittle hat.

630
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,599
Why don't you just say that?

631
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:20,843
Okay.

632
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,971
- Excuse me... Mr.?
- Chubb.

633
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,544
Kensington Chubb.

634
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,000
How do you do, Mr. Chubb?

635
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:42,886
Would you like to follow me, I think
I might be able to move things along.

636
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,659
How very nice of you.

637
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,035
No, no, no, no, no!

638
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:49,063
Her Highness is a very
delicate animal.

639
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:52,719
It upsets her so everyone
but papa carries her about.

640
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:54,776
All's well, dear.

641
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,587
- Why don't you just follow me?
- How very considerate.

642
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,658
<i>I do appreciate what
your're doing for me.</i>

643
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,659
Oh, sorry.

644
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,602
- Why does he get to go...
- He's a V.I.P.

645
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,000
So what's that make me?
A V.U.P.?

646
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,725
A Very Unimportant Person?

647
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,056
I have a reservation.

648
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,318
De ce nu iei o pauzã?
Mã ocup eu de oaspete.

649
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:25,590
Hello sir, I'm sorry for the wait.
Welcome to the Bank.

650
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:44,470
Hello.
Kensington Chubb here.

651
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:47,908
Saul, it's me.
He's in his room. Blast him.

652
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:49,271
Got it.

653
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,823
Gloves and mask
don't take any chances.

654
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:52,837
Got it.

655
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,889
Hello, front desk.

656
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:39,001
Yeah, I'm in room 1706...

657
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:41,871
and there's some sort of
terrible smell in here.

658
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,525
It smells like...

659
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,801
Well but... I need, I need to move!

660
00:35:47,254 --> 00:35:50,013
Certainly, sir.
I'll just see if we have anything available.

661
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,060
I'm sorry, sir. We are fully booked
for the grand opening gala...

662
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,060
but I'll let you know if anything ends up.

663
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,967
Enjoy your stay at the Bank.

664
00:35:59,968 --> 00:36:00,985
- But...
- Goodbye.

665
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:15,004
- That I'm ready to see all available rooms.
- My way, mister. - Thank you.

666
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,675
Her highness is so very
sensitive to smells.

667
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,330
Get away.

668
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,106
If you keep on complaining...

669
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,990
they'll fire us, just for listening...

670
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:33,027
I just say that the working
conditions are bad.

671
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:35,027
Nobody can deny that.

672
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,493
Payment... little.

673
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:42,028
Working hours... long.

674
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,198
That's the way it is in Mexico.

675
00:36:47,129 --> 00:36:50,000
Did you all forget about...

676
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:52,000
general Emiliano Zapata?

677
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:55,687
When they took the land
from the poor...

678
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,960
they believed it was
forever stolen.

679
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But Zapata said to them:

680
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:05,420
it's better to die on your feet...

681
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:08,921
than to live on your knees.

682
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And they fought.

683
00:37:13,001 --> 00:37:15,000
And they fought.

684
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,001
Hello.

685
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:35,841
I'd like a table for one.
I hear your risotto is tremendous.

686
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,337
It is tremendous.

687
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,167
- The name on the reservation?
- (?).

688
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:44,665
I'm sorry, sir. I can't
accomodate you.

689
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,042
Those are reserved.

690
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:50,742
May I recommend one of
our other restaurants?

691
00:37:50,743 --> 00:37:54,295
Ling Su, Cantonesian (?) cuisine.

692
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,030
Great.

693
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:24,895
<i>Okay it's not a prop, for prop's sake.</i>

694
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,300
<i>No, the Brody can work.</i>

695
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:32,012
What? Just you got the
greatest cover known to men?

696
00:38:32,098 --> 00:38:34,712
Right? So you don't even have to
think about these things anymore.

697
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,071
Congratulations!

698
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,618
No, maybe you're getting soft.

699
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,958
No, I'm not gonna put Danny on...

700
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,078
or Rusty.

701
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,382
Just... Goodbye dad.

702
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:50,670
Okay.

703
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,781
I rerouted all the impulses
going to the main randomizer.

704
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,340
In Black Jack the best (?) is 21.

705
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,897
It's called Black Jack.

706
00:38:59,323 --> 00:39:02,000
So the results should be 20's
and Black Jack...

707
00:39:02,003 --> 00:39:03,328
to all the players...

708
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,828
with the dealer "bust".

709
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,751
Your call.

710
00:39:19,912 --> 00:39:21,901
Do over. A do over.

711
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,535
Okay... I'll keep working.

712
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:39,535
- Good.
- Great.

713
00:39:42,168 --> 00:39:45,044
Yes, I'll have the dumplings and
the Shataki mushroom (?)...

714
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,644
and a sparkling water.

715
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,363
Staff...

716
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:43,334
casino...

717
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,451
food...

718
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,235
room cleanliness.

719
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:27,446
<i>At this point...
there's nothing I can do to help.</i>

720
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:29,027
He said that he'd be...

721
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:30,827
Cum îi zice?
Ambulatory by now.

722
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,964
- Are you keeping his spirits (?).
- We're working on it.

723
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:34,965
Thanks Stan.

724
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,006
Oh no, that's way too much.

725
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:40,666
- No.
- It's not like I removed a bullet.

726
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,665
This side.

727
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:47,163
- Dr. Stan! - Hey Linus, how's it going?
- Great.

728
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:48,463
- We're dead.
- What are you talking about?

729
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,964
- The factory in Mexico is offline.
- Offline?

730
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:53,001
- What does that mean exactly?
- I couldn't get details.

731
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:54,301
It just shut down.

732
00:41:54,785 --> 00:41:56,681
- You don't think that...
- Yeah, I do. - Oh boy.

733
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:21,080
So he says that they want their bread
and they want their roses too.

734
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,036
We better get down there
and straighten this out.

735
00:42:23,037 --> 00:42:24,976
- He doesn't listen to me.
- You're going.

736
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:28,000
If we don't get this factory back online...

737
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:29,330
we have to dock this showboat.

738
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:35,259
What do you mean?
Just the whole operation...

739
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,443
Dude, I got the showboat metaphor.
Thank you, Linus.

740
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,443
I gotta get back.

741
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:42,017
What?

742
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,251
What do you mean "what"?
(?) little something for the effort, maybe.

743
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,000
We pull tips.

744
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,400
The other guys are gonna think I'm kiting.

745
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,025
- Come on. - You want it
to come out of my pocket, or something?

746
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,019
Yeah.

747
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,649
Take it easy.
What's the problem?

748
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:04,820
The Tricode Optimizers that be into
into the nipple sleeve receivers...

749
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:06,003
pulverated their lubricating
(?)...

750
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:08,853
up against tension against the sidewalls.

751
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:09,682
Aha...

752
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,642
Picture a knee but without any
cartilage, bone on bone.

753
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:17,787
Apar deformãri în densitatea aliajului.

754
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:20,000
Devine ca un magnet.
Inverseazã polaritatea.

755
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:21,887
Where does that put us?

756
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,039
Cattled.

757
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:32,005
Okay. The good news is
there's another B600 available.

758
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:33,455
The one that dug the Chunnel.

759
00:43:33,556 --> 00:43:35,812
- I thought we had the one that dug the Chunnel.
- We did.

760
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,177
This one dug from
the French side.

761
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,258
The bad news is with timing this short
we're gonna have to buy this one.

762
00:43:40,259 --> 00:43:42,095
- And it's expensive.
- How much do we have left?

763
00:43:42,105 --> 00:43:44,994
If I tap the whole contingency
just over 10 million.

764
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:46,223
- How close does that get us?
- No.

765
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:47,322
How much is it?

766
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,672
- 30.
- 30?

767
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:50,141
- 6.
- 6?

768
00:43:50,142 --> 00:43:51,142
36.

769
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:55,892
- Isn't there a way doing it without the drill?
- The drill is the exit strategy.

770
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,293
Well...

771
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:00,015
is there a way for us to raise money?

772
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:02,892
- I got everything I have in this already.
- So do I.

773
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:04,636
- Me too.
- We all do.

774
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:12,193
If anyone of us was lying up
on that bed Reuben wouldn't rest...

775
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:14,193
until he made it right.

776
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,006
I gotta go up there and tell him
that we failed...

777
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:17,506
and there's nothing we can do about it?

778
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:25,715
- So we're stopping?
- I'm not saying that. - So what then?

779
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,386
Scuzi, signori.

780
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,002
Mr. Reuben is talking.

781
00:44:34,006 --> 00:44:35,462
He asks for Mr. Danny.

782
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:52,011
I hear cars pulling in...

783
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:56,911
I hear whispering conversations,
Linus crying.

784
00:44:57,459 --> 00:45:00,589
Why don't you tell me what
everyone else seems to know?

785
00:45:03,415 --> 00:45:06,465
Well the thing is...

786
00:45:06,466 --> 00:45:07,829
Wait!

787
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:10,891
Hi.
Good to see you smiling again.

788
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:14,509
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

789
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,862
That's your idea?

790
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,000
Well, we've shaken all the trees,
we've looked under every rock...

791
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,279
we've searched every...

792
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:25,063
We talked to everybody
we can trust.

793
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,022
I know it's not a great idea,
but it is an idea...

794
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,372
and I think as long as we have one idea
we shouldn't give up.

795
00:45:34,012 --> 00:45:36,150
I was really hoping to avoid
that this time.

796
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:43,348
Number one.

797
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,000
If any of you is trying to screw me...

798
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,477
he'll be dead.

799
00:45:48,868 --> 00:45:50,008
And I'm gonna be looking in
on the operation...

800
00:45:50,018 --> 00:45:52,158
just to make sure.
Number two.

801
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,041
I'll lend you this money
I am your senior partner.

802
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:56,041
Last money in, first money out.

803
00:45:56,646 --> 00:45:58,945
And you will double my investment.

804
00:45:59,986 --> 00:46:00,838
Double?

805
00:46:05,046 --> 00:46:07,656
- Is that a "yes"?
- Double.

806
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:16,005
That monstrosity that Bank
calls a hotel...

807
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:17,815
casts a shadow over my pool.

808
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:20,446
Break him.

809
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:24,392
Break him in half.
The man has no taste...

810
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,497
and yet every time
he opens a hotel...

811
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,497
he wins a Royal Review Board...

812
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:30,162
Five Diamond Award.

813
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,038
Every time he wins the Five
Diamond Award, he celebrates by...

814
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:34,438
We know.

815
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:37,205
- By buying one for his wife.
- You mean five.

816
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:40,654
- One is five.
- Number three.

817
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:44,421
I want you to steal the diamonds.

818
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,085
- No, that's... - Can't be done.
- We don't have the manpower or time.

819
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:50,508
- (?)
- We get caught we go away for life.

820
00:46:50,569 --> 00:46:52,452
We're not gonna risk that
so you can get his diamonds.

821
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:54,452
They're not for me.

822
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:57,003
I just want him to lose
what matters most to him.

823
00:46:57,098 --> 00:46:59,003
Do what you want with them.

824
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:02,048
But you need to steal the diamonds...

825
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:04,048
or you find somebody else
to finance your drill.

826
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:12,000
The B600 drill.

827
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:14,014
So what's the deal with
these diamonds then?

828
00:47:14,019 --> 00:47:16,014
They're out of Tiffany
they're 30 karat each.

829
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:19,581
(?) the award plaques...
On today's legitimate market they'd be worth...

830
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:21,384
250 million dollars.

831
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,684
Bank's already purchased the next one
in anticipation of winning the award.

832
00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:28,953
The rest are kept in a secure glass
viewing boot at the top of the tower.

833
00:47:29,171 --> 00:47:31,780
- And Benedict said we can keep?
- That's what he said.

834
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:34,063
Then why want these diamonds
on the agenda to begin with?

835
00:47:34,189 --> 00:47:35,530
Because it can't be done.

836
00:47:36,985 --> 00:47:39,203
This is why revenge jobs
don't work, Daniel.

837
00:47:39,204 --> 00:47:42,539
You put yourself in a position, you know
you should walk away, but you can't.

838
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,225
This is how guys die
or go to jail.

839
00:47:45,226 --> 00:47:46,226
Alright.

840
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:48,324
Does anybody wanna walk away?

841
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,000
- Saul?
- I say I was walking away.

842
00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:56,149
Let's cut the son of a bitch.

843
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,000
Okay. Bank fired (?), (?), (?)

844
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:03,053
and 4 others, just so he could say
he designed the hotel himself.

845
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:04,054
What this means to us?

846
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,735
There's no set of unified plans.

847
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:10,371
- Routes?
- According to March 05 plans...

848
00:48:10,372 --> 00:48:15,448
there's interior shafts with potential access to
the diamond viewing room. Here, here and here.

849
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,119
But the May 05 plans only show
shafts: here and here.

850
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:20,519
September 05 shows no shafts...

851
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:23,086
and December 06 plans are
the same as...

852
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:25,076
- How many sets of plans are there?
- That's ten.

853
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:30,000
Since we can't trust the accuracy
of these drawings...

854
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:31,113
based on my walking around...

855
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:33,889
these are the shafts we have to
clap an eyeball on.

856
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,988
Now there's still nowhere of knowing the
thickness of the floor underneath the diamonds.

857
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:39,010
Anything thicker than 5 inches
we have a problem.

858
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:40,690
Right.

859
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,008
This here is the elevator shaft...

860
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:46,398
which can be accessed through
a super high roller villa.

861
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:48,759
- Got it?
- Alright.

862
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,927
So who's gonna be our super high roller?

863
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:15,773
I'm so sorry to bring (?)...

864
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:18,925
Pepperidge, Lenny Pepperidge.
I'm Mr. Weng's communicator.

865
00:49:19,705 --> 00:49:21,853
He'd like you to know that
he was waiting for 7 minutes.

866
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,415
We've received your 10 million
dollar cash deposit...

867
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:27,008
and I would like you to know
that what we normally do...

868
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:29,005
Mr. Weng won't take a line.

869
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:31,415
He's a man of extraordinary
discipline.

870
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,283
He's willing to risk 10 million,
not a dollar more.

871
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:36,007
Did you say Mr. Weng was in
real estate, Mr. Pepperidge?

872
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,517
That's right.

873
00:49:37,518 --> 00:49:39,245
I only ask because his name...

874
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:41,745
doesn't come up on our
standard file database.

875
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:44,817
And Mr. Weng and I have worked
very hard to keep it that way.

876
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:48,697
Exactly what kind of real estate did
you say that Mr. Weng was involved?

877
00:49:48,698 --> 00:49:52,247
Look he owns all the air
south of Beijing.

878
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,370
- The air?
- Put it to you this way...

879
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:57,004
try building something larger
than 3 stories...

880
00:49:57,011 --> 00:49:58,684
in the Tianjin province...

881
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:00,903
see if his name comes up
in your database then.

882
00:50:03,706 --> 00:50:06,837
How quickly can you transfer his money
from your cage to the cage at the Bellagio?

883
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:08,546
Now I don't think that's necessary...

884
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:12,077
at all Mr. Pepperidge, we've
reserved our largest villa for Mr. Weng.

885
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,073
Extension 765.

886
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,367
Hello Robert.
This is Abigail Sponder.

887
00:50:31,368 --> 00:50:33,274
Your (?) introduced
us not too long ago...

888
00:50:33,368 --> 00:50:35,274
at the gaming fraud seminar.

889
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,982
I remember you.
What can I do for you, Miss Sponder?

890
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:42,117
Well, you know... We're about
to open a new property...

891
00:50:42,118 --> 00:50:43,045
and there are a couple of
characters here...

892
00:50:43,218 --> 00:50:45,045
I'm not to sure about.

893
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:47,747
Why don't you give me their names
and I'll check them out.

894
00:51:00,105 --> 00:51:01,060
Up you go.

895
00:51:03,976 --> 00:51:05,586
- What do you mean you're not going?
- You gotta go.

896
00:51:06,215 --> 00:51:07,199
Too fast?

897
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,306
You did the bullet train stunt
with all of Asia watching...

898
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:11,346
elevators aren't faster than that.

899
00:51:13,879 --> 00:51:15,002
That was C.G.I.?

900
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,842
Adicã a fost o minciunã?

901
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:19,118
Jesus.

902
00:51:20,429 --> 00:51:22,931
- Okay then.
- We're down again.

903
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:25,751
Well what about Reuben?

904
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,524
- Este fãrã inimã.
- It's just a living.

905
00:51:29,899 --> 00:51:32,000
Am putea plãti pe cineva
sã-i citeascã.

906
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:34,228
Maybe he'll see his
next birthday.

907
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:36,924
- January?
- I don't think so.

908
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,389
Shit.

909
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,216
Shit. Shit. Shit.

910
00:52:27,183 --> 00:52:28,237
Shit.

911
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,326
And then what happened?

912
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,041
She said she liked surprises.

913
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:39,141
I don't think that's what she meant.

914
00:52:39,142 --> 00:52:40,152
You think?

915
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:44,200
- So she put down the remote.
- And I put the towel back on.

916
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:46,520
Now, those (?)

917
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,947
- Relationships can be...
- Sure.

918
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:51,071
- But they're also...
- That's right.

919
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,290
I've gone through so many
blueprints...

920
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,690
I can taste the ink
on my fingers.

921
00:52:57,691 --> 00:52:58,490
Yeah...

922
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,569
The only other access point is through
the main airconditiong (?).

923
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:03,818
- We gotta move that guard.
- We don't have anything on him.

924
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:04,793
Let's find something.

925
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,459
ªi sã ajungem la elicopter

926
00:53:07,713 --> 00:53:08,897
Let's find something.

927
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,754
(?), this used to be the dunes.

928
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:19,775
Reuben thought me to shoot craps
here when I was a kid.

929
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:24,029
Am jucat. Instrumentarul
nu este 66.

930
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:26,021
He straightened me out.

931
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:30,193
I was 20... 2.

932
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:34,083
First time I met Reuben...

933
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:38,249
he looked me off getting cheated
at an old dealer's game at the (?)...

934
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,842
and he bought me breakfast.

935
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:47,150
Sands was there... Desert Inn.

936
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,510
They built them a lot smaller back then.

937
00:53:52,198 --> 00:53:53,742
They seemed pretty big.

938
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:57,256
The town has changed.

939
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:08,564
<i>You know if I read
încã ceva despre</i>

940
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:11,414
<i>Vegas legend,
Terry Benedict...</i>

941
00:55:11,665 --> 00:55:13,489
<i>I'm gonna have to buy
a magazine of my own.</i>

942
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:16,101
<i>And I haven't forgotten about that phone.</i>

943
00:55:16,572 --> 00:55:19,370
<i>Ah, the gold model, the one
that retails for 10.000.</i>

944
00:55:19,788 --> 00:55:23,939
<i>The double light Samsung.
Okay, that would be... Ungettable.</i>

945
00:55:24,216 --> 00:55:26,621
<i>No, no... You call Teddy Sanders
of promotion.</i>

946
00:55:26,622 --> 00:55:29,150
<i>I did that and he promised you...</i>

947
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:32,413
<i>the very first one as soon as
it comes of the line in September.</i>

948
00:55:32,414 --> 00:55:33,679
<i>That's July for me.</i>

949
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,281
What did you say about Samsung?

950
