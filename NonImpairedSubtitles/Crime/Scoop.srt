1
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,898
Don't mourn
for Joe Strombel.

2
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,797
Joe Strombel led a full life.

3
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,165
A newspaperman
in the best tradition.

4
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,945
A great credit
to the fourth estate.

5
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,082
It didn't matter if the bombs
in the war zone were falling.

6
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,647
It didn't matter how high up
the political scandal went,

7
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,617
or how many
big corporations

8
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,214
or small-time racketeers
leaned on him.

9
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:10,385
Whatever the risk,
if there was a story there,

10
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:14,129
Joe went after it.
And he usually got it.

11
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,428
Well, I was with him when the
story broke about Prince Charles,

12
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,302
and that made him persona non
grata with the Royal Family.

13
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,240
Except with Diana. They
always remained good friends.

14
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,936
He did love a woman.

15
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,510
Hey, did you know he started
as a police reporter?

16
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,343
Did he? Yeah, he was a bloody good one.

17
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,349
One of the best.
Maybe the best.

18
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,851
I got trapped with Joe once
in Afghanistan.

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,909
Yeah?

20
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,181
And we were going to be shot
any moment by the Taliban, until,

21
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,685
typically, Joe found
someone to bribe

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,453
so we could escape.

23
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,588
Not with his own money, though.
No, no, he got it on expenses.

24
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,029
Plus 10%.
Ten percent.

25
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,268
But it did involve us
getting out wearing burkas.

26
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,198
And, well, we lived
to write another day.

27
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,001
Everyone loved him.
Yeah.

28
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,768
Not always at
British intelligence.

29
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,037
No, but he got the
information before anyone else.

30
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,169
Yeah, he did. That's right.
Not Richard Nixon, though.

31
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,483
Well, wherever you are now, Joe, it
won't be the same without you, mate.

32
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,852
To Joe.
Joe Strombel.

33
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,306
Where are we headed?

34
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,583
Does this
mean anything to you?

35
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,686
He doesn't give answers.
Tried it.

36
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,723
Joe Strombel.
Coronary thrombosis.

37
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,700
Jane Cook.

38
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,569
So, what do you do?
Reporter.

39
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,163
Hmm.
You?

40
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:06,337
I'm... Well, I was personal
secretary to Peter Lyman.

41
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,509
Lord Lyman's son.
Yes, impressive young man.

42
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,781
You knew him?
No, only by reputation.

43
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,550
But I like what I know.

44
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,582
I think he's got
a real future in politics.

45
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,350
How did you die?

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,993
I think I was poisoned.

47
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,085
You think?

48
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,989
Why?

49
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,930
I believe I was poisoned

50
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,834
because I was on the verge of
confirming a terrible suspicion.

51
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,868
Yes?
What suspicion is that?

52
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,772
That Peter Lyman
is the serial killer

53
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,672
known to the police
as the Tarot Card Killer.

54
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,907
What?

55
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,177
I assume
you're aware of that case?

56
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,718
Yeah, I wrote an article two years ago,
when the Tarot killings first started.

57
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,256
But Peter Lyman? My God.

58
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,219
What on earth
made you suspect

59
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,784
this rich, young handsome,
above-reproach citizen?

60
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,091
You remember the last murder?
The police found a clue.

61
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,492
Yes, a cufflink. I read about it in
the paper. Unusual antique, wasn't it?

62
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,203
Yep.
Very rare Art Deco.

63
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,967
Peter had the exact pair.

64
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,904
So could have
the Tarot Killer.

65
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,569
The world is full
of coincidences.

66
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,910
Yeah, except I noticed
that Peter only had one left.

67
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,883
He'd lost the other.

68
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,513
Still,

69
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,616
although
it's a tantalizing thought.

70
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,123
Did you inform the police,
or was that too sticky?

71
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,418
I didn't know what to do,
so I phoned my lawyer

72
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,723
and I asked his advice on
whether to report it or not.

73
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,394
And I thought I heard
this click on the phone,

74
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,598
you know, like someone
had been listening.

75
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,798
Later that day, after tea,

76
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,771
I died suddenly.

77
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,208
That is suspicious.

78
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,911
My God, Peter Lyman.

79
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,452
Hard to believe, but if he did
turn out to be the Tarot Killer,

80
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,415
what a story.

81
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,118
I knew you'd appreciate it when
you said you were a reporter.

82
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,094
This would be a dynamite
scoop. And I got it first.

83
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,222
Yeah. Unfortunately, where
you're headed there is no first.

84
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,993
There's only last.

85
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,369
Mr. Tinsley!
Loved your last picture.

86
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,777
You really have a way
with actors.

87
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,213
Think you could maybe...
Please wait!

88
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,747
Mr. Tinsley?
Yeah.

89
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,955
Sondra Pransky.
Who?

90
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,625
Sondra Pransky. I'm the
journalism student from Adair.

91
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,389
I wrote to you about getting an
interview for the school newspaper.

92
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,451
Oh...

93
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,021
And you, well, your secretary,
actually, because... Not you.

94
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,500
I mean, I know how busy
film directors get and all.

95
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,299
But you said if I was in London
visiting, then you would, you know,

96
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,697
and here I am,
which is fantastic.

97
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,569
I think I have
your letter, actually.

98
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,905
See, right now I'm a
bit tied up. Here it is!

99
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,480
Here it is.
This is so great for me.

100
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,381
I mean, you've got
a huge following in Rochester.

101
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,679
It gets very cold there.

102
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,584
With your new movie coming
out in the fall, and... Well...

103
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,221
Actually,

104
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,256
I was wondering if we could just
ask you a couple of questions.

105
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,694
Do you mind? Okay, okay,
but we got to be real quick.

106
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,713
I write for the cultural
part of the paper.

107
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,617
I'm looking to move into
more serious pieces.

108
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:39,014
And when you say something
more serious, that's...

109
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,361
You really want to know?

110
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,631
Well, originally, I wasn't
going to go to college.

111
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,725
I was going to become a dental
hygienist like my sister, Beverly.

112
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,895
And, don't get me wrong,
it's a great profession.

113
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,429
I have very high respect for
teeth and gums, particularly gums.

114
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,941
My whole family's
in orthodontics. But...

115
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,342
And what? You're
vacationing here? Oh, yes.

116
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:05,006
Oh, I'm just very friendly with
a very upper class British family.

117
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,143
Our families vacationed
in Palm Beach together.

118
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,619
My mother
won a visit to Palm Beach

119
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,213
and I became friends with
their granddaughter, Vivian.

120
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,951
She's so lovely.
She'll stay with us...

121
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,593
Another?
Oh, thanks.

122
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,163
So I slept with him and I
didn't even get the interview.

123
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,757
I mean,
what kind of a reporter am I?

124
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,869
How was the sex?
Give me all the details.

125
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,530
Who knows? I was so drunk,
I don't even remember.

126
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,136
All I know is that
the second it was over,

127
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,402
he got a phone call and had
to leave suddenly for Thailand.

128
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,465
Thailand?

129
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:35,344
Yeah, Justin Richards got fired from
some project and he had to take over.

130
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,438
What difference does it make?

131
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,177
The point is,
I told the whole school

132
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,412
I'd get an exclusive
with Michael Tinsley!

133
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,475
You were nervous.

134
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,755
You're inexperienced.
You drank.

135
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,381
He's a charming genius.

136
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,720
But you know, you're a
very attractive, sexy girl.

137
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,284
If you're going to interview movers
and shakers in their hotel rooms,

138
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,523
you better watch out.

139
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,623
Not that I'd mind a roll in
the hay with Michael Tinsley.

140
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,834
I've put some fresh towels
in your bedroom, Sondra.

141
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,334
Thank you,
Mrs. Thompson.

142
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,100
Come on, sweetheart. Chop,
chop. You're gonna be late.

143
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,006
Oh, Mom. The point is
I didn't get the story!

144
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,806
I mean, if I'd used
my feminine wiles

145
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,574
like Katharine Hepburn
or Rosalind Russell.

146
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,013
Oh, come on.

147
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,913
We'll go have lunch
at The Ivy,

148
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,178
and then we'll take
my little brother

149
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,049
to see that show
he's so excited about,

150
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,918
and then we'll go
to that party tonight.

151
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,889
There'll be
loads of gorgeous guys there.

152
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,392
And you're always saying all the
men you meet are complete losers.

153
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:24,189
So you blew the story.
It's not life or death.

154
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare yourselves

155
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,799
for the astonishing magic

156
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,236
of Splendini!

157
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,179
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
you're an incredible audience

158
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,724
and I mean that sincerely. I say
that from the bottom of my heart.

159
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,655
You know, every time I come
to London, this great city,

160
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,695
I always get
a sincere sensation,

161
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,131
because you're marvelous
people, beautiful humans.

162
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,696
And for my next experiment...

163
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,738
And I call it an experiment,
you see, not a trick.

164
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,203
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

165
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,571
So if you'll step out
and find someone for me.

166
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,772
This is kind of dangerous
stuff so no children here.

167
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,837
I need
a grown-up volunteer.

168
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,349
Someone who's willing
to put her life on the line.

169
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,055
Is this your first time on stage? Yes.

170
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,320
Yes, you've never done... Well,
you got nothing to be afraid of.

171
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,829
You nervous? Don't be nervous.

172
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,757
What's your name?
Tell them your name.

173
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,924
Sondra Pransky.

174
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,027
A landsman!
United States! Fantastic!

175
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,937
And where are you from,
Sondra? No, don't tell me,

176
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,167
'cause I got a great ear
for that kind of thing.

177
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,109
Alabama!
Am I right? Am I right?

178
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,407
Close.
Yeah?

179
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm from Brooklyn.
Incredible!

180
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,917
God bless you, sweetheart.
I'm from Brooklyn, too.

181
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,612
That is fantastic. I feel such
love coming from this woman.

182
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,915
I can't tell you.
It's really...

183
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,820
I say this with all sincerity
from the bottom of my heart.

184
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,257
You're an incredible human
being and a credit to your race.

185
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,894
Sondra, let me ask you a question.
What do you do? Tell them what you do.

186
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,824
I'm a student.

187
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:17,162
Yeah? A student?
And what are you studying?

188
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,397
No. No, wait! I got an instinct
for what a person is studying.

189
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,097
For exactly
what you'd be right for.

190
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,700
Dental hygienist!

191
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,245
Was I close?

192
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,948
No, I'm a journalism student.

193
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,347
You study journalism.
Well, if you...

194
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,378
Have you ever been
dematerialized before?

195
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,217
No. No? Well, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

196
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,588
I'm just going to agitate some of
your molecules and split them apart.

197
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,286
It's not gonna hurt. I just
ate. Is this gonna make me...

198
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,519
You just ate.
She said she...

199
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,630
I'll do the jokes, Sondra.

200
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,793
Now, Sondra, I'm going to
ask you to step into that box

201
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,171
and I'm gonna have your molecules
split up. I'm gonna split 'em up.

202
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,673
It's gonna be very painless. And I'm
gonna put you back together again.

203
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,436
Don't tickle me.

204
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,304
Tell them what you just said
to me. You got to hear this.

205
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,641
Tell them what you said to me.

206
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,408
No, tell them, tell them.
No.

207
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,473
She said, "Don't tickle me. "

208
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,314
God bless you, sweetheart.

209
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,251
You got
a fantastic sense of humor.

210
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,516
You know if more people in
the world had a sense of humor,

211
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,854
we would not be
in the state we are in today.

212
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,393
I kid you not.

213
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,095
Get in the box. Get in
the box, Sondra. Go ahead.

214
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,927
In the box. Go ahead. Get in the
box. Get in the box. Hurry up.

215
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,326
I'm going to agitate the molecules
now. Miss Sondra Mandelbaum.

216
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,461
Pransky.

217
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,002
Pransky, Mandelbaum.
What's the...

218
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,337
We take off the same
holidays. Doesn't matter.

219
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,604
Get in the box, sweetheart,
and don't be scared.

220
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,667
You in there?

221
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,716
You're a journalist, right? Oh,
my God. What are you doing in here?

222
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,186
Aren't you
a journalist? Yeah?

223
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,688
I mean, those are the vibrations
I've been concentrating on.

224
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,588
Are you ready, Sondra?

225
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,821
I'm Joe Strombel, reporter, and
I have the scoop of the decade

226
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,488
about the Tarot Card
murder case.

227
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,294
I mean if it pans out,
it'll be fantastic.

228
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,665
It's got everything. Big
names, murder, prostitution.

229
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,302
I'm going to start agitating
your molecules.

230
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,772
You're a journalist. I've
got some information for you.

231
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,336
Big story.
Big, big, big scoop.

232
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,373
Peter Lyman...

233
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,331
Come on out, Sondra. Come on out,
sweetheart. Come on out, sweetheart.

234
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,461
The trick's over.
It's over. It's over.

235
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,206
She's a little stunned. She's never
been on stage before. So, you know...

236
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,400
She's a little stunned.

237
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,943
Are your molecules okay?
Is everything feeling good?

238
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,809
You all in shape?
You got all your parts?

239
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,549
That's fantastic.

240
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,950
Okay, Sondra, take your seat. Go back
to your seat. Go back to your seat.

241
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,454
Go ahead. She's great. Let's hear
it for her. She's great. Go ahead.

242
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,080
Go ahead.
Go back to your seat.

243
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,236
Will you take out
the blue light, please?

244
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,006
'Cause I'm
getting a completely

245
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,740
negative vibration
from the blue.

246
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:16,974
It's not right.

247
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,342
There's a lady
to see you, sir.

248
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,646
Hey, Mandelbaum! From the
school newspaper, am I right?

249
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:24,746
No, Pransky.

250
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,791
Listen, I have to talk to you
about something very serious.

251
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,292
When you put me
inside that box...

252
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,657
I smell
a frivolous lawsuit here.

253
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,822
You going to tell me you're getting
headaches now or something? Dizzy spells?

254
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,797
No. No. When you put me inside
that Chinese box...

255
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,359
Yeah, the dematerializer.

256
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,961
...a spirit materialized.

257
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,495
Uh-huh...

258
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,835
No, Mr. Splendini,
I'm very serious about this.

259
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,104
You can drop the Splendini.
My name is Sidney Waterman.

260
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,805
You know what I mean?
I just go exotic

261
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,008
to give the square haircuts a
little charisma now and then.

262
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,347
Look, the spirit appeared
right next to me!

263
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,080
At first I thought
he was one of your stooges.

264
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,317
I don't work with stooges, you know,
because you gotta pay them health benefits.

265
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,381
But then he told me
his name was Joe Strombel,

266
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,460
a journalist
from the land of the departed.

267
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,552
I couldn't believe it.

268
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,256
I'm a journalist,
he's a journalist.

269
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,594
I mean, our vibes must have
kind of meshed together and...

270
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,100
You know, he didn't say
that, in so many words,

271
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,636
but I'm putting
two and two together here.

272
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,696
Do me a favor, put two and
two together someplace else,

273
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,605
because I'm very, very busy.
So, do you mind?

274
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,577
Listen, I Googled him, okay?
There is a Joe Strombel

275
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,806
and he died three days ago.
Uh-huh.

276
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,212
Just put me
back in the box.

277
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,057
Now, I'm going
to agitate the molecules,

278
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,786
so let me know
if anything happens,

279
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,024
you know, just keep me posted.
I'll be right here.

280
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,158
The molecules are whirling.

281
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,668
Mr. Strombel? Joe?

282
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,801
It's Sondra Pransky here.

283
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,775
I'm a journalist at Adair. I know you
may have been aiming a little bit higher,

284
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,779
but I assure you, whatever I lack in
experience, I make up for in dedication.

285
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,312
I'm beginning
to lose patience, Sondra.

286
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,287
So, let's go. Is there
anybody in there at all?

287
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,088
Nothing. Nothing yet.

288
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,286
<i>Okay, that's it.
Finito. I've had it.</i>

289
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,089
Come on, sweetheart.
And if I were you,

290
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,290
I would not tell this episode
to anyone else,

291
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,060
because they'll take away
your driver's license.

292
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,327
I don't understand.
What? What's to understand?

293
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,200
I thought that... It's
plywood. I built it.

294
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,636
What're you thinking,
there are spirits?

295
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,970
And there's
a world of departed people?

296
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,600
I don't know
what you've been smoking,

297
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,644
but don't try
and bring it through customs.

298
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,372
Darling,
I'm a little late.

299
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,438
Sweetheart, I love you.
You know that.

300
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,947
I say this with all
due respect, but... I...

301
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,006
Sondra? Sondra?

302
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,683
Mr. Strombel.
Listen to me, Sondra.

303
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,421
Carefully. Listen to me, hmm? Write
this down. This is a big story.

304
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,848
You got a pen?

305
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,862
I only have a minute. Would you hurry?

306
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,320
Fine.

307
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,993
There's every reason to believe that
Peter Lyman... You got that name?

308
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,400
Yes. Peter Lyman. Son of Lord Lyman,

309
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,563
a respected businessman, hmm?

310
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,870
Rich, good-looking,
very successful.

311
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,067
That Peter Lyman is
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

312
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,477
Now, just
write this down.

313
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,880
If so, that he's murdered a dozen women.
Short-haired, brunette prostitutes.

314
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,414
And if
it turns out to be Lyman,

315
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,648
this will be the biggest story to
hit London since Jack the Ripper.

316
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,054
"Jack the Ripper. "
Is that capitalized?

317
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,525
There's no knowing
where he'll strike next,

318
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,222
but more women will be
murdered until he is stopped.

319
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,857
That's horrible!
We have to notify the police.

320
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,398
No, no.
What kind of reporter are you?

321
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,436
That would be a disaster!
God, no!

322
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,471
He's a respected millionaire.
You can't accuse anyone,

323
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,939
let alone someone like that
without substantial proof.

324
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:34,240
And once you've alerted him to the
suspicion... That he is under suspicion,

325
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,871
then he'll be
impossible to trap.

326
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,745
Not to mention
doubly dangerous.

327
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,717
There's also a possibility
that he poisoned his secretary

328
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,721
because he suspected that
she was learning the truth.

329
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,189
No, you have to
get the story first,

330
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,692
but first you have to
get the story right!

331
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,657
There's no certainty
in this, or...

332
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,661
I got a feeling
in my gut about this.

333
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,757
The kind
that journalists dream about.

334
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,665
And so far, no one else
has the information.

335
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,704
Oh,
if I was around today,

336
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,865
I'd find a way
to get the facts

337
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,239
and break this case
wide open!

338
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,743
Now, believe me, Sondra.

339
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,378
You can wait your whole life
for a story like this.

340
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,917
Don't blow it.

341
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,081
And be careful.
Lives are in the balance.

342
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,052
Possibly, maybe yours.

343
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,720
Got to go. Got to go.

344
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,172
That's it for me.
You got to help me with this.

345
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,140
Not me, honey.
I'm a prestidigitator.

346
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,801
I do coin tricks
and card tricks.

347
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,469
And I'm a journalist
sitting on top of

348
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,138
one of the biggest
stories of all time!

349
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,875
Yeah. For a college paper!

350
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,177
Kid, you're in
over your head.

351
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,151
You know what you should do? You
should share this story. Share it?

352
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,051
No!
I gotta dig up the facts

353
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,789
and then I gotta shop it
around to every paper in town.

354
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,485
Look at her.

355
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,084
Soon you'll be drinking
the black coffee

356
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,026
and smoking cigarettes with the
hat back. Now, what kind of...

357
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,563
We don't have much time here.

358
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,361
I mean, we got to strike! You
know this guy's a serial killer.

359
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,800
He could just kill
at any moment!

360
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,771
I heard that part. That's when I
knew I was gonna make other plans.

361
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,898
You should go call the police.
That's what I'd do.

362
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,374
Yeah, and
what am I gonna tell them?

363
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,343
Tell them that...
Exactly what he told you.

364
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:17,712
That Lord Lyman's son, Peter, is...
He suspects he's a serial killer.

365
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,784
Uh-huh, and when they ask me
where I got this information from?

366
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,719
Well, tell them! You know,
just say, you know tell them...

367
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,754
Just explain to them that...

368
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,821
You know, say that...
Tell them...

369
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,350
Where did you get
the information?

370
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,329
Was that the question
that you just asked?

371
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,393
I would not say anything if I were
you 'cause they'll put you away.

372
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,436
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

373
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,199
I'm gonna say, "I got this
information from a dead guy"?

374
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,504
Listen, this is not for me,
Sondra. I don't do this.

375
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,568
I do occasional bar mitzvahs
and kids' parties.

376
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,404
You know, you're
barking up the wrong tree.

377
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,814
Peter Lyman.
Who is Peter Lyman, you know?

378
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,045
How can we meet him?

379
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,384
How can we see
what we're dealing with here?

380
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,791
What the hell are we doing here? You
don't even know what the guy looks like.

381
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:09,856
That's why we're here.

382
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,233
I just couldn't get a clear picture
of him on the Internet, so...

383
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:16,206
Jesus. And what are we
going to do if we see him?

384
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,333
I mean, what are you gonna
learn by looking at him?

385
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,743
Unless he
strangles a passerby.

386
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,042
I don't know, Sidney.
I'm improvising.

387
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,776
I should be home,
working on my magic.

388
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,452
Hey, why don't you
think about this

389
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,182
as adding
some excitement to your life?

390
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,982
Hey, sweetheart,
excitement in my life

391
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,584
is dinner
without heartburn after it.

392
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,892
Do you have a family?

393
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,464
I had a wife, but she dumped
me, if you can believe that.

394
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,141
Somehow...

395
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,537
She thought I was immature
and that I never grew up.

396
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,277
Now, I had
a great rebuttal for her.

397
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,508
I could have nailed her,
you know,

398
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:01,746
but I raised my hand
and she would not call on me.

399
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,214
Sidney...
What?

400
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,380
That's him.

401
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,888
Let's follow him.

402
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,687
Follow? What do you
want to follow him for?

403
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,097
I'm telling you. We need clues, we
need a lead. We gotta start someplace.

404
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,568
No, darling, I do not think
this is a good idea.

405
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,899
It's a very good idea.

406
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:23,763
Come on!

407
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,971
Be careful.

408
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,653
Hey, don't touch anything.

409
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,211
You know,
if you break something here,

410
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,814
you're gonna be washing dishes
the rest of your life.

411
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,655
Okay,
now you've seen him. Let's go.

412
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,224
Jerry! It's Jerry Burke,
Louis' chiropractor.

413
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,668
Hi.
Nice to see you.

414
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,738
That's how you follow a guy?
It's not even Peter Lyman!

415
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,934
I told you
the photos weren't clear.

416
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:00,876
Sweetheart, you should
live and be well, prosper.

417
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,608
I hope... I say this
with all due respect.

418
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,979
But without me.

419
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,816
I'm tired, I'm bored, I'm hungry,
I'm going home. God love you.

420
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,014
I'll look for your byline.
Sidney!

421
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,788
I'm about to become your
favorite person. Why?

422
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,852
I ran into someone today
who said that Peter Lyman

423
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,897
swims at the Governor's Club
every day.

424
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,794
Really?
What's the Governor's Club?

425
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,129
It's this posh, private club,

426
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,567
but Daddy's partner's a member and
members are allowed to bring guests.

427
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,730
Wow, do you think
I could bring someone?

428
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,240
I'm sure Daddy can arrange
it. When do you want to go?

429
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,383
How can I help you?

430
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,716
Hi.
We're guests of the Fultons.

431
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,016
We're here to take a dip.

432
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,387
Oh, yes, yes. The lockers
are on the first floor.

433
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,891
The pool's downstairs.
Great.

434
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,162
By the way, is Peter
Lyman here, by any chance?

435
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,355
Mr. Lyman.

436
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,864
Yes, came in
a few minutes ago.

437
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,729
What color bathing suit
does he have on?

438
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,790
Hey.

439
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,359
I... Do you want me
to clash with him?

440
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,362
So silly.

441
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,441
So do you swim? Of course I
don't swim. You have to ask?

442
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,638
What? They say it's the
best form of exercise.

443
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,506
Yes, but when
I go into the water,

444
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:14,279
my glasses, you know, float
off my head into the pool.

445
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,244
Hey, Sidney,
that's got to be him.

446
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,721
Yeah, well,
make sure this time.

447
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,554
'Cause I don't want to swim
around after another chiropractor.

448
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,184
Hmm, he's very handsome.

449
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,765
This guy is a serial killer like
I play for the New York Jets.

450
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,832
How can we meet him?

451
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,197
I don't know.
They have a class system.

452
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,899
He's an aristocrat, and,
you know, we're commoners.

453
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,908
In fact, according to his system, I
think we're probably classified as scum.

454
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,845
This is our only chance.
He's all alone.

455
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,848
Well, you're
a pretty girl.

456
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,408
You know, I think you could probably
get this guy to get interested in you.

457
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,183
Don't be silly. Particularly
if he's got a twisted mind.

458
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,887
Look, I can't just go up to
him and say, "Hi, how are you?"

459
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,987
I mean, what if he gets
suspicious, or, you know,

460
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,464
if he gets put off, or...

461
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,555
Drown.

462
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,895
What? Drown! Drown! I'll
go get... I'll go get...

463
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,268
Listen to me!

464
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,533
I'll go get coffee.

465
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,542
Get a cramp, go in the
water, flounder around,

466
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,804
you know. Yes!

467
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,007
Go ahead, sweetheart.
That's a great idea.

468
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,777
He'll be obliged
to save you that way.

469
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,876
And if he doesn't... If, you know...
Then I'll notify your parents.

470
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,339
Help!

471
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,380
Help!

472
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,262
It's all right. Shh.

473
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,232
It's okay.
There you go.

474
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,200
Are you all right? Okay.

475
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,432
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,546
All right, here.
Here we are.

477
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,580
Here we are. You all right?
Thank you.

478
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,112
You okay?
Yes, thank you very much.

479
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,947
Sorry. It's my pleasure.
Here, let me help you out.

480
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,848
I'm not a very good swimmer.

481
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,588
It's all right.

482
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,954
My leg cramped.

483
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,084
Your leg?
Here, stretch it out.

484
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,219
Oh.
That's it.

485
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,557
Thank you.
No problem.

486
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,231
Listen, you should always do a
little stretching before you go in.

487
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,858
You know, that way you won't
cramp. Oh, thank you very much.

488
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,470
I haven't been swimming
in so long.

489
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,503
You're a new face.

490
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,398
Have you
just become a member?

491
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,875
Oh, no,
I'm a guest of the Fultons.

492
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,206
Oh, right, Jack Fulton.
Yes, lovely chap.

493
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,447
I'm Peter Lyman, by the way.
Hi, Son...

494
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,939
Sond...

495
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,645
Jade.

496
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:04,115
Jade Spence.

497
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,254
Jade Julliard Spence.

498
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,223
That's a very pretty name.
Thank you.

499
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,819
Yes, we're the Spences of...
Of Palm Beach.

500
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,028
Oh, not the same Spences
who own the shipping line?

501
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,632
No, no, no.

502
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,671
My father's into
silver and gold

503
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,674
and drilling.
Ah.

504
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,033
For wells.

505
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,402
What are you doing
in London?

506
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,346
I'm here visiting friends
in Holland Park.

507
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,646
Oh, good.
What do you do, Jade?

508
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,515
Well, I am an actress.

509
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,849
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

510
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,317
Yes, actually
I'm up for the part of Desiree

511
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,416
in the new Mike Tinsley film.

512
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,324
Oh, well, you're certainly
beautiful enough.

513
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,053
Thank you.

514
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,959
Look, Jade,

515
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,423
if you're not busy,

516
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,264
my father's giving a garden
party at the estate on Sunday

517
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,598
and I'd love you to come.

518
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,798
I'd be very happy to be your
date and show you around.

519
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,741
The English countryside is very
lovely this time of the year.

520
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,971
Sounds fantastic.
Good.

521
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,513
Do you mind
if I bring my father?

522
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,079
Your father?

523
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,276
Oh, look!
There he is right now.

524
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:08,741
Ah.

525
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,785
I was in the lounge.
I heard you drowning.

526
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,052
I finished my tea and scones
and came immediately.

527
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,853
Dad,
this is Peter Lyman,

528
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,622
who was nice enough
to rescue me.

529
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,685
Dad?

530
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,563
Yes, of course, child!

531
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,730
She cannot swim.
The girl cannot swim.

532
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,002
Like a lead weight, she sinks
to the bottom all the time.

533
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:35,044
It's a family trait. Lack of buoyancy,
or... Her siblings have it as well.

534
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,980
Yes, well, listen, pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Spence, right?

535
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,073
Yes.

536
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,550
Yes, and I'll see you
on Sunday at the estate.

537
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,814
Oh, great. Sunday? What's
Sunday? Not a fox hunt?

538
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,947
No. No, Dad.
I'll explain it to you later.

539
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,083
Listen, I'll leave all the
information at the desk, all right?

540
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,559
Hey, come, child.

541
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,732
What kind of idiot are you?
Not a fox hunt?

542
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,598
I'd like to talk to these
people in their own terms.

543
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,294
And, oh, thanks for
telling him I'm your father.

544
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:04,203
Oh, incidentally, he thinks
my name is Jade Spence,

545
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,799
so that makes you
Mr. Spence.

546
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:09,040
Wait a minute, I... This is too tricky.
I don't want to go ahead with this.

547
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,274
Why? What's wrong with you? Your whole
life is deception. You're a magician.

548
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:15,375
Yes, I'm a magician and I want to stay
a magician. Can I have a Coke please?

549
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,853
I don't want to get sued
or deported

550
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,254
or arrested
for stalking somebody.

551
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,452
This is a big guy
you're dealing with.

552
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,325
This is a big story, no kidding.
That's what Joe Strombel said.

553
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,160
That's why he returned, you
know. This is his last big scoop.

554
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,461
Hey. What do I care
about Joe Strombel?

555
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,231
Suddenly I'm taking direction
from a hunk of ectoplasm?

556
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,272
This could be
very big for my career.

557
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,338
<i>Your career's fine. You're on the
college Bugle, or whatever it is.</i>

558
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,002
You got years for scoops.

559
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,704
You know what?
Forget you, all right.

560
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,773
I'll do this on my own. I don't need
you. Go back to your card tricks.

561
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,613
I didn't say
I wouldn't help you.

562
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,245
You know, I just...
It has to be done properly.

563
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,647
You know, we gotta
put our heads together.

564
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:55,724
If we put our heads together,
you'll hear a hollow noise.

565
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,677
Look at this place.
All it's missing is a moat.

566
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,348
Ooh! Hey,
I could get used to this.

567
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,251
Look at this.

568
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,161
Oh, there he is.
Remember, Jade Spence.

569
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,693
Jade...
Jade, who?

570
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,066
Ah.
There you are.

571
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,933
Hello. How are you?
Welcome, Mr. Spence and Jade.

572
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,164
Mr. Spence.

573
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,675
You look stunning. Stunning. Oh,
thank you. It's beautiful here.

574
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:45,834
Thank you. Thank you. Yes.

575
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,401
It's been in the family
for years. About 400 years.

576
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,413
It's a little stuffy
for my taste, but... Oh.

577
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,779
She said, "All that's
missing is a moat. "

578
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,886
Right. I love that.
I love the moat line.

579
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,980
"All that's missing is a moat. "
Beautiful. Ah, this is my father.

580
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,521
Father, Stephen Lyman, this is...
These are my friends from America

581
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,924
I was telling you about.
Oh, Lord Lyman.

582
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,016
Jade Spence, Mr. Spence.

583
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,628
How are you?
Hello.

584
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,996
Curtsey, curtsey, curtsey, curtsey, curtsey,
curtsey, I've never met a Lord before.

585
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,159
How exciting!

586
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,068
No, but there was that Earl
that we... There was that Earl.

587
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,865
I do hope
you're enjoying yourself.

588
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,873
Peter, why don't you
show them around?

589
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,475
Absolutely.
Would you like that?

590
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,635
Oh, it...
Charmed, I'm sure.

591
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,008
Should we hit
the buffet table first though?

592
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,446
No, Dad. Because the stuff looks great.

593
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,005
Remember,
we wanted to look around.

594
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,915
Yes, of course, of course,
blessed offspring.

595
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,284
Why don't we get a drink
and then we'll start inside?

596
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,854
Oh, okay.
Come.

597
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,461
Yes, I love this room here. We
often spend evenings in here.

598
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,054
The English countryside!

599
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,395
It's elegant,
yet understated. I like that.

600
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,002
You've done wonders
with the place.

601
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,831
It brings to mind Trollope.

602
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,869
Oh, do you enjoy
reading Trollope, too?

603
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,499
No, no, not the author.
This was a girl I knew.

604
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,742
Well, come. Let's go upstairs
and have a look at the view.

605
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,802
Oh.

606
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,610
Would you quit fooling around!
What's wrong with you?

607
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,810
Try to pick up clues, try to
remember things. I'm charming him.

608
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:04,354
I remember. I got
a mnemonic system that I use.

609
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,446
I use images, it's a trick.
Uh-huh, yeah.

610
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,047
Say I want to remember
this ashtray.

611
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:12,358
I think of, like, 50 ashtrays dancing on
a desert island in hula skirts or something

612
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,724
and then I remember. I can
call it to mind whenever I...

613
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,198
Where are you going?

614
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,535
This is
one of the drawing rooms.

615
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,931
Wow, this is
really beautiful, isn't it?

616
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,303
Oh, here we have...
This is my great-grandfather.

617
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,309
There's grandfather
and his wife, Lady Hayden.

618
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,540
Reminds me of the portrait of
Aunt Hillary in the library, no?

619
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:34,281
Game woman, Hillary. Suffragette, I
believe. Yeah. Diphtheria took her.

620
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,213
Or perhaps it was elm blight.

621
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,049
Come on, Dad.

622
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,755
Oh,
this is just beautiful. Wow.

623
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,351
Yes. I love the lake.
Do either of you fish?

624
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,522
No, no, never have.
Oh, I'll have to teach you.

625
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,029
I've taken some salmon,
you know. Organic.

626
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,793
Yes, me, too.
I fly fish a little. But...

627
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,162
So, Jade, do you
enjoy concerts?

628
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,933
I'm very big
on the Philharmonic.

629
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,406
We sponsor, in fact.

630
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,602
I used to play the violin,
very, very badly.

631
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:04,213
But I have a number of... Well, actually
quite a large musical collection.

632
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,977
Do you play an instrument,
either of you?

633
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,347
Because we have
these lovely music gatherings.

634
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,612
I do. Yes, I play the...

635
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:13,223
Various classics, you know, Noel
Coward and Shakespeare and...

636
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,091
Right. We gave her piano lessons
when she was a little girl,

637
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,959
but her fingers
were just too stubby. So...

638
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:22,294
Yes, what about you,
Mr. Spence?

639
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,292
Well, I play the blues harp.

640
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,732
It's a little metal thing
you put in your mouth

641
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,101
and makes a twanging sound.
Very musical. Yes, yes.

642
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,404
Used to be called the Jew's harp,
but you know how those people are.

643
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,071
The slightest hint of anti-Semitism
and they write letters.

644
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,646
I would love it if you could teach me
how to fly fish. That would be great.

645
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,910
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

646
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,483
Okay, I want you to watch me very
closely. Pay very strict attention here.

647
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,055
Now I want you
to take a card.

648
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,614
Take any card you like.
You got it?

649
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,387
Go ahead, sweetheart. Take
it. You got it? Mmm-hmm.

650
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,087
Now put it in your
pocketbook. Put the card...

651
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,356
She's gonna put the card
in her pocketbook.

652
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,557
You got it? All right, now tell
everybody what the card was.

653
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,489
It was the six of hearts.
Six of hearts.

654
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:57,623
Can I ask you a question?

655
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,727
Was it
this six of hearts?

656
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,265
But I just put that
in my bag.

657
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,569
Well, check your card.
Check your card.

658
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,264
It's amazing!

659
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,771
You're
a wonderful sport, Claire.

660
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,574
I mean that sincerely.
God bless you.

661
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,047
You're a very sweet woman, and
this has been a great group.

662
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,313
From the bottom of my heart, I
say this with all due respect.

663
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,989
You're a wonderful... A credit to your
race and a magnificent group of people.

664
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,821
You know, I must find out
who does the hedges here.

665
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,588
Back home,
my topiary moose

666
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,959
is starting to look a little
shabby around the antlers.

667
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,827
What do you do,
Mr. Spence?

668
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,799
Me?
I'm in real estate.

669
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,567
I'm sorry, I'm in oil!
I'm in oil.

670
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,297
I was in
real estate,

671
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:38,206
but, you know, land is so difficult
to come by now, especially outdoors.

672
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,436
It's become a problem.

673
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,172
Incidentally,
I accept your invitation.

674
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,111
I will play poker
this weekend.

675
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,549
Now that I've seen how good you
are at cards, can we trust you?

676
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,917
Tell me about yourself, Peter.
This is all so new to me.

677
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,515
Well, what would you
like to know?

678
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,093
Well, I don't know.
Anything you'd care to reveal.

679
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,992
You know, your hopes,
your dreams.

680
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,101
Well, I come from a privileged
family, as I'm sure you can tell.

681
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,034
It was always decided one
day I would enter politics.

682
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:14,567
My hobbies are polo and...
Oh, I own some racehorses.

683
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,239
Hmm.
So, how's that for a start?

684
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,678
And what are
your hopes and dreams?

685
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:24,278
I like to dance
and visit museums

686
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,550
and, oh, I can cook Chinese food. Ah.

687
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,019
If you know any good
Chinese restaurants...

688
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:35,127
Oh, I've gotten very interested
in New Age phenomena recently.

689
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,257
Like what?

690
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:41,332
You know,
mystical things like

691
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:46,739
astrology and crystals
and Tarot. Mmm-hmm.

692
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,071
Do you know anything
about Tarot cards?

693
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,474
Not really.
I'm more scientific-minded.

694
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,039
I find that if...

695
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,245
What are you staring at?

696
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,679
Hmm? Oh.

697
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,853
You have wonderful enamel.

698
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,988
Thank you.
Thank you.

699
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,655
You know, I'd love to take you
dancing one night. I'm a good dancer.

700
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,259
Oh, I would love that.
That would be great.

701
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,031
Can I confess something?

702
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,391
Sure.

703
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,799
I just love
an American accent,

704
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,066
and I find much of what
you say very amusing.

705
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,263
Oh.

706
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,204
I'll take that
as a compliment.

707
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,040
And since you like
Chinese food,

708
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,977
I'm gonna have
my new secretary

709
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,174
send you a list
of the great ones in town.

710
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,783
Oh, you have a new secretary?
Oh, yes.

711
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,547
Yes, I'm breaking in
someone new.

712
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:34,148
My previous secretary died, a young
woman, just very suddenly of a blood clot.

713
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,317
It was awful.

714
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,394
Did they do an autopsy?

715
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,397
How did we
get on to this morbid subject?

716
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,365
So, you've never seen
a real English garden before?

717
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,698
Come.
I have a couple of treasures.

718
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:14,123
Would I offend you if I told
you something? Probably not.

719
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,601
You're very... Very different
from the women I usually meet.

720
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,658
Hmm.

721
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,332
That's a good thing.

722
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,568
Well, I just can't seem to get the vision
of you in your swimsuit out of my mind.

723
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,973
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

724
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,201
It was marked down.

725
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,007
See, that... Now that's
exactly what I mean.

726
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,380
You just have this very direct
and informal way about you.

727
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,147
It's... You take after
your father. Mmm-hmm. Great.

728
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:39,914
And you have
a very sensual quality.

729
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,115
It's... But I'm sure
you've been told that.

730
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,553
Wow. You work really fast.

731
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,090
Oh, God. Am I overbearingly
aggressive? I'll stop.

732
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,562
Oh, no, don't!

733
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,464
You just
were getting warmed up.

734
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,264
Are you romantic by nature?

735
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,530
I mean, I won't say, "Do you
believe in love at first sight?"

736
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,197
because that's
a clich but...

737
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,967
Have you ever had
an experience

738
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,235
where a bell goes off
just right away?

739
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,778
Sorry.
I need those.

740
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,410
You see,
I can't wear contacts.

741
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,679
I don't like to put my
finger on my eyeball.

742
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:21,089
Well, goodbye. We must meet
for tea and crumpets again.

743
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,154
We really must.

744
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,461
Ta-ta!

745
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,566
I could have strangled you
if you didn't shut up!

746
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,066
And stop telling people
I sprang from your loins.

747
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:32,006
I'm trying to cement the fact
that I'm your father!

748
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,943
That guy was so fantastic. I
can't imagine he'd do anything bad.

749
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,980
This guy is not a serial
killer, believe me.

750
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:41,073
I'd be very surprised
if he even killed one person.

751
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,079
He asked me to go dancing
next week.

752
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:47,247
That's a perfect strategy! You worm
your way in like a rodent or a roach

753
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,416
and as the crumbs
fall off the table,

754
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,587
<i>you collect them and we analyze them.
Aha! VoiI! Thanks. Thanks a lot.</i>

755
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,530
Look at this. Look at this.
Look what I got. "Betty G."

756
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,089
Yeah.
What is this?

757
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,726
It's a doodle.
He doodled it!

758
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,331
How do you know he doodled it?
How do you know this is his?

759
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,633
What do you mean,
how do I know it's his?

760
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,231
I stole it out of
his overnight bag.

761
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,071
What the hell
is wrong with you, Sidney?

762
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,371
It's a clue!
It's not a clue.

763
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,912
We're hard up for clues.
It's not a clue.

764
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,777
What does it mean? It could be his
aunt, it could be his travel agent.

765
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,283
I'm late for dinner. You want
to come in and eat something? No.

766
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,975
No, thank you.

767
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,622
Take a seat right over there.

768
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,088
Okay.

769
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,297
Peter called. He's going to be
late. He said to start without him.

770
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,336
Oh, well, come on then, let's
play. That's what we're here for.

771
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,032
Okay.

772
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,608
Come on,
short, little guy.

773
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,741
You're out?
This is it?

774
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,511
Anybody else?

775
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,050
You're still in?

776
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,349
So sorry, old chaps. I was
completely bogged down at the office.

777
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,582
Okay.

778
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,884
All right, who's winning?

779
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,858
Mr. Spence
is a good poker player, Peter.

780
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,484
Yes, I might have known.

781
00:39:57,628 --> 00:40:01,689
Actually, I bought my first
Reuben's with poker winnings.

782
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,829
You bought a Rubens painting?

783
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,461
Not a painting.
A sandwich.

784
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,702
I could use a drink.

785
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,768
He asked me if I believed
in love at first sight.

786
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,776
How sweet is that?
So naive.

787
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,209
Well, I hope
you told him yes.

788
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,769
I told him
we had nothing in common.

789
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,008
We come from completely
different backgrounds.

790
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,607
I think
he likes that or something.

791
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:24,484
But what about the story you're
writing on him? What is that all about?

792
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:28,984
Sondra?

793
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,700
"Mary Thompson,
a short-haired brunette,

794
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,534
"was strangled at Falconberg
Place last night at 9:30."

795
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,665
"Next to the body of the
short-haired brunette prostitute,

796
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:47,233
"was the hangman card
from the Tarot deck. "

797
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,570
Hey, what time did you say Peter
arrived at the poker game last night?

798
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,077
If you're asking me, did he
have time to strangle somebody

799
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,746
and make the card game,
yes, he had plenty of time.

800
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,287
I got to let
my feelings subside

801
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,326
and probe deeper
into this case.

802
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:04,791
What does that mean?

803
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:08,256
Well, it means that we know where his
family lives, we know his social circle,

804
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:11,824
but we don't know what his house looks
like. I want to get a look at that.

805
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,803
Here we are.

806
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,641
Wow. This is really
nice. Thank you. Yes.

807
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,418
Do you do
a lot of entertaining?

808
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,453
I'm embarrassed
to say that I do.

809
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,217
You must think I'm an empty
socialite. Much of it's political.

810
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,485
Oh, no.
I think you're swell.

811
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,654
That's a lovely painting.

812
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,396
Oh, I recognize that
from my art history books.

813
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,936
Oh, really?
Yes. Henry Moore.

814
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,734
In fact, it was a present
from Henry Moore to my father.

815
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,274
Oh, it's very beautiful. Is it Roman,
or Greek, or something like that?

816
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:58,405
It's Roman, in fact.
Second century A.D.

817
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,813
You have good taste.

818
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,809
I think you'll like
what's downstairs.

819
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,013
The real treasures. Come. Oh.

820
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,369
Here we are.

821
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,432
Oh.

822
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:31,877
These are all of my instruments.
The room is climate controlled, it's

823
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,611
to protect
all these beautiful pieces.

824
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,686
It's fantastic.
Thank you. Thank you.

825
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,416
Yes, my family's been
collecting it for years.

826
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:43,050
This is a Guarneri. And a Stradivarius.
You may have heard of them.

827
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:45,561
Oh, you play these violins?
Oh, me? God, no. No, no.

828
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:49,060
But we lend them out.
They need to be played.

829
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,194
All these old instruments,
it's very romantic.

830
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,303
Shall I show you upstairs?
Okay.

831
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,746
What's your name,
sweetheart? Tell me your name.

832
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,187
I'm Wendy Beamish.

833
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,623
Wendy... Let's hear it
for Wendy Beamish.

834
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:19,521
Fantastic. I love you, Wendy.
I really do.

835
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,221
Is it your first time
on stage? Yes. Yes.

836
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:24,563
I love this woman from the bottom
of my heart. I mean that sincerely.

837
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:28,934
You're an incredible woman and I
say that with all due respect, Wendy.

838
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,903
Wendy, have you ever been
dematerialized before? No, I haven't.

839
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,467
Ever had your molecules broken
up? No, no, I've haven't.

840
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,244
She's nervous.
Don't be nervous, sweetheart.

841
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,872
This is not gonna hurt much.

842
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,509
Get into the box.
Get into the dematerializer.

843
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,815
Are you in there? You
comfortable? I'm fine.

844
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,219
Okay, okay, stay calm.
Stay calm.

845
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,623
Can you hear me, Wendy? You
feel the molecules evaporating?

846
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,651
Let me hear from you, honey!

847
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,897
Remember these numbers.
16, 21, 12. What?

848
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,599
16, 21, 12.

849
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,306
16, 21, 12.

850
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,878
Sixteen,
16 blue horses.

851
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,383
Twenty-one jet planes.

852
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,979
And 12 midgets.
12 spinning midgets.

853
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,560
That was as great
as I imagined it would be.

854
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,556
You look beautiful.

855
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,423
And pensive.

856
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,689
No, not pensive.

857
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:32,457
Just confused.

858
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,695
Women after lovemaking,
it's always so complicated.

859
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,641
Hey, I love your aftershave.
What is it? It's Yardley.

860
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,169
I first used it when I was 16 and
never changed. I'm a very loyal soul.

861
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,216
Come here.
Do you have to put them on?

862
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,442
Well, they're quite sexy. God,
what makes you smell so sweet?

863
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:50,747
Oh, you like it?

864
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,485
Just some fragrance.

865
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,013
Right.

866
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,153
Where are you going?
I have an idea.

867
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,959
I think it's time to celebrate
with some champagne.

868
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:08,133
I want you to stay.
I make a mean scrambled egg.

869
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,829
Stay.

870
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,889
That's my mother.

871
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,958
Oh, she's very attractive.

872
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,666
Yes, she was very beautiful,
but quite difficult.

873
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,033
Difficult?
How?

874
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,231
Unfaithful.

875
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,811
Say, can you please stay? Nothing
would please me more. Come on.

876
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,515
I really can't.
Oh, why not?

877
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,550
My father.
He's feeling not that great.

878
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,816
Nothing serious?
No, no, nothing.

879
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,057
Just a tooth problem.

880
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,616
You know, a little
sensitivity in lower seven.

881
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,193
I really should go.

882
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,529
Oh. So, let me
get back to the story.

883
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,907
I'm on stage. I'm doing
the dematerializer trick

884
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,967
with this chick
from Manchester.

885
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,511
I don't know
where they get these people,

886
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:59,845
but she looked like
Sitting Bull.

887
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,508
And I got her in the thing,
and I vanish her

888
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:06,044
and everything goes according
to plan exactly and she's gone.

889
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:09,290
And suddenly, Strombel appears. What?

890
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,860
Yes, Strombel's in there! I got a
tremendous hand from the audience.

891
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,658
I wish
I could do it every night!

892
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:15,823
What did he say?

893
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:19,093
He gave me
the combination to a safe.

894
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,194
What safe, I have no idea.

895
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,272
I didn't see any safe.

896
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:29,067
Well, did you accomplish anything
besides maybe a possible pregnancy?

897
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,511
I'll tell you what I did see.

898
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:34,073
His mother, Lady Eleanor,
has short-cut, brunette hair.

899
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,609
Yeah,
but not a hooker?

900
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,652
No, Sidney,
she's not a hooker!

901
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,282
I hardly think so.
She's practically royalty.

902
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,654
Christ, you amaze me
sometimes. Your brain!

903
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,028
Back off. You know,
you're getting so upset.

904
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:53,035
I'm just trying to figure
out the various ramifications.

905
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,297
I just don't like
this whole thing!

906
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,566
I feel disgusting,
all right, it's awful.

907
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,173
I don't like
the whole process.

908
00:47:58,242 --> 00:47:59,641
Yeah, you want to think
he's innocent.

909
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,177
What's so bad about that, huh?

910
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,542
Jesus, this guy
must be some lover, you know.

911
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,412
I mean, all of a sudden you're
ready to dump the whole story.

912
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,213
I must find out
what breakfast cereal he eats.

913
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,689
What am I talking about?
There's a combination on the door

914
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:15,554
where he keeps his precious
musical instruments.

915
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,021
Okay,
so there is a combination!

916
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,119
I just got
to get in that room.

917
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,493
Do you have the combination?

918
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,794
We're not gonna break into his
room if that's what you're thinking.

919
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,959
You gotta have the com... I
got to get in there. No, no.

920
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,729
No, no, we're not going to do this
because it's not legal... You...

921
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,671
Sondra, what's wrong with you?

922
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,799
This guy is
the son of a Lord!

923
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:36,175
They'll take us to the Tower
of London and behead us!

924
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,847
Hi.
Guess what?

925
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,545
What?
Peter Lyman sent you flowers.

926
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,879
I assume your name
is Jade Spence?

927
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,250
Naturally I accepted for you.

928
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:48,484
Yeah, I'm Jade Spence.

929
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,719
What is going on?
Oh, Vivian...

930
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:53,818
Oh,

931
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,199
Peter's giving a party on
Saturday and he wants me to come.

932
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,065
I... Oh, I guess
I'll have to buy a dress.

933
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,866
Well, he certainly
seems smitten with you.

934
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,963
If he's smitten with anyone,
it's Jade Spence.

935
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,574
Who is Jade Spence?

936
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,573
A would-be
investigative reporter

937
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,477
who's falling in love with the
object of her investigation.

938
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,614
Of course we did.
Absolutely.

939
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,421
God bless you, sir. I'm going
to show you a little thing.

940
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,018
I want you to think of a card.
Just think of one of those cards.

941
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,391
Any one you want.
You got it?

942
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,433
All right, now, are you happening to
be thinking of the seven of spades?

943
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:35,604
That's amazing! How do you do
that? Just a little hobby of mine.

944
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,606
You know, I wish
I had more time to practice,

945
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,103
but, what with my oil wells, you
know, I never get around to it.

946
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,735
Your daughter's
very beautiful.

947
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,211
You met my daughter?
Yes.

948
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,545
Yes, we're very proud of her. She's a
lovely girl. Overcame a great handicap.

949
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,811
Yeah. You know, she was
learning disabled.

950
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,586
Her mother and I took her to
many specialists, you know.

951
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,282
Now she's practically normal,
you know.

952
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,688
She's a charmer.

953
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,917
God bless you, sweetheart. What
is your sign? I'm an Aquarian.

954
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:00,019
You're Aquarian?
And what is your persuasion?

955
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,830
Do you mean my religion?
Yeah, your persuasion.

956
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,730
I'm a Christian. What are you?
Yes, are you?

957
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,929
Me, I was born into
the Hebrew persuasion,

958
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,735
but, when I got older,
I converted to narcissism.

959
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:11,899
Dad?
Hmm?

960
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,067
Dad, I need
to talk to you right now.

961
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,478
Oh, I was just about to pull some
quarters out of Mrs. Quincy's nose.

962
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,310
Right now.
I need to talk to you.

963
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,406
Really?
Yep.

964
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,146
Excuse me. I'll...

965
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,380
Where?

966
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,320
Would you stop doing
those nitwit tricks?

967
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,690
What is wrong with you? You're
supposed to be a dignified businessman.

968
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,696
I told them it was a hobby.
The hobby of a rich merchant.

969
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:34,788
You know, so...

970
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,129
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.

971
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,994
Go down the stairs, open the music
room door. I'll keep Peter busy.

972
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:43,505
I'll meet you down there in a minute.
You brought the combination, right?

973
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,165
No, I left it
in my other jacket.

974
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,402
What?
Yes. And...

975
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,501
So, what are we gonna do? You
gotta go home and get it then.

976
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,570
I can't get it because the
other jacket's in the cleaners.

977
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:53,980
Sidney. This is the problem
having a limited wardrobe.

978
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,313
But not to worry.

979
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,286
I have a mnemonic system.
I remember everything.

980
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,483
There you are. Mr. Spence,
trust you're having a good time?

981
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,391
Yes, a great time! This
reminds me of our party.

982
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,862
We threw a masked ball in Palm
Beach this year, it was wonderful.

983
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:11,389
I came as a harlequin.
She dressed as Petunia Pig.

984
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:13,436
Honey, there's something I wanted
to ask you about. Absolutely.

985
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:17,496
That was a mask, wasn't it? Just...
I love her. Just a minute, okay?

986
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,743
Do you need a drink, Mr.
Spence? No, I'm fine, thank you.

987
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,266
It's eight

988
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,595
blue horses.
No, no, no.

989
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,137
It's 10.
Ten spinning midgets.

990
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,203
No, it's 12. Twelve jet
planes and eight... No.

991
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,851
Good to see you. Have a
nice time. Nice to meet you.

992
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,722
Calm down, calm down.
It was... It was...

993
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,850
It was...

994
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:14,293
Eight maids a-milking

995
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,399
and three French hens.

996
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:18,756
No, no.

997
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:30,907
Sixteen, wait, 20 jet planes,

998
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,248
12 spinning midgets.

999
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,017
Eureka!

1000
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,494
I'll be right back. I'm
just gonna use the bathroom.

1001
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,143
Sidney?

1002
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,156
Sidney, is that you?

1003
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,622
I'm locked in! Oh,
Christ... What's the combination?

1004
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,730
For some reason,
it's gone out of my mind.

1005
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,691
Did you see Miss Spence?

1006
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,760
I thought I saw her going
downstairs. Downstairs, right.

1007
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:04,469
It's
16 blue horses.

1008
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:08,472
It's 21 jet planes.

1009
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:12,070
And 12 midgets.

1010
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,614
Twelve spinning midgets.

1011
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,279
Oh, thank God!

1012
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,517
I thought I was gonna turn out
to be one of those skeletons

1013
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,923
people find when they sell
the house. Check the door.

1014
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:27,191
Sixteen, 21, 12. You
couldn't remember that number?

1015
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,825
My mnemonic system failed me.
What do you want me to say?

1016
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:35,093
Now exactly what are we looking
for in here? This is all...

1017
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:36,729
I'm not really sure.

1018
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,732
You're not sure?

1019
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,466
Well, you know,
don't break anything.

1020
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,569
By God, we'll get caught
and God knows.

1021
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:45,403
Hey, you know
the old dirty joke

1022
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,110
about how the French horn player
sleeps with his wife at night?

1023
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,116
Sidney,
put that thing down!

1024
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:52,449
Will you excuse me?

1025
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,657
There's nothing but
musical instruments in here.

1026
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,923
I'm telling you, we're on a
wild goose chase. Believe me.

1027
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,988
Jade?
What's the matter?

1028
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,828
Did you hear that?

1029
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,195
I thought I heard something. Oh, come
on, come on. Let's get out of here.

1030
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,272
All we need
is to get caught in here.

1031
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,197
Jade?

1032
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,407
Ah, there you are.
I was searching for you.

1033
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,071
The guests
will be leaving soon.

1034
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,615
Yes, well, I was just showing Father
around. He loves English homes.

1035
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,412
Yes, I was very impressed
with your cellar.

1036
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,716
I have
a wonderful cellar myself.

1037
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,849
No wine,
but it's rodent free.

1038
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,826
Well,
let's get a drink.

1039
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,260
Please, Mr. Spence, I haven't
seen you with a drink all night.

1040
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,288
Can you stay the night, please? What?

1041
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:36,826
Come on.
No, I can't.

1042
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,595
Why not?
My father.

1043
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,693
Oh, come on, I'll have
my driver take him home.

1044
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,601
No. I can't let you go.
You're too beautiful.

1045
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,764
Look at you. I can't.

1046
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,548
Jade?

1047
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,259
Oh.
Jade.

1048
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:53,326
Jade, it's 4:00 a. m.

1049
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:54,903
What are you doing?

1050
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,430
I couldn't sleep,

1051
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,442
so I thought
maybe some milk.

1052
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:01,933
Hmm.

1053
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,540
Jade, can I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.

1054
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,686
Would you consider not going
home at the end of the summer?

1055
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,523
I don't understand,
what more proof do you need?

1056
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:17,992
What are you gonna tell
the police?

1057
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,857
The guy owns a deck of Tarot
cards. That's not a crime.

1058
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:22,994
I mean, what, he was late
for a poker game?

1059
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,296
I'm sure he's smart enough
to have an alibi.

1060
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,131
What are we left with? His mother
has short-cut, brunette hair.

1061
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,104
I mean, look, if we blow
the whistle on this guy...

1062
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,641
I know. I understand... and he's
innocent and we can't make the story...

1063
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,438
Then he realizes
that you're, you know,

1064
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,537
you're a pushy little phony who's
been playing him for a sucker

1065
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,980
and he dumps you,
you know. I get it.

1066
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:42,313
All right. All I'm saying, is that
in order to make an accusation,

1067
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,409
we gotta have proof.

1068
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,920
Especially
about Lord Lyman's son.

1069
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,148
You don't make an accusation.

1070
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,556
We can phone in
an anonymous tip.

1071
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,252
You know how many crank tips
the papers say the police get?

1072
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,297
You're gonna phone one in
on Peter Lyman!

1073
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,390
They'll hang up on you
mid-sentence.

1074
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,162
Besides,
if the story's true,

1075
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,668
I want to be the one
to break it.

1076
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,170
You know
what Joe Strombel said?

1077
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,672
He said, "Get it first,
but first get it right. "

1078
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,368
Happy birthday.

1079
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,402
Wow, thank you.

1080
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,908
What's up?
You look so sullen.

1081
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:15,978
No, I'm not. I just...

1082
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,682
I get sad around birthdays.

1083
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,690
Oh, yes, well,
I can understand that,

1084
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:24,192
but I think we're both still
young enough to enjoy the gifts.

1085
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,352
Come on, open it.

1086
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:26,984
Okay.

1087
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:31,667
Oh, wow, it's beautiful.

1088
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,201
You like it?
I love it.

1089
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,702
Good. Here, allow me.

1090
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:36,694
Gosh.

1091
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,607
You shouldn't have.

1092
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:40,802
I wanted to.

1093
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,643
Hey, hey, are you crying?
No, I'm too tough to cry.

1094
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,737
Oh.

1095
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:50,217
Though my nasal passages do
become congested when I'm sad.

1096
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,116
Oh, don't be sad.
It's your birthday. Hmm?

1097
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,849
Oh, I wish I could
celebrate with you tonight.

1098
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,916
I just have to go out of town
for a few days.

1099
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,116
Really?

1100
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,130
Yes, I just have
some business to take care of.

1101
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,824
But we'll celebrate when I
get back, all right? Okay.

1102
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,928
Thank you so much for the
present. It's beautiful.

1103
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:10,529
I'll think about you
whenever I wear it.

1104
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,234
You didn't tell me
it was your birthday!

1105
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,074
I'll take you
for a magnificent dinner.

1106
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,943
We'll go to a great restaurant. Really?

1107
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:23,007
Do you enjoy
the McNuggets thing?

1108
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:27,318
What about Indian food?
Do you like spicy food?

1109
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,320
No, no, it's okay.

1110
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,326
I don't really have
much of an appetite.

1111
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:34,258
But you will when they bring out
the prawns in hydrochloric acid.

1112
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,025
It's fantastic, Sondra.

1113
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,233
What's the matter?

1114
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,236
What, are you thinking of Peter? No.

1115
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:43,168
I don't know, it's just...

1116
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,707
I wouldn't be surprised if he asked
me to marry him one day, you know?

1117
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:48,403
You come
from an Orthodox family.

1118
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,878
Would they accept
a serial killer?

1119
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,342
That's an expensive present.

1120
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,851
The Lymans are so wealthy.
Yes.

1121
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,683
It was almost
too extravagant.

1122
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,252
I'd better get ready. I still
haven't found my millionaire yet.

1123
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:09,097
Oh, God, Sondra, what a mess!

1124
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,631
It's starting to add up
against him.

1125
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,465
Bits and scraps
are coming together.

1126
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:15,936
God, it's you!

1127
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,733
I sensed you were falling
in love. I escaped again.

1128
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,470
It's just circumstantial junk, you
know. A coincidence here and there.

1129
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,570
Too much smoke
not to be fire.

1130
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,013
Look, I'm sure you've
been wrong plenty of times.

1131
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,243
Not wrong here.

1132
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:31,775
Though I agree you haven't got
enough to pull the trigger yet.

1133
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,184
If you act prematurely,
not only does he walk,

1134
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,351
your professional credibility
is wrecked, sometimes for good.

1135
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,361
Oh, I'm sure you want him
to be guilty.

1136
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,487
You know, that way you get
your last big scoop.

1137
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:42,996
I'm beginning to fade.

1138
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:44,897
Sondra, don't let me down!

1139
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,060
I wish you'd fade for good!

1140
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:48,396
Get out of my life!

1141
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:49,904
I'm not
cut out for this.

1142
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,497
I should be
flossing molars for a living.

1143
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,239
The bread is... You know, I can
make a meal just with the bread.

1144
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,212
I can do a whole meal,
just nothing but bread.

1145
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,247
If I ate that much bread,
I'd be 20 pounds heavier.

1146
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,182
See,
I never gain an ounce,

1147
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:07,382
because, you know,
my anxiety acts like aerobics.

1148
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,056
So I get the exercise.

1149
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,588
Thanks for taking me out
for my birthday, Sidney.

1150
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,186
Well, you know, you're the
daughter that I never had.

1151
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:17,255
Oh, that's so... No, no,
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1152
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,732
'Cause I never wanted
to have kids.

1153
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,433
I didn't. Because you
have kids, what is it?

1154
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,536
You know, you're nice to them,
you bring them up, you suffer,

1155
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:26,097
you take care of them

1156
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:30,612
and then they grow up and they
accuse you of having Alzheimer's.

1157
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:32,739
Could you
ever live in London?

1158
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:35,784
Could I live
in London? No.

1159
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,047
And I love London. Don't
get me wrong, I love London,

1160
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,316
but, you know,

1161
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:44,354
apart from the language problem,
I can't take the driving.

1162
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,487
Because it, you know, it's
on the wrong side, and I...

1163
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,727
Every time
I drive a car here,

1164
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:52,063
I'm convinced
I'm going to die in a crash.

1165
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,391
Sidney!

1166
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,559
What's the matter?

1167
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:57,502
It's Peter.

1168
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:58,631
You said
Peter was out of town.

1169
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,539
Well, that's
what he told me.

1170
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,099
Come on.

1171
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,540
What do you mean, come on?

1172
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,774
I ordered prawns.

1173
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,075
Just pay, all right?
Just pay.

1174
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,444
What do you mean, pay?
All I do is...

1175
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,613
Fine, it's her birthday.

1176
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:16,950
Come on.

1177
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,487
Maybe he's got
another woman on the side,

1178
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:22,564
and he likes you, but he's
sexually attracted to her.

1179
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,025
Thanks, Sidney.

1180
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,727
Well, why doesn't he have
his chauffeur?

1181
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,770
I don't know, whatever he's doing,
he must want it to be secret.

1182
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,072
Oh, I told you
he went the other way!

1183
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,135
Can we go home, please?

1184
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,975
It's starting to rain.

1185
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:13,447
I can't believe
he lied to me.

1186
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:17,346
Maybe he's doing something that
he's ashamed to tell you about.

1187
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:21,288
Maybe he belongs to one of those clubs,
or he's a cross-dresser or something.

1188
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,518
Or maybe
he does folk dancing.

1189
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,060
Oh, I'm sure it's probably
something that when he tells me,

1190
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,153
I'll just feel foolish
for thinking he lied.

1191
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,462
I'm sure. You know, not everything
in this world is sinister.

1192
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,297
You know,
just practically everything.

1193
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,202
That Indian food
made me sick.

1194
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,764
You hardly touched your cobra
salad. How can you be sick?

1195
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,805
Help!

1196
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,540
A woman's been strangled!

1197
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:49,450
Help! A woman's been strangled!
Help, call the police!

1198
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,509
Somebody call the police!
There's been a murder!

1199
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:52,884
There's been
a murder upstairs.

1200
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:53,944
Help!

1201
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,047
Have you got a phone? Have you
got a phone? Call the police.

1202
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,923
Could it be the Tarot Killer?
They found a Tarot card. It's him.

1203
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,394
I can't believe it!
She lives in this building.

1204
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,624
It's him again.
They found the Tarot card.

1205
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:07,100
Elizabeth Gibson,
another short-haired brunette.

1206
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,896
We should have
gone to the police earlier.

1207
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:13,032
Well, you know... You said
that they wouldn't believe us

1208
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,304
and they may not.

1209
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:19,136
Sidney, it's about time we show
my story to a real newspaperman.

1210
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,614
By real, you mean what?

1211
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:22,876
One that's living.

1212
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:26,083
<i>Vivian's father has a friend
that works at The Observer.</i>

1213
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,055
Well, it's very vivid
and rather shocking,

1214
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:32,959
and there are some genuine
circumstantial bits of evidence.

1215
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:36,760
But let me give you a lesson
in professional journalism.

1216
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:41,562
No newspaper should
or would ever run this story.

1217
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:43,795
What? Why?

1218
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,568
It would be fatally
irresponsible and libelous.

1219
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:51,179
All you have here are a number
of titillating speculations.

1220
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:55,745
Flamboyant theories that tarnish a
man, and a well-known figure at that,

1221
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:58,378
without a single shred
of substantial proof.

1222
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,683
So his mother
was a short-haired brunette.

1223
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,655
So he came late
for a poker game

1224
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:07,287
and said he was going away on a
business trip and he got caught lying.

1225
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:12,363
Yes, but who keeps a Tarot
deck under a French horn?

1226
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:17,196
It's not against the law to own a Tarot
deck, or keep it wherever you like.

1227
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,939
You'd look pretty foolish in
court with your accusations,

1228
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,637
and that's
where you'll wind up.

1229
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:26,004
Because he'd have no choice but
to sue you and the newspaper,

1230
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,208
and he'd win.

1231
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,015
And to go to the police?

1232
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,046
I'll come to that.

1233
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,283
But first let me continue my
tedious professorial lecture.

1234
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:38,185
Vivian's dad and I
go way back.

1235
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,687
He said you were
a journalism student.

1236
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,453
Hmm.

1237
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,091
You talk about getting a tip.

1238
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,132
Okay, you won't
disclose your source,

1239
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:50,331
but what you have done is
let your imagination run wild.

1240
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:51,531
No, no.

1241
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:55,168
What if I told you that my source
happened to be a certain Joe Strombel?

1242
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,711
The late Joe Strombel?
Yep.

1243
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,214
You mean, before he died
he gave a student reporter

1244
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,614
a major story and didn't
follow it up himself?

1245
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,381
We didn't say
it was before he died.

1246
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,887
What?
No, it...

1247
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,515
He got the story
before he died,

1248
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,026
and then he died
before he could follow it up.

1249
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:17,028
Well, why did he give it to
you? He didn't know he was dying.

1250
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,493
I don't buy it.

1251
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,125
I knew Joe Strombel well.

1252
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,801
If he'd had a tip
that he considered reliable,

1253
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,464
he would certainly
have pursued it himself,

1254
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,441
from the grave,
if necessary.

1255
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:31,442
What about how Peter
was in the neighborhood

1256
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:33,539
the night
the murder was committed?

1257
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,116
I realize as a student
how exciting it must have been

1258
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,814
to think that you were onto
something so spectacular.

1259
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:41,422
Hey, she is onto something!

1260
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,549
This kid is a bloodhound.
Look at her!

1261
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:47,153
She could sell the story
to any tabloid in town.

1262
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:48,786
Hmm.

1263
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,860
Now that I've preached on the
realities of accurate reporting,

1264
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:56,962
I want to tell you how
catastrophic for everybody involved

1265
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,166
it would have been
if you had, say, taken

1266
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,369
the results of your
investigation to a tabloid.

1267
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:07,273
Today, the police have apprehended
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

1268
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,647
And it most assuredly
is not Peter Lyman.

1269
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,381
What?

1270
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:15,549
Every paper in town is going
to press with it as we speak.

1271
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:20,156
It was a handyman named
Henry Banks who has confessed.

1272
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,026
Banks is a delusional paranoid
who's given Scotland Yard

1273
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,762
information that only the
killer could possibly know.

1274
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,400
He's led the police
to two additional bodies

1275
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:33,306
and his DNA and a fingerprint
they found check out.

1276
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,640
I know this puts a crimp in your scoop,

1277
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,244
but Henry Banks is
the Tarot Card Serial Killer.

1278
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,640
Not Lord Lyman's son.

1279
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,151
Well, I can't say
I'm not walking on air.

1280
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:51,254
Oh, Jesus, If I ever catch that
Joe Strombel, I'll kill him.

1281
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,318
I only hope Peter forgives
me for what I've done.

1282
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:54,487
For what?

1283
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,497
I lied to him.
I'm not Jade Spence.

1284
01:08:56,565 --> 01:09:00,001
I'm a pushy, duplicitous,
ambitious college student.

1285
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,058
I lied to him,
over and over.

1286
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,502
Darling, he lied to you, too,
so it's even.

1287
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:06,973
His lies pale in comparison to
the enormity of what I've done.

1288
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,536
So marry him as Jade
Spence. Don't tell him.

1289
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,946
You know, you don't have to
be Sondra Pransky ever again.

1290
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,449
Marry him as Jade Spence.

1291
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:18,544
Yeah, but I don't want to have to get
you a Father's Day gift every year.

1292
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:23,518
You know, I don't know how to break this
to you, honey, but you were adopted. Okay?

1293
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,526
Your mother and I,
we were at the orphanage,

1294
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,892
we wanted
a handicapped child, and...

1295
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,293
Ah, finally.
Just you and I all weekend.

1296
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:32,422
Yeah.

1297
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,894
I thought you'd like it here.

1298
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,436
It's lovely.
Mmm-hmm.

1299
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,703
Peter?
Yes.

1300
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,302
I have a confession to
make. Oh, God, so do I.

1301
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:46,804
Oh, well, let me go first.

1302
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,782
Actually, no,
let me, please,

1303
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,148
because mine's
been bothering me all day.

1304
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,583
I just want
to get it off my chest.

1305
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:55,420
When I told you I was going
away for a few days on business,

1306
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,890
I was lying.

1307
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,718
I know.
You know? How?

1308
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:03,456
Oh, I saw you.
You saw me? No.

1309
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:06,199
I was at dinner, and...
With your father?

1310
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:09,832
Actually... Well, anyway,
it doesn't matter. Really.

1311
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:14,108
The truth is,
that a company my father owns

1312
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:15,837
is about to merge with a
company in the Middle East.

1313
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:17,879
It's a very
sensitive situation,

1314
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:19,642
and the less anyone knows
about it, the better.

1315
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,307
And we just didn't want
the press to sniff it out.

1316
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,577
I mean,
that's no excuse, really.

1317
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:24,983
I'm just very sorry
for the extreme secrecy.

1318
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:28,114
No, no, no, it's fine.
I'm glad.

1319
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:31,921
It's your own secret
information. That's fine.

1320
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,258
So your father took you out
for a birthday dinner

1321
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,025
and you saw me.
I mean, how unnerving.

1322
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,931
God, I mean, the thing I hate
most in the world is lying.

1323
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,195
Uh-huh.

1324
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:42,895
What?

1325
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:45,972
Peter...
Yes, Jade?

1326
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:48,532
Peter...

1327
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,704
Oh, yes.
What did you want to tell me?

1328
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:51,870
Uh...

1329
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,710
Jade, there's nothing
you can tell me that...

1330
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:56,080
My name is not Jade Spence.

1331
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:58,450
It's not?

1332
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:01,481
No. It's Sondra Pransky.

1333
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,720
And my father is not my father.
His name is Sidney Waterman.

1334
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:07,694
He's a magician
called Splendini.

1335
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,287
I'm a journalism student.

1336
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:14,063
Don't ask me what kind of
crazy misinformation we received

1337
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:16,070
to believe you might be
the Tarot Card Killer.

1338
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:20,302
I mean, I didn't know you
at this time. Remember?

1339
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,609
And, of course,
as soon as I got to know you,

1340
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,011
I knew that
it couldn't possibly be true.

1341
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:28,208
And the police have him now,
so everything's fine.

1342
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:31,117
Of course, along the
route I fell for you,

1343
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,814
and now
I totally blew it, and...

1344
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,288
Who told you this?

1345
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,952
Oh, a newspaperman.
He's now deceased.

1346
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,758
Very foolish. He was
eager for his last scoop.

1347
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,489
Oh, I'm so sorry. I just

1348
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,192
totally understand if you
never want to speak to me again

1349
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,135
or if you don't want to
see me... Miss Pransky.

1350
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,298
Not only am I
not angry with you, but you...

1351
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:57,607
You've absolutely made my day! What?

1352
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,046
Just suspecting that I
could be such an imaginative,

1353
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,742
dramatic fiend.
I love it.

1354
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:02,841
You do?
Yes.

1355
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,580
I think it's one of the funniest,
craziest things I've ever heard in my life.

1356
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,087
I can't wait to tell
the chaps at the club.

1357
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,983
Peter?

1358
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:10,150
Yes, darling.

1359
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,859
I have to ask you something.
Yes, anything. Absolutely.

1360
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,759
Why did you hide that Tarot
deck in your music room?

1361
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,302
How do you
know about that?

1362
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,907
I was so paranoid. I...
It's crazy.

1363
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:31,070
But I snuck in. Oh, dear, it
was going to be a surprise.

1364
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,614
I bought them for you.
They're Victorian Tarot cards.

1365
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,650
You told me you were
into that kind of thing.

1366
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:36,776
What? Oh... It was
gonna be a gift for you.

1367
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:39,184
Oh, you're so...
I feel like such an idiot!

1368
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,654
Darling, no, no, no, never
mind, never mind. What a shame.

1369
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,453
Let's forget about it.
No...

1370
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,123
Huh? Let's just...

1371
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:49,025
Now that we've confessed our sins,
let's move on with our lives, huh?

1372
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,498
Really? Yeah. I want to
hear all about the real you.

1373
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,162
And I assure you in advance,
I'll love it.

1374
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,031
Oh, God,

1375
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,199
you snuck into
my music room, did you?

1376
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,907
So the reason
why he was skulking around,

1377
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,843
was 'cause he had
this private family business

1378
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:07,245
which is too delicate
to discuss, actually.

1379
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,781
Sorry, I don't buy it.

1380
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,952
What? The man is a liar and a murderer.

1381
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,681
And I say that
with all due respect.

1382
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,020
Sidney. Child, I know
what I'm talking about.

1383
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,319
Don't call me that, all right?

1384
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,384
Do you remember when we
were out on the estate,

1385
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,553
I found a clue,
you thought I was nuts?

1386
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,531
I thought you were nuts so many
times I can't recall the exact one.

1387
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,728
Do you remember this? Do you
remember this little item? This clue?

1388
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,268
Yes, Betty G.
Yes, Betty G.

1389
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:34,035
Now, I checked all the
girls that were murdered.

1390
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:37,574
The one that was killed the night
we saw Peter on the street, was named

1391
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:40,114
Elizabeth Gibson.

1392
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:41,907
So?

1393
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:45,248
So Betty is short for
Elizabeth a lot of times.

1394
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,380
Oh, come on, Sidney. That's a
real stretch. You're reaching now.

1395
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:52,587
Look, supposing you wanted to rub
somebody out and not get caught.

1396
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,959
Nobody wants
to get caught, Sidney.

1397
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,019
Look,

1398
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:59,932
he wants to get rid of Elizabeth
Gibson. Betty Gibson. Betty Gibson.

1399
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:02,163
So, there's
a series of murders

1400
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,638
with a guy that's got
a real style. A Tarot card.

1401
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,334
They said
he was a total maniac.

1402
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:10,503
He buys a Tarot deck
and let's say he hides it.

1403
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,446
Hypothetically, he hides it,
let's say, in a music room.

1404
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,813
Let's say he hides it in, let's
say, a French horn. Oh, Sidney.

1405
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,682
In a French horn!
I'm losing patience with you.

1406
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,915
I'm not saying the guy
did all the murders.

1407
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,617
I'm saying that he just did
Elizabeth Gibson,

1408
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:27,788
then folded it into the series of the
Tarot Killer so he wouldn't get caught.

1409
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:30,161
Henry Banks
confessed to all the murders.

1410
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,564
Henry Banks is deranged!
He hallucinates!

1411
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:33,623
My God.

1412
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,704
Henry... And you know those guys
like to brag when they get caught.

1413
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,863
Henry Banks, you know...

1414
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:43,571
Where are you going? The cops will dump
every unsolved murder on Henry Banks.

1415
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,545
They haven't
caught anybody in years.

1416
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:48,512
Peter wouldn't hurt a fly.
Oh, really?

1417
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,381
What about a fly who speaks?

1418
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,446
What?
Yes.

1419
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,614
Why would Peter
kill a prostitute?

1420
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:57,118
Because it looks terrible
on his resume.

1421
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:59,820
Who knows what kind of
sordid life this guy has?

1422
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:02,420
Have you completely lost your
mind? What is wrong with you?

1423
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,626
Peter being blackmailed by a
prostitute? It's ridiculous.

1424
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,293
What are you putting
in your Metamucil?

1425
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,367
You know...
Where are you going?

1426
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:12,669
You don't understand!
It would kill his reputation!

1427
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,402
Oh, can you bring
the water out?

1428
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:19,479
Can I say one thing?
Can I just tell you one thing?

1429
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,446
Joe Strombel
would not agree with you.

1430
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,917
I don't want to talk about
Joe Strombel, all right?

1431
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:25,851
Even a great reporter
can be wrong.

1432
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:27,751
But he's not wrong.

1433
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:29,347
Blackmail.
I see it all over.

1434
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:31,016
You are a cynical
crapehanger

1435
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,788
who always sees the glass
half-empty!

1436
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:35,955
No, you're wrong. I see the
glass half-full, but of poison.

1437
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,328
And you're gonna wind up
drinking it!

1438
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:40,163
You don't know anything. You don't
have a reporter's instincts, okay?

1439
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,601
You're some guy who
vanishes silk handkerchiefs

1440
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,161
and cuts
people's neckties off.

1441
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,901
Do everybody a favor. Go back
to your card tricks, all right?

1442
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:55,244
Did you tell her?

1443
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,048
I did. I told her.

1444
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,520
And I made it seem as though
it all suddenly just came to me.

1445
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:01,715
I know I'm right.

1446
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:04,057
She just won't listen to me.
She hates me.

1447
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:05,320
Yeah. I...
You know,

1448
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,988
sometimes, I got to say,
I worry about that girl.

1449
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,556
I don't think
I'll be seeing you anymore.

1450
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,493
Well, if there's a scoop
to be had here,

1451
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:17,104
she's going
to get it for you.

1452
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:19,803
You can only cheat death
so many times,

1453
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,140
and I've used
every trick I know.

1454
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,837
You look after her.
She's a decent kid.

1455
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:29,077
And check his Tarot deck.
See if a card's missing.

1456
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,876
I'm a reporter.

1457
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:07,888
I'm doing a story on Elizabeth
Gibson, and I know she lived here.

1458
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:12,323
I didn't know her. I hardly ever
saw her come and go. She was quiet.

1459
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,092
All right.

1460
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:17,798
I knew
what she did for a living.

1461
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:21,768
But whether she used to entertain her
clients here, or not, I couldn't say.

1462
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:31,902
Oh,
excuse me. I'm a reporter.

1463
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,746
And I'm doing a story

1464
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,716
about Elizabeth Gibson.

1465
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:39,618
If there's any comments, anything
you know about her that I...

1466
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:44,352
<i>What paper? What paper are
you from? The Washington Post.</i>

1467
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,894
I'm one of the top reporters
on the...

1468
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:51,455
<i>Did you see All the President's
Men? I was the short guy.</i>

1469
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:56,698
Why is an American paper
interested in this?

1470
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,899
No, no, we are, we are.
We're doing a big story.

1471
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:02,000
The Travel and Leisure section
is doing a big spread

1472
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,045
on places
to avoid like the plague.

1473
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,444
And so, I'm...

1474
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:11,048
I'll make it very worth
your while, you know and...

1475
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,610
All right, all right, all
right. I knew Betty Gibson.

1476
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:16,450
Mmm-hmm,
and she was very tough.

1477
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:19,326
But I don't think
that she deserved to die.

1478
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,525
Did you say Betty Gibson?

1479
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:26,298
Everyone called her Betty.
That was her name.

1480
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:31,262
Really? And did you know
any of her clients at all?

1481
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:37,501
I mean, she knew millions of men,
didn't she? She was very sexy.

1482
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:41,379
You know. Not that you'd
know that from those pictures.

1483
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:45,184
She used to be a really
pretty baby-faced blonde.

1484
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,380
You know,
the sort men go nuts for.

1485
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,016
A blonde? But in the paper...
The pictures in the paper...

1486
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,150
Oh, no, I know, I know.

1487
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,251
She made the mistake of cutting
it off and dyeing it black.

1488
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:54,860
God knows why.

1489
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,723
Maybe it's to please
one of her regulars.

1490
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,728
She had steady clients?

1491
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,027
Well, yeah, one for sure.

1492
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,596
Look, these guys never
use their real names, okay?

1493
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:08,504
But there was this one
rich kid that she saw a lot.

1494
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:12,142
And his name was Peter.

1495
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,446
Peter what?

1496
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,545
Peter...
Peter Yardley. Peter Yardley?

1497
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,951
Yardley. Yardley.

1498
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:24,456
Hello?
Hello, this is Mr. Spence.

1499
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:28,024
Sid.
Sid Waterman Spence.

1500
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:33,065
This is Sid Waterman Spence.
Where have I called?

1501
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:36,863
Oh, hello, Sidney.
It's Peter Lyman.

1502
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:41,108
Sondra and I are spending the
weekend at my father's country house.

1503
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:42,370
You could have come.

1504
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:47,371
That's okay. She gave me this
number to call. May I speak with her?

1505
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:48,541
Yes, one second.

1506
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,384
Hi, Sidney.

1507
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:01,088
Listen, I got a treasure
trove of information here.

1508
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,993
I just was snooping with...

1509
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,759
On Elizabeth Gibson.

1510
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,526
She's called Betty. Betty!
She's called Betty.

1511
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:13,196
And she had some kind of
a long relationship...

1512
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:16,904
A special relationship
with some young guy, Peter.

1513
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:21,415
The last name doesn't click,
but I'm sure it's the same.

1514
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:23,379
This is crazy.

1515
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,946
Look, stop making trouble,
Sidney. The case is closed.

1516
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,455
Listen, this thing adds up.

1517
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:35,125
You're alone up there with
a very, very dangerous man.

1518
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:36,855
That's two verys.

1519
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,692
You got to get back to town
right away.

1520
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,962
Sidney, if I thought there was
a shred of proof,

1521
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:45,268
I would never let my personal
feelings get involved, all right?

1522
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:46,898
The truth is,
I'm crazy about the guy.

1523
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:50,672
I can't keep obsessing over
tantalizing conspiracy theories.

1524
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,385
You know, I'm sure
that he killed her

1525
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:02,446
and made it look
like a Tarot killing.

1526
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:06,420
You know, you don't see it
because you got stars in your eyes.

1527
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:10,028
Look, I don't... This is crazy! I
don't want to talk about this anymore.

1528
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,759
It's too upsetting for me,
all right?

1529
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,130
Let me have my nice weekend.

1530
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,429
I'll talk to you
when I get back.

1531
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,697
Stop putting these paranoid
thoughts in my head!

1532
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,635
Is Sidney okay?
Yes, yes.

1533
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,371
You know, I love Sidney,
I really do,

1534
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:25,936
but he's just... He's got a part
missing, you know, he's crazy!

1535
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:27,276
Yes, really?
Mmm-hmm.

1536
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:28,373
Like what?

1537
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,110
We'll talk about it later.

1538
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:31,709
Let me change, okay?
Mmm-Hmm.

1539
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,407
Yes? Oh, yes, sir.

1540
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:59,004
Yes. My daughter is in
the country with Mr. Lyman.

1541
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,208
And I'm gonna be driving up
there later and she asked me

1542
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:05,515
if I could pick up her red cashmere
sweater. She thinks she left it upstairs.

1543
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:06,679
Red cashmere?

1544
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,383
Yes, it's a red sweater. It's
a kind of a red, tomato red,

1545
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:11,516
<i>like a fire engine.
A red. A rouge.</i>

1546
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:14,391
I understand, sir. Red.
Yes, yes.

1547
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:16,293
I'll see if I can find it.

1548
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,060
Sir?

1549
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:25,257
Oh, I was just
checking out the Stradivarius.

1550
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:31,668
<i>I play a few pieces myself on the violin.
Prokofiev and Bartok, the Hot Canary...</i>

1551
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:35,039
But Mr. Lyman is the only person to
have the combination to that room.

1552
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,045
Yes, but he wanted to share
it with me because, you know,

1553
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:39,580
in case something happened,

1554
01:23:39,647 --> 01:23:41,581
you know,
life is very capricious.

1555
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:45,244
A stroke, a sudden embolism
or lightning... You know I...

1556
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:47,612
Darling, I love you.
I mean that sincerely.

1557
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,988
You're a wonderful woman, you're a
tremendous servant and a credit to your race.

1558
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:53,254
And I mean that. From the bottom
of my heart I say that to you.

1559
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,852
I notice you didn't
get the red sweater.

1560
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:56,590
She probably left it
in another bedroom.

1561
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,859
You know, she's got a little
problem with promiscuity.

1562
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,093
But...

1563
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:03,532
So, I'll be going. I'll
call you. We'll have lunch.

1564
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:16,182
Mr. Lyman, sir, Mr. Spence has been
here and he's been into the music room.

1565
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:18,248
What do you mean?

1566
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,511
A most unusual
sequence of events.

1567
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:22,852
Mr. Spence came by looking
for his daughter's sweater.

1568
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:24,414
Said she'd requested it.

1569
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,722
Next thing I knew,
he was in the music room.

1570
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,719
Sir, I think he'd been
drinking, from his behavior.

1571
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:32,963
Yes, yes.

1572
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:36,162
Yes. Okay, Margaret,
thank you. Goodbye.

1573
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:38,465
Is everything okay?

1574
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:41,407
Yes.
Yes, it will be.

1575
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:59,576
It's so nice to be out
here with you, just away

1576
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:03,022
from the rest of the world and... Hmm.

1577
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:07,585
Yes, I often come out here
to read and, well, and fish.

1578
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,152
There's trout in the lake.

1579
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:19,596
What are you thinking about?

1580
01:26:20,775 --> 01:26:22,367
You really want to know?
Yes.

1581
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,541
Just how ironic life is,
and tragic.

1582
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,344
Why?

1583
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:32,512
Well, that I met you
by rescuing you from drowning

1584
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,152
and found you
totally enchanting

1585
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:39,749
and now we've come full cycle and,
alas, you're going to have to drown.

1586
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:43,889
What?

1587
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:47,426
Oh, I imagine by now Sidney's
confirmed that I killed Betty Gibson.

1588
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:50,096
I mean, in my own defense, there
really was no other way out.

1589
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:53,437
At first I managed
to hide my identity from her,

1590
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,669
but I saw her too many times
over the years

1591
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:58,708
and she learned who I was,
and...

1592
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:01,408
Well, it became
a constant demand for money

1593
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:03,712
and I just could not
let that go on, could I?

1594
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:06,743
I mean, my whole life
and career

1595
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:09,654
would be just hostage to
her moods at all times.

1596
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,123
So, I studied
the Tarot case,

1597
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:16,527
I rehearsed my plan,
and, well, you know the rest.

1598
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,531
If you do something to me,
Sidney's gonna find out!

1599
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,726
He'll tell someone.

1600
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:22,361
No, no, no. You see, you
will go in a boating accident,

1601
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,132
and Sidney will go
later tonight.

1602
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,733
No one knows
of your relationship with him,

1603
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:29,700
because, after all, you're not
actually father and daughter, are you?

1604
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:33,505
And no one will think twice to investigate
the death of some obscure vaud...

1605
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:34,809
Are you listening?

1606
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:36,981
No one will think twice
to investigate the death

1607
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:40,612
of some obscure vaudevillian called
Splendini, who is really a stranger to me.

1608
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:42,380
Help!

1609
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:44,220
Help! Someone help me!

1610
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:54,759
Yes, very quiet, isn't it?

1611
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:00,097
This is the advantage
of a private lake.

1612
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:06,180
Get off me!
Get off me!

1613
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:09,242
Get off me!
Come...

1614
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:30,223
Yes, police.

1615
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:35,300
Yes, this is Peter Lyman.
I need the police immediately.

1616
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,861
At the Lyman estate.

1617
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:41,968
There's been a terrible boating
accident. A woman has drowned.

1618
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,738
It's awful.
Please come right away.

1619
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:45,301
Thank you. Thank you.

1620
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,915
They think they know
where the body is.

1621
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,590
I'm so sorry, sir.

1622
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:01,490
When last I saw her,
she...

1623
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,724
She just said she wanted to go out
there to communicate with nature.

1624
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:11,204
Just to think she wanted
some peace and quiet and...

1625
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,664
She wasn't depressed, or
anything like that, was she, sir?

1626
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:14,730
God, no. No.

1627
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,271
I mean, unless she was
keeping it from me.

1628
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:19,206
You heard no cries for help?

1629
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,738
No! No, I was listening
to music in here, damn it.

1630
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:25,043
It's just so ironic.

1631
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:26,245
Because the way
I first met her

1632
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,550
I rescued her from
drowning in our club pool.

1633
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:31,114
And she was a very,
very weak swimmer.

1634
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,019
Hello?

1635
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,786
I was faking it at the pool
to get your attention.

1636
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:40,225
Actually, I used to be captain of
the Brooklyn Community Swim Team.

1637
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,674
Fascinating observation.

1638
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:59,445
Lyman lost a cufflink
at the flat of a prostitute,

1639
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,988
who was later killed
by the Tarot Card Killer.

1640
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:06,684
Well, this upright chap certainly
enjoyed patronizing some dodgy women.

1641
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:10,722
Unfortunately for Elizabeth Gibson,
she elected to blackmail him.

1642
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:14,124
It's a beautifully
written story

1643
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:18,136
and one of the best bits of
investigative journalism in a long time.

1644
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:20,474
And this paper
is proud to run it.

1645
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,941
Oh, I have to share the
credit with Joe Strombel.

1646
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:24,268
An inspiration,

1647
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:26,711
who taught me more than I
could ever explain to anyone.

1648
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:29,545
And to the late
Sidney Waterman.

1649
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:31,410
Splendini.

1650
01:31:31,552 --> 01:31:34,282
A nice guy who helped out
with the investigation

1651
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:36,983
and without whom
I never could have made it.

1652
01:31:38,392 --> 01:31:40,883
Sidney, wherever you are,

1653
01:31:42,029 --> 01:31:43,462
I'll never forget you.

1654
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:46,697
How did you get here?

1655
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:48,159
Me?

1656
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:51,966
I couldn't get used to driving on
the goddamn wrong side of the street!

1657
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:54,030
You know, I was driving
up to the country,

1658
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:57,043
and in the United States, I would have
been a hero. I would have saved her.

1659
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:58,100
I would have...

1660
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,704
But here, you know... That's the
one drawback of living in London.

1661
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:03,909
Granted, the theater's better,
there's many good Indian restaurants.

1662
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:05,179
Well, what did you do?

1663
01:32:05,286 --> 01:32:07,846
What do I do?
I'm Splendini. Magician.

1664
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:11,024
Would you like to see
something? Oh, yes, please.

1665
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:12,753
Do we have time for a card trick? Yes.

1666
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:14,522
I believe we have eternity.

1667
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:16,961
I'm going to show you
a little trick now.

1668
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:20,195
I just want to say from the bottom
of my heart, I mean this sincerely...

1669
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:22,233
I say this
with all due respect.

1670
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:24,965
You are a wonderful group and
a fantastic group of people.

1671
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:27,701
I love you and I feel that
coming back from you.

1672
01:32:27,775 --> 01:32:32,109
And you may be deceased, but
you should not be discouraged.

1673
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:33,510
Because, you know...

1674
01:32:33,581 --> 01:32:36,141
Don't think of being dead
as a handicap.

1675
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,344
You know, when I was
a child, I stuttered.

1676
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:40,819
But with stick-to-it-iveness
and perseverance,

1677
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:42,856
you know, you can never tell
what could happen.

1678
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:44,357
Now, I want you
to take a card, Alma.

1679
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:45,687
Go ahead,
take any card you want.

1680
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,455
Just pick it. Pick it.
Go ahead, sweetheart.

1681
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,257
<i>I love you, sweetheart.
That's fantastic.</i>
