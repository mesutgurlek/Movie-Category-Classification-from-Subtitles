D.N.A. And blood were

315
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,366
all over Davis's clothes,
inside his van.

316
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,702
Which could've got there when he
lifted Ackerman into his van.

317
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,937
Yeah, or when he murdered him.
Davis has two counts

318
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,739
- of aggravated assault.
- At a time when his family

319
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,708
had just been murdered
in a home invasion.

320
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,944
He hasn't had so much
as a parking ticket since.

321
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,779
What's bothering you, Mitch?

322

<i>It was a 911 call.</i>
<i>Somebody called in an accident</i>

327
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,661
<i>20 minutes</i>
<i>before Davis was picked up.</i>

328
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,430

329

<i>there was no one there.</i>

330
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
MAN: <i>Okay, thank you.</i>

331
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,139
Is there any way
we can find the caller?

332
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,174
- No, he used a payphone.
- How do you know that?

333
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:03,447
If he used his cell, it would
have his name, phone records.

334
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,450
MAN: <i>Okay, 911 call's
potentially damaging,</i>

335
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,386
<i>but it's not conclusive.</i>

336
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,154
<i>And if we can't find the caller,</i>

337
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,490
<i>defense probably can't either.</i>

338
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,759
<i>Could be anyone in Chicago.</i>

339
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,928
Mitch, where were you that evening?

340
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:18,670
<i>(LAUGHS)</i>

00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,669
- Yeah, thanks, Stu.
- <i>If it was a hit-and-run,</i>

344
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,938
all it takes is
for the guy who hit him

345
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,674
<i>to come forward and confess,</i>
<i>and we're dead in the water.</i>

346
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:34,512
STUART: <i>What's the likelihood
of anybody doing that, huh?</i>

347
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:38,549
Bottom line: Do we have
enough for a conviction?

348
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,519
Davis was found with a
dead man in his van.

349
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,521
We have a ton of physical evidence.

350
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,890
No alibi, a documented
history of violence

351
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,491
and his public defender's
still in diapers.

352
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,692
Mitch will eat him for breakfast.

353
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:59,002
Charge him, murder one.

354
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:09,245
MITCH:
You examined the body, doctor.

355
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:13,517
In your professional... opinion,

356
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,020
what was the cause of death?

357
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,988
Blunt force trauma to the skull.

358
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,924
And what caused that trauma?

359
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,226
The back of the skull
was badly crushed,

360
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,729
so it's hard to narrow
it down to any one item,

361
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,865
but some of the marks
seemed consistent

362
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,568
with a hammer found
in the suspect's van.

363
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,038
And the interior was covered
in grease and motor oil,

364
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,942
so any type of violent
struggle in that environment

365
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,046
could've also caused those wounds
and left that trace evidence.

366
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,748
You said, "seemed consistent."

367
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,016
That's correct.

368
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:51,755
Your report talks of abrasions

369
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:56,192
and impact wounds with grease
and motor oil in them.

370
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:00,096
Now the defense I'm sure
is gonna argue that...

371
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:02,933
<i>those wounds indicate</i>

372
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,536
<i>that a car ran over Cecil Ackerman</i>

373
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,972
as per the defendant's testimony

374
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,607
and that the rest is just...

375
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:14,744
a misinterpretation
of the evidence.

376

It's your witness, Mr. Brockden.

385
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,252
Doctor, the jury will be unfamiliar
with your field of expertise,

386
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,322
so I'll ask
quite a simple question.

387
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,759
Just how accurate
is forensic linguistics?

388
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,295
- Extremely.
- But it's not perfect?

389
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,697
Perfection doesn't happen
in science.

390
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:10,801
Okay. On a sliding scale
of one to 10 then...

391
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,637
you may want to object, counselor.

392

<i>The witness's field</i>
<i>is not on trial here.</i>

the question, your honor.

<i>You stated earlier that you believe</i>

the caller to be genuine?

396
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,884
By this I assume you mean

397
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,886
he was reporting a real accident.

398
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,119
Correct.

399
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:33,324
And you can tell this just by...

400
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,692
hearing his voice?

401
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,195
It's more complicated
than that, but yes.

What else can you tell
us about the caller?

403
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,001
Hard to be certain

404
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,369
from the quality of the tape.

405
