"Don't Breathe (2016)" ^ (Run time 01:22:29)

2
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:28,361
Don't Breathe

3
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:45,806
20. 19. 18.

4
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,344
Come on.
You know there's 12 seconds.

5
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,066
- 17.
- Yo, killed that already.

6
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:50,926
- Dude.
- Come on.

7
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,712
14.
13.

8
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,149
- 12. 11.
- Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

9
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,696
10.
9.

10
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:00,905
I told you this was
going to be fancy.

11
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:04,247
Alright, so,
just like last time.

12
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:06,492
No cash. The total take
has to fall below 10 g's

13
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,384
Yeah, yeah, whatever Judge Judy.
Come on.

14
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,011
Let's do this.

15
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:42,095
Okay, let's get out of here.

16
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:18,667
.

17
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,590
Everybody's leaving.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,144
You know, if we keep hitting
houses like today, Rocky,

19
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,751
- and...
- Bye bye, Detroit.

20
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:32,313
And hola California.

21
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:35,470
Wait, wait.
You're going away, Rock?

22
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,476
Yes, as soon as I can.

23
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,922
When are you---
When are you coming back?

24
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:44,366
Never.

25
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,523
You should come with us.

26
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:49,993
- I...
- What?

27
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,796
Everyone else is gone.

28
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,716
I got my dad here.

29
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:57,150
I'll miss you then.

30
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:23,171
Dad?

31
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,500
You at home?

32
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:15,172
- Yo, this is it, man?
- And I have my 40%.

33
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,934
Take it or leave it.

34
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,975
- It's a fucking Rolex in there, bro.
- What do you think?

35
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,184
And when I put it up for auction
that's not a risk, huh?

36
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,871
You know how much people on
the street pay for a hot Rolex.

37
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,648
Huh.

38
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:33,531
You want money,
then steal money.

39
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,818
Fucking bullshit, bro.

40
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:40,113
You want to hear a tip
or not?

41
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:45,428
Alright, let's hear it.

42
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:48,136
1837 Buena Vista Street.

43
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:51,156
A house with your dad's security company,
I've already checked.

44
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,095
Guy who owns it
is an army vet.

45
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,096
Normally, it's just him and the house.

46
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:58,567
- That part of the city is a ghost town.
- It looks like a dump.

47
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,119
That's actually good news.

48
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,749
How's that good news.

49
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:03,129
The story goes.

50
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,212
Some preppy girl,
a few days ago

51
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:07,158
- ran over this guy's daughter.
- Jesus.

52
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:08,692
The daughter died.

53
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:12,932
And this preppy, rich ass family
pays him off.

54
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,434
Gives him a big ass settlement.

55
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:18,523
Baloney honor, right.

56
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:22,591
This guy, is sitting
on at least...

57
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:26,638
300k.
Boom!

58
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:32,085
I mean, if I deliver this stake to Raul,
man, he will shit his pants.

59
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,504
Do you think the money
is in the house?

60
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,860
I don't know.
Let's go find out.

61
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,812
Guys, we don't-
we don't do cash.

62
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,557
Above 10k, it's major larceny.

63
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:41,060
That means 10 years
if we get caught.

64
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,244
- We won't get caught.
- Okay, and then what?

65
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,162
That amount brings serious cop presence
and there will be an investigation.

66
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,361
- My dad can get in trouble.
- I knew you'll bitch out on me.

67
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:49,446
I just knew it.

68
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:54,255
Alex, if we do this right, 
we'll never have to do it again.

69
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:01,393
Where're you going?

70
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:03,995
We're not doing this one.

71
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:06,564
Seriously.

72
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,797
Give us the fucking keys, man,
we'll fucking do it!

73
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:11,445
Alex!

74
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:26,284
ROCKY:
I NEED TO GET HER OUT OF HERE.
FOR ME - HELP?

75
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:53,408
Gulf War Veteran reaches six figure settlement
from Grosse Point's well known Roberts family.

76
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,678
Are you done, Diddy?

77
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:11,604
Be a doll and get your mother
a large 14 bolognese.

78
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:13,807
So, Trevor is living here now?

79
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:15,751
Don't be a bitch, Roxanne.
It's just a few months

80
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:17,993
till he can find a new job.

81
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:19,783
You have no money in here.

82
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,840
You pay for it then.

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,271
I know you're making money.

84
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:30,986
I'm done.

85
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,178
Your lips look sore.

86
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:36,132
That's how you're making
your cash out there?

87
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,518
Huh?

88
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:43,234
Okay.
Diddy, let's go for a walk.

89
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:45,681
I don't have to be...

90
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:51,552
- Yeah, well, it's not summer, monkey head.
- I want to be a surfer.

91
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:54,580
There's no surf in Michigan.

92
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:58,765
Not fair.

93
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,556
Yeah, well.

94
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:03,928
Some things you can't change, baby.

95
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:06,329
Well.
No matter how, we'll go there.

96
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:09,159
What a... bummer.

97
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:12,462
OK. I AGREE

98
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,470
Hey, you know where
there is surf?

99
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,728
California.

100
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,719
What do you say you and I
move there together?

101
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,466
Would you like that?

102
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:26,143
Okay.
I promise then.

103
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:42,908
Is that a new tattoo?

104
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,125
Yeah.

105
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,007
I got it last night.

106
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:48,287
- Is it a?
- Ladybug.

107
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:50,322
Why a ladybug?

108
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:56,667
What?

109
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,697
When my dad left,
my mom started drinking and

110
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:04,653
she told me that

111
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:07,715
my dad's leaving was
all my fault.

112
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,166
And I missed him a lot so,
I'd cry.

113
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:16,123
She got so fed up with
the crying that she would

114
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,636
lock me in the
trunk of her car.

115
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:21,213
Sometimes for hours.

116
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:25,512
But there is this uh...

117
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,829
a little hole in the trunk

118
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,205
and one time
a ladybug flew in.

119
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,363
It kept me company.

120
00:11:34,095 --> 00:11:36,435
It made me feel safe.

121
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,199
When I reached California,
I'm going to color this tat.

122
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:43,597
And that's the last time
I will mark my body.

123
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,406
If we get this money,
I'm going away with you guys.

124
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,563
I know you will.

125
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:07,242
At least for blocks around
the houses aren't occupied.

126
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:10,196
No people means
no Five-O on patrol.

127
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:12,301
It's going to be
a piece of cake.

128
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,571
The guy's a shun and hasn't
left his house like 5 days.

129
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:18,928
I say we do it with 
him in the house.

130
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:21,856
Jesus.

131
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:24,801
Get off the fucking car,
you dogshit!

132
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:33,944
Shit, that's our guy.

133
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,931
Wait, is he blind?

134
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:46,801
He has lost his sight
in Iraq or something.

135
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,050
It's kind of fuck up to rob
a blind guy, isn't it?

136
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:52,414
Just because he's blind don't mean
he's a fucking saint, bro.

137
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,298
We do this tonight.

138
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,354
The whole neighborhood is fucking empty.

139
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:25,043
This guy is the last man standing.

140
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:30,948
The lights are out.
He must be asleep.

141
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,632
He's blind.
Light's out doesn't mean anything.

142
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:36,704
It's 2:00 am.
He's sleeping.

143
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,537
Let's take care of
that dog first, yeah?

144
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:05,711
Oh man.

145
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,918
He's took it.

146
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,939
It'll be lights out in a second.

147
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:27,154
There's 4 locks,
you got the other keys?

148
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,864
No, I only have one.

149
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,495
Fuck me!

150
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,052
Why wouldn't he give backup
keys to the security company?

151
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:38,771
Because the money's in there and
the paranoid fuck doesn't trust nobody.

152
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,303
Let's check for a side door.

153
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,155
Sweet dreams, pal.

154
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,562
What's that?

155
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,998
You just point this in the
general direction of the master keypad.

156
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,633
It will kill the alarm.

157
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,435
Okay.
Open the fucking door, Dexter.

158
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:53,564
Got it.

159
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:54,960
Shit.

160
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,455
What's wrong?

161
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,321
It won't open.

162
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,850
This guy isn't messing around.

163
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:15,652
There's a bolt here,
I can feel it.

164
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:20,674
It's locked.
Locked from the inside.

165
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:23,937
What about that window?

166
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,237
There's no bars on it.
I can fit in there.

167
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:27,517
What?

168
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,840
No.
We're not sending you in there at all.

169
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,893
Nobody is sending me anywhere.
I'm going myself.

170
00:16:36,524 --> 00:16:37,977
Help me up.

171
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:41,632
- Here, Rocky. You only got 30 seconds. 
- Okay.

172
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:43,429
Here.

173
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:18,070
ENTER CODE: 30
29... 28...

174
00:17:57,283 --> 00:17:59,295
<font color="#80ffff">DISARMED
Ready to Arm</font>

175
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,691
Slow your roll, fool.

176
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:49,360
She must have got it by now.
She's fine.

177
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:53,229
- Yeah, like you would give a fuck.
- What'd you say?

178
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,974
That's my bitch in there.

179
00:18:58,074 --> 00:18:59,967
Let me give you some advice.

180
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:03,760
Be a good friend and stay in the
fucking friend zone, alright?

181
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:09,039
You okay?

182
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,399
Yes.

183
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:11,995
I turned it off.

184
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,970
- Huh. What the fuck?
- Hey!

185
00:20:47,466 --> 00:20:50,775
Hey. Hey.
Look here.

186
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,087
We have 3 seeds.
Right?

187
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:32,826
Just three.

188
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:34,725
1.

189
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:38,830
2 and 3.

190
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,593
3 seeds.

191
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:45,585
In their sit cups,
oh and cute.

192
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:48,787
Now the water.

193
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:52,245
Now the water

194
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:28,302
What does a tree need to grow?

195
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:33,090
Water, seed, soil
and the sun.

196
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:34,680
Sounds good.

197
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:45,813
Done!

198
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:53,762
What the fuck, dude?

199
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:55,921
The guy's gassed out.
He's-He-s out.

200
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:57,760
He's a sleeping beauty.
It's fine.

201
00:23:57,785 --> 00:23:59,266
Guys.

202
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,809
...it's locked.
- Only lead in the house.

203
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:09,256
Probably in there.

204
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,766
Do you think
you can crack it open?

205
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:24,840
Fuck!

206
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:29,922
Jesus.

207
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:33,315
Do you have anything else?

208
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,856
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

209
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:39,291
Got a more powerful tool.

210
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:44,350
- Whoa, what the hell is that?
- It's a 9mm Beretta.

211
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,166
Gangster style, bitches.

212
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:47,920
Why'd you bring a gun?

213
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,453
This is a soldier's house, Alex.

214
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:50,908
Like I would ever come in here
without some chrome.

215
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:53,860
Honey.
You never shot a gun before.

216
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:56,158
Yeah, well.
It's time to pop that cherry, baby.

217
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:58,266
Because I want to pop that shit
like a fucking tuna can.

218
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,846
Do you have any idea what
bringing a gun to a burglary means?

219
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:01,882
Yeah.

220
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:04,714
It gives me a better chance
to defend myself, Alex.

221
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:07,773
What? You just gave this guy 
the legal right to shoot us.

222
00:25:11,434 --> 00:25:12,929
Rocky, let's go.

223
00:25:12,954 --> 00:25:14,309
No, no, no, no, no.

224
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:17,581
- I think we should stay.
- We have to leave, this is not good.

225
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:22,138
You don't really think just because
you jerk off to her instagrams selfies

226
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:24,193
that makes you a Romeo.

227
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,940
Think again, bitch!

228
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:42,379
Fuck, I'm so out.

229
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:46,210
Alex.

230
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,259
Who-Who's there?

231
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,964
Okay, man.
Just chill, alright?

232
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,468
Look, uh...

233
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:25,436
I was wasted and
I wondered in.

234
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:28,173
So that was my bad, alright?
So I'm just gonna...

235
00:26:28,198 --> 00:26:30,172
I'm just going to leave, okay?

236
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:46,096
Stay right fucking there.

237
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:48,753
Don't you fucking move.

238
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:53,850
Yeah, that's right.
I know what's in there

239
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,712
and I ain't leaving without it.
You got me?

240
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:59,662
Now, you do as I say, alright?

241
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:03,375
Don't take 1 single step, alright?
Huh.

242
00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:09,276
What, you hear me or what?

243
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:13,724
What you blind and deaf
all of a sudden, huh?

244
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:18,511
Motherfucker, I said stop.
I think you fucking heard me.

245
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,210
- Sorry.
- Don't you move.

246
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:25,027
What the fuck are you doing, old man?
I'll fucking shoot you.

247
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:29,184
Don't you fucking touch me.

248
00:27:36,251 --> 00:27:38,054
Fucking pussy

249
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:41,709
What are you going to do now, huh?
Huh?

250
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,676
You better fucking stop!

251
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,402
Don't hurt me.
I'll kill you, man!

252
00:28:07,774 --> 00:28:10,648
Please, just... let me walk.

253
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:14,501
Let me walk.
Leave me alive.

254
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:19,280
Why do you want to do this...
man... please.

255
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:22,190
How many of you are there?

256
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:25,490
- What?
- How many?

257
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,740
It's just me, man, alright?
It's just fucking me.

258
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:38,811
Just let me go!
Please, just let me go...

259
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:47,840
Just... let me go...

260
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:53,404
Okay.

261
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,381
Okay.
Okay.

262
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:00,911
Okay, I swear to god.

263
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:27,018
MONEY DEAD

264
00:32:36,376 --> 00:32:37,976
In closet

265
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:39,193
<font color="#ff8080">2978</font>

266
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:49,424
Oh.

267
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:19,969
.

268
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,345
Rocky.
Hey.

269
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,948
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

270
00:34:38,555 --> 00:34:39,751
Maybe we...

271
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:42,037
Maybe we should call the cops
before he does.

272
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:43,692
We'll come clean.

273
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:45,517
Wait.

274
00:34:58,926 --> 00:34:59,254
OPEn

275
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,373
OPEnEd

276
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:34,687
There's a lot more than
300 grand in this.

277
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:36,989
Got to be about 
a million dollars.

278
00:35:37,126 --> 00:35:39,348
Okay, let's get out of here.

279
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:49,378
That's some sort of door.

280
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:52,572
The door's bolted from the inside.
That could be the way out.

281
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:54,894
Let's go.

282
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:52,045
Let's go.

283
00:38:55,464 --> 00:38:56,814
This way.

284
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:01,974
Holy shit, fuck night.

285
00:41:01,142 --> 00:41:03,036
- Where's the door?
- I don't know.

286
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:04,890
Where is it?
Do you see it?

287
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:41,207
(Please help me.)

288
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,392
(Please.)

289
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,038
We need to get the fuck
out of here right now.

290
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:46,574
Come on.

291
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:49,553
Let's go.
The door is right here.

292
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,838
What?

293
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:02,079
Rocky.

294
00:42:02,373 --> 00:42:03,447
Rocky.

295
00:42:03,472 --> 00:42:04,719
Hey, we're about to make it.

296
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:06,565
The door is right fucking here,
we can leave right now.

297
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:08,732
- Alright?
- (No...)

298
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:12,608
Cindy Roberts found innocent
of vehicular manslaughter

299
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:16,115
She's the one who
killed his daughter.

300
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,323
We have to get
her out of here.

301
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:23,017
No. No. No, Rocky.
We don't have time.

302
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,806
We'll get out of here
and we'll call the cops.

303
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:27,954
- And then they'll come find her.
Alright?
- (The safe.)

304
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:30,152
(The safe.)

305
00:43:10,492 --> 00:43:12,249
The code from the safe upstairs,
do you remember it?

306
00:43:12,274 --> 00:43:15,008
Uh.
2978.

307
00:43:15,033 --> 00:43:17,886
2978.

308
00:43:19,674 --> 00:43:20,996
Okay.

309
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:26,081
He's coming.

310
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,638
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

311
00:43:30,042 --> 00:43:31,401
Fuck.

312
00:43:31,426 --> 00:43:33,729
Almost there.
Almost there.

313
00:43:34,304 --> 00:43:37,503
I don't care what you did.
I'll get you out of here.

314
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:39,912
Go.
Go!

315
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:05,428
What's wrong?

316
00:44:07,706 --> 00:44:09,046
What's wrong?

317
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:11,282
- It's locked.
- Use the keys.

318
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:12,976
Just try the keys.

319
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:17,933
- I have it shoved in.
- Come in.

320
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,310
Yes!

321
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,105
Come on!

322
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:36,581
He shot her.

323
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:19,666
No.

324
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,308
No!

325
00:46:22,528 --> 00:46:23,964
No.

326
00:46:28,305 --> 00:46:30,836
No, baby.

327
00:46:32,602 --> 00:46:34,453
My baby.

328
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:43,333
NO!

329
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,835
NO!

330
00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:49,096
NOOO!

331
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:33,305
He's going upstairs.

332
00:47:35,244 --> 00:47:38,712
I say, we use these keys
in that lock to the front door.

333
00:47:38,737 --> 00:47:39,777
Alright?

334
00:47:39,802 --> 00:47:42,409
We get up there,
we can get out.

335
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:44,035
Okay?

336
00:47:52,943 --> 00:47:54,321
Let's go.

337
00:48:09,566 --> 00:48:10,979
Shit.

338
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:12,315
Huh?

339
00:48:29,793 --> 00:48:31,218
Alex.

340
00:49:47,644 --> 00:49:48,945
Rocky.

341
00:50:37,937 --> 00:50:39,972
- Rocky.
- Alex.

342
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:41,672
Alex.

343
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:44,000
Rocky. Rocky. Rocky.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

344
00:50:44,025 --> 00:50:45,488
Let's go, come on.

345
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:48,106
Let's go.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

346
00:50:48,596 --> 00:50:49,961
Come on.

347
00:50:53,012 --> 00:50:55,628
I see light.
Come on. Come on.

348
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:16,863
Don't... run.

349
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:21,789
Rocky.

350
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:26,736
Go to the door.

351
00:51:27,064 --> 00:51:29,103
Try the blue key.

352
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:30,878
Do it.

353
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,345
Fuck.

354
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:46,643
Rocky.

355
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,943
Come on.

356
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:52,495
Easy.

357
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,249
Okay.

358
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,944
Okay, that's a good boy.

359
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:01,461
That's good.
Alright.

360
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:04,363
That's...That's good.

361
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:06,097
That's good.

362
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,860
Go, go, go.
Upstairs now, go, go, go!

363
00:52:25,055 --> 00:52:27,380
Hey, move this.
Come on.

364
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:35,186
- Those locked up too?
- Yeah.

365
00:52:36,576 --> 00:52:38,328
We're trapped in here.

366
00:52:58,896 --> 00:53:01,004
Rocky, the remote,
do you have it with you?

367
00:53:01,483 --> 00:53:03,358
Come on, hurry.

368
00:53:03,816 --> 00:53:05,387
- What are you doing?
- I'm pressing the panic button.

369
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:07,738
That means you get in range,
the system will call 911 to the police.

370
00:53:07,763 --> 00:53:09,810
No, wait.
We can't go to jail.

371
00:53:09,835 --> 00:53:11,089
No.
No, we won't

372
00:53:11,114 --> 00:53:13,585
Okay, this is robbery
versus kidnap and murder.

373
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,971
The police won't care about us
or why we're here in the first place.

374
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:17,723
Who'd have lead them 
get this guy.

375
00:53:17,748 --> 00:53:19,772
But then we wouldn't 
keep the money.

376
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,231
We can gather this room.

377
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,709
Go!

378
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:39,455
Alex.

379
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,482
What are you doing?
Go!

380
01:03:25,288 --> 01:03:27,648
Please, let me go.

381
01:03:29,563 --> 01:03:31,727
Please, let me go.

382
01:03:36,047 --> 01:03:37,226
I...

383
01:03:37,492 --> 01:03:39,081
I understand you.

384
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,869
She killed your daughter.

385
01:03:40,894 --> 01:03:44,115
You wanted her to pay.
I understand that.

386
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:45,590
I won't tell anyone.

387
01:03:45,615 --> 01:03:47,982
You understand nothing.

388
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:52,171
Only a parent can know the...

389
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:56,619
... bond between a father 
and his child.

390
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:02,443
She should have gone to prison, but...

391
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:05,689
Rich girls don't go to jail.

392
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,357
None of this is is going to 
bring your daughter back.

393
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:19,962
That's not really true.

394
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:28,495
Cindy took my child 
away from me.

395
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,038
I thought.

396
01:04:33,408 --> 01:04:35,493
It's only fair...

397
01:04:38,197 --> 01:04:40,436
... that she give me a new one.

398
01:04:44,054 --> 01:04:46,782
She was pregnant with my baby.

399
01:04:50,188 --> 01:04:52,360
You killed them both.

400
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:53,670
No.

401
01:04:53,695 --> 01:04:58,238
They would be alive if you 
hadn't broken into my home.

402
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:13,646
You have to be held accountable.

403
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,376
Please, god.

404
01:07:22,752 --> 01:07:24,310
God.

405
01:07:24,483 --> 01:07:26,469
There's no god.

406
01:07:29,284 --> 01:07:31,199
It's a joke.

407
01:07:31,674 --> 01:07:34,442
A bad joke.

408
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,977
You don't do what 
god would allow.

409
01:07:38,002 --> 01:07:39,554
This.

410
01:07:43,252 --> 01:07:44,939
What are you doing?

411
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,747
I'm not a rapist.

412
01:07:53,835 --> 01:07:56,685
I never forced myself on her.

413
01:07:56,896 --> 01:07:58,315
Stop.

414
01:07:59,385 --> 01:08:04,054
I promised I would set her free
just as soon as she gave me a child.

415
01:08:09,934 --> 01:08:12,125
And now she's gone.

416
01:08:12,633 --> 01:08:14,765
But I'm done waiting.

417
01:08:17,808 --> 01:08:19,614
No.
No, no.

418
01:08:58,164 --> 01:08:59,553
Why do you doing this to me?

419
01:08:59,578 --> 01:09:03,232
There is nothing a man cannot do
once he accepts the fact that

420
01:09:03,257 --> 01:09:05,326
there is no god.

421
01:09:06,115 --> 01:09:07,470
No!

422
01:09:07,495 --> 01:09:09,608
No, no, no, no.

423
01:09:09,633 --> 01:09:11,430
NO!

424
01:09:12,324 --> 01:09:13,374
No!

425
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,122
It's done.

426
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:17,763
You're done.

427
01:09:19,753 --> 01:09:21,069
You'll breed well.

428
01:09:21,094 --> 01:09:23,321
No.
Get away from me.

429
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:26,752
NO!
NO!

430
01:09:26,777 --> 01:09:29,006
NO!

431
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:33,127
No...

432
01:09:35,134 --> 01:09:36,589
No.

433
01:09:36,614 --> 01:09:38,662
Shhh, shhh, shhh...

434
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:43,469
9 months, 
and I'll give you your life back.

435
01:10:22,848 --> 01:10:24,309
You okay?

436
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:26,871
Get up.

437
01:10:26,895 --> 01:10:28,942
Rocky, did he hurt you?

438
01:10:28,967 --> 01:10:30,240
Rocky.

439
01:10:32,288 --> 01:10:34,631
You fucking bastard.

440
01:10:48,302 --> 01:10:50,041
Whoa whoa whoa.
Hey, Rocky! Rocky.

441
01:10:50,066 --> 01:10:52,491
Rocky. Rocky, it's over.
Come on.

442
01:10:53,747 --> 01:10:55,583
How does that taste?

443
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:13,352
You're going to rot in prison
for what you've done.

444
01:11:13,551 --> 01:11:16,232
Rocky, we can't involve
the cops now.

445
01:11:16,484 --> 01:11:18,662
If we steal a million in cash
and then lead the cops here,

446
01:11:18,687 --> 01:11:20,549
he'll tell them about us.

447
01:11:20,764 --> 01:11:23,836
He'll blow this all over,
they'll get to us in a second.

448
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,528
You got what you came for.

449
01:11:29,393 --> 01:11:30,987
Now take it.

450
01:11:31,606 --> 01:11:33,696
Get out of my house!

451
01:11:37,581 --> 01:11:41,534
Look, he's buying our silence.
He needs us to take the money.

452
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,886
It's one or the other.

453
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:47,925
Whatever you choose,
I'm with you.

454
01:11:57,465 --> 01:11:59,286
- Okay.
- The door.

455
01:11:59,822 --> 01:12:01,554
Let's get out of here.

456
01:12:01,972 --> 01:12:04,064
I got to find the key.

457
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:09,343
Okay.

458
01:12:10,985 --> 01:12:12,321
I got it.

459
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:04,470
You're worthless out here.

460
01:13:08,874 --> 01:13:10,289
Fuck.

461
01:14:37,802 --> 01:14:38,846
Fuck.

462
01:14:38,871 --> 01:14:41,233
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck.

463
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:55,574
I'm sorry, Alex.

464
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:57,693
I'm so sorry.

465
01:21:07,017 --> 01:21:08,558
What is that?

466
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,814
You and me at the beach.

467
01:21:25,038 --> 01:21:28,188
A retired army vet who fought 
for our country in Iraq

468
01:21:28,213 --> 01:21:31,832
and lost his sight as a result 
of a grenade splinter.

469
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:34,697
Last night, 2 burglars
broke into his home and

470
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:37,496
attempted to rob and
brutally attacked him.

471
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:40,605
This visually impaired man was 
able to defend himself,

472
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:43,739
shooting and killing both of 
his attackers on the spot.

473
01:21:43,764 --> 01:21:46,134
Now, the man did sustain 
some injuries but doctor say

474
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,956
he is in stable condition.

475
01:21:47,981 --> 01:21:52,069
He'll be released from the hospital soon 
and able to return to his home.

476
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:55,746
No goods were reported 
stolen by the victim.

477
01:21:55,771 --> 01:21:59,354
I'm Dana Clark,
WADL news.
