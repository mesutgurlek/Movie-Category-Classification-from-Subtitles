You know this really happened?

78
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,858

are committed

by someone known to the victim.

84
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:49,415
Those that are not solved within
the first 48 hours seldom are.

Not so with serial killers.

86
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,460
One advantage
in this line of work

87
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:55,504
is knowing that as long as
the UNSUB is out there,

88
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:57,256
you'll always have
another chance.

a resetting of the clock.

The model for this exercise

92
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:06,097
was a missing-persons search
in Buffalo, 1982.

93
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:09,434
The dead man was an accomplice
who was killed the day before.

94
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,310
The killer staged a suicide

95
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:14,063
in order to try, in effect,
an escape.

96
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:18,650
As you can see, some of you
responded better than others.

97
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,819
Well, exactly how many times
has a profiler

98
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:23,947
been in a kill-or-capture
situation since 1982?

99
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:25,949
Are you suggesting I'm
preparing you for something

100
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:27,992
you may never experience?

101
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:29,952
Success comes
when you understand

102
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:32,330
that your most lethal weapon
isn't your firearm,

103
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,540
but your brain.

104
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,709
A lot of the old guard
don't believe in my methods.

105
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,502
A lot of them think I'm crazy.

106
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:41,088
You're a privileged group.

107
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:43,340
You're all smart
or you wouldn't be here.

108
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:45,884
I just want you to be smarter.

109
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:49,637
Our final exercise will be
on the island of Oneiga.

110
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,683
This simulation will be a test
primarily of your teamwork.

111
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:56,685
I hope you're ready.

112
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,897
Then how could we have saved
the girls at the old hotel?

113
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,400
You couldn't. They were dead
no matter what you did.

114
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:06,069
What's the point
if we couldn't have saved them?

115
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:09,405
The point is to get used to it.

116
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,743
? There, you've seen it,
my behavior's unacceptable ?

And that "J"...Where is it?
On my key ring...

122
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:34,220
means I'm either a Jill
or a Jennifer.

123
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,347
Those being the favorite "J"
names of Beltway parents

124
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:39,016
circa 1981.

125
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:41,560
I like to hang with my friends
and have a good time,

126
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,939
but I'm really just a mature
woman looking for a mature man.

00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,566
And I recently quit smoking.

Why do you say that?

129

You see the way she keeps eyeing
the guy next to her?

130
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,698
It's not him.
It's his cigarette.

131
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,366
Spoken like a woman who knows.

132

How long has it been, Nicole?
3 days?

The lovely Nicole
and her personal demons.

134
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:04,956
I'm surprised there's enough
room at the table for all of us.

135
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:07,667
Take me 5 minutes
to get her number.

136

don't I?

Jen, Jen. Yes.
Yes, Jen, of course.

00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,313
Okay, obviously
you don't remember me.

Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Enough.

156
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,709
Right about the blond.
You're on fire.

157
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,461
You're projecting.

158

I don't know. It was 2 seconds
at a lecture last semester.

The Moody lecture?

161
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:05,136
Yeah, yeah, Moody.

00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,556
I'm actually not even
a student myself.

164
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,099
Um...

165
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,810
I work in finance.

166
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14,937
Oh. Finance?

167
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:18,107
- Oh! Right. Bobby.
- Yeah.

168
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:20,317
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

169
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,903
He's got 15 seconds.

Thank you.

171
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:29,117
Lucas, looks like tonight
wasrt your night.

172
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,661
I know her. Her name's Jen.
I told her to play along.

173
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,870
You're full of shit.

174
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,288
You never know.

175
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,789
ALL: Ooh.

176
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,499
Ooh.

177
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,709
[Laughter]

178
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:44,547
So, what is going on
in that head?

179
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:45,757
We're professionals.

180
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,800
We shouldn't have to put up
with Harris' shit.

181
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:50,303
All right, what's up?

182
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:54,682
I'm not making profiler.

183
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:56,100
I was alone in his office.

184
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:59,937
His recommends were on the desk,
and I read them.

185
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:02,064
We still have the weekend
at Oneiga.

186
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,482
He says I'm unfocused.

187
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:04,649
He says I'm not capable

188
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:08,486
of the psychological commitment
necessary for profiling work.

189
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:10,196
How do you like that?

190
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:13,407
Commitment. Like,
"Fucking look at me, man."

191
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:15,409
Vince, I think...

192
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,245
You're not making profiler
either, Sara.

193
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:22,749
Sorry.
I read it.

194
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,544
Don't work too hard
out there, okay?

195
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:38,889
We've got a late addition.

196
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:41,308
This is Detective Gabe Jenson.

197
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:43,185
He's from the Philadelphia P.D.

198
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,686
Good morning.
How you doir?

199
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,396
He's their resident profiler,

200
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:48,147
and somehow he got
on D.O.J.'s good side

201
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:50,566
and convinced the attorney
general he could sit in

202
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,235
on some exercises
and see how I work.

203
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,362
Do I have the politics
about right?

204
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:56,614
Something like that.

205
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:57,906
He's joining the team?

206
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,701
He's just here to observe,
not to participate.

207
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:02,702
Now, be nice to him
or it's my ass.

208
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:03,995
No offense, Detective.

209
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:06,581
None taken. It's an honor
to meet all of you.

210
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:24,889
You want to do hostage rescue,
a smallpox outbreak,

211
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,349
this is the place.

212
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:31,437
Navy Seas built it
for war-game practice.

213
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:34,482
Once a year, they turn it over
to me for the weekend.

214
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:40,737
Okay, get your rappelling lines
and prepare to drop.

215
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:43,949
That's a joke.

216
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,713
Here we are.
Crimetown, USA.

217
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:01,840
Where all the residents
are dead.

218
00:16:01,882 --> 00:16:03,717
Or about to be.

219
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:07,095
Now, the idea here, people,
is to only kill the bad guys.

220
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:08,805
[Beeping]

221
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:09,847
But nobody's perfect.

222
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,683
It's nice
to hear you say that, sir.

223
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,852
RAFE: It's like Beirut
meets Belfast.

224
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:18,063
Sir, I thought they didn't let
foreign nationals in the FBI.

225
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,691
Don't worry. On the inside
he's 100% American, right?

226
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:23,235
As American
as the death penalty.

227
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,361
HARRIS:
That's my boy.

228
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:26,446
I think I'm in love.

229
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:31,784
Oh, there is one other person.
They'll be coming along shortly.

230
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:32,952
Who's that?

231
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:35,287
He's called a puppeteer.

232
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:37,539
He's killed two people
on these streets,

233
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,416
and he's about to kill a third.

234
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,084
Tomorrow you'll find
the crime scene

235
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,711
and receive
your background dossiers.

236
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:47,006
By 0800 on Monday, I want
a full profile of this suspect.

237
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,050
I want to know who he is,
what he does,

238
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,010
and where he's gonna do it next.

239
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,846
I'm asking Special Agent Reston
to be team leader

240
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,556
unless you'd like to defer.

241
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,390
No, Harris.

242
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,601
I will solve whatever sick,
twisted crime scenario

243
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,727
you come up with.

244
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:01,937
I hope so.

245
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,690
What's the tank for?

246
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,484
The Navy uses it
to simulate Arctic regions.

247
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:11,154
That's what the nitrogers for.

248
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:14,657
In general, if it says
"military," don't touch it.

Oh.
Great.

250
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,495
Navy humor.

251
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,085
The computers are loaded
with ViCAP,

252
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,461
but they're fully firewalled.

253
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:31,339
Don't do any research offsite.

254
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:35,384
If you want to do any
blood samples on the autorad,

analyze fibers...
scout samples...

You'll rest up here

Downstairs, there's
a fully stocked freezer,

00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,355
bunks, and your showers.

260
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:51,482
Don't forget.
You're 50 miles offshore.

261
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:55,152
If you run out of toilet paper,
you are shit out of luck.

So, what's the point?

Sorry, Detective?

264
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:00,115
The island, the middle of
nowhere, they're professionals.

265
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:01,158
What's the point?

266
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:06,037
The point is that they're
isolated, alone, and forgotten.

267
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,791
That's what it's like to be
inside the mind of a sociopath.

Have you noticed it's
a really bad feeling here?

Why, though?

Did you catch some killer
in Philly or something?

286
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:28,905
What's the deal?

287
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,449
You don't want to know
my war stories.

Well, actually, I do.

I mean, right now,

290
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:37,705
what do we know
about you for real?

291
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,957
We know he's got resentments
toward his parents,

292
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:43,293
as per the overload on tattoos
he's got there.

293
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:45,587
We know he's just out
of a bad relationship.

He's barely looked twice
at me and Sara.

Maybe you're not my type,

Trust me, I'm your type.

We also know
he watches his words.

299
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:02,102
So that crossword's either
a sign of honing a talent

300

or correcting a deficiency.

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,480
What you say about me
doesn't tell you about me.

It tells me about you.

your little gambling

I see you're feeding the ducks.

Maybe we could feed the ducks
together.

Is he right?

334

I lost both my parents.

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,259
So I grew up living real hard.

00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,817
I've got her.

488
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,319
Back the fuck off!
I'll handle it!

489
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,409
It's okay.

490
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,120
You're out of the water,
all right? You're out.

491
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:01,496
Aah!

492
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:05,000
All right.
You're out of the water.

493
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:08,836
- You're okay.
- What's her thing with water?

494
00:34:11,297 --> 00:34:13,049
I think I lost my smokes.

495
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:17,469
Harris brought us
to this island.

496
00:34:17,553 --> 00:34:20,514
Now we're not allowed to leave.

497
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:23,183
- Let's talk about this Harris.
- [Coughing]

498
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:25,185
Harris wouldn't do this.

499
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:27,604
You can say what you want,
but Harris is a company man.

500
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:31,065
Did anyone actually see him
get back in that chopper?

501
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:32,900
Oh, tell me
somebody witnessed that.

502
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,361
Maybe he got tired
of the simulations.

503
00:34:35,444 --> 00:34:37,905
Missed the taste
of the real thing.

504
00:34:39,865 --> 00:34:42,117
I'll give him a taste
of the real thing.

505
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,452
Did he just pull
that gun out of his arse?

506
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:48,039
We werert supposed to
bring weapons.

507
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:49,916
My gun goes where I go.

508
00:34:49,999 --> 00:34:52,793
If you get shot sometime,
maybe you'll understand.

509
00:34:52,835 --> 00:34:55,421
You shouldn't have brought
your weapon, Vince.

510
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,215
You're gonna be glad I did.

511
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:10,143
Two square miles at most.

512
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:13,020
Hey.
Check this out.

513
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,732
Who wants to play
some hide-and-seek?

514
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,902
Anyone else is on this island,

515
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:22,988
Harris or worse,
we're gonna find them.

516
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:26,032
How's about your Navy?

517
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:28,242
They don't muck around, do they?

518
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,420
GABE:
Damn cats.

519

[Thunder crashes]

520
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:07,904
Aah! Aah!

521
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:10,948
Oh, for the love of God,
just take the arm.

522
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,996
There. There.
That's the Lucas I know.

523
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:20,165
You want to get up
and do it all over again.

524
00:36:20,165 --> 00:36:22,209
Are you all right?

525
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:23,543
Yeah.
I told you I'm fine.

526
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:25,086
Yeah, you told me, but...

527
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,130
As long as people aren't
asking me if I'm all right,

528
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,965
I'm all right.

529
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,593
So can I ask you
something else, then?

530
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:35,512
Anything else.

531
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:37,931
Well, since the end
may be near here,

532
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:41,268
have you kind of always
sort of had a thing for me?

533
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:47,148
Aah!

534
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,442
[Laughs]

535
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,235
Is that a no?

536
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:56,115
20 minutes of 12:00.

537
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:08,626
So at 12:00
someone else is killed?

538
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:11,295
Somebody left those watches.

539
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:13,089
And left them
after Harris had gone.

540
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:15,591
Where is this killer?
We searched the island.

541
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:17,760
Somebody set that trap.

542
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:19,219
Somebody rigged that boat.

543
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,680
So what are we saying?

544
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,431
This is some kind of game?

545
00:37:23,515 --> 00:37:26,810
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

546
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:29,062
Who's the next motherfucker
to go?

547
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,190
It's 12:00.

548
00:37:33,232 --> 00:37:34,984
It's 12:00,
and we're still here!

549
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:37,194
We're still here,
and it's 12:00, and...

550
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:39,196
Shut up, Vince.

551
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:40,781
All right. Look.

552
00:37:40,947 --> 00:37:43,158
We know that there
is a killer on the island.

553
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,368
Someone who knows
what we're here for,

554
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:46,953
someone who knows where we'd be.

555
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:48,955
There's just one problem.

556
00:37:48,955 --> 00:37:52,291
There's no one
on the island but us.

557
00:37:57,171 --> 00:37:58,881
Now, hold on.

558
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:01,383
Real slow.

559
00:38:01,508 --> 00:38:03,468
Real easy like.

560
00:38:03,468 --> 00:38:07,138
Let's all move our hands
away from our weapons.

- You get on the ground.
- Lucas.

562
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,019
I'm checking the rooms.
I find this... by his bed.

563
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,230
It's maps of the island,
the building, everything here.

564
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:17,981
Been doing some research
on the place?

565
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:20,901
- I can goddamn explain.
- You can get on the ground!

566
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:24,362
This is a military facility!
No one has access to this stuff!

- No one leaves this room.
- Since when is this room safe?

00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:45,882
Since we're all in it.

Son of a bitch.

813
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:23,992
So how about me, huh?

814
00:54:25,952 --> 00:54:28,121
How about me?!
Is it my fucking time?!

815
00:54:28,162 --> 00:54:30,289
Right here, right now!

816
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,292
Who fucking wants it?!

817
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:36,086
It was you who said
to turn off the water.

818
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:51,058
Yeah, whatever
makes you feel better.

[Faucet turns off]

821
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:03,361
Sara?

822
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:07,532
I don't think any of us
should be alone right now.

823
00:55:07,657 --> 00:55:08,741
Okay?

824
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,537
Nic found another watch.

825
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:21,086
We've got an hour and a half.

826
00:55:22,754 --> 00:55:24,464
VINCE:
So what's with the jackets?

827
00:55:24,506 --> 00:55:27,133
If it's a message,
what's the order?

828
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:28,885
The order we're dying in?

829
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,804
J.D., Rafe, Bobby.
Which letters were theirs?

830
00:55:31,846 --> 00:55:33,681
That wouldn't work.
These were traps.

831
00:55:33,806 --> 00:55:35,307
They could've killed
any one of us.

832
00:55:35,391 --> 00:55:38,602
How about the order
we signed up with the bureau?

833
00:55:38,644 --> 00:55:39,937
Who here had seniority?

834
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:41,688
J.D., then Bobby.

835
00:55:41,688 --> 00:55:42,939
- Then me.
- Then me.

836
00:55:43,148 --> 00:55:45,692
LUCAS:
Cro...

00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:54,158
Crotone?

839
00:55:54,158 --> 00:55:57,119
Crotone, Croato, Croa...

840
00:55:57,286 --> 00:55:58,704
Might as well pick them
at random.

841
00:55:58,912 --> 00:56:00,497
VINCE:
Croatoan.

842
00:56:00,664 --> 00:56:04,292
Like the island, the colony.

843
00:56:05,585 --> 00:56:06,836
Do you know where we are?

844
00:56:06,836 --> 00:56:09,839
Near the Outer Banks
of North Carolina?

845
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:11,090
It's one of the first sites

846
00:56:11,215 --> 00:56:14,593
settled by the Europeans
in the New World.

847
00:56:14,718 --> 00:56:17,763
In the 16th century,
there was a ship of settlers

848
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:19,598
who landed right around here,

849
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,767
sent to colonize
the place for England.

850
00:56:22,851 --> 00:56:26,729
They built their town
on Roanoke Island.

851
00:56:26,855 --> 00:56:29,732
Over 100 people.

852
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:32,485
Two years later,
a supply ship sailed in...

853
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,904
only to find
that the colony had vanished

854
00:56:35,904 --> 00:56:38,282
without a trace.

855
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:42,494
No bodies, no papers,
no evidence of anything.

856
00:56:44,245 --> 00:56:47,248
Over 100 people.

857
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:49,042
Gone.

858
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:53,796
And the only thing left
was a single word

859
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:56,256
found carved in a tree.

860
00:56:57,383 --> 00:56:59,009
Croatoan.

861
00:57:01,386 --> 00:57:02,888
What was Croatoan?

862
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:04,389
Some said a body of water.

863
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:06,558
Others said an Indian tribe.

864
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:09,936
Point is, is 500 years later,

865
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:12,688
we still don't know
where those people have gone.

866
00:57:12,688 --> 00:57:14,690
That's the message.

867
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,694
An island full
of people vanish forever.

868
00:57:18,694 --> 00:57:20,487
And it happened here.

869
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,365
The killer isn't after the FBI.

870
00:57:23,448 --> 00:57:25,867
He's after infamy.

871
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,871
It troubles me
that you know this story.

872
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:32,707
It'd trouble you more
if I didn't.

873
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:36,835
All right, we know method,
we know motive.

874
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,506
All that's missing now
is where he made his mistake.

875
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:25,713
Got something.

876
00:58:39,309 --> 00:58:40,644
We've got blood.

877
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:42,687
Under Rafe's nails.

878
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:46,065
He struggled with the killer.
We got to run it past autorad.

879
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:49,485
What are you staring at?

880

NICOLE: I do. We can have
a DNA match in under an hour.

883
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,957
We've only got
less than an hour.

884
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,168
We'll need blood comparisons
from each of us...

885
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,921
unless anyone
has a problem with that.

your money on now?

Not sure my money
would go anywhere different.

you'd be down there.

Well, let me enlighten you. You
know there's a bomb on a boat.

I don't go anywhere

She wouldn't.
Not Sara.

That's why she planned it
for the island.

01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:13,102
She wanted us dead
and underwater,

so we'd suffer.

till the trap.

- No, you tell me!

Nic? Think about it.

Suspecting each other,
fighting each other.

This is what makes it fun.

964

You in the killer's mind again?

01:04:10,863 --> 01:04:12,782

from any of us.

01:29:45,895 --> 01:29:49,357
And Harris
just had to stay and watch.

1299
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:53,319
Party crasher here was more
of a problem than I thought,

1300
01:29:53,319 --> 01:29:56,864
but why am I gonna work
so hard to kill him

1301
01:29:56,905 --> 01:29:58,865
when I knew you'd do it for me?

1302
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:04,996
You see, the water
ain't your only weakness, Sara.

1303
01:30:05,038 --> 01:30:07,040
[Shuddering]

1304
01:30:09,292 --> 01:30:11,460
Your other weakness...

1305
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,003
is me.

1306
01:30:40,821 --> 01:30:43,114
In truth, I couldn't have
done it without you.

1307
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:45,116
As a sign of my appreciation,
I'm gonna grant you

1308
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,451
your deepest desire.

1309
01:30:46,534 --> 01:30:50,997
I'm gonna get you closer to your
sister than you ever imagined.

1310
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:57,794
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi.

1311
01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:06,135
- Are we having fun yet?
- [Gasping]

1312
01:31:09,889 --> 01:31:11,015
Whoa.

1313
01:31:24,903 --> 01:31:26,654
[Chuckling]

1314
01:31:30,992 --> 01:31:32,660
[Gasps]

1315
01:33:03,535 --> 01:33:04,744
[Gasps]

1316
01:33:24,304 --> 01:33:25,597
Drop it!

1317
01:33:29,517 --> 01:33:31,811
Go ahead, Sara.
Arrest me.

1318
01:33:33,771 --> 01:33:36,940
We have your blood
under Rafe's fingernails.

1319
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:40,360
Your fingerprints
on the fire extinguisher.

1320
01:33:40,444 --> 01:33:42,946
And your bullet in my neck.

1321
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,157
That don't look good.

1322
01:33:47,742 --> 01:33:49,494
You're fucked.

1323
01:33:52,913 --> 01:33:54,331
[Ticking]

1324
01:33:54,999 --> 01:33:57,417
- [Gasps]
- Time's up, asshole.

1325
01:34:21,148 --> 01:34:23,441
Good thing you hit like a girl.

1326
01:34:31,907 --> 01:34:34,493
I guess we found out
his weakness.

1327
01:34:35,494 --> 01:34:37,287
Bullets.

1328
01:34:48,381 --> 01:34:50,299
[Helicopter blades whirring]

1329
01:35:05,897 --> 01:35:07,940
Do you think they'll let me
make profiler?

1330
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:11,402
That depends.
One last question.

1331
01:35:12,695 --> 01:35:16,281
Whers the situation secure,
Agent?

1332
01:35:17,116 --> 01:35:18,700
On the drive home.

1333
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,035
Yeah.

1334
01:35:20,911 --> 01:35:22,495
On the drive home.

1335
01:35:38,497 --> 01:35:43,797
