And the second thing he never - angry

122
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,120
crazy mother -

123

! Dear director -

Do not talk about my mother -
Why Is Mother India? -

125
00:13:34,786 --> 00:13:39,987
I will raise my hands on you -
You can raise your hand on, but not on a woman -

126
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,020
Puente Ahmina -

127

is that your mother crazy

128

We will kill Grover is not it? -

130
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:19,584
Not -

131
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:21,017
No, Jack -

132
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:22,584
Why? -

133
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:25,850
Charlie you do not want to kill who destroyed our lives -

134
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,350
if Uncle Mnohr your father is -
was not less than a father to me

135
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,117
but because of that bastard was put in prison -
to the present day

136
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,950
Eight years -

137
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:39,651
eight years and I'm waiting -
I am also waiting for the past eight years, my Jack -

138
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:43,768
but the timing, timing everything -

139
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:47,067
Charlie told me once how -
I access Grover only?

140
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:49,708
If my goal was to kill him for you, and I ended up killing him -

141
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,207
eight years ago and I Olahakh shadowed -
everywhere in London, Berlin, Vienna

142
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:55,408
Paris, New York, everywhere -

143
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:00,151
If you want to Grover was dead and 7 times -
... but Jack O

144
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:03,951
death punishment small for him -

145
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:10,585
justice will be when asked to die and will not get it -

146
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:16,984
Justice will destroy it as much as when We have destroyed -

147
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:18,339
So why the delay Hey Charlie -

148
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,806
! I'm here and you're here, what are we waiting for after -

149
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:21,639
not -

150
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,606
It is not a revenge for me and you just -

151
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:25,773
it was revenge for three people -

152
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:30,239
You mean that we come to Charya -
for Jack -

153
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,873
This revenge would not be complete without it -
But Charlie - Jack -

154
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:35,139
we wait for the right time -

155
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:40,205
Charya our friend -

156
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:03,639
Tammy Iranian in fifty years of age and live -
Parsees in the neighborhood and is the best of the best decoder cabinets

157
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,205

171
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:21,093
and to disrupt the security package inside -

187
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,052
and is for a period of just 30 seconds -

188
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,619

00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:40,105
In fact, this footprint vaguely one person -

316
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:41,638
of thumb? -

317
00:26:41,872 --> 00:26:43,571
Thumb this -

318
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,838
Vicky Grover son Chern Grover -

319
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,339
Vicky Grover -
Yes -

320
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,406
"Vicky Grover"

321
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:50,972
"Vicky Grover"

322
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:53,997
Peter I would not care so, Go -
Well -

323
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:56,897
Come on, Charlie What is this silly joke -

324
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,630
Come Tammy reaction exaggeration does not show up, I have a plan -

325
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:02,298
you have a plan, then you will come Vickie Grover -

326
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:04,630
actually for -

327
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:06,298
they saw something like this -

328
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:13,565
chanting, Radhey, Radhey -

329
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,231
= = live Alknhillal -

330
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:18,764
Radhey, Radhey
"chanted live Alknhillal

331
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:22,630
NAND harasser and, mind Almottagrthm -

332
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:51,231
brought syrup NAND guys -

333
00:28:11,597 --> 00:28:15,431
give you Vicky Grover any NAND harasser -

334
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:18,164
What is this, a Doreen? -

335
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,764
Oh my God, this is like a movie -

336
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:23,298
NAND harasser and his mind Almottagrthm -

337
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:24,831
and where I found it? -

338
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:26,997
I've seen in the past year in Ramallah at night -

339
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:28,498
he performed the role of Hanuman -

340
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:32,095
I saw Ram night once and got a gift Age -

341
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:34,932
blessed -
Burktm, Burktm -

342
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,732
you know two basic things for NAND harasser -

343
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:53,899
The first thing that can be vomiting at any moment -

344
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:56,121
! Can fluctuate at any moment -
Is fluent in gymnastics?

345
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,856
Not fluctuate, vomiting -

346
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,226
, and the second thing -

347
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:04,259
The second thing they have seen for yourselves -

348
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,725
! No, not NAND -

349
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:38,226
It's a waste of time guys how we can make use of it? -

350
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:39,126
Sabotage the whole -

351
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:41,026
plan without it there is no plan -

352
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:44,335
if we want access to Shalimar, we need to face this -

353
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:45,968
for this -

354
00:29:46,873 --> 00:29:49,773
I mean the guys we needed -

355
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,440
Nhrrh -
not Nhrrh, - but we did not edit it -

356
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,040
see how he screwed up and unconscious -

357
00:29:55,473 --> 00:29:57,806
Why do you think he will risk his life? -

358
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:01,607
Never -
is certainly has no motive -

359
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:04,307
"Charlie"
No motive is not a crime

360
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:08,073
Above all, it is useless and smell bad too -

361
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:11,073
and of a man who Christolh Forest -
to a man of the upper class?

362
00:30:11,273 --> 00:30:16,040
Charlie heard about many operations -
but this case there is no process for treatment

363
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,773
Tammy -

364
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,073
not process without having money -

365
00:30:23,944 --> 00:30:28,044
know, in a year or two Sajma amount -

366
00:30:29,116 --> 00:30:31,316
But what about the timing of my NAND -

367
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,782
tumor in the brain mom will not wait two years -

368
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:41,483
... six months .. and that was delayed more than that, the -

369
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:49,431
Do not be afraid, you're not afraid NAND Sedber Money -

370
00:30:49,964 --> 00:30:52,031
NAND process will be to my mother -

371
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,631
NAND stop -
What do you do?

372
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:58,598
O society jar suspended in the air -

373
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:01,713
NAND I will break the jar -

374
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:04,579
Saxrha -

375
00:31:11,525 --> 00:31:15,124
Poor NAND mother infected tumor -

376
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:17,530
But guys found motivation -

377
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:20,829
mother -

378
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:22,330
process in toast motivation guys -

379
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:24,263
toast in NAND -

380
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:28,996
team diamonds -

381
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:34,875
drunkard all the time, an old retarded, a pistol and shot full of enfant terrible

382
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:40,242
Have chosen them carefully to the task of Charlie's Angels Charlie -

383
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:49,142
It's old and Rstna we were working here -

384
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,142
O Jack knew this machine? -

385
00:31:52,242 --> 00:31:54,710
Something incredible, man everything as it was, nothing has changed -

386
00:31:55,602 --> 00:31:58,202
... The story of the destruction of Chern Grover should start from -

387
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:01,502
place left where devastating -

388
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:04,369
and we will start work today -

389
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:06,635
But what we do here? -

390
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:11,001
Exercises -

391
00:32:12,235 --> 00:32:15,901
exercises biggest theft in the world -

392
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:26,035
This  -

393
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:36,240
hello to the Shalimar -

394
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:40,076
gentlemen hello to the Shalimar -

395
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:44,276
first information Cordor Shalimar inform him Extension 100 feet -

396
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:48,877
we have a special type and commandos are black cats -

397
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,942
Who kill first and will later -

398
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:55,810
these commandos holders -
courses in the Mossad and sufficient G

399
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:58,830
and through Alchorodor enter NAND -

400
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:00,329
why! What? -

401
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:06,095
Do I and smelting of these wrestlers to greet me and call me enter -

402
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:09,995
not assimilation but Saznonk Vicky Grover -

403
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:12,696
What do you mean? - Tammy
-

404
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:15,129
son Charn Grover -

405
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,262
Oh my God! Second -

406
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:24,162
mirror image - a dish similar to

407
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:28,095
But how it happened, my father did not go to Dubai never -

408
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:31,896
perhaps his father came to India -

409
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,496
... perhaps already - hey

410
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:40,638
This electronic security circle -

411
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:44,238
This lock does not only opens footprint thumb one person -

412
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:49,104
... And this person is -
Grover, Vicky Grover -

413
00:33:49,716 --> 00:33:51,082
key Shalimar -

414
00:33:51,284 --> 00:33:53,384
How are you, my father, Are you in good health? -

415
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:02,861
And how we will get imprint Vicky Grover? -

416
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:04,861
This is not a big problem -

417
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:09,794
Big problem, how we will make NAND -
seems like Vicky Grover

418
00:34:12,872 --> 00:34:14,605
Mission: Impossible -

419
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:26,006
What a big safe -

420
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:29,438
The Shalimar is real love Tammy -

421
00:34:33,326 --> 00:34:36,960
true love -

422
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:40,459
Shalimar -

423
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:44,826
We both -

424
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,860
Mstacan -

425
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:51,493
eyes -

426
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,159
nine and forty USB -

427
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,760
seven Sai Case -

428
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:58,092
circle 45

429
00:34:58,818 --> 00:35:01,618
in the original Shalimar no casing of the laser -

430
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:03,318
and that its strength in 1200 volts -

431
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:11,084
PIN number for this atmosphere changed daily -

432
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:12,818
Is changed daily -

433
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:22,851
and stop of the electric atmosphere? -

434
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:24,217
Dad? -

435
00:35:24,551 --> 00:35:25,818
But he did not go to Dubai never -

436
00:35:26,052 --> 00:35:28,217
hey do not remember my father -
Cool guys -

437
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:32,149
laser, computer task - cover

438
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:40,683
So gentlemen, these are the months safe in the world -
It Shalimar

439
00:35:41,116 --> 00:35:43,984
It works on 11 crore mobile gear -

440
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,650
K 11 crore -

441
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:47,183
... if we start today -

442
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,717
expire until 350 years open -

443
00:35:53,883 --> 00:35:55,149
Although it will not open -

444
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:11,855
Mr. Gupta prefer and check please -

445
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:21,321
permission to open Shalimar spend 350 years -

446
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:24,421
... but you are not your only -
five minutes -

447
00:36:25,221 --> 00:36:27,688
to open this treasurers have only 5 minutes -

448
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:31,521
... And if we do not take the diamonds and get out of the Treasury during the 5 minutes -
! What the -

449
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,989
close the door automatically and will cover the laser to put it back -

450
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,850
Go back to back a little, please, thank you -
Come back to back

451
00:36:42,188 --> 00:36:44,320
words, even if someone infiltration and arrived here -

452
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:47,821
can not get out -

453
00:36:48,895 --> 00:36:51,462
Mr. Gupta There oxygen -

454
00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:53,528
just tried to breathe -

455
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:58,295
As you have seen will not output - can
Masatkm of Shalimar Suai I

456
00:36:58,695 --> 00:37:01,395
and believe me I am not a thief? -

457
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:08,328
And you know the way out of here -
and there is no way to enter only this

458
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:09,495
no way -

459
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:14,261
By not only teach him a Grover -

460
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:15,628
any way? -

461
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:20,862
Shalimar is 150 feet below the earth from Atlantis -

462
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:24,395
here and there of the Atlantis -

463
00:37:24,464 --> 00:37:25,330
drainage system ! Exchange -

464
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:27,565
exchange means Albulaah -

465
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:28,932
And is not stink like you -

466
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:32,832
Shalimar weak point is the large atmospheric pressure -

467
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:33,898
sense? -

468
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:36,698
Air - compressed
-

469
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:39,565
for ventilation and there was a tube here for conditioning -

470
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:43,398
And not one of its extensions still exist even -
and now that link to Shalimar

471
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:45,965
Tammy and I'll get to the end of this channel -

472
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:49,732
O NAND and you will open this plate -

473
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:50,832
How? -

474
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:55,358
This Alzenbaraka -
I mean, my key NAND

475
00:37:56,226 --> 00:37:59,959
It contains special Ntwat and is - what will make
plate opens easily

476
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:02,135
Oh my God, and from where I got this? -

477
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,168
Among the thousands of hands that participated in Shalimar industry -

478
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:17,634
My hands were one of them -

479
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:21,068
which were drawn destruction Grover -

480
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:28,235
scheme amazing Charlie O thou, O man of genius -

481
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:33,334
Well -
Thank NAND

482
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:34,934
Wait -
Why? -

483
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:38,901
O Charlie told me how I'll get you to and behind the plate -

484
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:41,467
'll get to the plate through the ventilation channel -

485
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,501
See, the channel starts from here until you reach the top here -

486
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:49,834
This place drainage pipes for ventilation -

487
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:54,168
but now has been changed to recreational rooms -
for Titles and live panoramas

488
00:38:54,467 --> 00:39:00,300
And a ventilation duct and one slot is present here -
when Shalimar and ending in this room

489
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:01,501
and vent one is present here -
when Shalimar and ending in this room

490
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,168
There are 539 rooms in Atlantis -

491
00:39:05,868 --> 00:39:08,834
But there is no way to get to the Shalimar only this room -

492
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:12,369
C9 Room -

493
00:39:14,207 --> 00:39:19,640
good, we will go in and reserve -
this room and go directly to the Shalimar

494
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,406
true is not it -

495
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:23,916
Yes -

496
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,851
In reality is not so simple Hey Tammy -

497
00:39:29,422 --> 00:39:32,922
C9 what is happening is that the room -
previously reserved

498
00:39:33,223 --> 00:39:35,922
reserved? And 6 months ago? -
Yes -

499
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:41,122
No, not exactly so -
brother Charlie, I understand -

500
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:45,689
What happened to us the other team plans and room booking -

501
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:49,689
Do not worry I will talk to them and tell them Do -
Sttkasemon us half and half or told police

502
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:51,822
No No, this room can not be booked -

503
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,289
If those are reserved? -

504
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,256
I told you, O man, it's a green room -

505
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:58,089
whether green or black in color as we entered -

506
00:39:58,755 --> 00:40:00,189
Are we going to spend the honeymoon? -

507
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:01,989
Dear Charlie -

508
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:04,056
What's up? -

509
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:07,223
What to hide from us? -

510
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:09,355
Nothing, man -

511
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:12,488
absolutely nothing -
Well I'll tell you

512
00:40:12,622 --> 00:40:14,856

WDC

515
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:28,068
and if we want to get this room, we have to share the -
WDC

516
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,001
That's all -

517

521

523
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,015

but we did not listen too well

524
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:48,848
What did you say? -

525
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:49,782

Small dance contest, but this is not everything -

542
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:28,949
Do you think we are stupid? -

543
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:32,182
This is not a small dance contest, but a global dance contest -

00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:36,881
O genius! Why did not you tell us before? -

569
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:37,982
Behold, I tell you now -

00:47:45,518 --> 00:47:47,484
Charlie've told you that we can not dance -

590
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:49,354
would have been better for me to stay in the army -

591
00:47:49,722 --> 00:47:51,255
He wants to make us like "Michael Jackson -

592
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:54,722
We do a presentation on the stage after two weeks -
and you do not know to do something

593
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:57,088
and you know where you fool -

594
00:47:57,154 --> 00:47:58,121
those who say foolish? -

595
00:47:58,188 --> 00:48:00,555
All the time and you dance like a snake breeder -

596
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,166
Is it a wedding and your father? -

597
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:03,133

598

00:48:07,335 --> 00:48:08,035
Began again -

601

What do you do? -
What do you do you? -

602
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:10,168
Calm down -

603
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:11,302
No one is going to do something -

604
00:48:12,078 --> 00:48:13,111
Rohan, who is going to do everything -

605
00:48:13,345 --> 00:48:14,412
less pain you that it will be ordered to vote? -

606
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:15,512
We will lose -

607
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:17,512
Do not worry for the dance -

608
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:19,845
In fact there is no worry -

609
00:48:20,378 --> 00:48:25,311
because the number of participating teams and large -
have been developed for the Commission to accept the first phase

610
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,445
We will not accept any mistake tonight -

611
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:29,645
this competition is not a joke -

612
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:30,745
we will choose from is the best -

613
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:32,378
Km ready to face -

614
00:48:33,612 --> 00:48:36,378
.... oh the boys -
attaché my friends

615
00:48:40,944 --> 00:48:42,911
Please look-out image -

616
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,978
do not like to hit me a -

617
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:47,645
... was the first person I want to hit him Son of the

618
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:50,011
Forget it, my uncle -
This can not be done -

619
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:52,645
Take Antqamk him completely -

620
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:57,278
brother Charlie has understood the subject of theft -

621
00:48:58,245 --> 00:49:01,445
But why ignite the fires of revenge from you? - I did not understand this

622
00:49:02,178 --> 00:49:03,944
There is a story behind it, right? -

623
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:05,196
True -

624
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,996
this story sparklers -

625
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,630
And all revolve around a bunch full of Diamonds -

626
00:49:21,797 --> 00:49:24,763
Mnohr father Charlie and I were working together -

627
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:27,150
not just colleagues at work, but we were friends -

628
00:49:27,818 --> 00:49:31,851
Not like facebook friends do not -
remember some of them only on Friday

629
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:33,317
but real friends -

630
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:37,083
and not friends, we were like family -

631
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:43,484

1736
02:08:37,398 --> 02:08:39,064
I lost everything in one - day

1737
02:08:40,464 --> 02:08:46,897
Day and I knew that luck like mad dog -
you can turn at any time

1738
02:08:48,398 --> 02:08:52,997
and change the fortune of the day Charn Grover became the goal of my life -

1739
02:08:54,264 --> 02:08:57,631
And why did you think Stsjn -
and Troy for your father this story?

1740
02:08:58,631 --> 02:08:59,598
Why will say then? -

1741
02:09:01,897 --> 02:09:03,364
Bravo, you have done well, my son -

1742
02:09:08,665 --> 02:09:09,764
My father is not in prison -

1743
02:09:10,164 --> 02:09:11,730
! Mnohr not in prison -

1744
02:09:12,531 --> 02:09:13,298
Where is then? -

1745
02:09:14,398 --> 02:09:16,231
Dad tried to appeal to the Supreme Court -

1746
02:09:17,031 --> 02:09:20,298
But Charn Grover had bought a lawyer -

1747
02:09:22,131 --> 02:09:23,565
... has been hidden evidence and -

1748
02:09:25,531 --> 02:09:26,764
dad lost the case -

1749
02:09:27,997 --> 02:09:32,331
It is said that man can live -
without bread for four days

1750
02:09:32,897 --> 02:09:34,131
and four days without Water -

1751
02:09:34,722 --> 02:09:36,855
And without air for maybe four minutes -

1752
02:09:39,289 --> 02:09:44,822
... but without hope can not live for four seconds -

1753
02:09:47,223 --> 02:09:49,356
but my father showed a lot of courage Hey Tammy -

1754
02:09:50,122 --> 02:09:51,122
24 hours -

1755
02:09:51,789 --> 02:09:54,556
the next day and found his body in the prison -

1756
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:58,822
I do not know where he got a piece of the knife -

1757
02:10:09,855 --> 02:10:13,656
"Charlie"
Mnohr died and you tell us today

1758
02:10:14,623 --> 02:10:17,089
I was afraid of that weaken Qguakm -

1759
02:10:18,122 --> 02:10:20,156
should have been revenge -
of Charn Grover still existing

1760
02:10:21,102 --> 02:10:23,302
Revenge and needs to be defended Hey Tammy -

1761
02:10:25,135 --> 02:10:27,736
If there is no motive, there would not be a crime -
Tammy is not it?

1762
02:10:28,502 --> 02:10:30,535
After hearing this became defended weakness -

1763
02:10:31,402 --> 02:10:34,002
Grover, Grover, Grover, will not escape us never -

1764
02:10:34,068 --> 02:10:35,469
I Saguetlh -
No Tammy does not -

1765
02:10:35,535 --> 02:10:36,868
I will not leave him Hey Charlie -

1766
02:10:37,636 --> 02:10:39,002
... I want -
No No Hey Jack -

1767
02:10:39,269 --> 02:10:40,835
our vengeance for his death -

1768
02:10:41,455 --> 02:10:44,155
is not completed did not know how to freshen up My father -

1769
02:10:45,488 --> 02:10:46,755
him to taste death every day -

1770
02:10:47,288 --> 02:10:49,088
Here in Dubai jails -

1771
02:10:50,622 --> 02:10:51,888
aggravating law here -

1772
02:10:52,622 --> 02:10:55,188
cut off the hands of thieves in such thefts -

1773
02:10:55,689 --> 02:10:56,588
Think about it a little bit -

1774
02:10:56,722 --> 02:11:01,188
when arrested on charges of Grover -
! What will happen to the diamond theft by

1775
02:11:02,155 --> 02:11:04,055
Will not have a hand even Aaht by -

1776
02:11:04,755 --> 02:11:05,821
and will not have boots for walking on the ground -

1777
02:11:06,622 --> 02:11:09,921
This will be punished, and so would be of Justice -

1778
02:11:10,921 --> 02:11:13,188
true your words and your judgment is correct -

1779
02:11:15,055 --> 02:11:16,821
For me, It's not just steal -

1780
02:11:18,888 --> 02:11:20,255
It Ashour my father -

1781
02:11:21,088 --> 02:11:22,689
which I have not done since eight years -

1782
02:11:22,954 --> 02:11:27,655
even if I got the spirit to stop me I will not retract -

1783
02:11:28,622 --> 02:11:29,488
I Sanfz plan -

1784
02:11:30,288 --> 02:11:34,288
But if any of you would like to back down there is nothing wrong -
