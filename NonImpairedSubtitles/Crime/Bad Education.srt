1
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,900
"The current spell of icy weather
has claimed its first victim.

2
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,500
A motorcyclist froze to death
on Highway 4

3
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,400
and drove for a further 90 km
after he was dead.

4
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,900
Two patrolmen flagged him down

5
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,800
and as he didn't react
they pursued him.

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
They drove alongside

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,700
and rebuked him for his attitude.

8
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,500
As he didn't move
they realized something was wrong."

9
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
It seems incredible.

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,600
It's a wonderful image.

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,300
A dead young man drives
his motorcycle across the icy plain,

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,500
escorted by two patrolmen.

13
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
Where was he going
in that icy dawn?

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,600
To see someone who couldn't wait
until the morning.

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,100
There's a story here!

16
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,300
I'll cut it out and keep it,
it might inspire me.

17
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
I'll get it.

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,600
Hello.

19
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Hello. What is it?

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm an actor.
I'm looking for Enrique Goded.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He isn't here.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,500
But I can see him, man.

23
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
In any case,
we don't have any projects, so...

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,300
I'd like to speak to him.
We were old pals at school.

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm Ignacio Rodríguez.

26
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,300
All right, come in.

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,100
Thank you.

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,100
I don't think he'll see you.

29
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
That's all right.

30
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,500
Wait a minute.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
He's an actor, a nuisance!

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,700
I told him
we aren't preparing a film now.

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Tell him I'm not in.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,300
I did, but he saw you.

35
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,300
And I can see him.

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,100
He said he was
a friend of yours at school.

37
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,300
Who can he be?

38
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,800
Ignacio Rodríguez.

39
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
¿lgnacio?

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
It can't be!

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,500
That's what he said.

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,100
Ignacio, is it really you?

43
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,300
Of course, Enrique!

44
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,100
I'm delighted you remember me!

45
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,500
How could I forget you?

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,700
Well, it's been sixteen years.

47
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,500
That long?

48
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,500
More or less.

49
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
I wouldn't recognize you
with that beard.

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,800
You'd look better without it.
Come into my office.

51
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,300
You want a coffee?

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,100
No, thanks.

53
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm having one.

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,700
Then, yes.

55
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,800
Martín, will you make some coffee?

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,600
Yes.

57
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,300
Sit down.

58
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,900
What brings you here?

59
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,300
I came to ask for work.
I'm an actor.

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,700
I've brought you my resume.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,100
Bumblebee Group.

62
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,300
An independent theater company.

63
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,800
"El Retablillo de San Cristóbal"
by García Lorca,

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
"The Diary of Adam and Eve"
by Mark Twain...

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,200
Mark Twain, García Lorca...

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,500
Only the best
for the Bumblebee.

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Don't you write anymore?

68
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,300
No, I stopped ages ago.

69
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,100
But I've brought my last story.

70
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,100
"The Visit"

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
By the way, when are you starting
your next film?

72
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,100
Well...

73
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,500
I'll do anything.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,400
We're eyeing tabloids
to see if I can think of stories.

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,900
You've caught me
in a creative crisis.

76
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
That's a bummer!

77
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,100
Read my story,
it might give you some ideas.

78
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,300
What's it about?

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Our school.

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
One part is based
on our childhood,

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,300
and the other part isn't,
when the characters grow up.

82
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,200
That's fiction.

83
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
I haven't introduced you.
Ignacio, Martín.

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
Pleased to meet you.

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,000
Sugar and milk?

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,100
Yes, please.

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,200
By the way,
I don't call myself Ignacio anymore.

88
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,300
I'm Ángel.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,800
Why's that?

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
It's my stage name.

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,100
An actor can't be called
Ignacio Rodríguez.

92
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,300
He can't?

93
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,200
Of course not.

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,900
Ángel Andrade.

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,900
Everyone calls me that,
even my mother.

96
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,100
That's great.

97
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,500
Thank you.

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,900
Ignacio was..

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,900
Ángel.

100
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,200
Ignacio...

101
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,300
Ángel.

102
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,200
Well, Ignacio,
before he became Ángel,

103
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,100
was...
is an old school friend.

104
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,700
Martín is my production director.

105
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,000
and maid of all work.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,700
Well, Ignacio...

107
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,500
Ángel...

108
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,300
Right, Ángel.

109
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,700
I'm delighted to see you.

110
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
AS soon as I've got anything...

111
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Give me your number,
I'll call you.

112
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,100
I don't have a phone,
but I'll call you.

113
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,700
Should I leave you another photo?

114
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,100
No, don't worry.

115
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,700
Well, Ángel,
it was great seeing you.

116
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,700
So should I go?

117
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Yes, I think so.

118
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,000
Can't I help you cut out... ?

119
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
No, thanks a lot.

120
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,000
So long.

121
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
My pleasure.

122
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,300
You look great!

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,800
So do you.

124
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,500
Do read "The Visit"

125
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,100
Yes, I will.
I'm dying of curiosity.

126
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Great. See you.

127
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,100
I thought he'd never leave!

128
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
Is he really a friend of yours?

129
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,400
Yes.

130
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,600
I haven't seen him
since school.

131
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,600
We were really close.

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Well, he was my first love.

133
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,100
But he's changed a lot.

134
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,200
I didn't recognize him.

135
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,100
Will you see him again?

136
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,100
No.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,500
It seemed that you liked him.

138
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,000
No, there's nothing less erotic
than an actor looking for work.

139
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
"The Visit".

140
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,500
<i>Ever since we started touring
with the show "The Bomb"</i>

141
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,700
<i>I've been waiting for this moment.</i>

142
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,800
<i>Today we're playing in the town
where I went to school.</i>

143
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,700
<i>I won't mention its name
so as not to promote it.</i>

144
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,100
<i>I owe my best memories
to the Olympo Cinema,</i>

145
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,100
<i>which is now in ruins.</i>

146
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,100
Card.

147
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,300
I'm fucking sick of losing!

148
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Then clear off.

149
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Take a break.

150
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
She defines herself as

152
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
a mix of desert, hazard,

153
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,200
and cafeteria.

154
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,300
She's a great artiste

155
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,300
and a great friend of mine.

156
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,800
With all of you,

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,100
our next act,

158
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,500
the mystery

159
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,100
and the fascination

160
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,900
of the one and only,

161
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,300
the inimitable,

162
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Zahara!

163
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,200
A bit of applause
for Crissake!

164
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,900
So...

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,700
What?

166
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,000
Listen...

167
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
I'll see you at the hostel.

168
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,500
Yeah, but...

169
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,200
Paquito, you heard me.

170
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,700
You've got time
for everything, fag.

171
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,700
Monda!

172
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,500
Wait for me, love!

173
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,100
Hello.

174
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,400
Hello.

175
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
What's wrong?

176
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,400
I can't find my keys.

177
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,200
May I help you?

178
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,500
Sure.

179
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
No, they're not here.

180
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,700
Let's see.

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Not here either.

182
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,100
No?

183
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,000
No.

184
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,400
Here they are!

185
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,500
My lips are wearing out!

186
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,900
I drank too much.

187
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,500
You're telling me.

188
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,700
Hey!
I'm sucking your dick!

189
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,100
He's out cold!

190
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
A kid.

191
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Not a cent.

192
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,300
A lottery ticket.
I'll keep that.

193
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
Don't start the engine
right outside.

194
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,100
But he's passed out!
Well hung, isn't he?

195
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,200
He's not bad.

196
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,600
And look, he's still hard!

197
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,900
Love,

198
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,700
let me suck him off a bit.

199
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,600
No, you've got things to do.

200
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,100
You've been at him for hours.
Look at your lip!

201
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,000
Come on,
the bike won't run away.

202
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Shut up!
Now, go hide the bike.

203
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,100
Hurry back, I'll see you
in your room before 7:00.

204
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,000
Sure, I get all the dirty work
and you have all the fun.

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,700
Now you get a hard-on,
asshole!

206
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,000
It's not fair!

207
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,900
Enrique Serrano!

208
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Enrique!

209
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,700
Paquito!

210
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Come up here!

211
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,700
What about the bike?

212
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,500
Leave it there.
Come up.

213
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,800
There's nothing like
loading up on drugs

214
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,600
and hormones

215
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,000
to end up
as crazy as you, bitch.

216
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
The keys!
We're not stealing the bike!

217
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,900
Why not?
We've got a buyer.

218
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,100
I'll explain later.
I'll meet you at the mass.

219
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,500
So we're going to the school?

220
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
yes, now more than ever.

221
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,900
I'm flipping out, bitch!

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,600
I bet you are.

223
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,500
<i>Dear Enrique,
It's me, Ignacio.</i>

224
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
<i>I've dreamed so much
of this moment!</i>

225
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,100
<i>Years have gone by
but I've never forgotten you.</i>

226
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,000
<i>We have to meet again,
but when you're not drunk.</i>

227
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,400
<i>I want to tell you about my life
and hear about yours</i>

228
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,000
<i>while we eat a cream cake
in the Mallol Patisserie,</i>

229
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
<i>like when we got out of school
on weekends.</i>

230
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,400
<i>I'm not going
to complicate your life.</i>

231
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,500
<i>I know you're married
and have a child.</i>

232
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,300
<i>I know that
you live in the next town,</i>

233
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,500
<i>that you're broke
and that I'd like to help you.</i>

234
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,000
<i>Right now,
I'm working on something,</i>

235
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,100
<i>but i'll explain it all
in the patisserie.</i>

236
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
<i>I'll wait for you from 6:00 to 7:00.</i>

237
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
<i>Do come!</i>

238
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
<i>I adore you.</i>

239
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,100
<i>Ignacio.</i>

240
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,400
Yes?

241
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,700
<i>I miss you.</i>

242
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,400
<i>Have you unpacked
all the boxes?</i>

243
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,100
Not even half of them.

244
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,800
<i>Do you need a hand?
I don't mind, really.</i>

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,200
It's best if you don't, Martín.
Thanks.

246
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,100
Can I call you later?

247
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm reading.

248
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,400
<i>Oh, do forgive me.</i>

249
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,200
Don't be so fucking touchy!

250
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll call you in a while.

251
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,900
<i>Do that, even if it's late.</i>

252
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,600
We saw Sara's first films here.

253
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,100
And "Breakfast at Tiffany's".

254
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,700
Enrique and I groped each other
for the first time here.

255
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,100
My knees are trembling
just thinking about it.

256
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm meeting him at 6:00
in the patisserie.

257
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,100
Don't get your hopes up.
Remember, he's married.

258
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,600
If Father Manolo
hadn't separated us...

259
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,100
What's he got to do with it?

260
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,800
A lot, everything!

261
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,300
That priest owes me a lot
and it's time for him to pay.

262
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,200
I hate seeing you like this.

263
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,700
You got anything left?

264
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Yes.

265
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,000
What?

266
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,000
Cocaine.

267
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,900
C'mon, let's have some!

268
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,900
Here?

269
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,400
Of course.

270
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,900
No one's out
in the streets yet.

271
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,500
Oh, fag!

272
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,900
Come on.

273
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,800
A nailful for my gal Paca.

274
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,500
One more.
I believe in couples.

275
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
two fucks, two bumps,
two "amigas"

276
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,100
"Two Rode Together",
"Two For The Road".

277
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,700
You're such a pig!

278
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,100
Right, let's go to school!

279
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,700
Gee up, girl!

280
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,700
Come on, best foot forward.

281
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,300
This was my school.

282
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,100
I'm worn out.
Do you have anything left?

283
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,400
Be quiet.

284
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,300
It has started.

285
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,500
The god of hope who,
by the grace of the Holy Spirit,

286
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,800
fills us with His joy and peace...

287
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,300
That's Father Manolo.

288
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,500
He looks so old!

289
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,000
Well he's no chicken.

290
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
I guess.

291
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Zahara, this is crazy!

292
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,500
Are you backing out, bitch?

293
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,800
No, but the chapel is so tiny,
there's no place to hide.

294
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,700
When he sees us appear,

295
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,100
he'll do what Christ did
to the buyers in the temple.

296
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,800
He drove them out with a whip,
and he was Christ!

297
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
So this man who, according
to you, is so imperfect...

298
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,200
I confess to God,
the Father Almighty,

299
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
and to you, my brethren,

300
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,500
that I have sinned
through thought, word,

301
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,200
deed and omission.

302
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,300
Through my fault.

303
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,700
Through your fault.

304
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,600
Through my fault.

305
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,600
Through your fault.

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,600
Through my most grievous fault.

307
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,800
So I beseech
the Blessed Mary, ever virgin,

308
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,100
the angels, the saints,

309
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,300
and you, my brethren,

310
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,600
to intercede for me
before Our Lord God.

311
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,200
Almighty God,
have mercy on us,

312
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
forgive us our sins
and lead us to eternal life.

313
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,900
Through Jesus Christ Our Lord.

314
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,500
We'll see...

315
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,100
The Lord be with you.

316
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,500
I could use Him.

317
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,800
May the blessing
of Almighty God,

318
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,000
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

319
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,000
descend upon you.

320
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,500
You may go in peace.

321
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,700
I hope so.

322
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,600
Go back to the dormitory
and sleep a bit more.

323
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Thank you, Father.

324
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,900
If I'm in the sacristy
for too long, don't wait.

325
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,600
We'll meet at the hostel
for lunch,

326
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,600
sweetheart.

327
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,500
Cute!

328
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,900
Divine!

329
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,100
Good morning, Father Manolo.

330
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,300
What do you want?
You can't come in here!

331
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm the sister of an ex-pupil,
Ignacio Rodríguez.

332
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
You still can't come in here!

333
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Don't you remember Ignacio?

334
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,000
We've had a lot of pupils.

335
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,300
But no one like Ignacio,
I'm sure.

336
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,400
I've brought
an important message from him.

337
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,200
He can give it to me himself.

338
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,700
He can't.

339
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,000
He died in an accident.

340
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,100
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,600
Now, please go.

342
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Go away!

343
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Hide!

344
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,100
I've got it all!

345
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,600
Hide, he's coming!

346
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,300
Ignacio...

347
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,900
I told you to leave!
What are you doing here?

348
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,000
The same as you,
remembering Ignacio.

349
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,300
Get out!

350
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,500
We have to talk, Father.

351
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,900
It'll only take a minute.

352
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,800
Say what you have to say
and go!

353
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Are we going to talk in the dark?

354
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,500
I don't mind.

355
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,700
I'm used to working
in the dark.

356
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,600
What do you want?

357
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,400
A better life

358
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,100
and a better body.

359
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,000
What do I have to do
with those improvements?

360
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,700
You can help me
finance them.

361
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
I don't believe
Ignacio is dead

362
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
or that you're his sister.

363
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,400
I don't even believe
you're a woman.

364
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,600
Are you locking me in?

365
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,200
I don't want anyone
coming in by mistake.

366
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,300
And now,
tell me why you're here!

367
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Ok. I'll get to the point.

368
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,500
It's a story by Ignacio.

369
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Yes, he took your advice
and kept on writing.

370
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I've got a friend,
a pig,

371
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,100
who works at "Diario 16".

372
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,800
He's very interested
in publishing this story.

373
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,300
But first I'd like your opinion.

374
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,300
Apart from being
Ignacio's literature teacher

375
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,300
you're one of the main characters
in this story.

376
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Read this.

377
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,600
<i>Each month, the boys
who got on the honors board,</i>

378
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,300
<i>that is, the ones who got
the best grades,</i>

379
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,900
<i>were rewarded
with a day in the country.</i>

380
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,600
<i>We were always accompanied
by our literature teacher,</i>

381
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,200
<i>Father Manolo.</i>

382
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,300
<i>Moon River,</i>

383
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,700
<i>always on my mind.</i>

384
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:58,000
<i>I won't be swept away</i>

385
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,700
<i>by the water,</i>

386
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,700
<i>the muddy water</i>

387
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,400
<i>of that Moon River</i>

388
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,000
<i>as it flows along.</i>

389
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,600
<i>River and moon,</i>

390
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,200
<i>tell me where to find</i>

391
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,900
<i>my God,
and good and ill.</i>

392
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,400
<i>Tell me.</i>

393
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,100
<i>I'm longing to know</i>

394
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,600
<i>what is hidden</i>

395
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,900
<i>in the dark</i>

396
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,100
<i>and you'll find it...</i>

397
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,100
No!

398
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
lgnacio!

399
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,900
lgnacio!

400
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,000
<i>A trickle of blood
divided my forehead in two.</i>

401
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,100
<i>I had a feeling the same thing
would happen with my life.</i>

402
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,900
<i>It would always be divided
and I couldn't help it.</i>

403
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,400
Open the door, Father.
It is I.

404
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:43,900
What is it?

405
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,900
There's been a robbery.

406
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,700
Where?

407
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,000
In the chapel.

408
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
I think it was
after your mass.

409
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,500
Were you missing anything?

410
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,500
No.

411
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,700
The chalice, the paten,
the jug, the cruets...

412
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,200
They must be found!

413
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,600
The boys mustn't hear about this.

414
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,900
Very well.

415
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,500
And no one is to bother me,
except you.

416
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,400
Was that Father José?

417
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,300
Ignacio hated him.

418
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,500
Does he still hit the pupils?

419
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,500
He never lad a hand on Ignacio.

420
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,500
That was
the principal's privilege.

421
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,600
To sum up,
I want a million in cash.

422
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Or else "Diario 16"
will publish the whole story.

423
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
I don't have a million pesetas,
much less in cash.

424
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,900
But you can get it.

425
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,200
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm leaving.

426
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,400
I've said all I had to say.

427
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,300
But keep reading,
it gets better.

428
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,400
The key.

429
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,200
Wait.

430
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,700
Wait until after break time.

431
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,100
It'll just be a minute.

432
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
So you came to blackmail me.

433
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,200
Tell Ignacio he's overrating
these pages. They're garbage!

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,700
Garbage is hot!

435
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,600
You and I make
a best-selling couple.

436
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,500
And the editor of "Diario 16"
knows that.

437
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,300
You're in no position
to threaten anyone.

438
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,300
People will believe me,
not you.

439
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,400
No, people have changed.
This is 1977.

440
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,500
This society puts my freedom
above your hypocrisy.

441
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,400
If we treated Ignacio so badly,
why did he come back?

442
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,800
Why didn't he report us
or change schools?

443
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,300
He came back
'cause he'd fallen in love,

444
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,400
with a classmate.

445
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,800
Enrique Serrano.

446
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,000
Remember him?

447
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,100
Yes.

448
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,600
Do you mind if I keep reading?

449
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,900
<i>There were lots of celebrations
at school.</i>

450
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,200
<i>The most important one
was Principal's Day.</i>

451
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,900
<i>That day, there were
sports competitions</i>

452
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,900
<i>and religious acts,
and we had a special meal.</i>

453
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,500
Come with me, Ignacio.

454
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,500
Come along!

455
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,700
I haven't finished.

456
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,200
You'll sing better that way.

457
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,300
Do you know the new words?

458
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,500
Yes, I've got the crib
Father Manolo gave me.

459
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,500
Call him Reverend Principal.

460
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,300
He's the school principal
from today.

461
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,100
I know.

462
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,500
Don't answer back.

463
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,700
When you're singing,
keep looking at him,

464
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,500
as if there were no one else
in the dining room.

465
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Do you understand?

466
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,900
Yes.

467
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,800
<i>Father José, placed me
in the center of the dining room.</i>

468
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,100
<i>I felt odd in front of
all those priests drinking and eating,</i>

469
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,700
<i>and I was a bit scared,</i>

470
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,900
<i>but they all looked at me kindly,
except Father Manolo,</i>

471
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,000
<i>who looked ready to cry.</i>

472
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
<i>And now,</i>

473
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,600
<i>Father José Manuel,</i>

474
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,700
<i>as a birthday gift,</i>

475
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
<i>Ignacio is going to sing</i>

476
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,000
one of your favorite songs.

477
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,100
"Torna A Sorrento".

478
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,800
The new words, "Gardener",

479
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
were written by Father José Manuel,

480
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,700
helped by my humble self.

481
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,300
When you're ready, Ignacio.

482
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,500
<i>Gardener, gardener,</i>

483
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,000
<i>night and day
among your flowers,</i>

484
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,200
<i>setting fire to their colors</i>

485
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,100
<i>with the flame of your love.</i>

486
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,900
<i>And you place in every calyx</i>

487
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,200
<i>the smile of your yearning,</i>

488
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,800
<i>with your eyes
turned up to heaven</i>

489
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,700
<i>where all your hopes reside.</i>

490
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,900
<i>And your flowers, gardener,</i>

491
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,200
<i>with their corollas
burning brightly</i>

492
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,700
<i>join together in gratitude</i>

493
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,700
<i>and embalm you
with their scent.</i>

494
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,400
<i>Continue with your labor,</i>

495
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,900
<i>cultivating all the flowers</i>

496
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,300
<i>entrusted to your love</i>

497
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,300
<i>by the Lord.</i>

498
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,500
I thought you didn't like me.

499
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,000
No, just the opposite!

500
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,300
But every time I looked at you,
you looked away.

501
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Because you made me nervous.

502
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,600
And now I don't?

503
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,400
No.

504
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,100
<i>Come in.</i>

505
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,700
<i>May I help you?</i>

506
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,500
<i>Don't you recognize me, Mother?</i>

507
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,400
<i>Has the world
changed me so much?</i>

508
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,700
<i>Mother Soledad!</i>

509
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,700
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

510
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,900
<i>I've come to stay.</i>

511
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,800
<i>To stay?</i>

512
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,100
Sara is so beautiful!

513
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,300
<i>In this house?</i>

514
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,700
No.

515
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,700
<i>Never</i>

516
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,100
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

517
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,300
<i>Who can remember if I did something
I shouldn't have?</i>

518
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,900
<i>It's impossible.</i>

519
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,000
<i>It is not God
who rejects you.</i>

520
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,700
<i>It is I,</i>

521
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,700
<i>in the name of my Order.</i>

522
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,700
What's wrong?

523
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,000
I can't sleep.

524
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,000
Neither can I.

525
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,900
What we did in the cinema
wasn't right.

526
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,100
I liked it.

527
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,100
So did I.

528
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,600
But I think it was a sin,
and God's going to punish us.

529
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,100
God?

530
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,800
I don't believe in God.

531
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,500
What do you believe in?

532
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,700
I'm a hedonist.

533
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,100
What's that?

534
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,000
People who like having fun.

535
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,800
I read it in an encyclopedia.

536
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,000
What's the matter?

537
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,800
You hear that?

538
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,800
Father Manolo!

539
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,700
Open the door!
Or must I break it down

540
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,900
and let the whole school
know what you're doing?

541
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,500
lgnacio!

542
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,100
I know you're in there!

543
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,900
I've seen your feet.

544
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,300
I can hear you breathing.

545
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,000
lgnacio!

546
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,500
We're not doing anything!

547
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,300
Get out!

548
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,000
I'll deal with you later!

549
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
I'm not leaving Ignacio
alone with you.

550
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,300
How dare you!

551
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,600
Get out of here immediately!

552
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,500
Enrique, please.

553
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,800
Do as he says.

554
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,100
Come here.

555
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,800
What were you doing in there?

556
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,400
Nothing.

557
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,600
Nothing?

558
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,500
I swear, Father.

559
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,800
Then why was the door locked?

560
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Come along.

561
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,700
Come with me to the chapel.

562
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,100
The bell!

563
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,200
What are you thinking of?

564
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,900
<i>I think I've just lost my faith
at this moment,</i>

565
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,900
<i>so I no longer believe
in God or hell.</i>

566
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,700
<i>As I don't believe in hell
I'm not afraid,</i>

567
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,200
<i>and without fear
I'm capable of anything.</i>

568
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,900
We'll forget this, Ignacio.

569
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,600
Even if I wanted to,
I can't stay angry with you.

570
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,800
But promise that what happened
tonight won't happen again.

571
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
And Enrique?

572
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,700
What about him?

573
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,100
Will he be punished?

574
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,500
I should expel him!

575
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,200
I'm sure he was
responsible for it all.

576
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,600
No, I was.

577
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,600
Don't cry.

578
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
He's a very bad influence on you.

579
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,300
I want what's best for you.

580
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,200
If you don't expel him
I'll do what you want.

581
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,100
Hush.

582
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,500
<i>I sold myself for the first time
in that sacristy</i>

583
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,600
<i>to avoid Enrique
being expelled.</i>

584
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,700
<i>But Father Manolo tricked me.</i>

585
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,900
<i>I swore that one day
I'd make him pay for that.</i>

586
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,300
On your feet!

587
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,000
Hands behind your head!

588
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,700
And, one!

589
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Change!

590
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,500
Change!

591
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,300
Change!

592
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,300
Change!

593
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,200
Change!

594
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
Change!

595
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,800
Hurry up, Enrique!
We'll miss the bus!

596
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,000
Change!

597
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,500
Change!

598
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,500
I'm happy you came!

599
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,300
You're better without the beard.

600
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,100
Thank you.

601
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,800
What are you doing?

602
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,200
I'm re-reading your story.

603
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,600
Didn't you like it the first time?

604
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,600
Of course.

605
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,500
Just look at it.

606
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,200
I couldn't help making notes.
Force of habit.

607
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,100
That's Ok,
it's your copy.

608
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,700
Thanks.

609
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,500
Right, well...
How can I put this?

610
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,500
I think there's a good film
in this story

611
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,900
and I'd like to direct it.

612
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Really?

613
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,000
You're not kidding me?

614
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,800
I never joke about work.

615
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,100
But first, tell me how much
you want for the rights?

616
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,800
What rights?

617
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
The story is yours!

618
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,300
Do what you fucking want
with it!

619
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,700
So you really liked it?

620
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,700
I admit that when you said
it was based on our childhood

621
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,800
I felt

622
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,000
a bit apprehensive.

623
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,900
But I was very touched.

624
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,300
I'm so happy, man.

625
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,100
Remember I'm an actor
and I want out of Bumblebee.

626
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Yes, I know that.

627
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,600
You'd be perfect
as Enrique Serrano,

628
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,900
naked on the bed,

629
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,700
with Zahara's letter
on the pillow.

630
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,500
¿Enrique Serrano?

631
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
I think I'd rather play Zahara.

632
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,500
Zahara, you?

633
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,000
You're crazy!

634
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:39,800
Why?

635
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,100
Well...

636
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,300
You're too well-built.
You're not right.

637
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,300
Martín, we've got our story!

638
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,300
I can slim down!
I can get into the part!

639
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,200
I'm used to that in the theater.
Like Robert De Niro...

640
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,000
Make a photocopy.

641
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,700
"The Visit"?

642
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,800
Yes.

643
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,100
Ignacio and I are starting
on the script.

644
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,500
If you're going to direct it,
it's best if you write it yourself.

645
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,700
All right, Ignacio.

646
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,300
Ángel!
Start calling me Ángel,

647
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
or you'll never get used to it.

648
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,200
Ángel.

649
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,000
Do you mind driving?

650
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,700
I'm a bit shaky.

651
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,200
I'm surprised you can even walk,
with all you've taken.

652
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,900
We had to celebrate, right?

653
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,900
I thought we'd be talking
about the project.

654
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,500
We'll talk later.

655
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,200
We've got time.

656
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
Remember?

657
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,300
Remember what?

658
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Nothing.

659
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,900
You're really high.

660
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,100
What should I remember?

661
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,700
Nothing.

662
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,300
Turn off here.

663
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,700
Is all this yours?

664
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,400
No, no way.
I've just rented it.

665
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,300
Don't be too impressed,
it's a mess inside.

666
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
How about a swim?

667
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,100
It would do you good.

668
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,900
How's the water?

669
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,700
It's waiting for you.

670
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,200
Will you pass me a cigarette?

671
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,200
You weren't serious about
playing Zahara, were you?

672
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,200
Totally.

673
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,000
I don't joke about work either.

674
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,200
Then let's not talk about work.

675
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,500
What are you doing?

676
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,700
Sleeping here
or going back to Madrid?

677
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,000
If you want, I'll stay.

678
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
But talking about bodies,

679
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,900
if I look too manly
I can slim down.

680
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,100
I'm very flexible,
I can do anything.

681
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,100
You disconcert me, Ángel.

682
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,300
You told me that already.

683
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,600
And you told me
about slimming down.

684
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,300
Why don't we just talk clearly?

685
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,300
I can't say it
any more clearly1

686
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,500
I'm an actor.

687
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,500
I spent three fucking years
doing shit with Bumblebee.

688
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,300
This is my first chance
to get a terrific part

689
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,100
and I won't let it slip away.

690
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
You can't do Zahara.

691
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,900
Not at first sight,
but give me time!

692
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,000
You're a good director,

693
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,900
and I'll do anything!

694
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,300
You just have
to trust both of us.

695
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,300
I've tried.

696
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,000
But I can't trust you.

697
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,100
Why?

698
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,800
I just can't recognize
the Ignacio I knew at school.

699
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,400
The one who loved "Cuore Matto"
and so many other things.

700
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,300
My tastes have changed.

701
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,400
Is that what bothers you?

702
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,800
No.

703
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,800
People change with time.

704
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,700
Not you.

705
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,100
Simply, you're not Ignacio.

706
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,400
Who the fuck are you to decide
who I am or who I'm not?

707
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,400
How dare you?

708
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,700
Why am I not Ignacio?

709
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,600
Because I don't remember
a song from years ago?

710
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
Apart from that.

711
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,200
Because I'm not sucking your dick?

712
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,500
If I'd stayed like the kid you knew,
I'd be dead now.

713
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,500
I already am.

714
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,600
Dead tired.

715
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,400
I'm going to bed.

716
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,900
What are you doing?

717
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,700
I don't know.

718
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,700
You tell me.

719
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,800
Tell you what?

720
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,600
If I'm going to play Zahara.

721
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,700
Does your staying
depend on that?

722
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,200
No!

723
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,800
But if I don't play Zahara
there's no film.

724
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,900
Then I don't know
why you're here, cockteaser.

725
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,900
Get out!

726
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,000
Why the hell did I decide
to see you again, fucking faggot!

727
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,200
"A woman threw herself
into a pool of hungry crocodiles

728
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,400
in a zoo that was crowded
with visitors at the time.

729
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,300
When the first crocodile attacked,
the woman hugged it,

730
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,600
according to the witness.

731
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,700
The crocodiles devoured
the body of the woman,

732
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,500
who never complained,

733
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,200
in a few minutes."

734
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,300
What a horrible death!

735
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,500
Well...

736
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
She didn't even open her mouth.

737
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,700
What's on your mind?

738
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,800
Hungry crocodiles.

739
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Hello.

740
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
Hello, come in.

741
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,300
It's the journalist.

742
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,700
Why are you here?

743
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,500
Ton interview me?

744
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,700
No.
Well, yes.

745
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,400
Which is it, cutie?

746
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,100
I'm not a journalist,
I'm an actor.

747
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,300
And I'd like you to help me
prepare a character.

748
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,900
What character?

749
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,900
A tranny who imitates
Sara Montiel, among others.

750
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,800
That's me!
Why don't they give me the part?

751
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,400
Well, you're not an actor,
you're just a faggot.

752
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,800
What you have to learn
is how to be polite,

753
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,400
because that's no way
to treat a lady!

754
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,100
I'm sorry.

755
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,500
So will you teach me?

756
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,800
And how will you pay me,
honey?

757
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,900
That's what I'm looking for!

758
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,900
Two minutes.

759
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,100
We'll talk later.

760
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,100
I'm on now.

761
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,500
Everything you do
is great for me.

762
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,100
I'm delighted.

763
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,800
See you later.

764
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,100
Ortigueira, 6 kilometers.

765
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,500
Hello.

766
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,300
Hello.

767
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,300
What can I get you?

768
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,300
A beer.

769
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,300
Forgive me for asking,
but how did you get that lighter?

770
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,500
You're not from here.

771
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,100
I stole it from a friend.

772
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,300
His family lives here.

773
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,200
Maybe you know him.
His name is Ángel Andrade.

774
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:21,900
Yes.

775
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,500
That's his stage name.

776
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,700
Sure, I know him.

777
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,500
You do?

778
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,700
Yes, very well.

779
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
That's great.

780
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,100
Who is it?

781
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,300
Enrique.
I was at school with Ignacio.

782
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,100
Go away
or I'll call the police!

783
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Excuse me.

784
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,200
Are you Enrique Goded?

785
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,700
Yes.

786
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,600
I'm Ignacio's mother.

787
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,400
I'm delighted to meet you.

788
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,300
Come in.

789
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,300
Thank you.

790
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,500
Forgive my sister-in-law.

791
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,900
I've got the heart problem,
but she's the one who gets scared.

792
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,300
It doesn't matter.

793
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,000
Ignacio talked a lot about you.

794
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,100
We were very good friends.

795
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,100
I know.

796
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,000
The last time he came to see me
he wrote you a letter.

797
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,500
A letter?

798
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,000
I never got it.

799
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,900
It was three years ago.

800
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,800
He didn't know your address,
he sent it to the Ministry of Culture.

801
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,500
Then I'm not surprised.

802
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,400
By the time it was returned,
he was dead.

803
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,900
Let's go into the dining room.

804
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,500
That's my son Juan.

805
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,300
Then younger boy.

806
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,600
He's in the theater.

807
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,400
He's changed his name.

808
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,600
He says
there are too many Juans.

809
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,300
He wants even me
to call him Ángel.

810
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,100
I'd like to see Ignacio's room.

811
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,400
To be honest,
he didn't really have a room.

812
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,900
But when he came
he liked to use the attic.

813
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,900
Would you like to see it?

814
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,900
We're going upstairs!

815
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,000
Juan burned everything.

816
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,700
The notebooks, the clothes...

817
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,600
All except those magazines.

818
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,900
There's nothing left
of what Ignacio wrote?

819
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,600
No.

820
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:14,700
What a pity!

821
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,000
Are you from a publisher too?

822
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,100
No. What publisher?

823
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,100
Soon after Ignacio died,

824
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,000
a man came who was in charge
of publishing young authors,

825
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,900
Or so he said.

826
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,900
He was desperate to get
his hands on Ignacio's stories.

827
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,300
Do you remember his name,
or the publisher's?

828
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,600
No, but he was very insistent.

829
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,900
So I told the truth,
that Juan had burned everything,

830
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,300
and he even asked
for Juan's address.

831
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,100
I gave him a false one,
of course.

832
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,500
I think that man
was half mad.

833
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,000
This is Ignacio's letter.

834
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,200
It didn't get burned

835
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,900
because I never told Juan
it had been returned.

836
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,300
Thank you, ma'am.

837
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,600
Don't judge my Juan.

838
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,700
He's a good son,

839
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,500
but his brother's death
really hit him.

840
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,100
He was the one who found him.

841
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,100
<i>Dear Enrique.</i>

842
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,400
<i>At last I've got news of you.</i>

843
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,500
<i>I read it in the papers.</i>

844
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,700
<i>You've directed
your first film, man.</i>

845
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,300
<i>Even if it was underground.</i>

846
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,600
<i>And to think I was the film buff!</i>

847
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,300
<i>You'll be pleased to hear
I'm still writing.</i>

848
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,300
<i>I'm enclosing a story
that would make a divine film.</i>

849
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,400
<i>Father Manolo inspired it.</i>

850
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,000
<i>It's incredible, but I ran into him
the other day in Valencia.</i>

851
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,100
<i>I'm visiting my mother now,
but I live in Valencia.</i>

852
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,200
<i>I've checked up,
he isn't a priest anymore.</i>

853
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,400
<i>He calls himself
by his last name, Berenguer.</i>

854
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,100
<i>He works in a publisher's,
he's married and has a son.</i>

855
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,800
<i>I thought: He's crying out
to be blackmailed!</i>

856
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,100
<i>So I wrote "The Visit",
the story I'm sending you.</i>

857
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,400
<i>Read it, please.</i>

858
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,500
<i>At this point in my life,
I need a lot of money</i>

859
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,900
<i>and I'm going to get it
from that fucker!</i>

860
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,500
<i>He owes me a lot,</i>

861
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,500
<i>and it's time for him to pay.</i>

862
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,300
<i>Write to me and I'll tell you
the rest of the story.</i>

863
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,500
<i>All I'm asking
is to hear from you.</i>

864
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,100
<i>I can only share this story
with you.</i>

865
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,500
<i>I love you.</i>

866
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,400
<i>Your Ignacio.</i>

867
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,700
I'll get it.

868
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,400
What do you want?

869
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,400
I've come to apologize.

870
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,200
I'll give you your shorts.
You left them behind.

871
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,800
Thank you.

872
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
I'm very sorry
about what I said.

873
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,500
I take it all back.

874
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,600
If you're still interested,
"The Visit" is yours.

875
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,900
Do it with whomever
and however you want.

876
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,300
Have you lost weight?

877
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,200
Yes.
I'm really working on it.

878
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,800
I want to lose even more.
And I'm taking classes.

879
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,500
Classes in what?

880
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,200
In how to be a queen.

881
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,300
I'm working with the best
Sara Montiel impersonator.

882
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,500
She performs at "Bambola",
a gay club.

883
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,100
I'm workin as a waiter there.

884
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,600
so I can study the queens
more closely.

885
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,900
Then you're still
thinking about Zahara.

886
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,100
Yes.

887
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,300
Just let me do an audition.

888
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Thank you.

889
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,500
You had it!

890
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,900
Yes, you left that behind too.

891
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,900
Ignacio,
I'd like to talk...

892
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,300
Until you call me Ángel,

893
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,600
I won't believe you're taking me seriously.

894
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,400
Ángel,
I'm sure you're a good actor,

895
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,400
now more than ever.

896
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,300
So you'll let me audition?

897
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,400
<i>The audition worked
for several months,</i>

898
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,500
<i>long enough for me to throw myself
into the shooting of "The Visit",</i>

899
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,200
<i>like the woman who
threw herself to the crocodiles</i>

900
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,000
<i>and hugged them
as they ate her.</i>

901
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,400
You've changed the ending.

902
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Yes.

903
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,300
"The Visit" can't end happily,
like your story.

904
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,600
Why not?

905
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,700
Zahara can't just
walk out of the school.

906
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,300
She's a threat to the priests.

907
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,600
And we know
what the Church is capable of.

908
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
But this ending
is really heavy, man.

909
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,000
For you, as an actor,
it's much more intresting.

910
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,000
You think so?

911
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,700
Of course.

912
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,900
<i>I shot "The Visit"
as a homage to Ignacio.</i>

913
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,300
<i>In his letter, he'd said
he'd love to see it on the screen.</i>

914
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,700
<i>And also to discover
the enigma of Juan.</i>

915
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,300
<i>He allowed me
to penetrate him frequently,</i>

916
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,000
<i>but only physically.</i>

917
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,700
<i>We were about to finish shooting
and his mystery was still intact.</i>

918
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,600
<i>But on the last day</i>

919
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,600
<i>we had a visit.</i>

920
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,600
Silence!

921
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,100
And... roll camera!

922
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,500
Rolling!

923
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,500
"The Visit"
91, 1, first take.

924
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,700
Zahara, darling!

925
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,100
Action!

926
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,000
The boys are in class
and I'm sick of arguing.

927
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,500
Let me out!

928
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,300
Do you want to kidnap me?

929
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,100
Open the door!

930
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,500
I have to take a piss,
buy cigarettes, get a fix!

931
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,300
Even if I got the money,

932
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,800
how can I be sure
you won't blackmail me again?

933
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,200
You'll never be sure.

934
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,300
That's my revenge.

935
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,700
Let me out or I'll scream.

936
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,700
I loved Ignacio.

937
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,600
You don't love a boy of ten.
You harass him, you abuse him!

938
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,700
I loved him.

939
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,100
Please, let me out!

940
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
I'm locked in!

941
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,700
She's threatening
to denounce us.

942
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,700
She wants a million pesetas
to keep quiet.

943
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,900
If you give her a single peseta,
you'll never stop paying.

944
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,000
I knew we'd meet again,
scum!

945
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,800
You know her?

946
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,800
You knew him
much better than I did.

947
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,200
It's Ignacio Rodríguez.

948
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,600
Ignacio!

949
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,800
It can't be!

950
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,500
We have to finish him off.

951
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,200
He's a threat
to the whole congregation!

952
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,400
He wants to say something.

953
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,200
Yes, that we let him do.

954
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,300
If you're going to kill me,

955
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,200
I'd like to confess first.

956
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,600
Confess what?

957
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,700
Thanks to you
we've got no way out.

958
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,300
You have to stay calm.

959
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,200
I'll get rid of the body.

960
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,300
How?

961
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,800
It's best if you know nothing.

962
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,900
It was self-defense, Father.

963
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,300
He'd have made
our lives impossible.

964
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,200
Yes,

965
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,600
I guess so.

966
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,700
And there are no witnesses.

967
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,300
God.

968
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,500
Yes,

969
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,200
but He's on our side.

970
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,300
Cut!

971
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,700
We've cut, guys!

972
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,800
This one's good.
What about the other one?

973
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,900
Give me No. 1 as well.

974
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,800
Well done, guys.

975
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,400
No, it was great.

976
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,300
Is anything wrong, Ángel?

977
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,300
No.

978
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,700
I'll see you later.

979
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,300
It went really well.

980
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,500
Put that down!
Who are you?

981
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,300
The villain in your film.

982
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,400
Father Manolo!

983
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,900
Mr. Berenguer.

984
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,700
I'm not even a father
to my own son now.

985
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,800
Get out!

986
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:15,000
I read in a magazine
that you were here.

987
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,900
Go and drink some hot milk
with honey, and take an aspirin,

988
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,600
and leave me alone.

989
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,400
I've got a lot to do,
I can't waste time on you.

990
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,000
Not even to find out
how Ignacio died?

991
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,900
Or who killed him?

992
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,900
And if it concedes
with your film?

993
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,600
Say what you have to say
and go.

994
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,500
I was living Valencia.

995
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,800
I worked for a publisher
that promoted young writers.

996
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,800
Three years ago, I received
a story called "The Visit",

997
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,500
signed by Ignacio Rodríguez.

998
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,900
Ignacio Rodríguez calling
about the new writers anthology.

999
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,900
Didn't you tell him
he was rejected?

1000
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,500
Yes, but he insists
on speaking to you.

1001
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:11,900
He's on your line.

1002
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,700
<i>Mr. José Manuel Berenguer?</i>

1003
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,500
Yes.

1004
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,200
<i>I preferred Father Manolo.</i>

1005
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,000
Excuse me?

1006
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,100
Are you the author of "The Visit"?

1007
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,100
<i>Yes.</i>

1008
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,900
We decided not to include it
in "Short Stories of the 80s"

1009
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm sorry.

1010
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,800
<i>You and I have to talk.</i>

1011
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,900
I think not.
I've got nothing more to say.

1012
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,700
<i>But I do.</i>

1013
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,500
<i>I went to St. John's School.</i>

1014
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,200
<i>You were my literature teacher,</i>

1015
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,000
<i>and you were
madly in love with me.</i>

1016
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,900
<i>I remember how
you'd embrace me from behind</i>

1017
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,800
<i>while you declared your love.</i>

1018
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,800
<i>I can't believe you've forgotten.</i>

1019
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,700
<i>I remember the buttons
on your sauterne</i>

1020
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,700
<i>digging into my backbone.</i>

1021
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,400
<i>Have you really forgotten?</i>

1022
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,700
<i>I'll expect you
at my house at 7:00.</i>

1023
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,500
<i>My address is on the back
of the envelope, Father Manolo.</i>

1024
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,600
<i>Push the door.</i>

1025
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,200
<i>It's just stuck.</i>

1026
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,100
<i>That wasn't the Ignacio
you and I loved.</i>

1027
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,000
Hello, Mr. Berenguer.

1028
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,700
I'm Ignacio.

1029
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,100
Please, come in.

1030
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,100
Yes, I'm a junkie,

1031
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,400
but I want to quit
and I thought you could help me.

1032
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,600
Well, I know a clinic.

1033
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,800
So do I, but first I want
to fix myself up a bit.

1034
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,300
I know I've got divine tits,
but everything else...

1035
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:19,500
Anyway, I won't get into that.

1036
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,900
Looking pretty
costs a lot of money, Father Manolo.

1037
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,400
I think a million would do it.

1038
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,900
A million?

1039
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,900
Yes, in cash, and my lips
are sealed. I won't say a word.

1040
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,600
You're out of your mind!

1041
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,000
Sexual harassment
is frowned upon, Father Manolo.

1042
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,700
What would your wife think,
or your boss?

1043
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,800
You're in no position
to blackmail anyone.

1044
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,500
I could have you
arrested tonight.

1045
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,200
Very well.

1046
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,200
You call the police,
I'll call your wife and the media.

1047
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:55,100
A blackmailer can't be
as defenseless as you are.

1048
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,100
Believe me,
I know what I'm saying.

1049
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,900
Juan, go back to your room.

1050
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,200
I want to watch TV.

1051
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,100
Watch it later,
we're talking business.

1052
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,700
I don't mind if he stays.

1053
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,300
I'm sure you don't.

1054
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,600
He's my brother,
he's looking after me.

1055
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,400
Or that's my mother's idea.

1056
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,000
I'm Mr. Berenguer.

1057
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,800
One million, end of story.

1058
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Do you want me
to call him Juan,

1059
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,200
or Ángel?

1060
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,700
The blackmail
became an investment for me.

1061
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:45,300
<i>I visited the brothers frequently
so I could keep seeing Juan.</i>

1062
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Remember Don Narciso,
the Nazi?

1063
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,800
He love my illustrations.
Look at this one.

1064
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,400
And there's another one...
Look, this is beautiful.

1065
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,400
And this one...

1066
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,300
"Children of Spain"

1067
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,200
I brought you this.

1068
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,400
<i>I kept Ignacio happy
with small amounts of money.</i>

1069
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,100
<i>And I kept stalling him.</i>

1070
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,900
<i>I desired Juan,</i>

1071
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,000
<i>more and more every day.</i>

1072
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,200
Hello.

1073
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,100
Hello.

1074
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:39,100
You brought the dough?

1075
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,100
I can only give you 50,000.

1076
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,800
You said
you'd bring the million!

1077
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,200
I said they'd tell me today
if I'd get the loan.

1078
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,900
They said yes,

1079
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,300
but they have
to check my guarantees.

1080
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,700
I need another three weeks.

1081
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,500
Another three weeks!

1082
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,900
I'm a junkie.
Haven't you noticed?

1083
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,900
I could be dead in three weeks.

1084
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,100
Are you going away?

1085
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Obviously!

1086
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,500
I want to see my mother
before I check in.

1087
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,900
She has to see me with these teeth
and this face, and it's your fault!

1088
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,300
Don't be unfair, Ignacio,
I'm doing what I can.

1089
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,100
Then do more!

1090
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,700
I'll be gone for a week.

1091
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,700
When I come back
I want that million.

1092
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,100
If you don't have it, you'll be sorry.
I'm sick of being put off!

1093
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,900
I'll try to hurry them up, but...

1094
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,400
Father.

1095
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,700
Come along.

1096
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,300
Shall I help you?

1097
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,300
Sure, take the Olivetti,
it's the heaviest.

1098
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,400
While you're at it,
take this one too.

1099
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,700
Stop that taxi.

1100
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,300
Taxi.

1101
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,000
Bye, Father.

1102
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,400
Goodbye.
Open the trunk, please.

1103
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,900
My scarf!

1104
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:06,900
Excuse me.

1105
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,000
I've come for my scarf.
I must have left it here.

1106
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,700
Fuck, it's really soft!

1107
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,400
Silk.

1108
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,600
It's yours.

1109
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,700
To be honest,
I left it here for you.

1110
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,200
Cut it out,
I'm not Ignacio!

1111
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,000
Fortunately.

1112
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,600
What time is it?

1113
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,100
12:30.

1114
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,900
Did he give you anything
for me?

1115
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,100
Ignacio? No.

1116
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,600
Fuck!

1117
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,100
I had to pay
my school fees today.

1118
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,200
Are you studying?

1119
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,500
Yes. Drama.

1120
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,000
I'm an actor.

1121
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,600
Selfish bastard!

1122
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,700
He knew I had to pay today
and he didn't give me anything.

1123
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,600
Obviously, I paid his fees.

1124
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,500
I hadn't told Ignacio

1125
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,100
but the bank had granted me
a loan of two million.

1126
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,900
I withdrew the first million.

1127
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,700
I told my wife I was going
to a conference abroad.

1128
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,100
She didn't believe me.

1129
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,100
I guess
that doesn't interest you.

1130
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,300
Not in the least.

1131
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,200
How did Ignacio die?

1132
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
The week Juan and I
spent alone

1133
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,500
was the happiest in my life.

1134
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,200
Every day
I bought him something.

1135
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,600
<i>Clothes, a walkman,
a Super-8 camera.</i>

1136
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,400
<i>I enjoyed the gifts
more than he did.</i>

1137
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,500
Take off your shirt.

1138
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,200
Take it off!

1139
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,800
Now it's my turn!

1140
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,100
Now, take that off.

1141
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,600
Show me your cock.

1142
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,400
If you're going to shoot my dick,

1143
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,500
don't show my face!

1144
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,800
Too late.

1145
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:40,900
I can't...!

1146
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,800
You!
Give me some dough!

1147
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,500
I've got the fucking sweats.

1148
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,300
How's mom?

1149
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,200
She had another heart attack.

1150
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,900
But she's all right now.
I'm the one who's sick.

1151
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,300
The dough!

1152
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:28,700
More!

1153
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,800
That's all I have.

1154
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,200
I want that million now!
No more excuses!

1155
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,600
No more stalling
and no more gifts.

1156
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,500
Mom!

1157
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,000
<i>How are you, Juan?
Has Ignacio arrived?</i>

1158
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:41,900
Yes!

1159
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,400
what happened this time?

1160
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,500
The usual thing, son, but...

1161
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:49,000
He stole my pension,
and I'd just gotten it!

1162
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:49,900
Is that true?

1163
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,300
<i>Yes, love, it is.</i>

1164
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,000
Tell auntie
I'll send her some money.

1165
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,100
He promised me
he was going into a clinic.

1166
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,500
And you believed him?

1167
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,100
Yes, this time he really means it.
He's going to try.

1168
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,100
<i>You have to help him.</i>

1169
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:06,900
How?

1170
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,700
By being with him.
Don't leave him.

1171
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:10,900
Promise me.

1172
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,000
I promise.

1173
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,300
<i>Listen, did he give you</i>

1174
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,900
the cheese and the chorizos?

1175
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,200
Delicous!

1176
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,700
Why did you bother?

1177
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,500
There's food in Valencia.
Don't spend your money.

1178
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,400
<i>They're your favorites.
I'd kept them for you.</i>

1179
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,200
<i>You can't get them in Valencia.</i>

1180
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,300
All right, thanks.

1181
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:29,900
<i>Lots of love, son.</i>

1182
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,000
Yes, call me if anything happens.

1183
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,600
<i>Don't worry, I will.</i>

1184
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,700
Bye.

1185
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,300
Where's Ignacio?

1186
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,000
I'm going to kill him!

1187
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,600
It was Juan's idea.

1188
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:47,500
Or mine, I don't know.

1189
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,400
The only solution
was to get rid of him.

1190
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,800
More or less
what you've just shot.

1191
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,000
But not as violent.

1192
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,600
How did you think of it?

1193
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,700
Ignacio's story
doesn't end like that.

1194
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,900
While I was adapting it,
I found out that Ignacio was dead.

1195
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,900
Did Juan tell you?

1196
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:14,900
No.

1197
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,500
I found out myself.

1198
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,200
Will you just tell me
how it happened?

1199
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,900
<i>I arranged to meet Juan
at the Museum of Giant Figures.</i>

1200
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,100
<i>He had it all planned out.</i>

1201
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,100
<i>Much more than
it seemed at first.</i>

1202
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,200
I'll buy the junk
and you give it to him.

1203
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,200
Why me?

1204
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,400
Fuck, he's my brother!

1205
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,100
I'm not a monster.

1206
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,500
Do you think
this doesn't hurt me?

1207
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,100
But he's ruining all our lives.

1208
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,000
What will we do afterwards?

1209
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,700
We won't meet for a while.

1210
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:57,700
Why?

1211
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,300
You said
there'd be no investigation.

1212
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,700
Just in case.

1213
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,700
It's best
not to arouse suspicion.

1214
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,800
I'll go and look after my mother,
she'll need it.

1215
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,500
When things calm down,
I'll call you and we'll go away.

1216
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,200
Have you got the money?

1217
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,100
Yes.

1218
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:14,900
No.

1219
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:17,900
What will I do
while I'm waiting?

1220
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,300
Work, earn money.
We'll need it.

1221
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,600
The situation at home
is unbearable.

1222
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,700
Apologize to your wife
and enjoy your son.

1223
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,900
Tell her the truth.

1224
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,700
What?

1225
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,400
Say you've been
with someone else,

1226
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,900
a woman.

1227
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,900
Give me your mother's address.

1228
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,400
It's best if I don't.

1229
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,200
Then you won't be tempted
to come see me.

1230
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,100
What are they laughing at?

1231
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,200
They're laughing at us.

1232
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,100
At me, at least.

1233
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,200
Juan bought deadly pure heroin.

1234
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,300
He gave it to me

1235
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,300
and I went to Ignacio's.

1236
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,500
Alone.

1237
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,000
This is my last fix.

1238
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,100
What do you mean?

1239
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:33,800
I'm quitting.

1240
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,200
This time I really am.

1241
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,400
Before I get my face
and all the rest done,

1242
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,400
I'm checking
into a detox clinic.

1243
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,700
I've already applied.

1244
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,400
Good.

1245
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,600
You'll have the money tomorrow.

1246
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,200
I hope so.

1247
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,400
Before noon, Ok?

1248
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,300
Just in case,
I wrote two letters,

1249
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,300
one for the publisher
and the other for your wife,

1250
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,300
telling all you've hidden from them
in the past and present.

1251
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,300
That's unnecessary. Give them to me!

1252
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:08,100
When I get the money.
Before noon.

1253
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,500
Pretty, aren't they?

1254
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,100
What?

1255
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,700
My tits.

1256
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,500
Yes, they're wonderful.

1257
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,200
Thank you.

1258
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,200
Shall I help you?

1259
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,500
No, no.

1260
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,200
Go away.

1261
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,200
I don't like fixing
in front of you.

1262
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:48,200
It's done.

1263
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,400
Pull in here.

1264
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,900
We'll go to the cinema
to kill time.

1265
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:20,600
It's as if all the films
were talking about us.

1266
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,100
Now what?

1267
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:28,900
I'm going home.

1268
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,400
You want me to go with you?

1269
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,200
No, you'd better not.

1270
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,000
Remember to get
those two letters.

1271
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:37,700
Yes.

1272
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,500
If you don't
we'll be in trouble.

1273
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,900
I'll get everything
don't worry.

1274
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,600
If we won't be seeing
each other for a while,

1275
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,800
give me some of the Super-8s.

1276
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,900
It would console me
to see us screwing.

1277
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,500
You're nuts!

1278
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,500
What if your wife saw them?

1279
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,300
We have to burn them.
I'll take care of that.

1280
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,200
Let's go.

1281
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:23,100
Get in for a minute.

1282
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,800
No, I'm going to take a taxi.

1283
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,200
Then,

1284
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,000
I won't see you again?

1285
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,000
It's just for a few days.

1286
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:45,600
Taxi.

1287
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,500
Call me as soon as you can.

1288
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,400
Yes.

1289
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,400
Ignacio?

1290
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:54,300
Enrique.

1291
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:56,800
What's wrong?

1292
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:01,300
You!

1293
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:02,800
At last!

1294
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,600
I read in this film magazine
that you were here.

1295
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,100
What did you tell him?

1296
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:08,700
Everything.

1297
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,000
Now you only have me, darling.

1298
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,100
You're crazy.

1299
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,200
Remember I've got
my brother's letters,

1300
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,800
accusing you of his death.

1301
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,400
We both did it, my love.

1302
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,300
The letters only mention you.

1303
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,100
Enrique, wait!

1304
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:29,400
Enrique.

1305
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:41,900
Are you all right?

1306
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Leave me alone!

1307
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,600
If I ever see you again,
I swear I'll kill you!

1308
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,700
Now that I've found you,
I won't let you go.

1309
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,600
Get used to the idea.

1310
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,200
Mónica.

1311
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,400
Can you give me a lift?

1312
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,100
Sure.

1313
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:02,900
Yes?

1314
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,000
Get in the front.

1315
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,000
Hello.

1316
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,300
Who was that?

1317
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,300
Someone looking for Enrique.

1318
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,700
<i>Who is it?</i>

1319
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,400
It's me.

1320
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:54,800
Give me back the keys.

1321
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,600
Your things are in the hall.
Take them away.

1322
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,300
The taxi's gone.

1323
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,800
You'll have to lend me the car
or drive me back to Madrid.

1324
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:33,000
I want to order a taxi.

1325
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,300
11, Avenida del Aqua.

1326
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:39,900
Enrique Goded, yes.

1327
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,300
Thank you.

1328
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,700
I was going to tell you
after the shoot.

1329
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,300
Tell me what?

1330
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,700
That my name is Juan.

1331
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,900
That I'm Ignacio's brother
and Ignacio died four years ago.

1332
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,800
I knew that already.

1333
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,100
I know that you knew.

1334
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,100
What do you mean?

1335
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,500
My mother rang to tell me
you'd been to the house.

1336
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,800
I guessed
you'd learned everything.

1337
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,900
When you asked for the audition,
you knew that I knew?

1338
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,000
Yes.

1339
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,400
And you still kept pretending?

1340
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:17,600
What else could I do?

1341
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,100
I didn't lie
you knew everything.

1342
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,200
No, I didn't, far from it.

1343
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,400
I knew you'd taken Ignacio's place
and that he was dead,

1344
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,300
but I never imagined
that you'd killed him!

1345
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,400
That's the taxi.

1346
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,000
I didn't kill him, Berenguer did!
Ignacio was blackmailing him.

1347
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,900
And you were hustling him!

1348
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,200
The taxi's waiting.

1349
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,800
You don't know what it is like
to have a brother like that

1350
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,100
and live in a small town.

1351
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,200
Juan,

1352
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,000
the taxi is waiting.

1353
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:15,800
Why did you choose me?

1354
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,800
You still don't see me
as Zahara.

1355
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,500
Was it just to fuck me?

1356
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:23,500
It was curiosity.

1357
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,500
I wanted to see
how far you would go

1358
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,000
and how much I could take.

1359
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,200
I would go a lot further.

1360
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:34,000
I bet you would.

1361
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,500
You needn't explain any more.

1362
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:43,900
It's not mine.
It's from Ignacio.

1363
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:07,540
Dear Enrique:
I think I've succeeded...

1364
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:16,260
"After the release of "The Visit"

1365
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:18,580
Ángel Andrade
became the top heart throb

1366
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:19,900
his reign
lasted for ten years.

1367
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:22,020
In the '90s, his career
suffered ups and downs.

1368
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,980
He married Mónica,
the wardrobe girl.

1369
01:36:25,203 --> 01:36:26,814
At present
he works solely on TV series."

1370
01:36:28,737 --> 01:36:31,285
"Mr. Berenguer
(formerly Father Manolo)

1371
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:33,450
did not disappear from Angel 
Andrade's life (formerly Juan).

1372
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,900
He started asking for money
and blackmailing him.

1373
01:36:34,941 --> 01:36:36,254
One night, he was run down
and killed by a car that didn't stop.

1374
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:40,032
The car was driven
by Ángel Andrade."

with the same passion"
