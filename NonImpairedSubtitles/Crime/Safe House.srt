Tobin Frost has
just waltzed his way

180
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,663
into a U.S. Consulate
in Cape Town, South Africa.

181
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,827
Now this man,
without question,

182
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,994
is one of the most notorious
traders that we've got.

00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,030
Errington, call up
his background profile.

184
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,773
ERRINGTON: Tobin Frost was
recruited into the Agency in 1984.

185
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:14,903
He tested off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work.

186
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,673
His first assignment was in
Lebanon, in January, 1985.

187
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,177
Three months later,
he captured and flipped

188
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,515
a high-ranking
Hezbollah leader.

189
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,749
<i>Over the next</i>
<i>several years,</i>

190
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,554
<i>Frost successfully questioned and recruited</i>
<i>many high-value individuals.</i>

191
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,562
He became known as an expert
manipulator of human assets,

192
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,463
and he literally rewrote
Agency interrogation protocols.

193
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,057
LINKLATER: Frost served
in many active theaters,

194
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,002
including Libya
from 1995 to 1998,

195
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,698
Jordan, 1998 to 2000.

196
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,405
During his tenure
in Jordan,

197
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,374
Frost was suspected of leaking
information to Mossad,

198
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,570
but nothing
was confirmed.

199
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,011
Ten years ago, Frost went off
the reservation completely.

200
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,049
<i>He currently</i>
<i>has no allegiances</i>

201
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,710
<i>and is wanted for espionage</i>
<i>on four continents.</i>

202
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:57,619
His last known sighting
is Hamburg, Germany, in 2011.

203
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,955
You know, Harlan, we should
interrogate Frost now.

204
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,459
Sweat him for
everything he's got.

205

Once he's stateside,
we have fewer options.

206

that can be there in two.

208
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,899
We'll take Frost to the safe
