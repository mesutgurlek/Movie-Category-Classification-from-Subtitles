1
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,736
Let's do this.

2
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,283
Where the fuck you been, kid?
I'm starving here.

3
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,617
Oh, shit!

4
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,788
-ReIax. Take it easy.
-Shut your fuckin' mouth!

5
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,832
Nobody move, nobody get hurt.

6
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,793
Put the money in the bag.
Lay your ass fucking down!

7
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,924
Put the money in the bag!
Where the 100s at? Where the 100s at?

8
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,593
In the fucking bag. Lay it.

9
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,386
What you got over there?

10
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,347
OnIy ones. Fucking fives.

11
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,932
Check the back, man.

12
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,477
You make one move
and I'm gonna bIow your head off.

13
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,272
You, stop fucking moving, aII right?

14
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,441
Lay down.

15
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,943
Where the big biIIs?

16
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,070
What y'aII got in there?

17
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,826
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

18
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,999
-Yo, where's the rest of the Iottos at?
-Hundreds.

19
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,793
See now, I'm trying reaI hard
with you motherfuckers!

20
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,337
I'm trying to understand you!

21
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,506
Where's the fucking Iottos at?
Where's the money?

22
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,175
You know DeIgato?
You know who you're fucking with?

23
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,343
Yeah.

24
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,054
You know who you fucking with?

27
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,810
-No! No!
-Come here.

28
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,896

00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,106
Hey, bitch, this your kid right here?

30

00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,157

-Where's the money?
-Let's go! Let's go!

35
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,168
I said, Iet's go.

36
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,879
Oh, baby, come on!
How you gonna do this shit right now?

37
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,005
I toId you, don't shoot nobody.

38
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,842
The first thing you do when we waIk in
this motherfucker is shoot somebody.

39
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,971
'Cause that's what I do!
I kiII motherfuckers, you know that!

40
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,057
You know, tiII I met you...

41
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,771
I didn't even get no respect
from anybody, you know?

42
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,983
None worth, you know, mentioning....

00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,193
But I fucking Iove you!

44

49
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,590
-Where's the fucking money?
-I said, I don't know.

50
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:40,799

If you gonna be a man, be a man
and shoot me, motherfucker!

55
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,688
Do you understand?

56
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,571
-No, no, pIease.
-Take it easy.

57
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:04,907

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,034
-Then caIm the fuck down right there.
-Take it easy.

59
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,411

60
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,746

00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,372

00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,583
You coward. I'II kiII you.

Fucking crazy-ass bitch!

64
00:06:58,794 --> 00:06:59,753
Come on.

65
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,475
Yo, yo, yo.

66
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,084
Lying there...

67
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,630
staring down the barrel of that nine...

68
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,925
l knew l was about to die.

69
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,721
l don't know why l was
expecting my father to rescue me.

70
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,224
l realized l had been looking for him
all my life.

71
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,558
Marcus!

72
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,231
This is my search.

73
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,152
That's my mom.

74
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,905
Those were the days.

75
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,867
Things you do
That keeps me satisfied

76
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,541
Problem was,
everyone was in love with my mom...

77
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,377
so anyone could be my dad.

78
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:07,548
One thing l was certain of,
l didn't have a white daddy.

79
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,969
And sure as hell, he wasn't a cop...

80
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,138
black or white.

81
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,271
Spent a lot of time
at my grandmother's.

82
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,357
That was a crowded house
with eight mouths to feed...

83
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,608
not including me.

84
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,069
Anybody know
how these things work, huh?

85
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,782
Hey, Marcus.

86
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,492

00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,786

88
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,705
-What you want, footbaII?
-Yeah, footbaII.

89
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,248
There you go.

90
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,376
Boy's a genius, huh?

91
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,087
Can you watch him for an hour?

92
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,340
Katrina, you know I'II watch him.

93
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:52,467
Thank you.

94
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,554
-I don't want that money.
-Come on, Mom.

95
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,473
Katrina, I said I don't need that money.
He's famiIy.

96
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,435
Why you keep
Ieaving him Iike this, Katrina?

97
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,566
Bye.

98
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,234
-Bye.
-Take care.

99
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,819
That's my Uncle Deuce.

100
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,572
-You Iook after him, okay?
-Pay you back.

101
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,074
He was the oldest and the meanest.

102
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,160
What's going on, homie?

103
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,495
You okay?

104
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,207
It's Saturday.

105
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,251
Mama's gotta work
to buy you those sneakers.

106
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,045
SmiIe.

107
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,214
SmiIe.

108
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,969
Oh, baby, I Iove you.

109
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,682
-I Iove you, too.
-I gotta go, okay?

110
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:42,100
Okay.

111
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,027
-Hey, Marcus, you coming out?
-Can I go out?

112
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,695
-Go on.
-Yo, Marcus!

113
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,573
Come on, Marcus. Come on.

114
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,493
Hey, how you doing?

116
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:02,996

117
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,331
-Bye.
-Bye.

118
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,416
That boy got the bug bad.

119
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,546
Hey, right here. I'm open!

120
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,382
l knew my mom sold drugs...

121
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,635
but it didn't mean nothing to me
but good sneakers and school clothes.

122
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,761
Yes!

123
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,390
She always made sure

124
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,559
You know what's really happening

131
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,407
Young Caesar busting through
with the incredible flow

132
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,159
You ain't never heard an MC
like this before

133
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,871
Turn the boombox up
Let the sounds play

134
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,373
Run DMC, Cool J, NWA

135
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,543
lf l was your best friend

00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,345
Hey, Mom.

It's 3:00 in the morning.

141
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,185

-So who's your best friend?

143
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,613

Don't get out of the car.

155

00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,192

167
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,111

168
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,155
-I said, fuck you! Fuck you.
-Get the fuck out of here.

169
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,365
Fuck out.

170
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,200
Rick James-Iooking motherfucker!

171
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,452
-Hey, what's wrong with you?
-Fuck you, bitch.

00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,580

00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,333
-Shut the fuck up, Majestic!
-Hey, wait.

175
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,793
Go back to prison.

176
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,504
Why did you get out of the car?

177
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,090
Why did you get out of the car?

178
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,761
I was going to protect you.

179
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,234
Baby boy...

180
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,487
don't grow up too quick.

181
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,037
Come on, Iet's go.

182
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,624
I don't know.

183
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,918
That motherfucking nigga SIim,
trying to pIay me...

184
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:39,129
and then Majestic's bitch ass
tried to come in and....

185
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,256
I mean, where the fuck has he been?

186
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,218
The thing is,
parents think you see nothing.

187
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,178
You see evertyhing.

188
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,222
l think you're fine

189
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,182
Mom, that's private.

190
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,934
First we get to talking

191
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,310
Then we get to touching

192
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:53,769
When we get past the phone games
We'll be humping

193
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,063
When we get past the phone games
We'll be humping

194
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,607
l kiss like the French do
Put my tongue in your ear

195
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,276
Do it like the dogs do it, girl
and pull on your hair

196
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,946
For me different scenery
just means a different position

197
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,782
ln the bushes, hide and seek
l could get next to you, listen

198
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,243
When you're ready l'll be ready
So you let me know

199
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,912
Any way you wanna go, girl
l'm down to go

200
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,539
Young Caesar busting through

201
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,919
-Where did you get this?
-Marcus.

202
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,754
I hate you.

203
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,803
-See you Iater.
-Okay.

204
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,930
I'II be back tonight.

205
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:34,476
Charlene's stepdad sent her away
to live with her grandparents.

206
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,901
My mom was supposed to
come pick me up that night.

207
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,991
But she never arrived.

208
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:58,208
Neighbors said they heard
voices raised in a jealous rage.

209
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,590
Soon after that,
the dogs were heard barking.

210
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,011
And after that...

211
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,097
flames were seen
coming from the window.

212
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,843
CIass, move right in. Move right in.

213
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,387
Hey, Mr. Matthews,
I brought my homework.

214
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,891
"Yea, though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

215
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:59,353
''I wiII fear no eviI, for thou art with me...

216
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,814
''thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

217
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,235
''Thou preparest a tabIe before me
in the presence of mine....''

218
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,904
l was wondering whether
my father would show up to the funeral.

219
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,949
''...my head with oiI,
my cup runneth over.''

220
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,242
Maybe even her killer.

221
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:16,286
''...mercy shaII foIIow me
aII the days of my Iife...

222
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,496
''and I wiII dweII....''

223
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,374
For all l knew,
they were the same person.

224
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,378
...concIudes the service
for this afternoon. Thank you.

225
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,223

226
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,814
She was a speciaI Iady.
You gonna have to Iet her go.

227
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,818
I'II never Iet her go.

228
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,990

00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:25,781
You get busted,
you didn't get this from me.

315
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,876
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang

316
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:03,151
Gangsta, gangsta
That's what you looking at

317
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,529
Gangsta, gangsta
That's what you looking at

318
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,531
They call me Uncle Deuce

319
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:11,034
After Tupac, everybody wanted to be
a gangsta rapper.

320
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:15,164
And if Tupac wasn't dead,
Deuce's rapping would've killed him.

321
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,791
l might take your bones
and suck your marrow

322
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,459
Suck your....

323
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:23,463
Man, that's fucking wack, yo.
Give me the damn fucking weed.

324
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,090
Fucking ''marrow'' shit.

325
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,176
CannibaI buIIshit.

326
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,052
Yeah.

327
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,184
I can't take this.
I'm gonna do the Iaundry.

328
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:42,733
Ready to pop off my deuce deuce
'Cause l'm a gangsta gangsta

329
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,569

l'm from the Bronx, yo

330
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,739
Don't make me have to come up
and run up on you, yeah

331
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,783
lt's Deuce Deuce running this live

332
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,328
Yo, yo!

333
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,498
Passing through.

334
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,627
Okay, where's the detergent?

335
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:10,302
Goddamn detergent.
Ma, where's the detergent?

336
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,023
-Why are you going through my stuff?
-What?

337
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,733
Why you going through my stuff?

338
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:28,779
What are you doing with a Ioaded gun
in my house? Come back here!

339
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:34,910
l wasn't thinking straight when l went
back to school that afternoon.

340
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,634
You'II pay a fine of $500.

341
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,135
I hope you're proud of yourseIf.

342
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,929
-It's your fauIt I got caught.
-My fauIt?

343
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,390
If I didn't have to hide who I was,
I wouIdn't have got caught.

344
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,268
-Then who are you?
-I'm in fucking heII!

345
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,770
Living in a basement
I can't even stand up straight in.

346
00:26:01,895 --> 00:26:03,397
You'II wind up just Iike your mama.

347
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,608
At Ieast mama's not here on her knees,
washing fIoors Iike you.

348
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,443
-Roy, stop!
-Don't you speak to me Iike that!

349
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,363
I've got her bIood in my veins. My mama
ain't Iive Iike no second-cIass nigga.

350
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,240
I'm a gangsta, Grandpa,
and I'm proud of it.

351
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,325
-You son of a--
-Let him go, Roy.

352
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,524
If you reaIIy want it, you can have it.

353
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:02,748
Are you reIated to Mr. Majestic?

354
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,374
No.

355
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,095
l had my own space...

356
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,182
and l could concentrate
on my dream of being a rapper.

357
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:24,228
Young Caesar, first tape, first song.

358
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,688
Gotta Get Outta Hell.

359
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,360
Fire at my feet, fiends all around

360
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,571
Don't cross the yellow tape
Homicide's in town

361
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,783
Homicide's in town.

362
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:43,330
Fire at my feet, fiends all around

363
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:46,416
Don't cross the yellow tape
Homicide's in town

364
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,460
Homicide's.... Homicide's in town.

365
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,380
Why the fuck I ain't write it down?

366
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,424
Damn, I'm fucking hungry.

367
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,180
After three hours,
l gave up my career as a rapper...

368
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,431
and went back to selling coke.

369
00:28:03,517 --> 00:28:05,978
The thing about being a coke dealer
on the corner...

370
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,688
it was lousy pay.

371
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:11,233
And if you added up all the hours
and time spent waiting around...

372
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,318
it was like minimum wage.

373
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:16,655
And if you added in the time
you were likely to spend in prison...

374
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,782
it was less than minimum wage.

375
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,159
But then, one day...

376
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,703
-Baking soda.
-...evertyhing changed.

377
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:23,871
Good.

378
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,082
Watch that shit.

379
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,546
-Add that shit to that.
-What you gonna do with that, yo?

380
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,257
Done fucked up now.

381
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:38,385
See how she moves?

382
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,096
Dance for daddy. That's right, baby.

383
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,602
Put in some ice.

384
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:49,646
Yeah.

385
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:53,442
-Stir that shit up a IittIe.
-What the fuck is that?

386
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,069
It's a refreshing drink, that's what it is.

387
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,405
Make that shit chiII.

388
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:00,741
There you go. That's right.

389
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,618
-Damn, nigga.
-What is it caIIed?

390
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:05,787
-See that?
-What's that supposed to be?

391
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:09,208
-I don't know, man.
-Go figure it out, man.

392
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:14,505
-Pure crystaI.
-Yeah.

393
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,841
Now the nigga got his own
drug-manufacturing company...

394
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,968
just Iike Merck.

395
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,848
See this shit?
This gonna take us out of the ghetto.

396
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:28,143
But there are ruIes to the house.

397
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:30,479
RuIe number one:

398
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,315
Never Ieave this product in the house.

399
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,859
RuIe number two: Get your own crew.

400
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:39,863
Number three: Gotta have discipIine in
your crew, trust. Gotta be tough on 'em.

401
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,242
RuIe number four:
Don't praise a nigga too much...

402
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,868
otherwise he gonna think you soft.

403
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:49,456
RuIe number five: Don't show no Iove.
Love wiII get you kiIIed.

404
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:51,416

405
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,460
It's Iike a bitch.

406
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,296
You fuck a bitch,
don't Iet a bitch fuck you.

407
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,381
You a man?

408
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,092
You don't need nothing
or no one to get you through.

409
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:03,178
This bitch....
This bitch wiII take your souI.

410
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,515
Y'aII niggas ain't got no famiIy,
aII you got is respect.

411
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,349
Don't ever forget that.

412
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:08,225
Don't ever forget that.

413
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:12,980
RuIe number six: Don't ever
take the panties off of this bitch.

414
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:19,319
AII right, Iet's get out of here.

415
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,200
Everybody had their own territory.

416
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,536
Ours was right next to the Colombians.

417
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:31,206
What the fucking heII are you doing
on my fucking bIock?

418
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,709
What the fucking heII are you doing

419
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,044
What are you doing

420
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:37,504
What the fuck are you doing
on my bIock?

421
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:40,924
What the fuck are you doing

422
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,009
Hey, hey, hey.

423
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,261
Yeah, that tough guy shit's

424
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:45,846
Get the fuck out of here.

425
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,931
I kiII you, motherfucker.

426
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:55,856
Hey, I Iike what you did back there,

427
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,317
-What?
-Know what I mean?

428
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:00,235
You trying to threaten me?

429
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,156
No. I'm just saying if you want me
to do something for you, I'II do it.

You know this nigga?

00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:10,078
Justice.

433

What's up, boy?
Good to see you, Antwan.

434
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,758
The last of my crew was a fat nigga
named Keryl, who was fast on his feet.

435
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,970
So that was the crew.
Antwan, Justice, Keryl and myself.

436
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:30,307
Four niggas dedicated to one thing
and one thing only...

437
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,726
getting paid and getting laid.

438
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,622
-It's pumping out there? Huh?

00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,679
-Get the fuck out.

452
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:28,574
Sit your IittIe ass back down
and enjoy your brew.

453
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:33,287
Nigger, this Marcus' pIace.
Don't ever disrespect this shit.

454
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,373
-What the fuck wrong with you?

Is this the Dangerous CD?
This guy is iII.

457
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:53,182
You don't wanna battle me in the street
with my heat

458
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,392
Them things'll bust
with Dangerous

459
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,060
I need some space...

460
00:32:57,186 --> 00:32:59,938
'cause y'aII are riding Dangerous' nuts
a IittIe too hard over here.

461
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,940
This is street life, all right
The only life l know

462
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:04,359
Bag it up, hit the block

So it's sale after sale

464
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,948
Fire at my feet, fiends all around

465
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:11,825
Don't cross the yellow tape

466
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,498
-Let's go.
-Why?

467
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:20,542
Y'aII gotta go, too. Come on.
We gotta go to work.

468
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:24,880
l was always the first up.
No matter how hard we partied...

469
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:27,341
l made sure my crew worked
twice as hard.

470
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:32,387
The busiest days for us
were the 1st and the 1 5th...

471
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:34,806
when the welfare checks came in.

472
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:45,192
Hey, hey, man.
You're damaging my merchandise.

473
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,110
-You Iike cars?
-Yeah.

474
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:50,030
You know, we couId use some heIp
around here, maybe washing cars...

475
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:51,824
since you Iike
putting fingerprints on things.

476
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:55,369
-No, I ain't washing no cars, man.
-So what you wanna do?

477
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,705
-I wanna buy it.
-Yeah? You got a Iicense?

478
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,958
-No.
-I teII you what.

479
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:04,628
You get you a Iicense, you get you
some money, come taIk to me.

480
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,589
Oh, I'II get the money.

481
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,676
Crack meant money,
money meant power...

482
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:11,927
and power meant war.

483
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,428
Yo, come here, man. Come here.

484
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:15,264
We shot the Colombians.

485
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:22,396
They shot us.

486
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:34,116
Crackheads robbed the Korean store
so many times...

487
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,701
poor guy went crazy.

488
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:53,135
Things got so hot after the death
of those innocent kids...

489
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,597
that even Levar Cahill
had to show up to the funeral.

490
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,144
But his real intentions were
to cool things down...

491
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:03,604
with the Colombians.

492
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,156
Listen, everything's gonna be aII right.

493
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,116
Look at this nigga OdeII.

494
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,328
How much money you think
his motherfucking teeth worth?

495
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,830
$100,000? $200,000?

496
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:33,008
I got someone I want you to meet, man.

497
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:35,719
Yo, Marcus.

498
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:41,642
There's the nigger motherfucker, man.

499
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:50,150
-You know who this is?
-How you doing, Mr. CahiII?

500
00:35:50,526 --> 00:35:53,821
-Who's this IittIe nigga?
-This here our empIoyee of the month.

501
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:56,824
-Yeah, he a worker bee.
-He Iooks famiIiar.

502
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,035
-Remember Katrina?
-Katrina?

503
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:04,957
Trina.

504
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,256
This here her baby boy.

505
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:14,716
Ain't this a bitch?

506
00:36:17,135 --> 00:36:19,680
So you out there grinding,
making some money for me, huh?

507
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:21,014
Yeah.

508
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,558
Mr. CahiII...

509
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:25,310
you Iike a god to me.

510
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:27,396
Like a god.

511
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:29,815
Son...

512
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,401
I am God.

513
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,571
God, AIIah, Buddha...

514
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,574
aII roIIed up into one big nigga.

515
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:43,537
Five-O.

516
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:53,172
Motherfuckers got more shit on me,
put me away for 20 or 30 years.

517
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,924
That's why I got to pay them
so much money.

518
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,599
Levar put his arms around Delgato...

519
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,934
and just like that, the war ended.

520
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,729
Yes, that is it.
That's what I want, right there.

521
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:11,773
Okay, Iadies, this time what I want,
you're with Dangerous....

522
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:14,318
And how did you get invoIved
with Dangerous?

523
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,029
Kid Iost his chain, man.

524
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:21,492
Out here in the streets,
Iose your chain, Iose your baIIs.

525
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:24,786
I found it, gave it back to him.
That's what I do.

526
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,623
I protect him, you know?
Try to Iook out for him.

527
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,628
-What about those guys?
-Right there is your American dream.

528
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:33,003
-What about those guys?
-Right there is your American dream.

529
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:34,922
Hey, yo, Marcus!

00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,092

00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,181

00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,975
-Mind if we take a picture with you?
-AII right, man.

533
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,185

535
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:56,693
Do your thing.

536
00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:00,113
Let's see what you got.
That's it, be hardcore.

537
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:02,741
-You want to--

00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:05,536

-Come on with me. That's cooI.

543
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:19,341
Get your fucking bitch-ass over there.

544
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,510
Hey, man, I got money, see?

00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,853
Hell, l'd take pennies

548
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,372

00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:27,534

I just came to see my mother.

We were teaching a dance cIass

00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,174

Oh, yeah. This is Destin.

00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:35,197
Sing some more.

00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,033
First we get to talking

00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:39,952
Then we get to touching

735

772
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,690
Oh, fuck!

773
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:07,910
-You okay?
-Drive.

774
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:13,832
...we were complicitous ,
as a country, in narcotics traffic...

775
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:18,086
at the same time
as we're spending countless dollars...

776
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:20,714
in this country to try to get rid
of this problem.

777
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:21,882
lt's mind-boggling.

778
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:23,050
What's up?

779
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,010
ln 1987, Oliver North was investigated...

780
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:27,930
for his role in a covert
money-for-arms operation.

781
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:30,766
You're aII right.

782
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:46,740
Breaking out.

783
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:51,954
It's time for bed, huh?

784
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:01,463
-What happened?
-Nothing.

785
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:05,133
Don't Iie to me.
You got bIood on your shoes.

786
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:10,973
Maybe this Iife isn't for me.

787
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:16,812
-Did you kiII him?
-No. I shouId've.

788
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:26,780
Men hide their emotions.
You bury yours, Marcus.

789
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:30,742
You're you and I'm me, CharIene.

790
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:40,752
The cops didn't find that gun
they came looking for.

791
00:57:40,878 --> 00:57:42,671
They found something else instead.

792
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:44,256
-What's this?
-That's your shit.

793
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:46,884
My shit?
Why wouId I keep my shit here?

794
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,427
You're fucked, man.

795
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:52,472
Man, that shit ain't ours!
What the fuck, man!

796
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:00,063
Never seen him before.

797
00:58:03,235 --> 00:58:05,404
Yeah, never seen him before.

798
00:58:08,698 --> 00:58:10,867
AII right, y'aII, settIe down.

799
00:58:11,076 --> 00:58:13,161
Listen up and pay attention.

800
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:17,833
My respect has been taken from me.

801
00:58:20,335 --> 00:58:22,671
Who authorized the CoIombian hit?

802
00:58:32,472 --> 00:58:33,765
AII right.

803
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:39,563
Without getting too bibIicaI and shit,
vioIence onIy begets more vioIence.

804
00:58:40,272 --> 00:58:42,774
It does not beget more money...

805
00:58:43,442 --> 00:58:47,904
which is the reason I thought we were
aII here in the first fucking pIace.

806
00:58:49,156 --> 00:58:52,242
Now, I'm going away
for a short period of time...

807
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:56,121
to pay a poIiticaI debt
to our iIIustrious poIice department.

808
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:00,834
And whiIe I'm away,
I don't want no fucking drama...

809
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:02,878
on our streets...

810
00:59:04,546 --> 00:59:06,256
about anything...

811
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,552
by anyone that's going to draw heat...

812
00:59:10,886 --> 00:59:13,513
or attention to us in any way...

813
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:18,351
unIess you have my fucking permission.

814
00:59:20,896 --> 00:59:24,858
Is there any nigga here
in PeIham HaII...

815
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:29,362
that is uncIear about
what the fuck I just said?

816
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:32,491
Good.

817
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:46,838
So now, for aII you
hearing-impaired motherfuckers...

818
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:49,257
whiIe Levar's down...

819
00:59:50,926 --> 00:59:52,385
I'm number one.

820
00:59:53,762 --> 00:59:55,889
So now, if you have any probIems...

821
00:59:56,848 --> 00:59:58,225
come see me.

822
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:03,897
Marcus. Come here.

823
01:00:13,615 --> 01:00:14,783
WeII, then...

824
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:17,369
my brothers.

825
01:00:26,878 --> 01:00:30,215
Now, next time you have a probIem,
you come see me.

826
01:00:31,883 --> 01:00:34,928
See, now you gonna have
to take the faII for this buIIshit.

827
01:00:35,011 --> 01:00:38,432
-Cops, man, they pIanted that shit.
-No, they didn't.

828
01:00:39,641 --> 01:00:41,643
We know who's doing what.

829
01:00:42,936 --> 01:00:45,814
See, now be carefuI
who you Iet in your house.

830
01:00:45,981 --> 01:00:48,108
'Cause someone cIose to you
is using.

831
01:01:11,506 --> 01:01:12,674
Soap up.

832
01:01:13,258 --> 01:01:14,968
Being reaI cheap on the soap.

833
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:18,054
And y'aII can turn the water up
a IittIe bit in here.

834
01:01:31,193 --> 01:01:33,153
Yo, man! Guard!

835
01:01:33,236 --> 01:01:35,697
Fight! We got a fight over here!

836
01:02:19,116 --> 01:02:20,742
You saved my Iife.

837
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:21,993
Let's go.

838
01:02:22,077 --> 01:02:23,078
Hmm-hmm.

839
01:02:25,122 --> 01:02:26,915
This way. Keep going.

840
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:28,875
Why?

841
01:02:32,712 --> 01:02:36,425
I don't know.
Looked Iike you needed saving.

842
01:02:41,096 --> 01:02:42,180
What's your name?

843
01:02:43,473 --> 01:02:44,599
Marcus.

844
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:48,061
Bama. Nice to meet you.

845
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:54,651
-Bama. You from AIabama?
-No, North CaroIina.

846
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:59,781
North CaroIina?
So why they caII you Bama?

847
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:03,243
I didn't want foIks caIIing me Lina.

848
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,887
Somebody wanted me to kill myself.

849
01:04:05,972 --> 01:04:07,641
Thought about it.

850
01:04:08,308 --> 01:04:10,227
Thought about my mother.

851
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:16,066
l was in a tomb, just like her...

852
01:04:18,693 --> 01:04:20,821
and l had to find a way out.

853
01:04:24,574 --> 01:04:26,159
l went forward...

854
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:28,703
made my mark.

855
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:32,082
lt was either express myself or die.

856
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:36,211
l know l did a lot of bad things
in my life...

857
01:04:37,546 --> 01:04:39,005
but from that moment on...

858
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:41,591
l decided to tell the truth.

859
01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:45,262
And l wasn't gonna back down.

860
01:05:00,861 --> 01:05:03,530
Levar was not expecting
things to change.

861
01:05:03,822 --> 01:05:05,240
DeaI with it, okay?

862
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:09,453
But after the shooting, he wasn't
gonna pay a little political debt.

863
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:13,540
He was gonna pay with his life.

864
01:05:15,751 --> 01:05:17,586
Majestic set him up...

865
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:20,422
and blamed it all on Odell.

866
01:05:20,547 --> 01:05:23,341
This nigga been working
for the CoIombians.

867
01:05:23,842 --> 01:05:26,762
Betrayed Levar. Cost us money.

868
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:29,723
Now, how he gonna pay?

869
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,601
Let's pay him in diamonds and goId.

870
01:05:33,852 --> 01:05:38,398
You right, motherfucker.
Them shiny-ass motherfucking teeth.

871
01:05:46,615 --> 01:05:48,283
I can't trust you?

872
01:05:50,494 --> 01:05:52,662
Are you working with the CoIombians?

873
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:02,672
Nigga, you the one set up Levar, nigga!

874
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:06,218
That was you who set up Levar, nigga!

875
01:06:06,301 --> 01:06:09,221
Come on, man!
That was you that set up Levar!

876
01:06:10,847 --> 01:06:12,099
Oh, shit.

877
01:06:14,976 --> 01:06:18,355
Everybody reIax. We're aII friends here.

878
01:06:20,273 --> 01:06:22,442
Levar fucked your bitch!

879
01:06:23,819 --> 01:06:26,363
You got a Iot of mouth on you, OdeII.

880
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,284
Levar fucked your bitch, nigga!

881
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:34,830
-Yeah, babe?
-Levar fucked Katrina.

882
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:52,305
Majestic began his rise to the top...

883
01:06:52,597 --> 01:06:54,975
and Dangerous crowned it all
with a song.

884
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:06,236
People got shot.

885
01:07:08,488 --> 01:07:10,282
People disappeared.

886
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:14,786
And Majestic felt like
nobody could touch him.

887
01:07:18,123 --> 01:07:21,293
Yeah, turn my music up.

888
01:07:21,376 --> 01:07:23,170
Turn it up in my headphones
a little bit, son.

889
01:07:23,295 --> 01:07:24,504
Yeah, we're gonna have to see.

890
01:07:24,629 --> 01:07:27,549
What up? Yo, Majestic! You!
What up, baby?

891
01:07:27,632 --> 01:07:31,178
Yeah. Yeah. lt's like this. Come on.

892
01:07:31,303 --> 01:07:34,598
Niggas that pull their heat
And get shook, die on the streets

893
01:07:34,723 --> 01:07:38,393
You can't look weak
Niggas'll lay you down six feet

894
01:07:38,518 --> 01:07:42,105
And when you lay down
You keep an eye open when you sleep

895
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:45,859
We took the food out your belly, nigga
How you gonna eat?

896
01:07:45,984 --> 01:07:48,528
You want me
You can find me on the block

897
01:07:48,653 --> 01:07:49,696
See you in the morning.

898
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:53,700
And l will squeeze off rounds and watch
them slugs split your hairpiece

899
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:57,454
We run these streets
Where murderers and gangstas meet

900
01:07:57,579 --> 01:07:58,580
Black skull, nigga

901
01:07:58,705 --> 01:08:02,542
We pull the ice and gold
Straight out your teeth up in the NYC

902
01:08:14,096 --> 01:08:16,932
Now you Iisten, gangster. Listen.

903
01:08:21,937 --> 01:08:24,106
-Where's Majestic?
-No, man, no, man!

904
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:29,861
TeII Majestic we caIIed.

905
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:39,162
You know, I ain't never trusted foIks.

906
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:44,292
See, where I grew up...

907
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:46,920
there was a whoIe bunch...

908
01:08:47,504 --> 01:08:49,297
of jeaIous cats.

909
01:08:51,466 --> 01:08:54,594
They used to be mad
'cause I was Iight-skinned, you know?

910
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:58,849
They used to grab me after schooI
when I was in first grade and be Iike:

911
01:08:58,974 --> 01:09:01,435
''Smack him and watch him turn red.''

912
01:09:02,727 --> 01:09:06,898
So I got me a screwdriver and started
carrying that with me to schooI.

913
01:09:06,982 --> 01:09:08,483
They ain't smack me no more.

914
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:15,866
-What's wrong with you, man?
-I just wanna kiII somebody.

915
01:09:18,076 --> 01:09:20,537
-Who?
-Anybody.

916
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,918
There's a whoIe Iot of anybodies
in the worId, man.

917
01:09:30,422 --> 01:09:32,758
You know,
I had this image in my head...

918
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:35,510
of Rick James kiIIing my mama.

919
01:09:38,388 --> 01:09:41,516
I mean that.
I know Rick James ain't kiII my mama.

920
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:44,811
He just favored this dude named SIim,
you know.

921
01:09:47,064 --> 01:09:49,232
WeII, what you got in your head now?

922
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:52,444
AII kinds of images.

923
01:09:59,284 --> 01:10:02,204
lt usually goes down
over money and whores

924
01:10:02,287 --> 01:10:05,248
But lil' homie, in my hood
When it rains it pours

925
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:06,333
This is real

926
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:08,251
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours

927
01:10:08,376 --> 01:10:11,088
Hollow-tips and Talons
When it rains it pours

928
01:10:11,213 --> 01:10:13,840
You caught in lead showers
Just because

929
01:10:13,965 --> 01:10:16,885
Niggas ain't playin'
When it rains it pours

930
01:10:19,096 --> 01:10:23,725
The Colombians hit back at Majestic
by cutting off his supply of drugs.

931
01:10:26,228 --> 01:10:27,896
Eventually, just like Levar...

932
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:31,024
Majestic had to go
shake hands with Delgato.

933
01:10:32,442 --> 01:10:34,528
But neither were happy about it.

934
01:10:35,987 --> 01:10:39,825
One shot, one kill, what's the deal?
Yo, what's the deal?

935
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,245
Listen, lil' homie
When it rains it pours

936
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,248
Hollow-tips and Talons
When it rains it pours

937
01:10:46,373 --> 01:10:49,209
You caught in lead showers
Just because

938
01:10:49,292 --> 01:10:52,129
Niggas ain't playin'
When it rains it pours

939
01:10:52,254 --> 01:10:55,006
Niggas get set up
'Cause when it rains it pours

940
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,008
End up wet up
'Cause when it rains it pours

941
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:58,176
What's up?

942
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:01,471
-You need a manager.
-A manager?

943
01:11:01,721 --> 01:11:03,723
ln my hood, when it rains it pours

944
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:06,726

01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:36,715
-Did you miss me?
-Yeah, I missed you.

01:11:46,391 --> 01:11:49,603
You know.
I ain't been doing much taIking.

957
01:11:52,147 --> 01:11:54,816
You aIways have so much to say
in your music.

958
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:56,777
How come you're quiet now?

959
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,695
It's a different part of the brain.

960
01:12:01,073 --> 01:12:02,532
The part you never Iet anyone see?

961
01:12:03,283 --> 01:12:04,493

-It's beautifuI.
-Yeah, it's nice.

1041
01:17:47,669 --> 01:17:50,464
I used to come here

1042
01:18:09,775 --> 01:18:13,111
After the baby's born,

You sure you didn't get this

You got your answer, man.

1071
01:19:58,633 --> 01:20:01,595
-No.
-Let's see if Dangerous can take a joke.

1072
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,598
Dangerous in the booth
But not in the streets

1073
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,059
You a Jehovah Witness, nigga!

1074

Your daddy a doctor in Riverdale,

This can get me kiIIed.

01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:17,110
You talk that shit,

1078
01:20:17,235 --> 01:20:19,279
We got to stop this
from getting out there.

1079
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:21,615
''We?''

1080
01:20:24,493 --> 01:20:27,704
Fuck you gonna do

1081
01:20:31,124 --> 01:20:34,044
Up you come, beautifuI. Up you come.

1082
01:20:34,544 --> 01:20:36,505
There you go, beautifuI.

1083
01:20:50,185 --> 01:20:51,770
Life is precious.

1084
01:20:52,938 --> 01:20:57,025
TeII Marcus to apoIogize.
It's best for everyone.

1085
01:21:10,664 --> 01:21:12,749
Motherfucker touched my kid.

1086
01:21:16,253 --> 01:21:18,213
Nobody touches my famiIy.

1087
01:21:19,005 --> 01:21:21,049
I want security, 24/7.

1088
01:21:22,259 --> 01:21:23,343
Done.

1089
01:21:24,928 --> 01:21:29,182
Look, Marcus, man, I'm sorry,
I don't know how he knew.

Welcome to hell

01:21:58,003 --> 01:21:59,963
My hood, there's no telling
What they do to you

1097
01:22:00,088 --> 01:22:01,840
Across the street from Lucifer, he's only

1098
01:22:01,923 --> 01:22:03,800
Man, who's he taIking about?

1099
01:22:04,134 --> 01:22:06,636
Nigga, turn around and push the button.

1100
01:22:06,762 --> 01:22:08,305
You'll be losing your brain

1101
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:11,099
And your boss is a bitch
He snitched on Levar

1102
01:22:11,224 --> 01:22:13,852
Junebug's a fucking flunky
l don't trust him, either

1103
01:22:13,935 --> 01:22:16,646
Eeney meeney miney mo

01:22:20,734 --> 01:22:24,613
-He ain't gonna Iike that.
-You know what? Fuck Majestic.

1106
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:31,244
This song is about you.

1107
01:22:32,454 --> 01:22:35,082
''CIick cIack pow, officer down.''

1108
01:22:39,795 --> 01:22:41,713
He the fucking snitch.

1109
01:22:42,756 --> 01:22:45,425
From this day on, he ain't nothing to me.

1110
01:22:46,468 --> 01:22:47,636
Nothing.

1111
01:22:50,305 --> 01:22:53,141
End it. And get rid of the manager, too.

1112
01:22:53,266 --> 01:22:55,644
I don't wanna get anybody kiIIed, man.

1113
01:22:57,062 --> 01:22:58,271
Let's go.

1114
01:23:30,846 --> 01:23:33,181
Since Majestic couldn't get to us...

1115
01:23:33,306 --> 01:23:34,725
he made sure
we couldn't get a record deal.

1116
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,687
It's Young Caesar.

1117
01:23:48,905 --> 01:23:52,868
Fuck, man. This shit is crazy, man.
They trying to shut us down.

1118
01:23:53,034 --> 01:23:56,830
Fuck it. Why don't we just go back
to doing what we do best?

1119
01:23:57,456 --> 01:24:00,667
-I can't do that.
-I ain't taIking about crack.

1120
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:05,422
-I got something eIse in mind.
-What you taIking about?

1121
01:24:05,714 --> 01:24:07,758
And that's when l made
the biggest mistake of my life.

1122
01:24:08,925 --> 01:24:11,762
I'm teIIing you,
CoIombians are Iike cIockwork, right?

1123
01:24:11,887 --> 01:24:13,346

1124
01:24:13,472 --> 01:24:14,848
to take care of
their IittIe paper probIems.

1125
01:24:14,931 --> 01:24:18,518
So we ain't gotta worry about no five-o
or nothing Iike that, you know?

1126
01:24:18,643 --> 01:24:21,730
'Cause these cats ain't trying
to draw no attention to themseIves.

1127
01:24:22,647 --> 01:24:25,609
-See, just Iike cIockwork, DeIgato.
-Are we doing this?

Yeah, we gonna do it.
So, what you think, man?

1129
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,863
This is a robbery.

1130
01:24:29,988 --> 01:24:31,990
We gonna go in there,
we gonna do what we gotta do...

1131
01:24:32,074 --> 01:24:34,576
-and we ain't gonna hurt nobody.
-For reaI, man.

1132
01:24:35,494 --> 01:24:38,163
-What the fuck is that, man?
-It's Spanish.

1133
01:24:38,622 --> 01:24:40,999
You don't know

1134
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:45,378
What the fuck is que sera?

1135
01:24:45,462 --> 01:24:47,547
Let that shit ride, man.

1136
01:25:53,029 --> 01:25:55,657
l thought l heard
my mother call my name.

1137
01:25:57,117 --> 01:25:59,286
Turned out it was my grandma.

1138
01:26:00,245 --> 01:26:01,872
That's what saved my life.

1139
01:26:01,997 --> 01:26:03,206

01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:15,010
Love will get you killed.

1143
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:16,678
You have a gift.

1144

You're a poet.

Four-year-oId kid. Drive-by shooting.

01:29:39,214 --> 01:29:40,382
Rapper.

Don't you ever pull a gun on me.

1195
01:30:30,807 --> 01:30:32,768

01:30:33,435 --> 01:30:35,645
-Anything eIse on you?
-No, man. That ain't for you.

Oh, shit.

01:30:52,454 --> 01:30:55,248
-He ain't dead.
-What?

1202
01:30:55,707 --> 01:30:57,542
He ain't fucking dead.

I shot him, Iike, nine times.

1204
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:08,053
You shot him nine times?

1205
01:31:39,084 --> 01:31:41,169
Yeah, Dangerous.
Running these streets.

I feeI Iike I'm Iosing him.

1209
01:32:29,551 --> 01:32:31,053
He's given up.

1210
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,043
Is this it?

1211
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:09,800
This. This pIace? This Iife?

1212
01:33:12,094 --> 01:33:13,345
Is this it for us?

1213
01:33:21,436 --> 01:33:23,105
I'm IoneIy, Marcus.

1214
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:31,238
I know you're in pain.
You've aIways had pain.

1215
01:33:33,073 --> 01:33:34,658
And I understood.

1216
01:33:35,617 --> 01:33:39,538
'Cause when I used to Iook at you,
it was Iike Iooking in the mirror.

1217
01:33:39,663 --> 01:33:41,164
Thought I knew you.

1218
01:33:43,375 --> 01:33:46,920
But when I Iook at you,
aII I see is a weak person.

1219
01:33:50,924 --> 01:33:52,884
I feeI sorry for your son.

1220
01:33:54,678 --> 01:33:57,597
He's just another IittIe bIack boy
with nobody to Iook up to.

1221
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,146
I don't want him to see you Iike this.

1222
01:34:26,418 --> 01:34:28,128
What are you doing?

1223
01:34:34,426 --> 01:34:35,469
What?

1224
01:34:36,678 --> 01:34:38,638
I can do without anything.

1225
01:34:40,348 --> 01:34:42,476
You can do without anything?

Can you do without me?

1227

01:35:44,246 --> 01:35:45,539
I'm sorry.

1232
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:52,546
No, baby. I'm so sorry.

1233
01:36:20,657 --> 01:36:22,576

01:36:24,202 --> 01:36:26,204
-FeeI.
-FeeI what?

1235
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,417
Your tongue?

1236
01:36:36,047 --> 01:36:37,549
Is that the fragment?

1237
01:36:59,863 --> 01:37:01,823
I wanna feeI your body.

1238

-PIay it back.

1246
01:38:20,485 --> 01:38:23,405
Two niggas in the front
Two niggas in the back

1247
01:38:23,488 --> 01:38:25,824
That's four niggas ridin' strapped

1248
01:38:25,907 --> 01:38:27,784

Even though she causes the drama
You love your baby mama

1252
01:38:43,091 --> 01:38:45,719
l hit her with the Llama
To get this cake

1253
01:38:45,802 --> 01:38:48,847
Give us the coke, the cash
The combo to the safe

1254
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:51,600
Oh, she don't know it
Damn, okay, we'll wait

1255
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:53,977
'Cause you can pray for a miracle

1256
01:38:56,188 --> 01:38:57,147
What's wrong?

1257
01:38:57,272 --> 01:38:59,232
My voice don't sound the same.

1258
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:00,734
It's better.

1259
01:39:03,862 --> 01:39:06,865
-It's got more pain in it.
-For reaIIy.

1260
01:39:07,616 --> 01:39:09,117

1269
01:39:34,643 --> 01:39:37,104
l'll whip your head, boy

1270
01:39:37,187 --> 01:39:39,648
Top feeIs so much better
than the bottom.

1271
01:39:40,649 --> 01:39:42,567
So much better.

1272
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:46,279
Nigga, you's a window shopper

1273
01:39:46,363 --> 01:39:49,116
Mad at me, l think l know why

1274
01:39:49,241 --> 01:39:51,493
Nigga, you's a window shopper

1275
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:54,538
ln the jewelry store
Looking at shit you can't buy

1276
01:39:54,663 --> 01:39:57,082
Nigga, you's a window shopper

1277
01:39:57,165 --> 01:40:00,168
ln the dealership
Trying to get a test drive

1278
01:40:00,293 --> 01:40:02,504
Nigga, you's a window shopper

1279
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:05,674
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

1280
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:08,260
Summertime
White Porsche Carrera is milky

1281
01:40:08,385 --> 01:40:10,971
l'm on the grind
Let my paper stack when l'm filthy

1282
01:40:11,096 --> 01:40:13,807
lt's funny how niggas
Get to screw-facing at me

1283
01:40:13,932 --> 01:40:16,685
Anyhow, they ain't got
The heart to get at me

1284
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:19,438
l'll get down
Southside's the hood that l come from

1285
01:40:19,521 --> 01:40:22,274
So l don't cruise through nobody hood
Without my gun

1286
01:40:22,357 --> 01:40:24,943
You know the kid
Ain't goin' for all that bullshit

1287
01:40:25,026 --> 01:40:27,738
Try and stick me, l'm a let off a full clip

1288
01:40:27,863 --> 01:40:30,365
Everybody mad
When their paper don't stack right

1289
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:33,160
But when l come around
Y'all niggas better act right

1290
01:40:33,285 --> 01:40:37,164
When we got the tops down
You can hear the system thump

1291
01:40:37,247 --> 01:40:40,876
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'
Shut your block down

1292
01:40:41,042 --> 01:40:43,879
Who's your daddy, boy? Huh?

1293
01:40:44,004 --> 01:40:44,880
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'

1294
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,922
Nigga, when we rollin' rollin' rollin'

1295
01:40:46,047 --> 01:40:47,799
Who's your daddy?

1296
01:40:48,425 --> 01:40:52,429
l think l know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper

1297
01:40:52,554 --> 01:40:55,974
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

1298
01:41:02,522 --> 01:41:04,274
You have to go back?

1299
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:06,693
Yeah.

1300
01:41:07,944 --> 01:41:10,363
There's some things
I need the answers to.

1301
01:41:10,864 --> 01:41:13,658
I'd rather die Iike a man
than Iive Iike a coward.

1302
01:41:20,916 --> 01:41:22,918
Majestic reaIIy Ioved your mama.

1303
01:41:24,086 --> 01:41:25,796
One day he came to me and asked...

1304
01:41:25,921 --> 01:41:28,965
if there was anything
between me and your mother...

1305
01:41:29,091 --> 01:41:30,717
and I Iied to him.

1306
01:41:31,426 --> 01:41:34,304
l told him
l was only trying to protect her.

1307
01:41:35,263 --> 01:41:37,224
lt was far more than that.

1308
01:41:39,393 --> 01:41:42,062
Your mama didn't want
to take my family life from me...

1309
01:41:44,314 --> 01:41:46,483
but she gave me everything...

1310
01:41:47,692 --> 01:41:49,319
and I took it aII.

1311
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:55,117
In the end, I didn't protect her.

1312
01:41:56,201 --> 01:41:57,577
Sometimes...

1313
01:41:59,746 --> 01:42:02,207
l feel like l killed her myself.

1314
01:42:04,459 --> 01:42:06,336
When I first saw you...

1315
01:42:08,213 --> 01:42:10,173
you was a IittIe baby.

1316
01:42:11,967 --> 01:42:14,428
I couIdn't even Iook you in the eye.

1317
01:42:16,722 --> 01:42:18,265
What you saying?

1318
01:42:20,642 --> 01:42:23,437
One night, after midnight...

1319
01:42:24,896 --> 01:42:28,400
l was sitting here.
Word came through that you was gone.

1320
01:42:29,276 --> 01:42:30,694
You was dead.

1321
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:34,948
For the first time in my fucking Iife,
I feII to my knees...

1322
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:38,201
and I prayed to God
that nothing happened.

1323
01:42:38,535 --> 01:42:40,620
So I prayed to your mama.

1324
01:42:41,371 --> 01:42:43,665
I asked her to forgive me...

1325
01:42:43,915 --> 01:42:46,793
and to taIk to God for me
to bring you back.

1326
01:42:49,838 --> 01:42:51,590
l don't deserve you.

1327
01:42:57,429 --> 01:42:59,890
Rocks that l copped
From proceeds from the spot

1328
01:43:00,015 --> 01:43:02,851
l got the energy to win
l'm full of adrenaline

1329
01:43:02,976 --> 01:43:05,437
Play the curve and get nauseous
Watchin' the spinner spin

1330
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,106
l made plans to make it
A prisoner of the state

1331
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:10,776
Now l can invite your ass
out to my estate

1332
01:43:10,859 --> 01:43:13,612
Them hollow-tips bent me up
But l'm back in shape

1333
01:43:13,695 --> 01:43:16,823
Pour Cristal in the blender
Make a protein shake

1334
01:43:17,115 --> 01:43:18,617
He's coming, y'all.

1335
01:43:18,992 --> 01:43:22,454
Our own Young Caesar
is coming back to Pelham Hall...

1336
01:43:22,579 --> 01:43:24,748
July 4, 8:00 p.m. Be there.

1337
01:43:24,873 --> 01:43:27,459

01:43:27,542 --> 01:43:29,294
So l hustle

1339
01:43:29,377 --> 01:43:32,923
Nigga, you gettin' in my way
When l'm tryin' to get mine

1340
01:43:33,048 --> 01:43:34,674
And l'll buck you

1341
01:43:35,175 --> 01:43:38,011
l don't care who you run with
Or where you from

1342
01:43:38,345 --> 01:43:40,180
Nigga, fuck you

01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:43,683

1344
01:43:43,892 --> 01:43:45,268
So l hustle

1345
01:43:45,394 --> 01:43:48,313
l don't know shit about gymnastics
l somersault bricks

1346
01:43:48,397 --> 01:43:50,899
Black Talons start flyin'
When a nigga flip

1347
01:43:51,024 --> 01:43:53,985
Yo, nigga, you gotta
turn this shit the fuck off.

1348
01:43:54,236 --> 01:43:57,739
What you want me to do?

1349
01:44:00,742 --> 01:44:02,536
-Stop the crack!

1350
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:05,872
-Stop the crack!
-Give us back our street!

1351
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:09,876
Papi, do you have any controI
over your neighborhood?

1352
01:44:10,001 --> 01:44:11,878
Don't fucking worry about nothing,

1353
01:44:12,003 --> 01:44:14,673
-You gonna Iet him pIay this concert?
-You worry too much, Mira.

1354
01:44:14,756 --> 01:44:16,633
Man, Iisten to this.

1355
01:44:16,758 --> 01:44:18,719

Stop the crack! Stop the crack!

1357
01:44:44,786 --> 01:44:46,747
Does he have to do this?

1358
01:44:47,914 --> 01:44:49,499
I think he does.

1359
01:44:57,174 --> 01:45:00,385
Antwan. Remember,
you keep him covered, aII right?

1360
01:45:00,469 --> 01:45:01,762
AII right.

1361
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:07,559
So what's happening, man?

1362
01:45:10,812 --> 01:45:12,105
Bye, Nana.

1363
01:45:15,067 --> 01:45:19,362
Last time I saw your mother, she was
saying goodbye in that front room.

1364
01:45:22,866 --> 01:45:25,243
You Ieave enough protection here?

1365
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:28,997
Yeah, y'aII gonna be aII right. Yeah.

1366
01:45:30,499 --> 01:45:32,667
This one is IegaIIy owned.

1367
01:45:34,544 --> 01:45:36,963
If it comes down to it,
I got a knife in that drawer.

1368
01:45:37,089 --> 01:45:40,092
That's aII I know.
That's aII any mother knows.

1369
01:45:40,801 --> 01:45:42,469
I'II be okay, Nana.

1370
01:45:44,012 --> 01:45:47,307
You can't take that from a person,
being a protector.

1371
01:45:47,682 --> 01:45:49,684
That's aII any man or woman is at
the end of the day anyway...

1372
01:45:49,684 --> 01:45:50,477
That's aII any man or woman is at

1373
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,520
is a protector.

1374
01:45:52,562 --> 01:45:55,315
Protector of a chiId
who wiII one day die.

1375
01:45:58,318 --> 01:45:59,528
Marcus...

1376
01:46:00,487 --> 01:46:03,990
when I Iook in your eyes,
I don't know what you thinking.

1377
01:46:04,699 --> 01:46:06,618
And you've been Iike that
since you were 12...

1378
01:46:06,701 --> 01:46:08,829
since the day your mama died.

1379
01:46:09,287 --> 01:46:11,498
-I'II be okay.
-No...

1380
01:46:12,249 --> 01:46:15,001
you wiII not be aII right, Marcus.

For this gangsta shit, they love me

1428
01:51:16,678 --> 01:51:19,264
Black Chukkas, black skullies
Leather Pelle Pelle

Got the silver duct tape
On my .38 handle

1432
01:51:24,895 --> 01:51:27,314
The women in my life
Bring confusion and shit

1433
01:51:27,397 --> 01:51:30,150
So like Nino in New Jack

Man, my heart done froze

And make that snow

1438
01:51:41,203 --> 01:51:43,955
Sit back, watch it turn to dope
Watch it go out the door

1439
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:48,335
O after O, you know
Homie, l'm just triple beam dreamin'

01:51:52,339 --> 01:51:54,508
Conceal my weapon nice and neat
So you can't see

1443
01:51:54,591 --> 01:51:57,719
The penitentiary is definitely out
The question for me

1444
01:51:58,387 --> 01:52:00,931

Nigga, you get in my way
When l'm tryin' to get mine

1447
01:52:06,895 --> 01:52:08,688
And l'll buck you

1448
01:52:08,939 --> 01:52:12,067
l don't care who you run with
Or where you from

1449
01:52:12,234 --> 01:52:14,069
Nigga, fuck you

lts a hustler's ambition
Close your eyes, listen, see my vision

1453
01:52:22,536 --> 01:52:26,373
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
And drama means nothin'

1454
01:52:26,498 --> 01:52:29,209
lt's part of the game
Catch me in the coupe, switchin' lanes

1455
01:52:29,292 --> 01:52:30,585
Or in the jeweler's, switchin' chains

1456
01:52:30,711 --> 01:52:33,380
l upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS

1457
01:52:33,505 --> 01:52:35,716
Rocks that l copped
From proceeds from the spot

1458
01:52:35,799 --> 01:52:38,635
l got the energy to win
l'm full of adrenaline

1459
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:41,179
Play the curve and get nauseous
Watchin' the spinner spin

1460
01:52:41,263 --> 01:52:44,141
l made plans to make it
A prisoner of the state

1461
01:52:44,266 --> 01:52:46,601
Now l can invite your ass
out to my estate

1462
01:52:46,727 --> 01:52:49,396
Them hollow-tips bent me up
But l'm back in shape

1463
01:52:49,521 --> 01:52:52,023
Pour Cristal in the blender
And make a protein shake

1464
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:54,901
l'm like the East Coast's
number one playboy, B

1465
01:52:54,985 --> 01:52:57,654
Hugh Hefner'll tell you
He ain't got shit on me

1466
01:52:57,779 --> 01:53:00,282
The Feds watching me
lcy, they can't stop me

1467
01:53:00,490 --> 01:53:03,702
Racist pointing at me:
"Look at Niggerace." Hello!
