00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,985
No more room? No more room?

165
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,865
Pray tell, what Une twat
did he deem more worthy?

166
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,491
Longfellow!

167
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,743
Longfellow?!

168
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,075
Longfellow!

169
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,614
Where is ii?

170
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,499
- Where is what?
- The trash bin.

171
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:32,881
That is where all this brain-sucking,
soul-warping fish wrap should be put!

172
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,416
That's lovely, Eddy.

173
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,177
A real show of adjectival fireworks
from the great Poe himself.

174
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,715
Not only do you refuse
to print my review of Longfellow,

175
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,134
but you run
his third-rate poem instead!

176
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,894
- People like Longfellow.
- Editors like you tell them to.

177
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,430
Have you no soul, Henry?

178
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,725
Does the artistic enrichment
of your readers mean nothing to you?

179
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,734
Artistic enrichment?

180
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,363
You've got some gall, barging
into my office and lecturing me

181
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,820
when ail you do
is criticise others' work!

182
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,575
Not true. Not true at all.

183
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:06,285
You called Emerson
a "sad, festering literary whore".

184
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,040
Because he is precisely that.

185
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,499
Is honesty now a vice, or do you
prefer that jaded hack, Griswold,

186
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,131
fawning over some steaming mound
of hackneyed tripe?

187
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,634
- Doesn't think much of YOUR stuff.
- He's an intellectual nonentity.

188
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,172
He's a buffoon, which is probably why
he's so at home here with you.

189
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,715
Aw, you're out of control.

190
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,102
I'm broke.

191
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,639
Then try writing
another "Tell-Tale Heart".

192
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,183
People love blood. They love death.

193
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,774
If I couldn't churn out a "Tell-Tale
Heart" or a "Pit and the Pendulum".

194
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,189
I'd indenture
my very soul to the devil.

195
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,029
You've got to publish my review.
I'm desperate.

196
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,070
I need stories. Gripping stories.

197
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,036
I've got nothing left.

198
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,295
I've used up all my tricks.

199
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,004
Try laying off the liquor and
tinctures. it's rotting your brain.

200
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,043
I only drink occasionally,

201
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,133
to be social,
to alleviate my shyness.

202
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,474
And the tinctures
are purely therapeutic.

203
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,057
A slight palliative against the chill
of an orphan's despair.

204
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,314
- Write me something I can sell.
- You're a real bastard, Henry.

205
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,276
Why are you doing this?!
Why?!

206
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,570
What have I done?!

207
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,364
Please!

208
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,453
No!

00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,305

00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,980
Agh! Argh!

AAARGHH!

Consider, Carl, if you will,
the human heart.

214
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,679
This small chamber,

a vacancy,

of our species are hidden.

00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,931

I think that it is the most romantic
thing I've ever read.

So, I had to hear about your stunt
all afternoon.

241

E wanted to see if I could get that
vein on the side of his neck

- to finally explode.

Yes, and I consider it my duty

to wrestle you away
from that gun-toting Philistine.

And into the arms of you,

- Who better?
- Then why antagonise him?

248
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,001
I can't help it.
I despise people who despise me.

- What is Carl eating?
- Fi heart.

- A human heart?
- Mm-hm.

252
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,426
- How in heaven did you come by ii?
- An admirer works at the morgue.

253
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,218
I was searching for inspiration.

254
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,309
So tell me again exactly...

255
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:27,602
how much... money you made

256
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,238
from your self-proclaimed
world-famous poem about that bird?

257
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,241
Raven. $9. But did I mention
that it's world-famous?

258
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,619
Edgar... Edgar.

259
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,654
We can't go on like this.

Emily, what do you want?

261
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,873
I want you to get up off your knees

unless you intend to use
that position for another purpose.

263
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,171
The imagination reels
with possibilities.

264
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,711
But what did you have in mind
specifically?

265
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,755
A proposal.

266
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,720
- You mean marriage?
- {SIGHS}

267
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:03,229
it's not such a horrible thought.
People still do it from time to time.

268
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:07,187
- Really? When?
- When they're in love, I suppose.

269
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:13,447
If I were in love with that person,
would I think about her all the time?

270
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,074
Most likely.

271
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,282
And would I spend
every waking moment

272
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,698
desiring to smother the other
with affection?

273

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,640
- Why is hair attracted to a magnet?
- What?

322
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,979
Scot is merely carbon residue
from coal and wood.

323
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,017
Am I under arrest?

324
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,482
I'm Detective Fields.
Please, sit down, Mr Poe.

325
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:43,070
Yes, the infamous Detective Fields.
Am I under arrest?

326
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,159
No. Not as yet.

327
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,071
Then I'd rather stand.
It makes it easier to leave.

328
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,990
I am...

329
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,375
I'm a reader of your work.

330
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,378
I admit my admirers have gone
to great lengths to meet me.

331
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,539
I didn't say I was an admirer.

332
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,333
And yet you read them.

333
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,014
The night before last a girl
and her mother were found murdered,

334
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,845
the daughter lodged in a chimney,

335
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,887
the mother's head nearly severed
with a straight razor.

336
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,770
The killer Ned through a window

337
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,183
in which a lock was feigned
with a nail sawn in half.

338
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:22,196
Does any of this
sound familiar to you, Mr Poe?

339
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,611
But you're talking about my story.

340
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,697
A work of Notion.

341
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,785
I'm afraid I'm not.

342
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,924
According to various witnesses,
you were seen drunk two nights ago

343
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,880
in a tavern near the harbour.

344
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,588
What time did you leave?

345
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,138
I don't remember.

346
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,727
My leaving was... involuntary.

347
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,519
Do you actually think
that I murdered these people?

348
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,654
May I see your hand?

349
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,194
Which one?

350
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,405
Either will do.

351
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,495
Perhaps with the aid of accomplices

352
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,706
such a scenario
might be conceivable,

353
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,210
however improbable.

354
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,170
Yet what cannot be disputed

355
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:31,807
is the fact that your imagination
has inspired a horrendous crime.

356
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,842
Am I to be charged, then?

357
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,183
Is imagination now a felony?

00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,098
- {KNOCKING AT DOOR}
- Come!

359
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,813
Inspector, can I have a word?

{GAGGING}

362
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,247
This is Henry Maddux,
editor of the "Baltimore Patriot".

363
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,958
He was brought in
to identify the body.

364
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:07,048
His name is... I mean, was...
Gris... Griswold.

365
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,758
- Ludwig Griswold.
- He worked for you?

366
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,639
- Freelance writer.
- What things did he write?

367
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,802
Some poetry. Mostly criticism.
You know, the easy stuff.

368
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,222
Did he have a relationship
with Edgar Allan Poe?

369
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,983
Of course. They hated each other.
Had a vicious feud a year ago.

370
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,894
Sold a lot of papers.

371
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,190
- How long have you known Mr Poe?
- Edgar? Well, the past ten years.

372
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:32,280
You published his story,
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue".

373
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,195
He wrote that several years back
in Philadelphia.

374
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,239
I reprinted it
a couple of times here.

375
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,625
People love the gory ones.

376
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,168
So they do.

377
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,001
Edgar isn't a suspect,
is he, Inspector?

378
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,008
At this point everyone is a suspect,
Mr Maddux.

379
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,044
Forgive me.

380
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:56,343
I know there is a darkness
to Edgar, but...

381
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,101
they're all up in here.

382
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,184
Every woman he's ever loved
has died in his arms.

383
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:07,069
I believe that God gave him a spark
of genius and quenched it in misery.

384
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,777
But as far as something like this...

385
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:16,412
The only thing he's ever killed
is a bottle of brandy.

386
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,447
Thank you for your time, sir.

387
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,129
This may come
as a shock to you, Mr Poe,

388
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:30,464
but we are in dire need
of your unwholesome expertise.

the counterweight to be... so large.

391
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,939
We have reason to believe
you knew the victim.

392
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,199
- Really?
- If you would?

393
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,744
I don't believe I know him.

394
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,080
Then perhaps
this will jar your memory.

Yes.

'42. "Tales of Ratiocination. "

403
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,355
Are there other stories
in the collection?

404
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,320
- Many.
- Specifically about murder?

405
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,950
I'm afraid so.

406
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,111
As unfortunate as this is,

407
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,249
you may be uniquely qualified
lo cast light on our killer.

408
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,580
There is logic
underlying these deaths.

409
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,086
Do you think this comes
from a logical mind?

410
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:50,418
A man who carves
a human being in half

411
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,674
doesn't come from a place of logic.

412
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:57,680
- Then from where?
- Menial disease. Obsession.

413
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,431
Passion.

414
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,556
I believe the killer is taunting us.

415
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,347
He wants us to know
he's going to strike again.

416
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,564
What do you make of this?

00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:16,574
- It was covering the victim's face.
- "The Masque of the Red Death. "

What is ii?

419
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,375
The quote from the story mentions
Prospero, a character I created

420
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,380
to symbolise man's arrogance even
when confronted with certain death.

421
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:36,135
Prospero hosts a costume ball
where Death comes in disguise.

425
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:51,309
If "The Masque of the Red Death"
is his next intended story,

426
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:55,150
we must use this opportunity
to capture this man at your ball.

in the habiliments of the grave.

he comes in and kills everybody?

- Sir...

438

The similarities
are too coincidental.

439

I'm asking you again.

440

Allow me to have my men scattered
about your ball, in costume,

catch this monster.

I've seen the effects
of this man's determination.

If he has chosen your gathering to...

You will not destroy an evening

Then I insist my officers be present.

Fine. Just make sure
they scrape the shit off their boots.

He was the host of the ball.

Mr Fields, if Mr Poe
is a part of your investigation...

461
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,386
Mr Poe has a unique perspective
on aspects of this crime.

462
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,178
Why? ls the killer an alcoholic,
an opium addict and atheist?

463
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,472
An atheist?
You misconstrue me, sir.

Poe, you stay away from my daughter.

No.

Mr Fields, I'm happy to indulge
your request for security,

468
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,786
but if I see him tomorrow night,
you'll have to protect him from me.

469
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,572
Why do we need security?

470
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,117
My writing has become
the inspiration to an actual killer.

Quite gruesome, really.

If I'd known my work had
a morbid effect on people,

473
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,502
I'd have devoted more time
to eroticism.

You're a vile little man.

475

As I said, we were just leaving.

638

Her innocence was the first part
of her soul to die.

639
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:07,201
And while it happened,
he stood still,

640
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:11,496
watching to fully enjoy
the dreadful metamorphosis

641
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,632
from a life full of hope

642
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,884
to death without purpose.

00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,771
Mr Poe.

645
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,816
I've been, erm...

646
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,149
I'm sorry to disturb you but...

647
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,406
I was a little concerned
about your...

648
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,942
- My progress?
- Yes.

649
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:46,990
I feel as if I've gone from author
to character in one of my tales.

650
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:50,877
As trapped and bedevilled as any of
the hapless bastards I ever created.

651
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,499
I can appreciate that.

652
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,846
Regardless of what
you think of me, Fields,

653
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,852
I am a master of my art,

654
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,355
and I will not fail her.

655
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,984
I know that.

656
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:23,071
Look, I... I think I was overly harsh
with you the other day,

657
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:26,579
and for that I'd like to apologise.

658
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,710
My wife was singing at the piano
when she first coughed up blood.

659
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,683
I prepared myself for the worst,
but Virginia seemed to recover,

660
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,935
and foolishly I succumbed to hope.

661
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,233
But by year's end
the blood came again...

662
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,769
and again.

663
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,404
Great effusions of blood.

664
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:06,161
Raging fevers, her sheets spattered
with crimson, drenched with sweat.

665
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,662
I often thought I could hear
the sound of darkness

666
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,200
as it stole across the horizon
rushing towards me.

667
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,581
But here I...

668
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:21,293
I was overwhelmed
by a sorrow so poignant,

669
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:26,465
when she finally died I fell
in all candour a great release.

670
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,678
But it was supplanted by the return

671
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:33,267
of that dark and morbid melancholy
that followed me like a black dog...

675
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:53,662
Do you really believe
she's still alive?

676
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,787

- The blood, Poe, it's fake!
- The blood?

695
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:43,609
The prostitute. She's no prostitute.
It's stage blood. She's an actress.

- The blood on the hands. "Macbeth"

My mother's playhouse.

The victim was still in her costume,

702
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:08,384
which suggests she was abducted
directly from the theatre.

- Yes, I heard.

But we have made some headway.

825
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:50,609
According to theatre records, the
sailor's name is Maurice Robichaux.

No.

Cantrell and I made some inquiries
at the docks.

829
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,619
He was signed on to a trading vessel
which made port five days ago.

830
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,200
The start of the murders.

831
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:06,082
And, like many sailors,
he took employment in the theatre,

832
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,335
working the backstage riggings.

833
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,962
But, as we know,
he wasn't there today.

was prearranged.

Have you ever written
anything about a sailor?

854
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,459
No.

855
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,883
Did you speak with the ship captain?

856
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,973
- I did.
- And?

857
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:52,765
Robichaux was a valued crewman.
Well liked.

858

- In France.

861
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,190
- Anything?
- No.

01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,906
Yes. Possibly. Who knows?

is...why Baltimore?

864
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,662
The Fortunato had docked
in ports around the world.

865
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,672
- The what?
- All over the world.

866
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:20,710
- The name of the ship, say it again.
- Fortunato.

"The thousand injuries of Fortunato
I had borne as I best could."

What is that?

869
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,927
The first sentence of
"The Cask of Amontillado".

870
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,813
- Go on.
- A story I wrote about revenge.

871
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:37,977
A man kills his rival by walling him
up. Fortunato is entombed alive.

872
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,441
- Where?
- In the catacombs of a palazzo.

873
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,823
- The story is set in Italy.
- There are no Catacombs here.

874
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:47,657
No, but there are tunnels
underneath the city.

955
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,780
- Why?
- He gave us the location of Emily.

956
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,246
This watch is mine.

957
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,533
I thought I'd lost it.

958
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,497
- The kilter left this?
- On the dead sailor.

959
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,082
- In, to be more exact.
- The utter gall.

960
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,418
Along with
the latitudinal co-ordinates.

961
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,834
Incredible.

962
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:04,097
Forgive me. I have no background
in navigational techniques.

963
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,724
To plot an exact position,
you need three things:

964
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:10,478
a sextant, an accurate chronometer
and a celestial almanac.

965
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:16,689
The almanac tells the exact time
at which the sun hits its zenith.

966
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,444
- Exact noon.
- Shall I bring more?

967
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,901
Leave it! Please.

968
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,407
It's all right, Percy. Get another.

969
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,788
If your watch is set to Greenwich
Mean Time, you can calculate

970
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:31,290
how far east or west
of Greenwich, London you are.

971
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:35,170
Twelve...twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight, rather.

972
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:37,626
- Which one, damn it?
- Twenty-eight.

973
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,631
- Twelve twenty-eight, right?
- Yes.

974
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:43,385
Longitude is a measure of time
east or west.

975
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,469
Latitude, distance from the equator.
That's north or south.

976
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,350
Seventeen degrees north.

977
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,267
The West Indies? It can't be.

978
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:58,025
He couldn't have
transported her that far.

979
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,357
Here. St Croix.

980
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:05,195
That's impossible. The Danish
West Indies is a two-week journey.

981
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:08,077
It's not an island, St Croix.

982
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,488

983

01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:45,607

He's at Doc Clements'.

1023
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:04,991
There was an empty grave.
It had Emily's name on it.

1024
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:08,081
That was his clue.
That's why he sent us there.

1025
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:12,248
Perhaps, or to kill again.

01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:18,734
Tell me, where is sh...?

1113
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,768
Ivan.

1114
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:54,402
Surprised?

1115
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,440
Where is she?

1116
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:00,860
Dying.

1117
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,199
More quickly than I expected.

1118
01:28:03,361 --> 01:28:06,490
So I had to speed things along
and deliver the morning edition

1119
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,409
so you could finally realise
it had to be...

1120
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:12,671
none other than your humble
typesetter and biggest fan.

1121
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:17,801
A drink?

1122
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:25,683
You don't know how I've looked
forward to this moment, sir.

1123
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,685
To sit here like this,

1124
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,437
no more masks,

1125
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:31,064
artist to artist.

1126
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,066
Artist to artist.

1127
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:36,729
Though I admit,
as I read your final chapter,

1128
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,273
I felt more muse than artist.

1129
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:45,491
You're mad.

1130
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:51,292
Really, Mr Poe?

1131
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:53,670
You're one to talk.

1132
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:59,259
Where is Emily?

1133
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:02,045
Just like that?

1134
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:07,013
No probing the devious twists
and turns of man's darkest motives?

1135
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,019
No prying into the mysteries
of his conscience?

1136
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:11,805
So very unlike you, Mr Poe.

1137
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,475
Where is she?!

1138
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,518
Ow!

1139
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:22,157
A rather disappointing denouement,
I have to say.

1140
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,909
But that's life, isn't it?

1141
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:27,787
So much less satisfying than fiction.

1142
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:30,324
It's time this story comes to an end.

1143
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,418
Very well.

1144
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:35,875
Give me the gun.

1145
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:40,967
You've come this far, Mr Poe.
Are you really going to back out now?

1146
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:46,636
You know what happens next.
You wrote it, after all.

1147
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:50,428
You either pull that trigger
and kill me and young Miss Emily

1148
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,847
or you give me the gun.

1149
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:55,440
She will live.

1150
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:58,694
That was your solution, right?

1151
01:30:10,697 --> 01:30:13,200
I have to admit, I don't cry easily,

1152
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:17,621
but you had me bawling like a baby.

1153
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:19,960
And I've always had a fancy
for poisons.

1154
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,750
That's how I done my dad.

1155
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,636
The idea of drinking something
that will kill you

1156
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:27,092
but having time to carry on
a conversation

1157
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:31,635
is, as they say, fraught
with dramatic possibilities, right?

1158
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:34,771
Listen to me,
talking about dramatic possibilities

1159
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,979
with vane of the greatest writers
of our time.

1160
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:42,863
I must say, it has been a profound
honour working with you, sir.

1161
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,566
Working with me?

1162
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,736
I know they're your ideas.
I'm just borrowing.

1163
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,576
Except for Valdemar's tongue.
That was me.

1164
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:54,742
- Quite a subtle metaphor, I thought.
- Subtle?

1165
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:56,785
It made no sense at all.

1166
01:30:56,952 --> 01:31:00,422
Even in the end,
I'm confronted by a plagiarist

1167
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:04,050
without even the originality
to invent themselves.

1168
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:05,802
I've concocted you.

1169
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:09,181
I couldn't agree more.

1170
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:12,058
I am your crowning achievement.

1171
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:14,720
Your masterpiece.

1172
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:18,732
In whose world do we each exist
right now, Edgar?

1173
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,188
Mine, or yours?

1174
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:24,900
I don't really know the answer.

1175
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:28,366
It's quite brilliant.

1176
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:31,862
Well...go on, sir.

1177
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,493
Bottoms up.

1178
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:46,926
I need a carriage now!

1179
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:48,632
- Inspector!
- I need a carriage.

1180
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,218
And send a messenger
to Charles Hamilton's house.

1181
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:54,225
Tell him to get to
the "Baltimore Patriot". Do it!

1182
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:10,234
{POE} So it has been written:
I will die today.

1183
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:15,448
A hole of mouldering earth awaits.

1184
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:20,289
It is a just end to a man
consumed by death his entire life.

1185
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,831
Emily, take this kiss upon thy brow.

1186
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:26,921
Really good stuff, sir.

1187
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,676
A poet to the end.

1188
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:32,885
I suppose this bit
is for Miss Hamilton.

1189
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:35,637
Where is she?

1190
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:39,645
- Where is she?
- I tell you, Mr Poe,

1191
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:43,354
I used to live for your stories,
just live for them.

1192
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,939
When you stopped writing...

1193
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,860
I guess I went a little nuts.

1194
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:53,197
But I kept on believing,
even when you closed me out.

1195
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:55,111
I still believed in your vision,

1196
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,701
in a future where people
would stand in lines

1197
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:02,665
to see the kind of things that
only people like you and I could see.

1198
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,671
I knew you had one more in you, sir.

1199
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:11,003
No one will ever forget you.

1200
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:18,559
Have you ever been to France?

1201
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:21,813
There's a young writer over there -
Jules Verne.

1202
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:24,065
- You heard of him?
- What?

1203
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:25,726
Paris...

1204
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:29,024
He really reminds me of you, sir.

1205
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:32,236
Where is she? You owe me!
Where is she?!

1206
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:35,072
"Anything was better than this agony.

1207
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:38,580
"Anything was more tolerable
than this derision.

1208
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:42,538
"I could bear those hypocritical
smiles no longer."

1209
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,953
"The Tell-Tale Heart."

1210
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,999
She's here... She's here.

1211
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:50,587
- {KNOCK AT DOOR}
- Carriage for Mr Reynolds!

1212
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:54,095
On my way in just a moment!

1213
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:56,473
Goodbye, Mr Poe.

1214
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:01,185
I've enjoyed our time together.

1215
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:04,522
Reynolds...

1216
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:14,650
Almost...

1217
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:05,833
Emily!

1218
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:16,260
{LABOURED BREATHING}

1219
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,672
Emmy?

1220
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:20,932
Answer me.

1221
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,929
Emily! Please, answer me!

1222
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:38,032
Oh, my God.

1223
01:35:57,961 --> 01:36:00,430
{MUTTERS}

1224
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,553
Emily...

1225
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,392
{BREATHES RAGGEDLY}

1226
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:09,741
Emily... Emily...

1227
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:26,470
Emily.

1228
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:31,889
Open your eyes.

1229
01:37:32,055 --> 01:37:34,399
Emily, open your eyes.

1230
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,860
Yeah.

1231
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,701
Oh, yeah.

1232
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:47,863
Is it really you?

1233
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:49,781
{SIGHS WITH RELIEF}

1234
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:52,917
- I love you.
- I love you.

1235
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,252
I'm here.

1236
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,792
I came for you.

1237
01:38:02,835 --> 01:38:05,179
Okay.

1238
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:13,642
Stay awake.

1239
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,183
I have you, always.

1240
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,486
We're going home.

1241
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,989
- You did mean it?
- Mean what?

1242
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:25,525
When you said you would marry me.

1243
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:27,819
In this life and the next.

1244
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,492
Clear the way! Clear the way!

1245
01:38:34,659 --> 01:38:36,411
What's wrong with you? Make way!

1246
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:38,955
- Where's Poe?
- He was here a moment ago.

1247
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:40,715
Poe!

1248
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:42,921
Hurry!

1249
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,965
Where is Edgar? Where is Edgar?

1250
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:50,975
{HAMILTON} Now, be careful.

1251
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,602
Go, go, go!

1252
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:18,123
Sir?

1253
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:20,288
You are Edgar Poe, correct?

1254
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:24,250
I am.

1255
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:27,216
For a few more minutes, anyway.

1256
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:30,598
Fire you all right?
You look a little the worse for wear.

1257
01:39:30,756 --> 01:39:32,804
Is there someone I can call for you?

1258
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,062
- Reynolds.
- You want me to ind Reynolds?

1259
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:39,223
Does he have a first name?

1260
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,983
No.

1261
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:46,944
Tell Fields...
his last name is Reynolds.

1262
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:50,531
I'm sorry, sir,
you're not making much sense.

1263
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,954
Tell Fields.

1264
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:07,297
The Lord help my poor soul.

1265
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:23,192
{EXHALES SLOWLY}

1266
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:49,965
Mr Fields?

1267
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:52,630
- I'm Dr John Morgan.
- Doctor.

1268
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:56,847
- Do you have a cause of death?
- I'm sorry, I don't.

1269
01:40:57,009 --> 01:40:58,886
I have a few ideas but...

1270
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:02,353
As you know, he was brought in
in a very deranged state.

1271
01:41:02,515 --> 01:41:04,483
I'm told he was ranting.

1272
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:06,110
Yes.

He kept going on and on about telling
you that your last name is Reynolds.

Is that helpful, or just gibberish?

1275
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,577
Maybe both.

Doctor.

your final analysis.

Thus much let me avow -

01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:44,023
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream.

01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:49,654
All that we see or seem
ls but a dream within a dream.
