but if you dont pull over and give
yourselves over quietly

21
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,821
I swear to Christ. Your head is going
up the drivers ass

22
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:17,822
His head, is going up your ass and

00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:04,628
Oh, now you speak the English

This, Hancocks latest act of so-called
heroics

38
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,438
took a hefty financial toll.

39
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,939
Initial estimates are said to top
Nine Million dollars

40
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,340
Which, if accurate, represents a
personal record for the notoriously

41
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:55,641
publicity shy Hancock.
Who, as usual, cant be reached

42

the fires, the water damage, the fires

45
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:04,545
L.A. would be a lot better off if this guy
would just leave and let us

46
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:07,046
get on with our jobs.
He's never asked us for a badge

47
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:09,347
He's never worked with us in any
capacity

48
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:12,148
what so-ever. Zero
I dont mind if he could just

49
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:13,949
do it somewhere else.
New York maybe!

50
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,750
Let them tussel with him for a
while.

This Hancock guy, is surely on
some kind of mission and he's using

55
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:31,855
our city to beat himself up for reasons
known only to him....

So?
Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

58
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:53,058
Actually, Bono is like the Bono of P.R.
but i do try

59
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,559
Well... Lets see it.
Ok

60
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,860
I'll get right into it.
Good morning everyone

61
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:01,961
I'm here to talk to you about
charitable giving

62
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:05,362
ok and we all know the way that
that works is you give one maybe

63
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:09,463
two percent of your net cash and you
get and arm band or a wrist band

64
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:12,064
or a ribbon or whatever it is
It's nowhere near enough

65
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,665
and thats why we, at Embry Publicity
would like to offer you..

66
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:18,066
The All Heart symbol.
Now..

67
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:22,467
you would be among a very select
group

68
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:25,768
of corporate giants to bare this logo
on your product

69
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:28,869
and what this would say to the
public

70
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,270
is that your company, Phara Thompsis,
Has made a radical contribution..

71
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:37,371
to helping our world. And here's
all you need to do to qualify.

72
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:43,372
Your new T.B. drug, Micodine,
we would like you to give that

73
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:45,473
product away
for free.

74
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:49,474
Did you say free?
I did.

75
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:54,675
Only to those that really need it.
Only to those who, without it,

76
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:56,676
would other wise die.

77
00:07:56,677 --> 00:08:00,277
well, it is a concept thats up there with..
lethal side effects

78
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:03,678
Mandatory product recall.
Get indicted, go to jail

79
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:06,279
Get out, work at IHop for the
rest of your life

80
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,180
Understandable reactions.
A radical concept but.

81
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:13,381
It is the brand that represents a
fairer and better world

82
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:18,682
The brand that everyone
is talking about

83
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:20,583
Who is everyone?

84
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,784
We do already have a sports franchise.

85
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:26,985
NFL? MBA? MLB?
Soccer.

86
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:30,086
MLS?
Which team?

87
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:32,487
Well, It's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

88
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:35,088
My sons team.

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:41,489
We can save the world.
Alright. Someones just gotta go first

91
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,091
Are you a crackpot?

92
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:58,292
Hey hun. You're probably at the
store

You're all idiots.

119
00:10:57,318 --> 00:11:00,518
You're the one that threw the dudes

120
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:01,619
And whats with the train?

121
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Why didn't you just go strait up
into the air with the car?

122
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:08,121
Yeah! Go strait up.
You've obviously injured that poor woman

123
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:09,122
(crowd)
Yeah!

124
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:11,423
She's right.

125
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:15,523

134
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:47,231

You're not flying by the Valley

140
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:15,137
Alright, one guy will be right here.

What's going on dad?

Oh my God, Ray?
What happened to the car?

151
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:47,748
Oh boy, you would not have believed it
I came this close to getting hit by

152
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:51,049
a train.. If it wasn't for that guy..
he saved my life.

153
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,150
Hancock, this is my wife Mary.
Believe it or not pal, I almost kissed

154
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:56,951
a train today.. Saw my whole life
flash before my eyes

155
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:59,552
He saved your life?

156
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:01,953
Yeah, you good?

00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,154

160
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:17,057

161
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:18,058
I love meatballs.

162
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:21,959
Who's so busy they cant have a meal huh?
And it's on us. Please?

163

164
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:52,361

Do you like eagles?

166
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:58,363
This guy is like a little talking
machine huh?

167
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:00,364
We don't have a lot of guests

168
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:03,365

173
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,770
Very long time.

174
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:20,371
Thats some good meatballs boy.

175
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:24,172

176
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:26,073

177
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:29,074
Hey, Aaron pal, How was school

178
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:30,075
Fine.

179
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:32,275
Yeah? No more problems with that
bully Michael?

180
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:33,276
Michele.

181
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,777
Michele huh?
Yeah, it's French

182
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,378
Michele, Hancock is this..
Hancock? Michele is this neighborhood

183
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,079
bully. We've been trying to teach Aaron
about conflict resolution.

184
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,480
hmmm...
Know what i mean?

185
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:48,681
Yeah, Turn the other cheek
and all that?

186
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,582
Thats exactly right.

187
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,083
uh huh, Well just dont ever turn
that one alright.

188
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:55,184
Never let them punk you.

189
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,985
Got it.
Ok Aaron. Eat your food.

190
00:14:56,986 --> 00:15:00,586
The way you deal with bullies is you
take you right foot...

191
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,087
bring it right up.. catch him
in his little piss punk.

192
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:04,488
You dont have to do that honey.
ok?

193
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:07,389
It's a good idea.
You aim strait..

194
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,490
Make sure he cant use that thing for
nothing but a flap to keep the dust

195
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,591
out of his buttcrack.
Ok, Please.

196
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:16,692
Just stop. Michele is not a man.
He's a little boy ok. And his parents

197
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:20,293
happen to be going through a really
bad divorce and

198
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,394
thats why he's acting up.
And maybe you dont know this but

199
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:25,895
not everything in this world gets
resolved by brute force

200
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:29,696
Not everything has to be bang, scream,
blood, more blood.

201
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:32,297
there is just so much distruction..
Angel!

202
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,698
She watches so much news...
That sometimes it gets to be

203
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,499
a little too much.

204
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,400
you got a toilet?

205
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,301
yup.
Yeah, just past the fridge.

206
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:50,302
Did he... Just take the wiskey
bottle to the bathroom?

207
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:52,503
Do you want him to kill
us all?

208
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:54,504
Thanks for coming on in.
Good right?

209
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:57,005
Very. Yeah. Yeah.
You want to say goodbye to him?

210
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,906
Goodbye Hancock.
Hey, Alright little buddy.

211
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:02,107

212
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:03,908

213
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,308
Come on Aaron.

217
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:16,012

218
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:17,713

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,119
Now I want to deliver that for you.

225
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,620
You're a Super Hero .

226
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:42,421

asking you for your autograph.

227
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:44,222

244
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:32,139
but I can change this guy's life
and you know Just think about

245
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,140
all the good he can do

246
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,341
I think your just wasting
your time with this guy.

247
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:38,742

I think he just needs people
to care, you know?

252
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:52,947
You see the good in everybody Ray,
even sometimes when it's not there.

00:22:56,305 --> 00:23:01,405
I dont even remember that. Yeah.. Greenpeace
Does. Walter does.

311
00:23:01,406 --> 00:23:03,406
This all gets redundant after a while,

312
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:08,206
but my basic diagnosis of your
fundamental problem is..

313
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:09,907
Wanna hear it?
No.

314
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:11,608
You're and asshole

315
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,009
I know. I call it like I see it though.
It's not a crime to be an asshole

316
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,110
but it's very counterproductive.
Not a crime but you are an asshole.

317
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:20,111
dont you think?
Be careful.

318
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:22,812
Alright, How about this?

319
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:27,113
I've been thinking about something. This
kinda goes to how you present yourself.

320
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,114
Come on, Really?
It's the middle of the day.

321
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:33,015
What springs to mind...
When you see this?

322
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:35,516
Homo

323
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:38,617
How 'bout that?
Homo in red

324
00:23:42,818 --> 00:23:44,618
Norwegian homo.
I'll give ya that.

325
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,919
Let's move past the comics.
Lets get into something deaper

326
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,920
I think... That deap down you behave
badly because you are lonely

327
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:56,521
I think deep down you want
peoples acceptance.

328
00:23:56,922 --> 00:24:00,222
come on now, you save peoples
lives and they reject you

329
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:02,123
so you reject them back.

330
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:07,024
and we're switch that cycle. We're
gonna start fresh, start new.

331
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:11,225
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into will-power

332
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:14,926
Hey Hancock!
We almost won.

333
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:18,327
Yeah we did. ok, up stairs. I'm
making lunch. Go change.

334
00:24:18,328 --> 00:24:19,328
Hey sweetheart.

335
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:24,229
were you watching the news?
No. we've been working on Hancock

336
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,330
interfacing with the public.
interfacing with the public.

337
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,831
This has been on all day.

338
00:24:28,832 --> 00:24:30,832
(on tv)
The law, is the law Mr. Hancock.

339
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:35,033
And you are not above it.
Felony destruction of property

340
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:39,134
Amounting to tens of millions of dollars,
theft and now this.

341
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:43,835
From where i sit... I see a selfish self
absorbed man,

342
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:48,036
With a lot of muscle, but no regard for
anyone but yourself.

343
00:24:48,037 --> 00:24:53,537
Mr Hancock. Let me remind you. You
are not above the law.

344
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:59,038
You have failed to show at over 600
subpoenas and civil suits.

345
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,939
Anybody else would be held in contempt.
But, Oh no, not you.

346
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,340
You may be a super-hero but let
me tell you this.

347
00:25:06,341 --> 00:25:09,941
You're not nearly as strong as the
U.S. Constitution.

348
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,842
Bank on it buddy!

349
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:15,243
Genius. Things just got real.
This is exactly what we needed.

350
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:17,944
This is perfect. Right now there is a D.A.
trying to figure out how to come up here

351
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:21,345
and put you in jail.
Bitch can try.

352
00:25:21,346 --> 00:25:23,746
I say you go.

353
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:28,547
People take you for granted you know?
We gotta make people miss you.

354
00:25:28,548 --> 00:25:30,948
People don't like you Hancock.
(Aaron): I do.

355
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:35,349
Two weeks. You know? The public will be
clammering for you. When they do..

356
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:41,350
We'll be ready. And uh, worst case scenario is
I'm wrong and you just fly out of there.

357
00:25:41,351 --> 00:25:43,351
what do you have to lose ?

358
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:52,852
(Crowd Clammering)

359
00:26:01,553 --> 00:26:05,553
I apologise to the people of Los Angeles.
But my behavior has been improper

360
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:07,254
and i accept the consequences.

361
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:12,955
I ask my fellow Angelinos for their
patience and understanding.

362
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:14,656
(crowd yelling)
You're and asshole!

363
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:23,357
Life here can be difficult for me.
After-all I'm the only one of my kind.

364
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:26,458
During my incarceration I will be
participating in Alcohol and

365
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,259
anger management treatment.

366
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,960
You deserve better from me. I can
be better. I will be better.

367
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:48,961
Give me the hand playboy.

368
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:32,562
Oh, I get it.

369
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:36,763
I put some uh.. well most
of you in here.

370
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:40,464
(Inmate agreeing)

371
00:27:40,865 --> 00:27:44,165
I can understand you feeling some
kind of way about that.

372
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:50,366
Uh.. so... I'm gonna do me. And I'm
gonna let you do you

373
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:52,667
I.. I.. Dont want no trouble.

374
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,668
Alright?

375
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:57,469
I just want to go to my cell.

376
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,170
Excuse me.

377
00:28:04,971 --> 00:28:06,971
Excuse me please.

378
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:17,672
If you don't move..
Your head is going up his ass.

379
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:21,273
(Inmates all laughing)

380
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:26,374
Ya'll fellas sure you want to
ride this train?

381
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:28,875
Choo Choo asshole.

382
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:30,776
ohh.
(pants ripping)

383
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,076
(crowd)
Ohhhhhhh!!!

384
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:40,777
(Theme from Sanford And Son playing)

385
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:56,378
Did you shove one man's
head up another man's ass?

386
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:05,779
alright we are gonna circle back to that.

387
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,080
The DA's office wants your
sentence to run 8 years.

388
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,981
it's a big number, but not something
we didn't anticipate

389
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:14,582
you know our plan is to..
what are you doing?

390
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:15,583
Hey hey hey  hey hey!

391
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:26,084
it sounded like you said they want
me to spend 8 years in this shithole?

392
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:28,685
8 years is more like 4 1/2
with good behavior

393
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:33,086
but it's irrelavant' because with
you out of the picture

394
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:36,287
and with the crime rate
going up through the roof

395
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:39,288
The D.A. and the cops are going to
call for your immediate release

396
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:41,289
and they are going to demand it.
They're gonna ask you..

397
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,190
Where you going? Hey!

398
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:46,191
Stop right there.
Hancock. Hancock!

399
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:47,892
Get Back!

400
00:29:47,993 --> 00:29:49,593
You're a coward!

401
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:52,493
Who you talking to Ray?
I'm talking to you!

402
00:29:52,794 --> 00:29:55,894
Who you talking to Ray?
Stop pretending that you dont care.

403
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:58,495
You've got a calling. You're a hero
Hancock. You're going to be

404
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,796
miserable the rest of your life
Untill you accept that.

405
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:05,997
Trust me. Trust this plan. This
process Just stay in here

406
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:09,698
When they call, A hero is
what we are going to give them.

407
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:13,399
How we gonna do that Ray?

408
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,300
Aright guys uh.. Lets start sharing.
Don?

409
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:19,901
Yeah.
You had something?

410
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:25,802
Yeah I.. I uh.. think i might have
had a little bit of a break-through

411
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:26,803
Good for you.

412
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:33,604
Yeah, I realize that breaking necks is easy
but uh.. I'm sitting there

413
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:36,505
and i'm stairing at myself in the mirror

414
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:41,006
and I thought...
This is tough.

415
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,507
ha ha ha
Why do you always laugh?

416
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,108
Picturing you look at the mirror
scares the shit out of me.

417
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:50,509
Everytime I'm talking it
completely ruins the cycle.

418
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,810
lets watch the cross talk.
Ok?

419
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,811
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

420
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,312
no no no no no no
Keep sharing. Lets move on.

421
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:02,413
Mr. Hancock?
Do you want to share today?

422
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:04,014
Pass.

423
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:07,415
your landing is your first impression
it's your supre-hero handshake

424
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:10,516
Dont come in so hot ok?
Dont come in too drunk.

425
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:13,017
And dont come in and land on a
100 thousand dollar Mercedes alright?

426
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,918
People have to be happy that you've arrived.

427
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:17,819
Mr. Hancock, you share?

428
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,120
Pass
So you've used the door.

429
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:24,821
The building is still intact.
People are happy that you've arrived.

430
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:26,922
They feel safe now.
There's an officer there

431
00:31:26,923 --> 00:31:29,323
and he’s done a good job
So you might want to tell him

432
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:32,124
he’s done a good job.
What the hell did I have to come for Ray,

433
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,525
if he’s done a good job?

434
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:45,726
(Inmates chatter)
Man. Oh come on man...

435
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:48,127
(Radio announcer)
KBLA Radio AM 850

436
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:52,128
Today’s big story is no surprise here...
Hancock. What’s your take?

437
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:54,229
(Male voice)
I for one have had enough of this guy

438
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,830
I’m glad he is doing time around bars
And I hope they don’t let him off easy

439
00:31:57,831 --> 00:31:59,431
Let my cousin Pookie out.

440
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:02,632
You know I see you don’t wear a bullet
proof vest security officer

441
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:05,533
And I respect your courage
Because bullets don’t bounce off you

442
00:32:05,534 --> 00:32:06,734
they bounce off me

443
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:14,135
(Female Voice)
This city is being run be gangs and drug dealers

444
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:16,336
Hancock is the only guy that makes
them shake in there boots

445
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:18,437
He doesn’t always tie a pretty ribbon
around it but he gets the job done

446
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:19,838
Besides he’s hot!

447
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,239
Let me hear you say it.
Let me hear you say good job.

448
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
G...

449
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:28,241
Go...

450
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:32,242
Mr. Hancock, would you like to share?
Pass

451
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:35,043
Gooooooo       d

452
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:40,344

Go od jooooob

454
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:47,846
Good job

455
00:32:47,847 --> 00:32:50,047
Jail watch day 5

456
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:52,548
And True to his word
Hancock remains incarcerated

457
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:57,449
Meanwhile crime is still on the rise
LAPD is recording increases

458
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,550
of up to 30% in the last 5 days
that Hancock has been behind bars

459
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:10,051
Hancock!!! Hey Hancock!!!

550
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:30,528
Why’s that?
Good behavior.

551
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:33,129
Do you know what this is?

552
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:40,630
Umm… I’m guessing it is some kind of
detonator type deal.

553
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:43,431
Its 8 pounds of C4 strapped to each
and every on of them

554
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:48,132
This is spring loaded dead mans switch

555
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:49,433

00:44:08,038 --> 00:44:11,038
You’re gonna get me safely away from
here with the money

561
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:15,539
Or else they will be cleaning up these
hostages with a mop

562
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,240
I’m gonna have to say no to that

563
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:26,541
Ahh… I’m really trying to 
turn over a new leaf.

567
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:44,545

00:46:53,664 --> 00:46:54,664
How’d you two meet?

587
00:46:56,265 --> 00:47:02,765
Umm.. I was married once before
First wife, a she died giving birth to Aaron

588
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:10,466
That’s another dinner, but I’ll.. But umm…
So there I am,

589
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:13,467
I’m with this beautiful little baby and
I don’t know what the hell to do and

590
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:18,468
I was in the super market and I’m in
the baby aisle

591
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:23,069
and I got a brand of diapers in each hand
and I’m staring at them like I don’t know how

592
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,770
I’m going to get thorough the day

593
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:29,871
And Angel (laughing)
Sees me

594
00:47:33,372 --> 00:47:35,672
She knew and she gave this look

595
00:47:37,173 --> 00:47:41,373
And even in the trance I was in
I knew that somebody; somewhere...

596
00:47:42,174 --> 00:47:43,174
was throwing me a little rope

597
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:49,875
Well starting that day I put my life back together.
Right?

598
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,176
You’re drunk.
so? Come here.

599
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,577
What about you buddy?
You’re from another planet, aren’t you?

600
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:07,978
Naw man, I’m from Miami.
You didn’t come in on like a meteor or …?

601
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:14,979
Nope, woke up in a hospital, first thing I remember.
Government hospital, yes? Experimenting on you and

602
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,580
No Ray, regular ole Miami emergency room.
Come on?

603
00:48:19,581 --> 00:48:25,081
Yeah a my a my a skull was fractured.
They told me I tried to stop a mugging...

604
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:26,982
Somebody knocked you out?

605
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:32,883
I guess I was a regular guy before and
when I woke up I was changed.

606
00:48:34,484 --> 00:48:37,184
The hospital nurse tried to put a
needle in my arm and

607
00:48:37,185 --> 00:48:42,485
It just broke against my skin
and then my skull healed in like an hour

608
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:46,086
Doctors were astounded

609
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:49,487
And umm they wanted to know my story

610
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:53,688
Just like you but, I couldn’t tell them
I don’t know who I am

611
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:55,689
Amnesia.

612
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,290
You know the blow to the head
Yeah well that’s what they figured

613
00:49:00,991 --> 00:49:02,591
You don’t remember anything?

614
00:49:05,392 --> 00:49:07,392
The only thing I had in my pocket was

615
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:11,293
bubble gum and 2 movie tickets

616
00:49:12,194 --> 00:49:15,094
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein

617
00:49:16,195 --> 00:49:18,495
But no ID, nothing

618
00:49:19,296 --> 00:49:23,996
I went to sign out and the uhh nurse
asked me for my John Hancock

619
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,597
So I actually thought that’s who I was

620
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:31,998
How come I didn’t hear any of this, read
about it in any newspapers?

621
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:35,499
It was probably in the papers 
about 80 years ago

622
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,900
80 years ago
Oh..  I don’t, I don’t age.. This is it.

623
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:42,701
That’s nice.
Gotta wonder though

624
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,502
What kind of Bastard must I have been

625
00:49:51,703 --> 00:49:53,703
 That nobody was there to claim me?

626
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:02,704
I mean I’m not the most charming guy in the world 
So I’ve been told, but..

627
00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:07,905
Nobody?

628
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:14,606
That didn’t tire you out at all coming up the stairs?
Not really

629
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:20,807
you could’ve just flown me up the stairs
wooo, I could have done with out that.

630
00:50:20,808 --> 00:50:22,408
Let’s get your shoes off here. 

631
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:24,509
Alright but that’s all you’re getting
off me though, haha

632
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:30,410
You believe in me, don’t you Hancock?

633
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:34,611
Of course Ray, I believe in you.
Help me up here

634
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:41,012
Listen to me this is important
“Cause I believe in you know and I and

635
00:50:44,113 --> 00:50:45,113
You’re gonna do great

636
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:49,314
You’re gonna fix everything

637
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:55,615
You get some sleep Ray
You sleep tight too

638
00:50:57,816 --> 00:50:59,716
Hancock, tucking me in

639
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:11,417
Alright he’s asleep
Damn babysitter never cleans up after herself

640
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:25,518
You have a bruise on your hand

641
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:32,019
You, you should go

642
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,720
It’s getting late

643
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,021
If Ray finds out about me...

644
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:09,122
You’re dead

645
00:52:19,923 --> 00:52:20,923
(whistling)

646
00:52:54,824 --> 00:52:57,224
Joan, we’re going to take care of that, okay?
Don’t you worry.

647
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:03,125
Hi Honey, breakfast?

648
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:08,526
Hancock sneezed, uh?
Can you believe it? Achoo

649
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:11,827
It’s amazing that you slept through that
You’re a good sleeper

650
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:15,828
Holy shit
I’m not going to say I told you so but..

651
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,929
You told me he was going to sneeze a hole
through the front of the house?

652
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,730
I just said can’t be around
Oh sweetheart can you get that

653
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:25,731
Thanks, Oh God you you’re strong.
I got it.

654
00:53:25,732 --> 00:53:30,232
But you don’t worry about anything
I already apologized to the neighbors,

655
00:53:30,233 --> 00:53:33,733
called State Farm
Everything is taken care of.

656
00:53:33,934 --> 00:53:34,934
You just...

657
00:53:37,235 --> 00:53:38,235
enjoy that breakfast

658
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:43,936
What’s this?  We’re going on vacation?
Uh-hum

659
00:53:43,937 --> 00:53:44,937
Are we?
Just the 3 of us

660
00:53:45,538 --> 00:53:47,538
End of the summer?
Tonight.

661
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:48,339
Tonight?
Let’s go somewhere.

662
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,740
Knock Knock.

663
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:54,641
Guzuntight
Uh?

664
00:53:54,642 --> 00:53:58,642
I…I was just telling Ray here
I hope you are done sneezing

665
00:53:58,643 --> 00:54:02,243
Because I don’t think our house
can take much more

666
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:03,244
Of your sneezing

667
00:54:10,245 --> 00:54:14,145
Yeah.. sometimes uh..
I sneeze when there’s dust

668
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,346
Or if I get really surprised

669
00:54:19,747 --> 00:54:21,347
That’s unfortunate.
(cell phone rings)

670
00:54:21,348 --> 00:54:24,648
This is Killborn
Mike, how ya doing?

671
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:27,749
It was great to see you too

672
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,150
Yep well uh... right

673
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:34,751
Go head shoot

674
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:40,251
Oh I got a pen right here
Right, no I know.

675
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:54,252
(Hancock) umm hum

676
00:54:55,253 --> 00:54:57,153
I am warning you

677
00:54:57,154 --> 00:54:58,854
(Continuing on the cell phone)
Alright go ahead

678
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:06,055
Okay good
Now that’s still…

679
00:55:08,956 --> 00:55:11,356
Hang on one second
Do me a favor?

680
00:55:16,357 --> 00:55:18,857
We are going to talk.
Go away.

681
00:55:35,258 --> 00:55:38,358
I can do this all day…Bong! Bong Bong!!
Shut Up!!!

682
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:39,359
Bong!

683
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,360
(Continuing on the cell phone)
ummm…I suppose I ...

684
00:55:42,361 --> 00:55:44,761
Fine, we’ll talk okay?

685
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:49,062
And when we are done talking, you go
away and leave my family alone.

686
00:55:50,763 --> 00:55:52,963
My place at 4 o’clock.
Whatever.

687
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:58,164
(Continuing on the cell phone)
it means uh... I would rather not talk numbers now

688
00:55:58,165 --> 00:56:00,565
I like to save them for the pitch
So then let’s just set a time

689
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:06,266
That’s good with me I will see you then
Alright yeah 3:30 great

690
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:08,867
Hun is it hot in here?

691
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:09,868
(Wasted Days and Wasted nights)

692
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:31,469
he hurt you didn’t he?

693
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:38,170
Ahhh… Use your words
How did it make you feel?

694
00:56:42,271 --> 00:56:44,471
Sore.
Bad

695
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:51,072
Cause he took your power.
And you have to get your power back

696
00:56:52,073 --> 00:56:55,773
And no-one will give your power back
You have to go out and take it

697
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:57,874
You understand me?

698
00:57:00,575 --> 00:57:05,375
We’re gonna go find Hancock and
Get your power back.

699
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:46,076
Ask.

700
00:57:48,577 --> 00:57:49,877
You and I?
You and I what?

701
00:57:50,278 --> 00:57:51,678
We’re the same?
No.

702
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,779
 I’m stronger
Really?

703
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,780
Oh yeah

704
00:58:02,781 --> 00:58:03,781
who are we?

705
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:09,782
Gods, angels, different cultures call
us by different names

706
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:12,083
Now all of a sudden its super heroes.

707
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:14,884
there are more of us?
There were

708
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:17,085
They all died.

709
00:58:19,186 --> 00:58:20,186
Just the two of us

710
00:58:29,987 --> 00:58:30,987
What is this?

711
00:58:35,188 --> 00:58:36,488
Who are we to each other?

712
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:38,889
We’re brother and sister
That’s a lie.

713
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,490
No I’m your sister
That is a lie.

714
00:58:42,491 --> 00:58:43,991
I’m your sister
No

715
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:46,992
Sisters don’t kiss brothers the way
you kissed me last night.

716
00:58:47,893 --> 00:58:50,993
You’re lying, deals off
Let’s go see how Ray feels about this.

717
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,094
Get your ass back here!
I’m telling

718
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:06,395
The All Heart symbol will be known globally,
As a symbol that represents companies

719
00:59:06,396 --> 00:59:08,796
That are committed to changing the world

720
00:59:09,497 --> 00:59:14,797
They can give away there substance goods okay?
Foods, drugs, power, clothing for free.

721
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:15,798
I thought we were talking about Hancock?
Two…

722
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:31,899
Stay away from me and my family
You are not going to do this to me again.

723
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,800
What?
I don’t know what you are talking about.

724
00:59:36,401 --> 00:59:37,701
(I love you Hancock)
It can’t work.

725
00:59:39,002 --> 00:59:42,802
It always end the same way
Persia, Greece, Brooklyn

726
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:45,303
Brooklyn?
I’ve never been to Brooklyn.

727
00:59:45,304 --> 00:59:48,804
I have put up with your Bullshit for
the last 3000 years and I’m done.

728
00:59:48,805 --> 00:59:51,005
I don’t know what you are talking about?
Done! You Listening?

729
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:53,506
I don’t know what you are talking about!
I am happy, okay, finally I’m happy

730
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,307
You are not going to mess it up
Look at me… I don’t know what you are talking about?

731
00:59:57,408 --> 01:00:01,008
I hate to burst your little crazy lady
bubble but it must not

732
01:00:01,009 --> 01:00:03,109
Have been all that great 
‘cause I don’t remember you

733
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,210
Call me crazy….

734
01:00:12,911 --> 01:00:15,811
one more time.
Coo coo

735
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:28,712
Alright hold it…Alright
You better not hit me with that truck

736
01:00:29,913 --> 01:00:33,213
For companies to qualify for the All Heart symbol
they need to prove that the are a leader

737
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:35,214
in the global revolution.
We gonna talk about Mr. Hancock?

738
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,315
That they are committed to the bettering of
the world And they can do this

739
01:00:38,316 --> 01:00:39,316
in 4 different ways. This is how they…

740
01:01:21,017 --> 01:01:24,717
The most important thing with All Heart is
the Brand recognition That’s why I mocked

741
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:27,918
up the examples here and 
Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris

742
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:43,019
So we need maximum exposure
We need extreme marketing

743
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,020
Is it snowing?

744
01:01:59,321 --> 01:02:01,821
Get off me!!
Listen to me

745
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:03,622
I hate you
I’m sorry

746
01:02:08,023 --> 01:02:10,723
Who ever I am, What ever I did
Look at me

747
01:02:12,624 --> 01:02:13,624
I’m sorry

748
01:02:48,825 --> 01:02:52,025
Why were you flying?
You were flying Mary.

749
01:02:53,326 --> 01:02:56,126
She was definitely flying
Okay I was flying

750
01:02:57,127 --> 01:03:00,927
And I’m very strong as well
 It's just the way we are

751
01:03:00,928 --> 01:03:02,928
We?
Me and him, it’s just us now.

752
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:03,929
The others paired up and died.

753
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:07,330
You didn’t say anything about the others
pairing up at the trailer.

754
01:03:07,331 --> 01:03:10,031
You were at his trailer?
This is very hard to explain.

755
01:03:10,032 --> 01:03:11,632
Great, I’m all ears Mary.
Me too

756
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:14,633
Do me a favor 
Just give me and my wife one moment please.

757
01:03:14,634 --> 01:03:17,034
Don’t, don’t bring it here Ray
The adults are talking for once second

758
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:18,735
Technically speaking, 

759
01:03:20,836 --> 01:03:22,736
He’s my husband

760
01:03:22,837 --> 01:03:24,937
Hoooooly shit

761
01:03:25,538 --> 01:03:27,838
What?
 We broke-up decades ago

762
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:31,039
long before you were borne.
He just can’t remember

763
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,240
But you can, right?
You knew?

764
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:36,641
That’s something you might want to
bring up on a first date Mary.

765
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:40,842
I don’t like to travel, I’m allergic to cats,
I’m immortal, okay?

766
01:03:40,843 --> 01:03:42,943
Those are like some of things you
might want to give a heads up on

767
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,444
What ever we are, we were built in two's, okay?

768
01:03:45,445 --> 01:03:49,345
We’re drawn to each other no matter
how far I run He’s always there

769
01:03:49,346 --> 01:03:50,646
he finds me. Its physics.

770
01:03:50,747 --> 01:03:53,647
What are you saying, are you
are fated to be together?

771
01:03:53,648 --> 01:03:55,648
I’ve lived for a very long time Ray

772
01:03:56,749 --> 01:04:01,249
And the one thing I’ve learned...
fate doesn’t decide everything.

773
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,150
People get to choose.

774
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:07,851
You chose to let me think I was here alone

775
01:04:18,452 --> 01:04:20,452
I didn’t think you would miss
what you didn’t remember

776
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:23,953
Great, now what?

777
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:31,354
I didn’t plan for this

778
01:04:53,355 --> 01:04:55,255
(TV reporter)
Prison authorities confirmed that

779
01:04:55,256 --> 01:04:58,656
the prisoner uprising was lead by
Kenneth Parker Jr

780
01:04:58,657 --> 01:05:01,957
Also the leader of last weeks Spring
Creek bank robbery

781
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:06,558
At least 8 prisoners not accounted for, 
For information on the prison riot at Norwalk

782
01:05:06,959 --> 01:05:10,259
Construction workers at the prison were
attacked and knocked unconscious

783
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:13,460
the prisoners stole the workers clothes
And it’s feared that at least some

784
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:17,261
of them have escaped
Parker is considered a criminal master mind

785
01:05:17,262 --> 01:05:20,162
He is very effective in using
psychological persuasion

786
01:05:20,163 --> 01:05:22,263
to organize criminals from different
backgrounds.

787
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:25,664
He’s a former Psychology professor at
Stanford University.

788
01:05:26,165 --> 01:05:28,965
While there he organized a notorious
criminal network comprised

789
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,066
Of graduate students from diverse fields…


790
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:35,067
$91.10
$91.10 you got to be shitting me

791
01:05:35,968 --> 01:05:38,768
$91.10
Highway robbery

792
01:06:02,169 --> 01:06:04,569
What?
I’m taking the money

793
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:07,470
Umm

794
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:12,771
I can relate to that

795
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,572
You know you want something..

796
01:06:18,773 --> 01:06:19,773
Nobody can stop you from taking it.

797
01:06:22,074 --> 01:06:23,374
You just take it right

798
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,175
I like that

799
01:06:29,476 --> 01:06:30,476
But can you take it?

800
01:06:33,077 --> 01:06:34,977
My Zagnut bar versus your gun

801
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,079
(2 shots fired)
(car alarm)

802
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,380
Sorry about your window

803
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:37,681
I need an IV line

804
01:07:38,982 --> 01:07:39,982
CVC electrolytes

805
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:43,783
It’s not gonna work
I’m in

806
01:07:45,284 --> 01:07:46,884
What’s happening to me

807
01:07:49,485 --> 01:07:52,685
(TV Reporter)
This just in.. John Hancock has just been

808
01:07:52,686 --> 01:07:54,686
 rushed to Los Angeles General Hospital

809
01:07:54,687 --> 01:07:57,887
Hancock is in serious condition with
multiple gunshot wounds

810
01:07:58,088 --> 01:08:01,688
No story yet as to how this happened to him but
We will continue to cover this story

811
01:08:01,689 --> 01:08:04,389
live as it unfolds.
Reporting live from …

812
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:17,990
(reporters yelling questions)
From what I’ve heard

813
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:21,891
he was trying to stop a robbery
Do you know if some special ammunition

814
01:08:21,892 --> 01:08:23,192
was used in the gun that shot him?
No

815
01:08:23,193 --> 01:08:25,293
Some new bullet
No No Not that I’m a aware of

816
01:08:25,294 --> 01:08:27,694
Could this have anything to do with the
mysterious super woman who appeared?

817
01:08:27,695 --> 01:08:30,695
I do not have that answer
(reporters yelling questions)

818
01:09:05,296 --> 01:09:06,896
You’re becoming mortal

819
01:09:09,097 --> 01:09:12,797
It’s us
Being close to each other

820
01:09:14,098 --> 01:09:16,998
It’s never happened this fast before

821
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:20,899
You have to leave

822
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,900
The further away you get from me the
better you’re gonna feel

823
01:09:24,901 --> 01:09:30,001
You’ll start getting your powers back
And you’ll be flying and breaking things 

824
01:09:30,002 --> 01:09:32,102
And saving people before you know it

825
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:52,303
It’s like I said, we were built in pairs
And when we get..

826
01:09:54,004 --> 01:09:56,304
 close to our opposites we lose power

827
01:09:58,305 --> 01:10:01,405
why?
So we can live human lives

828
01:10:03,006 --> 01:10:04,506
Love, connect

829
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:09,307
grow old, die

830
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:13,408
What happened to us?

831
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:22,909
Summer of ’04 BC,
we were becoming mortal like now

832
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,110
They came after me with swords

833
01:10:30,211 --> 01:10:31,211
You saved me

834
01:10:35,612 --> 01:10:40,312
1850, they set our house on fire

835
01:10:40,913 --> 01:10:42,713
you pulled me out of the flames

836
01:10:45,714 --> 01:10:49,414
80 years ago, what happened then?

837
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:55,815
We were living in Miami
And a new movie was playing in town

838
01:10:58,316 --> 01:10:59,316
Frankenstein

839
01:11:02,317 --> 01:11:09,917
And after we walked down Flagler street and 
You took my hand and you held it so tight

840
01:11:16,618 --> 01:11:18,018
They attacked us in an alley

841
01:11:23,019 --> 01:11:25,619
They hit you so hard
There was so much blood

842
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,620
They wouldn’t let me ride in the
ambulance with you

843
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:35,621
And by the time I got to the
hospital you were awake

844
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:41,922
But you didn’t know me

845
01:11:44,123 --> 01:11:48,923
So I left because every time we’re together..

846
01:11:50,924 --> 01:11:53,024
they come after you through me

847
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:10,725
You’re built to save people more
than the rest of us

848
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,726
That’s who you are, you are a hero

849
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:19,627
The insurance policy of the Gods
Keep one alive

850
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:23,228
you to protect this world.

851
01:12:37,529 --> 01:12:40,329
(gun shots)
Mary!!

852
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,130
Mary!
Stay down!

853
01:12:54,431 --> 01:12:55,431
Screams

854
01:12:59,332 --> 01:13:00,332
Mary?

855
01:13:12,233 --> 01:13:13,233
Stop!!

856
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:28,834
Stay down

857
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:43,335
Mary!
Help me get her up.

858
01:13:50,836 --> 01:13:52,836
Screams

859
01:14:07,737 --> 01:14:10,937
Both screaming!!

860
01:14:56,938 --> 01:14:59,038
Hold it hold it
I think we are losing her

861
01:15:00,839 --> 01:15:03,039
Heart monitor

862
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,640
Upon us all Hancock, 

863
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:18,741
you're no different

864
01:15:23,142 --> 01:15:27,842
Time to shut her down Hancock
It’s been a nice run

865
01:15:56,043 --> 01:16:00,143
Oh we are all gonna surely miss you

866
01:16:01,844 --> 01:16:03,644
But it is time for you to move on

867
01:16:04,945 --> 01:16:06,745
(flat line)

868
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:08,546
And maybe to a happier place

869
01:16:12,047 --> 01:16:14,047
You can thank me if you want to

870
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:16,948
Super hero
(Gun cocks)

871
01:16:21,749 --> 01:16:23,849
Aghhhh
Aaaw

872
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,250
You didn’t
Screams

873
01:16:41,251 --> 01:16:43,451
(Flat line)

874
01:17:41,252 --> 01:17:43,852
(exhales)

875
01:18:23,053 --> 01:18:24,053
(window crashes)

876
01:18:28,554 --> 01:18:29,554
beep

877
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:47,855
beep

878
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,156
Awwwwwwww

879
01:19:39,057 --> 01:19:42,057
What about Attila the Hun?
Completely cross eyed

880
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:44,258
Cross eyed?
Yep

881
01:19:44,259 --> 01:19:48,859
What about Queen Elizabeth?
Umm Neeeeedy

882
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:53,860
JFK, what about him?
Mmmm, Oh ,yeah, umhem

883
01:19:54,461 --> 01:19:57,461
Mmm, Oh Yeah, nothing more?
Not like that

884
01:19:57,462 --> 01:19:59,062
(cell phone beeps)
Oh come on, I was in Cuba for the

885
01:19:59,063 --> 01:20:00,563
whole missile thing so...

886
01:20:00,564 --> 01:20:01,564
Yeah, hang on

887
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:04,165
Hello

888
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,566
Ray
Hey I’ve been trying to call you

889
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,867
Yeah I was out of cell range

890
01:20:11,168 --> 01:20:13,568
Are you outside?
Yeah.

891
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:16,469
Look up
Alright I’m looking up

892
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:19,570
I’m looking up?

893
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:27,671
Baby
What?

894
01:20:35,472 --> 01:20:38,372
You’re gonna change the world
Good job Ray.

895
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:41,973
Oh my God Ray
Hey look up.

896
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,774
Hancock!

897
01:20:51,075 --> 01:20:53,275
I’m proud of you.
Thanks.

898
01:20:56,376 --> 01:20:59,276
Will I get in trouble for that?
Laughing...
