1
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:54,180
Listen to me! Killing a few hostages
is not sufficient!

2
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:56,841
The Americans must be made to suffer.

3
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:59,262
We must humiliate them.

4
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,978
You do not go far enough,
General Amin.

5
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:05,817
We must strip their entrails out
and drag them to Damascus,

6
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:09,737
until they include us
in the peace process.

7
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:14,324
Nonsense! This solution
is not bold enough for Libya.

8
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:18,461
l say wipe out Washington
and New York.

9
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:22,246
What? And spoil
three years of good PR?

10
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:25,546
The Americans believe l'm a nice guy.

11
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:29,848
ln some of their polls, l'm more
popular than their president!

12
00:01:32,312 --> 00:01:36,772
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
This is getting us nowhere.

13
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:40,193
lf we do nothing else this week,

14
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,111
we must conceive
at least one terrorist act

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,036
that will show all the world

16
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:50,124
that the United States,
the great Satan,

17
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:53,374
is but a paper tiger - a weak nation,

18
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:58,255
a weak people,
a people ripe for destruction.

19
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:01,927
Cowards, no longer willing to fight.

20
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:25,286
l knew it!

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,538
Hey, who are you?

22
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:06,203
l'm Lieutenant Frank Drebin,
Police Squad.

23
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:09,548
And don't ever
let me catch you guys in America!

24
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,665
Watch out!

25
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:44,851
..98, 99, 100. lt's all here.

26
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:48,146
This completes
our first shipment of heroin.

27
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:50,361
100~/. pure.

28
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,691
lt better be - all 40 kilos.

29
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,203
The final shipment
will be delivered in three days.

30
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,824
- Then we'll expect payment.
- Don't worry.'

31
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,699
Police! Throw down your guns!

32
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:55,314
Kill him.

33
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:47,869
lt's a great day for Americans.
This man alone...

34
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:58,426
There he is!

35
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,600
No flowers, thank you.

36
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:05,307
Welcome home, Frank. Good work
in Beirut. We heard about it.

37
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,528
Thanks. l want to know one thing -
is it true about Victoria?

38
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:13,232
l'm afraid so.
She ran off with some guy.

39
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,900
They got married last week.

40
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,662
Then it's over.
All of this is meaningless.

41
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:22,539
l did it for her. Everything.

42
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,119
And now she's gone.

43
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:29,380
And you came down here
to get a hot story, didn't you?

44
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:32,008
Pictures of me
to sell your newspapers.

45
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:35,848
- Frank...
- Sure, you think l'm a big hero.

46
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:40,481
Do any of you understand
how a man can hurt inside?

47
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:42,690
Frank, they're not here for you.

48
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:45,269
''Weird Al'' Yankovic is on the plane.

49
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:53,573
What about the wedding?
What was she wearing?

50
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:57,082
Don't torture yourself!
Put her out of your mind.

51
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,835
l can't get her out of my mind.
What about the guy?

52
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:04,175
- Do you know anything about him?
- Not much.

53
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,420
Just that he's an Olympic gymnast

54
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:09,183
and it's the best sex she's ever had.

55
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:14,890
l trusted her and followed my heart.
Foolishly, it seems.

56
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:17,604
l'm just gonna have
to learn to forget.

57
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:22,820
That's why l took my vacation
in Beirut - to find some peace.

58
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,948
lt won't be easy.

59
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:28,453
Everywhere l look,
something reminds me of her.

60
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,247
Maybe cops and women just don't mix.

61
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:36,753
What about Nordberg?
l came as soon as l heard.

62
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,213
He's alive, but on life support.

63
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:42,008
He's got a 50/50 chance of living,

64
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:46,227
though there's only
a 10~/. chance of that.

65
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:12,288
Mrs Nordberg, l think
we can save your husband's arm.

66
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,423
Where would you like it sent?

67
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:19,637
- Frank! l'm so glad you came!
- Wilma, l came as soon as l heard.

68
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:21,387
Thank you, Frank.

69
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:24,643
- Where's Nordberg?
- He's right here.

70
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:28,232
Nordberg, it's Frank, your buddy.

71
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:32,612
l'll get it!

72
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,203
Get the switch
at the back of the bed!

73
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:46,880
Nordberg, it's me, Frank.
Who did this to you?

74
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:48,958
l...love you.

75
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:54,170
l love you, too, Nordberg.
Who were they?

76
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:57,932
- Ship... Boat...
- That's right. A boat.

77
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,271
When you're better,
we'll go sailing together,

78
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:04,144
- just like last year.
- No... Drugs.

79
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:08,648
Nurse, give this man some drugs!
Can't you see he's in pain?

80
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:11,199
- Give him a shot, quickly!
- No...

81
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:14,490
Heroin! Heroin, Frank!

82
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:16,871
Nordberg, that's a pretty tall order.

83
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,127
Give me a couple of days
on that one.

84
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:26,712
Oh, my poor Nordberg!
He was such a good man, Frank.

85
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:31,182
He never wanted to hurt anyone.
Who would do such a thing?

86
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,928
lt's hard to tell.

87
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:38,062
A gang of thugs, a blackmailer,
an angry husband, a gay lover...

88
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,358
Frank, get a hold of yourself!

89
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:47,406
A good cop - needlessly cut down
by some cowardly hoodlums.

90
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:50,995
- No way for a man to die.
- You're right, Ed.

91
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,001
A parachute not opening -
that's the way to die,

92
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:56,542
getting caught in a combine,

93
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:59,253
having your nuts bit off
by a Laplander.

94
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,382
That's the way l want to go.

95
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,011
Frank! This is terrible!

96
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:11,441
Don't worry, Wilma.
Your husband is gonna be all right.

97
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:16,566
Just think positive.
Never let a doubt enter your mind.

98
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,648
He's right, Wilma,

99
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,652
but don't wait till the last minute
to fill out those organ donor cards.

100
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:27,448
What l'm trying to say is,
as soon as Nordberg is better,

101
00:12:27,543 --> 00:12:29,702
he's welcome back at Police Squad.

102
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:34,838
Unless he's a drooling vegetable,
but that's only common sense.

103
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:41,224
Do you know why Nordberg
was at the waterfront?

104
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,011
No...

105
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:48,309
But l found this at home in a drawer.

106
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:55,939
A photograph!
''l Luv You'' out of Caracas.

107
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,705
A Panamanian ship.

108
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:03,000
When he said ''l love you'', he was
telling you the name of the ship!

109
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:06,170
l realise that...now.

110
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:10,037
- We'd better check this out.
- l want every available man on it.

111
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:12,212
l can't spare anybody.

112
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:16,432
We're in charge of security
for Queen Elizabeth's visit.

113
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:19,187
Wilma, whatever scum did this,

114
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,767
no man will rest until he's behind
bars. Let's grab a bite to eat.

115
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:34,153
Due to the extraordinary efforts
of some of our civic leaders,

116
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:39,040
Queen Elizabeth has included
the city of Los Angeles

117
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:43,292
as one of the cities she'll visit
during her American tour.

118
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:49,047
Will the city hire
additional security officers?

119
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,301
We have placed the Queen's security
in the hands of Police Squad,

120
00:13:54,396 --> 00:13:57,515
a special division
of the Police Department,

121
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:00,692
represented here
by Lieutenant Frank Drebin.

122
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:06,698
Thank you, Your Honour.

123
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:09,574
Louder!

124
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:14,750
- You can use my radio mic.
- Thank you.

125
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:25,211
Thank you, Your Honour.
Protecting the Queen's safety

126
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:29,553
is a task that is gladly accepted
by Police Squad.

127
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:33,725
No matter how silly the idea
of having a queen might be to us,

128
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:38,813
as Americans we must be gracious
and considerate hosts.

129
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:42,657
Thank you, Lieutenant Drebin.

130
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:48,493
Of course, we all have a stake
in seeing that this portion

131
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:53,211
of the Queen's American tour
is completely protected.

132
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:58,126
And we can take pride
that the Queen...

133
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:06,179
lndeed, it is for all the people,

134
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:11,515
who will be able to share
in these...celebrations...

135
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,987
Especially exciting...

136
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:22,904
will be...the Queen's...
public appearances.

137
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,724
We also would like...

138
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:04,043
Ed and l drove to where Nordberg
had been found floating.

139
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:09,175
Without leads, you have to start
somewhere, and that was the harbour.

140
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:12,548
Please disperse. Please disperse.

141
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:16,972
There's nothing for you to see here.
Keep moving.

142
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,891
Where did they find him?

143
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:21,058
Out there.
Do you wanna take a dinghy?

144
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:24,356
No, l took care of that
at the press conference.

145
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:27,733
lt doesn't make sense.
Good policeman, bright future...

146
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:30,152
then something like this happens.

147
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:32,285
He was found by the nightwatchman.

148
00:16:32,373 --> 00:16:35,125
l'm gonna talk to the harbour-master.

149
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,249
l'll walk around and snoop.

150
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:46,545
- Yeah?
- Lieutenant Drebin, Police Squad.

151
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,214
l remember you. What do you want?

152
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:53,011
l wanna ask some questions.
Are you familiar with that face?

153
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:56,475
l don't know.
My memory ain't so great.

154
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,570
Oh, yeah?
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.

155
00:16:59,656 --> 00:17:01,695
- Still hazy.
- How about this?

156
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:03,941
l remember. Why do you want to know?

157
00:17:04,035 --> 00:17:07,572
- l can't tell you.
- Maybe this'll help.

158
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:11,200
- l don't think l should.
- Still don't think so?

159
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:14,794
- lt's Nordberg, he's a cop.
- No, he was dealin' 'H'.

160
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:16,627
- What?
- He was dirty!

161
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:19,634
Scum! l ought to
run you in right now!

162
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,257
He worked at Ludwig's Shipping.
He tried to push something.

163
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,685
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Why should l tell you?

164
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,937
- Maybe this'll help.
- l shouldn't tell you.

165
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,481
Can you spot me a 20? How about now?

166
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:34,728
l'm going down to Ludwig's office.

167
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:37,444
l'll find out
if you're telling the truth.

168
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:43,625
Vincent Ludwig owned one
of the city's largest corporations.

169
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:46,280
A respected business man
and civic leader,

170
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:49,580
he was to chair the Queen's reception
committee.

171
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:53,921
Now l was about to question him about
drugs and attempted murder.

172
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,930
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

173
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:05,977
Lieutenant Drebin to see you, sir.

174
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:10,476
Show him in.

175
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,955
- Lieutenant.
- The feeling is mutual.

176
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:21,825
Nice to meet you, too. Cuban?

177
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,415
No, Dutch-lrish.
My father was from Wales.

178
00:18:26,508 --> 00:18:28,051
Sit down.

179
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:31,385
- What a magnificent office.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

180
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:36,016
Most objects l have collected
over a period of many years -

181
00:18:36,102 --> 00:18:40,813
my Gainsborough, Ming vases.
Priceless!

182
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:45,859
They are objects which l feel
reflect my personality,

183
00:18:45,947 --> 00:18:48,153
like the Japanese fighting fish -

184
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,279
beautiful, graceful, elegant...

185
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:53,613
yet single-minded of purpose

186
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:57,372
and deadly when it finds
what it wants.

187
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,586
This particular one
is valued at over $20,000.

188
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:05,298
A luxury item, to be certain,

189
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:09,302
but l am a man who appreciates
the finer things in life.

190
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:13,473
Oh, this...
This is a rare Samurai pen,

191
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:16,481
a gift from Emperor Hirohito.

192
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:20,613
Unbreakable.
lmpervious to everything but water.

193
00:19:20,697 --> 00:19:25,572
- lts value is beyond estimation.
- That's fascinating.

194
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:30,620
But l'm sure you didn't pay this
visit for a lecture on fine art.

195
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,378
To what do l owe the honour?

196
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:37,294
l'm investigating the attempted
murder of a dock worker,

197
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,716
a man named Nordberg,
a police officer.

198
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,639
He is still alive, then?

199
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,099
He was shot six times.

200
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,441
Fortunately, the bullets missed
every vital organ.

201
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,226
- The salt water preserved him.
- So they...

202
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:58,812
So they got him
to the hospital in time?

203
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,906
He's in the intensive care ward
at Our Lady of the Worthless Miracle.

204
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:06,248
This certainly comes
as a shock to me.

205
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:11,577
As you know, l'm not the kind of man
who takes such things lightly.

206
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:15,588
There is no room in my organisation
for criminal activity.

207
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,092
Look out there - a vast
commercial development built by me.

208
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:24,266
Do you have any idea what was
out there just five years ago?

209
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:27,809
You bet you do. Orange groves!

210
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,985
Acres of them.
As far as the eye could see.

211
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,948
But now that land will generate
ten times the amount of profit.

212
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,944
Are you all right, Lieutenant?

213
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,364
Let me get you some Kleenex.

214
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:45,911
Has this officer -

215
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:48,128
What's his name? Nordberg -

216
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:52,261
been able to tell you anything?

217
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:56,842
Well, he hasn't been able
to tell us a thing so far,

218
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:59,855
but as soon as
he regains consciousness,

219
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,067
we'll see if he
can still play the guitar.

220
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:07,604
- Pardon?
- l've taken up a lot of your time.

221
00:21:07,697 --> 00:21:10,320
l'd like to look
at your employment records

222
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,866
and speak to someone in Personnel.

223
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:14,532
Of course.

224
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,325
- Dominique, send in Miss Spencer.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,129
l am quite busy making arrangements
for the royal visit,

226
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:27,131
but l will have my assistant
provide you with anything you need.

227
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,591
You've been very co-operative.
l'll note that in my report.

228
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:32,511
My pleasure.

229
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,983
Miss Spencer! This is
Lieutenant Drebin from Police Squad.

230
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,609
Hello...Mr Drebin.

231
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:45,861
Hello.

232
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:54,532
Oh!

233
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:13,603
Her hair was the colour
of gold in old paintings.

234
00:22:14,777 --> 00:22:17,944
She had a full set of curves

235
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:22,824
and the kind of legs
you'd like to suck on for a day.

236
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:26,614
She gave me a look
l could feel in my hip pocket.

237
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:32,541
Yep, this was starting
to get interesting.

238
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:41,764
- Nice beaver.
- Thank you.

239
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:45,847
- l just had it stuffed.
- Let me help you with that.

240
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:50,943
This should be
what you're looking for -

241
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:53,779
the shipping and employment records
for Pier 32.

242
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:56,488
Thank you.

243
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:59,114
l've heard police work is dangerous.

244
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:01,530
Yes, that's why l carry a big gun.

245
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,454
Couldn't it go off accidentally?

246
00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:06,833
l used to have that problem.

247
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:08,961
What did you do about it?

248
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:11,542
l just think about baseball.

249
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:16,632
That's a honey of an ankle-bracelet
you have there.

250
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:19,512
Did it slip down there again?

251
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:22,475
Yes, well...
l'll quickly go through these

252
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:24,605
and get them back to you tomorrow.

253
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:29,355
Fine, but there's no rush.
l mean, whenever you're through.

254
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,613
Thank you. l wish there was
some way l could repay you.

255
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:38,911
How about dinner? l know a place
that serves great Viking food.

256
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:43,131
lt's tempting, but l'm afraid
l must rest this evening,

257
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:45,255
tomorrow being Arbor Day.

258
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:48,212
Of course. Perhaps some other time.

259
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:51,887
- How about a rain check?
- Let's just stick to dinner.

260
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:55,594
Thank you for your help,
Miss Spencer.

261
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:58,978
My pleasure.

262
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:02,733
- Well?
- Mr Ludwig, you startled me!

263
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:04,695
l'm sorry, my dear.

264
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:07,948
Did you give the lieutenant
what he wanted?

265
00:24:08,034 --> 00:24:10,610
l gave him copies of the files
for Pier 32.

266
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:12,745
Good. That's good.

267
00:24:12,832 --> 00:24:17,828
He is an intriguing fellow,
don't you think?

268
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:21,920
Well, l don't know.
l've only just met him.

269
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,883
He seems very nice.

270
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,175
Jane, l realise
this is an unusual request,

271
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:30,600
but if there is something illegal
going on in this company,

272
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:34,474
l need to know about it,
so we can root it out.

273
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:36,642
That's why l want you to...

274
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:40,984
well, to get to know Drebin
a little better,

275
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:43,115
find out what he knows.

276
00:24:43,203 --> 00:24:45,989
Wouldn't this be best handled
by the police?

277
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,416
We are letting the police handle it,
my dear!

278
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:52,585
But we need to know
the facts quickly

279
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:55,792
before anything
gets into the newspapers.

280
00:24:55,883 --> 00:25:00,345
Don't forget, l have a responsibility
to the stockholders.

281
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:03,967
Well...if you put it that way...

282
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:07,974
- Yes, l'll do my best.
- That's better.

283
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:13,945
l'm sure you will.

284
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:23,534
lt was about 4pm
when l returned to Police Squad.

285
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:28,253
l wanted to see what the lab had
come up with on Nordberg's jacket,

286
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,794
the one they'd found on the docks.

287
00:25:30,883 --> 00:25:34,585
You can tell a lot from fibre
samples if they aren't too wet.

288
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,253
l was hoping we wouldn't
come up dry.

289
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:38,974
Hey, look out!

290
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:42,974
Police! Halt!

291
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:54,779
Anybody catch the licence plate?

292
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:58,288
Anybody get a look at the driver?

293
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:04,997
Take the names of everybody here
for questioning.

294
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,875
l've got to get...inside.

295
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:19,015
Hi, Ed, Ted. You got
those fibre samples yet?

296
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:21,184
- We got some action here.
- What?

297
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:23,733
We're testing our anti-graffiti wall.

298
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:25,694
We've got customers.

299
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,482
lt reacts when
the spray hits the sensors.

300
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:34,991
You've done it again - mazel tov!

301
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,872
Good work.
What will you think of next?

302
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,002
Now that you mention it,

303
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:42,961
here's something
we developed only yesterday.

304
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,887
To the casual observer -
an ordinary shoe.

305
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:49,886
But in actuality...
it makes a handy weapon.

306
00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:53,227
And everything a cop would need.

307
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,390
We call it the Swiss Army Shoe.

308
00:26:55,484 --> 00:27:00,062
- Great. And the fibre samples?
- Just one more thing.

309
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:02,444
See these cufflinks l'm wearing?

310
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:07,195
They're not just cufflinks. Each one
fires a single pin-sized dart,

311
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:10,374
that knocks out your victim
for a few minutes.

312
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,702
Let me demonstrate on Ed.

313
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:17,377
Ted! Why?

314
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:22,388
Don't worry.
He'll be up and around in no time.

315
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,602
- Why don't you take a pair?
- Actually, l could use another pair.

316
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,560
l think you'll like them.

317
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,400
- Want this, chief?
- Thank you, Al.

318
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,568
There's something
on the side of your mouth, Al.

319
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,193
No, no. The other side.

320
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:41,992
As you requested, we took some
fibre samples from Nordberg's jacket.

321
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,487
l'm afraid it doesn't look good.

322
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:48,081
- What do you mean?
- Take a look for yourself.

323
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:54,588
- l can't see anything.
- Use your open eye, Frank.

324
00:27:55,303 --> 00:27:57,343
Yeah, l can see it now.

325
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:01,015
At first, it appears
to be the normal cotton fibres.

326
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:03,806
But we discovered
a fine white powder.

327
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,641
Pure heroin.

328
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:10,820
How well do you know Nordberg?

329
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:14,488
We were partners for nine years
and he's my best friend.

330
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,993
We can't allow personal feelings
to get in the way.

331
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:22,827
- Are you saying that Nordberg...?
- The Queen arrives in two days.

332
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,459
lf the press should pick this up,

333
00:28:25,547 --> 00:28:28,632
it could be embarrassing
for the police and the city.

334
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:32,965
l'm sorry, Frank. l'm giving you
24 hours to clear Nordberg.

335
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:45,525
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

336
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:50,241
- A Mr Pahpshmir is here.
- Show him in.

337
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,547
ls there something wrong, Mr Ludwig?

338
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:02,374
No, it's nothing.

339
00:29:02,465 --> 00:29:06,714
- Then may we get down to business?
- Certainly. Have a seat.

340
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:09,924
l can carry out your request.

341
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,266
- My price is $20 million.
- Your price is not a problem.

342
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,690
But there is concern
on the part of those l represent,

343
00:29:19,778 --> 00:29:25,569
that you would be able to...
complete so difficult a task.

344
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:28,034
Tell me, Mr Pahpshmir,

345
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:33,710
in all the world,
who is the most effective assassin?

346
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:39,301
l would think anyone who manages to
conceal his identity as an assassin.

347
00:29:39,384 --> 00:29:44,344
Yes, but there is
even a more ideal assassin.

348
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:50,681
One who doesn't know
he is an assassin.

349
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:53,443
- Care for some tea?
- Yes, please.

350
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:56,646
Dominique, service for two, please.

351
00:30:08,211 --> 00:30:10,916
l must kill Pahpshmir.

352
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:22,681
- Cream and sugar, sir?
- Mr Pahpshmir?

353
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:28,557
Cream only, please.

354
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,448
- There's a gun on the floor, sir!
- Just leave it. lt's all right.

355
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,784
- The tea, please.
- Of course, sir.

356
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:44,291
Mr Pahpshmir, have you ever seen
sensory-induced hypnosis?

357
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,418
l think l just have.

358
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:49,258
How will she get near the target?

359
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:53,292
Oh, l doubt whether it will be her.

360
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:57,091
Good secretaries
are so hard to find these days.

361
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:59,808
And it seems to me...

362
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:04,434
anyone...can be an assassin.

363
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:12,569
l had 24 hours to find
something to clear my friend's name.

364
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,616
l returned to the hospital
with Ludwig's records

365
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,199
to try to jog Nordberg's memory.

366
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,995
Doctor, l have the chart,
if you're ready to go over it.

367
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,209
l'll be with you
when l've finished with Mr Nordberg.

368
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,377
Yes, Doctor.

369
00:31:32,937 --> 00:31:35,605
You'll be out of here
in a couple of...

370
00:31:41,655 --> 00:31:45,439
- l'd like to see Officer Nordberg.
- Sign in, please.

371
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,868
Wait a minute!
Where's the police guard?

372
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:52,903
- Drebin called and sent him home.
- Drebin?

373
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,625
l must kill Nordberg.
l must kill Nordberg.

374
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,965
Drebin, Police Squad!
Let go of that pillow!

375
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,293
Medical emergency!

376
00:32:40,723 --> 00:32:44,473
Drebin, Police Squad.
Follow that black car!

377
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:48,472
The car! Follow that car!

378
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:52,184
Stephanie, check your mirror. Signal.

379
00:32:52,277 --> 00:32:54,734
Now pull into traffic.

380
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,071
Try and ease off on the brake.

381
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:06,378
- Give it a little gas.
- l know a short cut. Turn left here!

382
00:33:09,716 --> 00:33:12,090
- There he is!
- Easy!

383
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:28,939
Turn right! Follow him!

384
00:33:29,031 --> 00:33:32,947
lt's OK.
Normally, you would not be going 65

385
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:36,119
down the wrong way
of a one-way street.

386
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,081
Apply the brakes.

387
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:42,872
Now put it in reverse.

388
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,797
- You dumb broad!
- Stephanie...

389
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:55,099
Gently extend your arm.

390
00:33:56,812 --> 00:34:00,265
Extend your middle finger.

391
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,115
- Very good. Well done.
- There he is!

392
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,656
Go for it, Stephanie!

393
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,747
Excuse me. Excuse me.

394
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,294
All right, move on!
Nothing to see here!

395
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,843
Please disperse!

396
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:04,469
Nothing to see here. Please!

397
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:11,399
The attempt on Nordberg's
life left me shaken and disturbed.

398
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:14,355
The questions kept coming up
again and again,

399
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,525
like bubbles in a case of soda.

400
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,948
Who was this character
in the hospital?

401
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:23,869
Why was he trying to kill
Nordberg...and for whom?

402
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:27,872
Did Ludwig lie to me?
l didn't have any proof,

403
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:30,536
but somehow,
l didn't entirely trust him.

404
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:34,417
Why was the ''l Luv You''
not listed in Ludwig's records?

405
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:37,264
lf it was, did he know about it?

406
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:39,592
lf he didn't, who did?

407
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:41,891
And where the hell was l?

408
00:35:44,857 --> 00:35:47,479
lt was almost midnight
when l got home.

409
00:35:47,568 --> 00:35:50,321
l just wanted
to slip under my blankets,

410
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:53,823
but my night was
just about to begin.

411
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,079
You're late.

412
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:38,920
That depends on what l'm late for.

413
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:42,090
You said we should
have dinner some time.

414
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:45,046
Tonight became ''some time''.

415
00:36:46,513 --> 00:36:48,672
l'm boiling a roast.

416
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:53,426
How hot and wet do you like it?

417
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,764
Very hot and awfully wet.

418
00:36:58,862 --> 00:37:02,610
You seem to know your way
around a kitchen.

419
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,151
l'm just as handy
in other rooms of the house.

420
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:08,570
That shirt looks familiar.

421
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:12,912
lt's yours. l didn't want
to get stained or wrinkled.

422
00:37:13,003 --> 00:37:16,004
At least...not yet.

423
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:23,305
Do you mind if l slip
into something more comfortable?

424
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:32,140
There. That's better.

425
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,357
l hope you've brought your appetite.

426
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:39,323
l've brought everything.

427
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,031
Well, then, dig in.

428
00:37:46,835 --> 00:37:51,378
lnteresting. Almost as interesting
as the photographs l saw today.

429
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:53,839
l was young. l needed the work.

430
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:57,047
No, they were taken
at Ludwig's docks.

431
00:37:57,138 --> 00:38:01,385
A ship came in, a Panamanian ship.
lt wasn't on Ludwig's records.

432
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:03,765
Probably an oversight.

433
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:07,187
How is your...meat?

434
00:38:10,238 --> 00:38:12,312
You be the judge of that.

435
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,406
Mmm...

436
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:22,663
l've got nine more.

437
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:30,260
- Have you seen that ship?
- l don't know.

438
00:38:30,344 --> 00:38:34,176
lt doesn't look like ours,
but we deal with so many ships.

439
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:37,183
Has Officer Nordberg
told you anything?

440
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:41,314
No, there's been another attempt
on his life. He's in a coma.

441
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:45,693
That's terrible!
This world is such a violent place.

442
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:48,485
lf it wasn't, l'd be out of a job,

443
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:53,284
but l'd give it up tomorrow
to live in a world without crime.

444
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,537
That's beautiful.

445
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,590
This is all happening too fast.

446
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:09,009
- l've been hurt before.
- l'm sorry.

447
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,557
l'd known her for years.

448
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:17,016
We used to go to
all the police functions together.

449
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:20,311
How l loved her,
but she had her music.

450
00:39:20,403 --> 00:39:23,192
l think she had her music.

451
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:27,066
She'd hang out with the
Chicago Male Chorus and Symphony.

452
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:31,206
l don't recall her playing
an instrument or being able to sing.

453
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:34,247
Yet she was on the road
300 days of the year.

454
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:39,414
l bought her a harp for Christmas.
She asked me what it was.

455
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:44,301
lt's the same old story.
Boy finds girl.

456
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:47,059
Boy loses girl. Girl finds boy.

457
00:39:47,144 --> 00:39:50,227
Boy forgets girl. Boy remembers girl.

458
00:39:50,313 --> 00:39:52,556
Girl dies in a blimp accident

459
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,521
over the Orange Bowl
on New Year's Day.

460
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:58,696
- Goodyear?
- No, the worst.

461
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:00,526
Poor dear!

462
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:07,330
Now, now. l don't want to upset you.

463
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:10,419
Frank, it's not that.

464
00:40:10,504 --> 00:40:12,912
Why did you have to be so wonderful?

465
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:19,260
- There's something l must tell you.
- No! No need to tell me anything.

466
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:22,265
What's in the past
doesn't matter anyway.

467
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:23,762
Maybe...

468
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:28,812
Maybe we're just two lonely souls
who have found each other.

469
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,105
Funny-face!

470
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:56,553
l want you to know...
l practise safe sex.

471
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,385
So do l.

472
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:36,798
l had a wonderful day, Frank. l can't
believe we just met yesterday.

473
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:40,763
You really mean that?
You're not just saying it,

474
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:43,303
because we exchanged bodily fluids?

475
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:46,762
No, l really mean it.
You're very special.

476
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:51,185
- Can l interest you in a nightcap?
- No, thanks, l don't wear them.

477
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,602
Actually, l'm on stake-out tonight.

478
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:57,612
l'll be thinking about you.
l'll call you tomorrow.

479
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:00,413
OK.

480
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,960
Good night!

481
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:22,396
The answer's up there
in Ludwig's office.

482
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:25,435
Call it what you will -
a hunch, women's intuition.

483
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:27,733
Ludwig knows more than he's saying.

484
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:31,818
A hunch won't stand up in court.
Where are your hard facts?

485
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,776
He's the only one except us
who knew Nordberg was still alive.

486
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:40,333
Next thing we know,
some thug tries to knock him off.

487
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:45,377
Maybe. But breaking into Ludwig's
office is taking a big chance.

488
00:43:45,466 --> 00:43:48,918
l know. You take a chance
getting up in the morning,

489
00:43:49,013 --> 00:43:52,131
crossing the street
or sticking your face in a fan.

490
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:54,264
There he is!

491
00:43:58,022 --> 00:44:01,226
Just trust me on this, Ed.
l know l'm right.

492
00:44:01,317 --> 00:44:03,275
OK, but be careful.

493
00:44:03,362 --> 00:44:06,448
Get some sleep.
l'll see you in the morning.

494
00:44:58,176 --> 00:45:00,217
Bingo!

495
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:49,987
''20,000,000 deposited,
Omani Bank, Zurich,

496
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:52,276
''upon proof of Queen's death.''

497
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:16,985
Destroying property, arson...

498
00:48:17,078 --> 00:48:20,198
sexual assault
with a concrete dildo?!

499
00:48:20,289 --> 00:48:23,127
What the hell were you doing there?

500
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,286
l'm sorry about that, Your Honour,

501
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:29,627
but we believe Ludwig is involved
in a plot to assassinate the Queen.

502
00:48:29,717 --> 00:48:33,502
That's ridiculous!
Where is this ''evidence''?

503
00:48:33,598 --> 00:48:37,549
Well...it...burned in the f-fire.

504
00:48:37,645 --> 00:48:39,304
Gentlemen,

505
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:43,775
Vincent Ludwig is one of the most
respected members of this community.

506
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,606
lf we're very nice to him,
he will agree not to press charges.

507
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:51,369
- Your Honour!
- Did l make myself clear?

508
00:48:51,451 --> 00:48:54,075
Yes, Your Honour. Good day.

509
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:58,414
Drebin!

510
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:04,791
l don't want any more trouble like
you had last year. That's my policy.

511
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:10,128
When l see five weirdos dressed
in togas stabbing a guy in a park,

512
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:13,309
l shoot the bastards.
That's my policy.

513
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:20,229
That was a Shakespeare in the Park
production of ''Julius Caesar''!

514
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,982
- You killed five actors! Good ones.
- Your Honour...

515
00:49:25,073 --> 00:49:29,406
Your presence at the Queen's
reception tonight is not necessary.

516
00:49:29,496 --> 00:49:31,453
ls that understood?

517
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,625
We understand, Your Honour.
Thank you.

518
00:49:57,615 --> 00:50:00,236
The plane has taxied to a stop.

519
00:50:00,326 --> 00:50:03,325
Any minute now
we expect the doors to open

520
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:05,987
and we'll get a glimpse
of the Queen,

521
00:50:06,082 --> 00:50:10,128
as she begins her first visit
to Los Angeles in five years.

522
00:50:10,212 --> 00:50:13,746
lt's a balmy, beautiful evening too.

523
00:50:13,841 --> 00:50:17,259
She's going from here
to a formal reception...

524
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:25,721
- Jane!
- Frank!

525
00:50:27,857 --> 00:50:30,942
l'm just making some dinner.
Are you hungry?

526
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,067
Maybe just a bite.

527
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,239
Ludwig wanted me to ask you
to meet him tonight.

528
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:40,904
There is something you should know.
l was in his place last night.

529
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:45,826
How nice! Did he show you his
Ming vases and rare oil paintings?

530
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,251
Jane, l think that he's involved
in a number of criminal activities.

531
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:52,382
Frank, stop it!

532
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:55,804
Vincent Ludwig is a well-respected,
generous, kind man.

533
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,142
- You don't know him like l do.
- How's that?

534
00:50:59,229 --> 00:51:04,685
- What's that supposed to mean?
- l'm sorry. l'm worried about you.

535
00:51:04,776 --> 00:51:08,905
l don't trust him and l don't want
you mixed up in anything dangerous.

536
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:12,240
Are Woo back in business?
They closed down three years ago.

537
00:51:12,325 --> 00:51:17,369
Gee, has it been that long? l don't
feel like Chinese tonight anyway.

538
00:51:19,127 --> 00:51:23,790
lt's sweet of you to be concerned,
but you're wrong about Vincent.

539
00:51:23,882 --> 00:51:27,666
He's such a gentleman.
He's so generous.

540
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:29,801
He just wants to talk with you

541
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:33,140
to clear up any doubts
you might have.

542
00:51:33,227 --> 00:51:35,303
- When?
- Tonight.

543
00:51:35,394 --> 00:51:38,269
Meet him at the 7th Street
stockyards.

544
00:51:38,358 --> 00:51:41,228
All right,
but promise you'll be careful.

545
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:44,937
Of course l will,
funny-face, for you.

546
00:51:46,198 --> 00:51:48,988
l've got to go. See you tomorrow.

547
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:52,912
Are you sure you won't have
something to eat?

548
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,311
Ludwig?

549
00:52:20,406 --> 00:52:23,491
- Drebin?
- Yeah, l'm Drebin.

550
00:52:23,578 --> 00:52:27,329
l have a message for you
from Vincent Ludwig.

551
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:32,292
l'm sorry, l can't hear you!

552
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,380
Don't fire the gun
while you're talking.

553
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:02,737
All right, put your gun down
and your hands up!

554
00:53:36,455 --> 00:53:39,206
Matthews, stake out that end,

555
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:43,373
and card-check for
anyone suspicious looking.

556
00:53:43,464 --> 00:53:45,540
Frank, what are you doing here?

557
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:49,418
l've been trading shots
with one of Ludwig's goons.

558
00:53:49,512 --> 00:53:53,213
They're planning
to do her tonight, here.

559
00:53:53,307 --> 00:53:58,266
- We better be on the lookout.
- Excuse me, ma'am, security.

560
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:04,818
- What's the meaning of this?
- Relax! Nothing will happen.

561
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:07,991
- l didn't do anything.
- Yeah? What about this?

562
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:12,406
You think we were born yesterday?
You didn't do anything, huh?

563
00:54:12,497 --> 00:54:14,075
l got rights!

564
00:54:14,164 --> 00:54:17,417
Ed, he's got a picture of your wife!

565
00:54:17,503 --> 00:54:19,543
Ethel!

566
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:23,803
All right,
anyone else here seeing his wife?

567
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:27,255
That's all right, Frank.
Let's get in the hall.

568
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:40,110
Are you enjoying yourself, my dear?

569
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:44,824
l'm so excited to be here.
l appreciate your inviting me.

570
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:48,743
Pleasure's all mine.
Perhaps afterwards we can...

571
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:52,786
- Drebin!
- Frank!

572
00:54:52,878 --> 00:54:55,998
You're both right.
Surprised to see me, Mr Ludwig?

573
00:54:56,091 --> 00:54:59,009
This is not the time
or place to talk.

574
00:54:59,094 --> 00:55:01,667
lt's way past the time we talked.

575
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:04,220
The gloves are off,
l'm playing hardball.

576
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:08,604
lt's fourth and fifteen, and
you're looking at a full court press.

577
00:55:08,688 --> 00:55:12,639
Mr Drebin!
lf you have evidence, then use it.

578
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:16,687
lf not, l am warning you -
get off my back!

579
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,821
Or it will cost you dearly.

580
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,791
- Frank, what's wrong?
- A lot of things, sweetie-pie.

581
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:29,577
A meeting that turned into
a peek-a-boo session with bullets,

582
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:32,922
set up by someone
who's been playing me like a violin.

583
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:35,796
Funny-face,
what are you talking about?

584
00:55:35,886 --> 00:55:39,933
My stockyard meeting, butter-wings.
Don't you remember setting that up?

585
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:43,186
Mr Ludwig said you'd called it off!
Believe me!

586
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:45,596
Thumb me another one, shuckie-lumps!

587
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,444
Frank, it's the truth!

588
00:55:48,529 --> 00:55:52,476
Cops and women don't mix.
Like eating a spoonful of Drano.

589
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:56,406
lt'll clean you out,
but it'll leave you hollow inside.

590
00:55:56,494 --> 00:55:58,535
Too bad, sugar-puff.

591
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:02,710
We could have been something.

592
00:56:02,794 --> 00:56:05,464
l only did what l was told to do!

593
00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:07,873
- Like make love to me?
- Frank!

594
00:56:09,593 --> 00:56:11,801
That makes things easier, Princess.

595
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:15,222
To think l trusted you!
l made a big mistake.

596
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:18,892
- You can take this back.
- Whose is that?

597
00:56:20,983 --> 00:56:25,195
Doesn't matter.
Take care of yourself, baby.

598
00:56:26,573 --> 00:56:28,482
By the way...

599
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:30,531
l faked every orgasm.

600
00:56:31,494 --> 00:56:33,535
Funny-face!

601
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,869
And to commemorate our friendship,

602
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,502
the city of Los Angeles is proud
to present to the Royal Family

603
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:47,711
this Revolutionary War musket,
donated by Mr Vincent Ludwig.

604
00:56:49,056 --> 00:56:52,261
Ladies and gentlemen,
Her Royal Highness,

605
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:55,187
Queen Elizabeth ll!

606
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:35,108
lt's disgusting the way they splash
this stuff all over the newspapers!

607
00:57:35,194 --> 00:57:37,818
What is journalism coming to?

608
00:57:37,906 --> 00:57:41,526
You're laying on top of the Queen
with her legs wrapped around you

609
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:43,198
and they call that news!

610
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:46,829
They can't kick you off the Force,
it's not fair.

611
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:49,788
l know. Life isn't always fair.

612
00:57:49,879 --> 00:57:55,300
Just think, the next time l shoot
someone, l could be arrested.

613
00:57:55,386 --> 00:57:57,507
Hey, look at that!

614
00:57:57,596 --> 00:58:02,722
The missing evidence in the Kilner
case! My God, he WAS innocent!

615
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:06,096
He went to the chair
two years ago, Frank.

616
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:09,558
Well...what's the use?

617
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,736
What good are these damn awards
and citations?

618
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,447
Frank...

619
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:17,073
Frank, that's not your desk!

620
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,496
Frank! l've been
looking all over for you!

621
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:23,666
Running another errand
for your boyfriend?

622
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:27,335
l tried to call last night.
l went by your place. Where were you?

623
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:29,832
l was out walking. All night.

624
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:32,928
Listen to me!
l have important information.

625
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:36,761
There was never anything
between Vincent and me.

626
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:40,221
- He likes East German men.
- What about you?

627
00:58:40,314 --> 00:58:42,471
l like cops.

628
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:46,434
- All right! Yeah!
- Settle down. Take it easy.

629
00:58:47,571 --> 00:58:50,490
- What've you got?
- l overheard Ludwig.

630
00:58:50,575 --> 00:58:55,700
You were right. He is planning to
have someone assassinate the Queen!

631
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,161
- Where?
- At the baseball game.

632
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:01,667
The Queen will be there
as Ludwig's guest.

633
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:05,885
ls Ludwig going to shoot her
in front of 60,000 fans?

634
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:08,755
No, a player,
during the 7th inning stretch.

635
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:11,682
- lt starts in 20 minutes.
- l'll go.

636
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:14,770
- l'll go with you.
- Stay with Ludwig

637
00:59:14,853 --> 00:59:18,105
- to allay suspicion.
- OK, let's go!

638
00:59:18,192 --> 00:59:19,982
Wait! Wait!

639
00:59:20,068 --> 00:59:24,149
l've gotten you into enough trouble
already. l'll go alone.

640
00:59:24,241 --> 00:59:29,153
No! This'll get you back on
the Force. We're right behind you.

641
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:36,246
Frank? l wanted you to know now,

642
00:59:36,337 --> 00:59:40,632
l've loved you since the first day
l met you, and l'll never stop.

643
00:59:40,717 --> 00:59:42,759
l'm a very lucky woman.

644
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,756
So am l.

645
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:57,604
Good afternoon.
We're coming live from the Big A,

646
00:59:57,697 --> 01:00:00,863
where the California Angels
meet the Seattle Mariners

647
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:05,280
in their showdown
for the Division League.

648
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:09,121
Hello! l'm Curt Gowdy,
along with Jim Palmer,

649
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:12,295
Tim McCarver, Dick Vitale, Mel Allen,

650
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:15,584
Dick Enberg and Dr Joyce Brothers.

651
01:00:15,675 --> 01:00:18,429
Join us for this
all-important ball game.

652
01:00:18,513 --> 01:00:20,255
And a special game it is.

653
01:00:20,346 --> 01:00:24,180
As we know, it is being attended
by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

654
01:00:24,268 --> 01:00:26,940
l'm sure she'll enjoy this game, Jim.

655
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:30,100
We've got all the exits covered.

656
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:32,268
l ought to arrest Ludwig right now.

657
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:36,230
No, we've got to let him
make the first move.

658
01:00:36,323 --> 01:00:40,026
The Mayor would have you arrested.
You've got to stay out of sight.

659
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,792
l've got to get that assassin.

660
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:45,033
lt could be any of those players.

661
01:00:45,126 --> 01:00:48,663
l've got to get down on that field
and search those players.

662
01:00:48,757 --> 01:00:52,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and welcome

663
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:54,959
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth ll!

664
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:05,730
One moment.

665
01:01:07,779 --> 01:01:10,733
Over there - these seats are taken.

666
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:29,834
My dear, is something bothering you?

667
01:01:29,929 --> 01:01:31,638
No, why do you ask?

668
01:01:31,724 --> 01:01:35,934
You haven't said a word.
You seem...nervous.

669
01:01:36,019 --> 01:01:40,683
Well, you know how important
this game is for the Angels.

670
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:44,360
Why he not here now?
l do not like to wait for him.

671
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:50,238
Mr Pallazzo, our head usher will
be here in two minutes. Please wait.

672
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:54,706
- He should be here now!
- l'll send him right over.

673
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:57,878
l do not wait for him!
He waits for me!

674
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,008
- Yes?
- Mr Pallazzo?

675
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:08,798
l am the head usher.
l am here to... Excuse me.

676
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,933
- Mr Pallazzo?
- Yes?

677
01:02:18,028 --> 01:02:22,027
- l am the head usher.
- One second.

678
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:23,611
Ladies and gentlemen,

679
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:28,032
on behalf of the California Angels
and the City of Los Angeles,

680
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:30,531
on the occasion of the royal visit,

681
01:02:30,628 --> 01:02:34,125
please welcome
internationally-renowned opera star,

682
01:02:34,213 --> 01:02:36,622
Enrico Pallazzo!

683
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:43,054
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us honour America,

684
01:02:43,143 --> 01:02:49,097
as Mr Pallazzo will now sing
our national anthem.

685
01:04:10,745 --> 01:04:14,825
And now we'll wait
for the exchange of line-ups

686
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,204
and the start of today's ball game.

687
01:04:25,678 --> 01:04:30,424
Excuse me, could you tell me,
is this an official bat?

688
01:04:33,731 --> 01:04:37,313
The Queen's visit
has brought a sell-out crowd!

689
01:04:37,402 --> 01:04:41,695
And the fans are being entertained
by the stadium's Angel Vision,

690
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,649
showing some unusual moments
in baseball over the years!

691
01:05:05,934 --> 01:05:07,975
Sorry, fellas!

692
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:38,135
How about that?

693
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:41,683
Ladies and gentlemen,

694
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:46,312
now taking the field -
your California Angels!

695
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:56,242
For everybody's safety,

696
01:05:56,327 --> 01:06:00,576
we ask that you do not throw
any objects on the field.

697
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:03,158
We thank you for your co-operation.

698
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:10,383
As the Angels take the field, we're
ready for the first pitch ceremony

699
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:14,468
with the Queen of England
ready to toss out the first ball.

700
01:06:17,896 --> 01:06:21,975
How about that?
Let's have a round of applause!

701
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:24,473
We're ready for the start,

702
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:27,524
as these lovely ladies would agree.

703
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:31,151
Those are the players' wives,
here to enjoy the game.

704
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:42,295
What d'you say, Cummings?
Are we gonna do this today?

705
01:06:42,382 --> 01:06:44,006
Do what?

706
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:45,885
Play ball!

707
01:06:49,014 --> 01:06:51,969
Frank! Al, it's Frank!

708
01:06:56,941 --> 01:07:01,401
The game's under way. Dave Spiwack
ready to face Jay Johnstone!

709
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,969
- Nothing to report.
- Don't worry, Al.

710
01:07:24,056 --> 01:07:27,508
lf one of the players is the killer,
Frank'll find him,

711
01:07:27,603 --> 01:07:30,851
even if he has to search
every one of them.

712
01:07:30,938 --> 01:07:34,308
..lead-off hitter Jay Johnstone.

713
01:07:34,401 --> 01:07:38,400
Hello, pal. Let's see
if that uniform's on straight.

714
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:43,366
Good here. Now let's see the shirt.
You should take a large.

715
01:07:43,454 --> 01:07:46,573
lt's a little tight in the crotch.

716
01:07:46,665 --> 01:07:49,074
All right? All set?

717
01:07:51,338 --> 01:07:53,912
OK, play ball!

718
01:08:22,457 --> 01:08:24,416
Strike?

719
01:08:27,756 --> 01:08:30,046
Yeah, strike!

720
01:08:42,982 --> 01:08:47,146
Stee-rike two!

721
01:09:02,255 --> 01:09:07,595
Stee-rike three!

722
01:09:57,362 --> 01:09:59,189
You're clean!

723
01:11:49,954 --> 01:11:51,531
Have you found him yet?

724
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:54,196
No, and l've searched
almost everybody.

725
01:11:54,292 --> 01:11:58,455
Yeah. There's only one more out
before the seventh inning stretch.

726
01:11:58,546 --> 01:12:03,041
You're going to have to stall them.
Don't let 'em get that third out.

727
01:12:03,134 --> 01:12:04,797
Right.

728
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:12,310
The Mariners' number four -
Armando Criscione! Criscione!

729
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:22,484
- Ball!
- Ball?

730
01:12:32,921 --> 01:12:34,545
Ball!

731
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:48,480
Get...get...what the...? Get off!

732
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,604
Catch it! Catch it!

733
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:58,149
- Get 'em off!
- Go, go, go!

734
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:05,037
- Safe!
- What do you mean, safe?

735
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:07,249
l don't believe it!

736
01:13:09,337 --> 01:13:11,166
Second base! On two!

737
01:13:12,341 --> 01:13:14,417
There's a throw by the catcher

738
01:13:14,511 --> 01:13:17,927
and now they've got Criscione
hung up between 1st and 2nd!

739
01:13:18,015 --> 01:13:20,138
What the hell are you doing?

740
01:13:20,226 --> 01:13:21,389
What?

741
01:13:21,478 --> 01:13:26,271
- You're not supposed to do that!
- Wait a minute! Stop that!

742
01:13:26,358 --> 01:13:29,063
Put that back down! Give me the ball!

743
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,323
l'll get you!

744
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,697
lt's hard to believe,

745
01:13:35,785 --> 01:13:39,487
but apparently the umpires
have got Criscione in a run-down!

746
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:43,955
- Safe!
- Safe?

747
01:13:44,046 --> 01:13:45,457
How about that?

748
01:13:45,548 --> 01:13:47,374
- Out!
- Safe!

749
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,461
- Out!
- He was safe!

750
01:13:49,552 --> 01:13:50,750
- Out!
- Safe!

751
01:13:50,845 --> 01:13:53,337
There's a sight l've never seen!

752
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:57,058
- Safe!
- What are you doing?

753
01:13:57,143 --> 01:13:58,687
Safe! Safe! Safe!

754
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:01,558
- He was out!
- He was safe!

755
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:04,439
You idiot! He was out!

756
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:06,902
All right, you're out of here!

757
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:10,076
- What?
- You can't throw an umpire out!

758
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,699
All right, YOU'RE out!

759
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:17,954
Hold on! Even the guy running
the scoreboard says he was out!

760
01:14:18,044 --> 01:14:21,380
And he's up in the mezzanine!

761
01:14:21,465 --> 01:14:22,877
lt's the third out!

762
01:14:40,236 --> 01:14:43,358
l must kill...the Queen.

763
01:14:48,038 --> 01:14:50,612
l must kill...the Queen.

764
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:55,376
Frank, it's the right-fielder!

765
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,428
- You're the boss!
- lt was safe.

766
01:15:05,518 --> 01:15:08,090
Now, we're going to take a walk.

767
01:15:08,477 --> 01:15:11,351
How could you
do something so vicious?

768
01:15:11,442 --> 01:15:16,318
lt was easy. Don't forget l spent
two years as a building contractor.

769
01:15:16,405 --> 01:15:18,646
Now, let's go quietly.

770
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:25,239
Hey, look at that! Let's get him!

771
01:15:36,512 --> 01:15:38,719
Kick him in the balls!

772
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,720
l must kill...the Queen.

773
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,647
Look out!

774
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:36,991
The umpire...
He saved the Queen's life!

775
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:39,122
That's not the umpire, Your Honour.

776
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,338
Hey, it's Enrico Pallazzo!

777
01:16:56,313 --> 01:16:59,400
Frank! Frank, help!

778
01:16:59,485 --> 01:17:02,485
Frank! Frank, help! Frank!

779
01:17:17,254 --> 01:17:19,165
Hold it, Ludwig!

780
01:17:19,258 --> 01:17:21,631
Stay where you are!

781
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:24,175
- He's got a gun!
- l know.

782
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:27,965
You ruined my life.
Now l'm going to ruin yours.

783
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:31,061
- Leave the girl alone!
- l am. l'm going to kill you.

784
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,187
l see.

785
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,819
Two can play at that game!

786
01:17:45,371 --> 01:17:48,244
- You killed him!
- No, just stunned.

787
01:17:48,334 --> 01:17:50,290
He'll be all right.

788
01:17:56,676 --> 01:17:58,504
Well...

789
01:18:23,959 --> 01:18:27,046
Frank...it's horrible!

790
01:18:28,256 --> 01:18:32,386
- lt's so horrible!
- l know, Ed.

791
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:35,051
My father went the same way.

792
01:18:50,741 --> 01:18:54,953
l must kill...Frank Drebin.

793
01:18:55,038 --> 01:18:58,122
l must kill...Frank Drebin.

794
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:01,452
No, no, don't shoot!

795
01:19:01,796 --> 01:19:05,663
Jane...it's me...

796
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:09,422
Funny-face.

797
01:19:09,513 --> 01:19:13,346
l must kill Frank Drebin.

798
01:19:13,435 --> 01:19:16,221
You love Frank Drebin.

799
01:19:16,313 --> 01:19:19,314
And Frank Drebin loves you.

800
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:23,314
Jane, if you don't love me,
you might as well pull that trigger,

801
01:19:23,404 --> 01:19:29,194
because without you,
l wouldn't want to live anyway.

802
01:19:29,286 --> 01:19:32,739
l've finally found
someone l can love -

803
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:36,997
a good, clean love...
without utensils.

804
01:19:37,085 --> 01:19:39,922
l must kill Frank Drebin.

805
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:43,464
lt's a topsy-turvy world, Jane,

806
01:19:43,553 --> 01:19:48,181
and maybe the problems of two people
don't amount to a hill of beans,

807
01:19:48,267 --> 01:19:51,801
but this is our hill
and these are our beans.

808
01:19:53,314 --> 01:19:57,859
Since l met you, l've noticed
things l never knew where there -

809
01:19:57,943 --> 01:20:01,694
birds singing, dew glistening
on a newly-formed leaf,

810
01:20:01,784 --> 01:20:04,155
stop lights...

811
01:20:04,244 --> 01:20:05,905
l must kill...

812
01:20:05,997 --> 01:20:09,365
Jane, this morning...

813
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:13,670
l bought something for you.
lt's not very much,

814
01:20:13,755 --> 01:20:18,881
but pretty good
for an honest policeman's salary.

815
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:20,929
lt's an engagement ring.

816
01:20:21,014 --> 01:20:23,054
l'd have given it to you earlier,

817
01:20:23,142 --> 01:20:26,392
but l wanted to wait
until we were alone.

818
01:20:30,566 --> 01:20:33,568
- l...
- l love you, Jane.

819
01:20:38,993 --> 01:20:40,821
Oh, Frank!

820
01:20:53,259 --> 01:20:55,503
l'm sorry!

821
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:10,605
l'm sorry that l yelled at you
yesterday, l really am.

822
01:21:12,574 --> 01:21:13,951
Drebin!

823
01:21:14,034 --> 01:21:16,704
l was wrong about you.

824
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:20,917
This city and the whole world
owes you a debt of gratitude.

825
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:22,200
Thank you.

826
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:25,628
And Monday morning
we want you back at Police Squad...

827
01:21:25,716 --> 01:21:29,713
- with a promotion to captain.
- Mayor...

828
01:21:29,803 --> 01:21:34,513
Don't thank me. There's someone else
here who wants to thank you.

829
01:21:34,601 --> 01:21:36,972
- Nordberg!
- Hiya, buddy!

830
01:21:37,061 --> 01:21:39,933
The doc says
l should be on my feet in a week!

831
01:21:40,023 --> 01:21:43,939
- And back on the Force!
- Nordberg, that's wonderful!

832
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,568
Frank! Everyone should have
a friend like you!
