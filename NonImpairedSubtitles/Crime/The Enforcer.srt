1
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:26,204
Where you headed, little lady?

2
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:29,321
Nowhere with you, numb nuts.
Buzz off!

3
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:39,043
See you Thursday, gorgeous!

4
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,443
It's a pretty day to hitchhike.

5
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:50,572
L've got a little VW
at Stinson Beach with a cracked block.

6
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:55,610
You wouldn't be going
to Mill Valley, would you?

7
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,164
Aren't we going to Mill Valley?

8
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:02,452
Got a couple bottles of
ice-cold beer up there.

9
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,130
You son of a bitch.

10
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:11,891
Okay, pile in!

11
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:41,683
How long you been with
Western Gas and Electric?

12
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:45,164
L can't remember how long.
How long l been in this?

13
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:52,082
Turn in here.

14
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,849
Climb up this road here.

15
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,523
L'll be right with you.

16
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:51,322
Hang a left here, Harry,
there's a jam on Bay.

17
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:08,606
What's with the citizen?

18
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:30,684
- Police officer, what's the problem?
- Thank God! He's inside!

19
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,490
Come on, it's a heart attack!

20
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,325
Wait here.

21
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,843
Make some room! Move aside!

22
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:42,323
Move aside.
This is an emergency!

23
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:47,124
Please move over!

24
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,365
Please give us room.
He's a police officer.

25
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:53,650
- Where's the ambulance?
- He had a heart attack.

26
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:55,929
He's still breathing, though.

27
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:02,922
Come on, get up.

28
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,722
Get up!
Get up, get up!

29
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:14,006
L say!

30
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,488
- Party's over.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.

31
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:21,244
Why are you squawking?
You got the free meal.

32
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:24,610
But l always enjoy
the ride in the ambulance.

33
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,963
Get out of here.

34
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:32,049
Harry, it's an all-units.

35
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:35,412
Marvelous.

36
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:39,805
My old lady will kill me.

37
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:44,729
She's doing a novena tonight
and l said l'd be home for supper.

38
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,245
<i>Suspects are armed.</i>

39
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:54,523
<i>Code 33.</i>

40
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:58,322
Inspector 71 responding to your 406.

41
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:11,562
What's going on?

42
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:14,452
Bastards held up that liquor store.

43
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:17,969
One of our guys stumbled in
and they shot him.

44
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:19,692
They have four hostages.

45
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,369
They'll shoot them
unless we give them a car.

46
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:24,807
What're you waiting on?

47
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:26,771
Lieutenant Brannigan.

48
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:29,288
He said to stall until he gets here.

49
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,689
- Don't let them kill me!
- We want the goddamn car right now!

50
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:44,449
Okay, but you get nothing
till l come and talk.

51
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:48,129
Lay your piece on that car's hood!

52
00:08:53,453 --> 00:08:55,603
What about me? L'm your partner.

53
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:59,528
L move fast. L don't need
extra linguini holding me back.

54
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,843
You got a lot of class, Harry.

55
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:32,092
You get cute, l blow this nice lady
all over you. Let's go.

56
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,011
On the floor, motherfucker.

57
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:43,813
For God's sake, do like he says!

58
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:48,765
- This is my best jacket.
- Get on the floor, you son of a bitch!

59
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,129
Spreadeagle! Move it!

60
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:53,850
Get down there.

61
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:59,123
San Francisco's finest.

62
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,611
Mitch.

63
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,647
Roll him over.

64
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:13,252
He's clean.

65
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:16,451
Here's the story.

66
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,610
First, we want all the pigs
out of here.

67
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:25,006
Second, we want a car...

68
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,372
...with a police radio.
Deliver it right out there in front.

69
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:32,524
We're taking two hostages.

70
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,252
Both the women.

71
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:39,925
You don't do what l tell you,
we blow their fucking heads off.

72
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:43,964
- You got the picture?
- Yeah.

73
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:46,090
What are you waiting for?

74
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,567
Run, you jive-ass bastard.

75
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:10,207
- What do they want?
- They want a car.

76
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,565
What are you going to do?

77
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,086
Give them one.

78
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:35,885
You son of a bitch!

79
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:13,325
Why's a man crazy enough
to join the cops?

80
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:16,081
If you find out, you let me know.

81
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:24,247
$ 14,379.

82
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:28,246
- How's that?
- Want an itemized account?

83
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:32,202
You took out two doors,
one window, 12 feet of counter...

84
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:36,810
...plus damages to the stock.
Plus one city vehicle totaled.

85
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:41,569
And three hostages in the hospital
who will probably sue the city.

86
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,849
- Why?
- Excessive use of force.

87
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:45,765
For your information, Callahan...

88
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:49,483
...the minority community
hates this kind of police work.

89
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:52,406
By "minority community"
you mean the hoods?

90
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:55,326
So happens they're
American citizens too.

91
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:59,361
- The lady with the gun by her ear?
- L'm not debating this.

92
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:02,048
L've spoken to the mayor twice!

93
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,523
He went through the ceiling!

94
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:06,411
You mention the meeting?

95
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,292
- What?
- The meeting two months ago...

96
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:12,491
...when you said priority was
to run the hoods out.

97
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:13,882
Not with violence!

98
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,249
Should l yell "trick-or-treat"?

99
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:17,482
Come on.

100
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:20,327
L expect you
and everyone on this force...

101
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:23,804
...to be restrained
or turn in his resignation.

102
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:26,045
You're on notice, Harry.

103
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:29,569
That wild west show of yours
is exactly what...

104
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:32,566
...this department's
not going to tolerate!

105
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,292
Is that clear?

106
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:36,642
Yes, sir.

107
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:42,449
- Lf that's all, l've work to do.
- Not in homicide.

108
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:46,167
What?

109
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,570
You're transferred to personnel.

110
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:52,092
To personnel? That's for assholes.

111
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,686
L was in personnel for ten years.

112
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,527
Yeah.

113
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:04,682
That's it!

114
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:08,642
Report tomorrow to the oral
examining board, 9:00!

115
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:15,168
No, you haven't got the picture.

116
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,805
L'm the robber, you're the cop.

117
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,406
Now, l'm in a market.

118
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,565
You've just caught me.
A 211 in the act.

119
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,690
L'm coming out with a hostage:

120
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:31,370
A kid with a gun at his head.
There's no way to take me alive.

121
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:33,968
You have ten seconds to decide.

122
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:35,362
What do you do?

123
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,523
One...

124
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:38,650
...two, three...
- You're under arrest.

125
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:41,168
...four, five...
- Do something!

126
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,732
...six, seven.

127
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,441
Don't just stand there,
goddamn it, do something!

128
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:47,285
Bang, you're dead.

129
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:50,763
- You're late, Callahan.
- Sorry.

130
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:52,605
- Hello, Krause.
- Hi.

131
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:56,329
Okay, Bustanoby,
you'll be given your grade.

132
00:14:57,893 --> 00:14:59,485
You were told 9:00.

133
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,008
We have 50 officers to test.

134
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:04,523
- For how many vacancies?
- Eight.

135
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:08,846
Five men and three women
promoted to inspector in this group.

136
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,653
- Three women?
- Do you object, inspector?

137
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,931
Now who might you be?

138
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:17,562
Ms. Grey, from the mayor's staff.

139
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,644
She's to monitor the exams.

140
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:23,647
- This is Inspector Callahan.
- Yes, l know something of him.

141
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,210
And l'd like to tell you...

142
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:30,287
...the mayor's plan is to bring
this department into...

143
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:33,843
...the mainstream of
twentieth-century thought.

144
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:38,371
How does he figure to do that?

145
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,252
For one thing...

146
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:44,165
...His Honor intends to...

147
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:48,201
...broaden participation
for women in the police force.

148
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,683
Well, that sounds very stylish.

149
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:55,045
He also said something about...

150
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:58,729
...winnowing the Neanderthals
out of the department.

151
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:06,531
Well, we better move along.
Next applicant.

152
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:12,009
- Officer Moore?
- Yes, sir.

153
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:14,972
This is the final stage
in the examination.

154
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:19,650
It's an informal test to measure
your ability to think on your feet.

155
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,282
Your reaction to stress, pressure.

156
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:26,452
Your ability to use the law
in a hypothetical situation.

157
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:28,372
Yes, sir.

158
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:30,605
How long on the force?

159
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:32,605
- Nine years.
- What department?

160
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:35,530
Mainly Personnel and Records.

161
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,728
- Personnel and Records.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,852
Have you any questions
for the applicant?

163
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:54,450
Questions...
How fast do you run the hundred?

164
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:57,890
Come on, you know
how this board functions.

165
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:03,291
All right, l'm sorry.

166
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,810
You know...

167
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:12,169
...if you're inspector under
the new guidelines...

168
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:15,730
...you might be out
riding in a police car.

169
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:18,123
Yes, sir, that's what l hope for.

170
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:20,489
Officer Moore, tell us about...

171
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:22,963
...your greatest felony arrest.

172
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:26,729
L've never made a felony arrest.

173
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:32,802
Well, tell us about
your best misdemeanor arrest.

174
00:17:33,693 --> 00:17:36,765
L've never made a
misdemeanor arrest either.

175
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,527
What gives you the right
to be an inspector...

176
00:17:39,773 --> 00:17:42,241
...when men have been
working 15 years!

177
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:45,485
Women stay home,
is that what you're saying?

178
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:47,570
You think it's an encounter group?

179
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,725
What will she do
if someone points a gun...

180
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:52,247
...and says, "Hit the deck"?!

181
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:55,530
You're trying to fail
this candidate, aren't you?

182
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:58,571
If she fails there,
she gets her ass blown off!

183
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,445
It's my ass!

184
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,169
And my hard luck.

185
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:09,209
Out there you'll have a partner.
You get blown away, he does too!

186
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:12,570
That's some price to pay
for being stylish!

187
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:21,041
Are you finished with the questioning?

188
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,964
Hypothetical situation, huh?

189
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:32,731
L'm standing on a corner
and Mrs. Grey propositions me...

190
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:36,045
...saying for $5.00
she'll put on a show...

191
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:40,002
...with a Shetland pony.
- Lf this is your idea of humor...

192
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,648
All right, what are you doing here?

193
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:49,563
Seeing if you know
what law's being broken...

194
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,883
...besides cruelty to animals.

195
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:54,653
That's a conspiracy,
title 7-182-1...

196
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:57,327
...of the California penal code.

197
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:59,529
Conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor...

198
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:03,368
...is a felony, and according to...
- Yes. Good answer.

199
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:06,923
Officer Moore,
you'll be given your grade.

200
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:30,362
After l get the guard's keys...

201
00:19:30,613 --> 00:19:33,605
...we drive to the end,
warehouse 50-A. Lalo?

202
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:37,124
All right, now, that's...

203
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:41,127
...I drop you off at the small door
and go around...

204
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:44,604
...to the wharf side.
You open up the first big door.

205
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:48,482
L drive in and back up to
the compound on the right.

206
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:49,768
Karl and Tex?

207
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:52,811
Man, we grab
the M-16 automatic rifles.

208
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:54,088
Wanda?

209
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:57,328
Locate and take any explosives.

210
00:19:57,653 --> 00:20:00,213
Dynamite, detonators, and plastics.

211
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,086
Right. Henry Lee?

212
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,167
L tote and load the ammo
for the M-16s, okay, man?

213
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,362
Miki?

214
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:10,889
Locate the L.A.W. Rockets.
They'll be in the back.

215
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:14,728
It's the most important item.
You sure of the location?

216
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:17,044
L sweated there for five years!

217
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,124
They're there, l promise!

218
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:21,171
All right, you guys.

219
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:24,325
- This is for the people!
- Right on, for the people.

220
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:27,605
Jesus, spare me.

221
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,891
- What is it?
- Gas company.

222
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,442
- Why?
- Major gas leak in the area.

223
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,604
We'll check underground pipes.

224
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:11,413
Don't smoke until we say it's okay!

225
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,291
L won't, l won't.

226
00:21:21,933 --> 00:21:26,085
It's seeping down in the earth.
This whole damn block could go!

227
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,086
- Got a phone l can use?
- Right this way.

228
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:46,201
Let's go.

229
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:04,245
Charlie left the gate open.

230
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:05,882
Better check it.

231
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:34,885
Tony, call backup.

232
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,725
- L'll check around.
- Frank, watch yourself.

233
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:57,606
L.A.W.S. Rocket.

234
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:01,170
- Beautiful!
- Yes.

235
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:05,925
Lalo, get the rest of these loaded.

236
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:16,806
You'll blow us out of here!
You all right?

237
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:19,649
Let us get these.

238
00:24:23,773 --> 00:24:25,331
Freeze.

239
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,130
Hold it right there!
Put those boxes down.

240
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,892
You back there.
Stand up so l can see you.

241
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:52,361
And drop that gun!

242
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,053
Put your hands over your head
and freeze!

243
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,684
- Now, wait a second.
- You shut up and listen.

244
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:09,165
You blink an eyelid
and l'll mail you home in a box!

245
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:11,290
All of you, against the fence!

246
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:13,372
Now!

247
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:21,046
You too, honey!

248
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:27,290
Oh, Jesus! Miki! Miki!

249
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:30,924
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

250
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:35,765
Baby, l'll get you out.
L'll get you home.

251
00:25:36,013 --> 00:25:37,605
Bobby, help get her up.

252
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:40,526
- You'll get us caught.
- No, we'll make it.

253
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,843
- She's dead.
- She's not dead!

254
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:44,685
The hell she isn't!

255
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:51,050
Come on, it's over.

256
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:52,842
Bobby.

257
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:11,529
Get it on there.

258
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:16,092
Lalo, get up in there! Come on!

259
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:39,967
Halt, police! Halt, or l'll fire!

260
00:26:42,493 --> 00:26:44,085
L'll get this son of a bitch!

261
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:45,768
Goddamn it!

262
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:58,451
He said it looked like
a regular company truck.

263
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,887
L'm asking the
Marin County sheriff.

264
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,762
Might tie in with the two bodies
found there last week.

265
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:10,162
Yes, sir.

266
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:12,286
How's DiGeorgio?

267
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:14,450
Well, Irene's with him now.

268
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:17,247
Is that some kind of answer?

269
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:20,162
He's been given the last rites.

270
00:27:20,493 --> 00:27:22,290
- Get what you can.
- I will.

271
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:24,251
Listen, l'm sorry.

272
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,166
Hello, Harry.

273
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:33,291
He's been asking for you.

274
00:27:33,573 --> 00:27:34,847
How is he?

275
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:36,925
He's in and out.

276
00:27:43,173 --> 00:27:45,164
L'll smoke a cigarette.

277
00:27:47,773 --> 00:27:49,491
It's a war, isn't it?

278
00:27:51,013 --> 00:27:53,732
L guess l never really
understood that.

279
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:06,767
Harry.

280
00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:10,326
Frank, what happened?

281
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:13,731
L had them, dead bang. And then I...

282
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:21,601
Sorry.

283
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:27,121
Frank?

284
00:28:27,493 --> 00:28:29,848
Something you want to tell him?

285
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:34,367
Harry, listen, the punk who cut me...

286
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:38,484
...I seen him before.
- Where?

287
00:28:39,293 --> 00:28:41,363
L just can't make the name.

288
00:28:42,373 --> 00:28:44,728
Where do you know him from, Frank?

289
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:46,765
That homicide...

290
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:48,647
...young hooker...

291
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,531
...in the Fillmore area.

292
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,651
The summer of '71.

293
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:57,611
- What about it?
- He was one of the pimps questioned.

294
00:28:58,493 --> 00:29:00,324
Liked him for it, Harry.

295
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:03,405
We liked him real good.

296
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:07,363
We liked everybody
north of Market on that one.

297
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:12,289
He had one of them cute,
little-boy names...

298
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:16,370
...Charlie something, or Bobby.

299
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,171
L'll check Records.
They'll have your notes.

300
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:25,084
Ten-to-one they blow it.

301
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:27,529
Not this time, Frank.

302
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,964
Maybe you better get some rest.

303
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:37,685
- Do you have to go just yet?
- Not if you don't want me to.

304
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:39,611
Thanks, Harry.

305
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:48,846
Get Irene.

306
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:59,929
- Talk to Records?
- Not yet. That was McKay.

307
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:04,930
We got a tape from the bastards.
L'll see you in 30 minutes.

308
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,570
Code Blue, Intensive Care.

309
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,007
30 minutes.

310
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,481
<i>One million dollars</i>
<i>or we blow things up.</i>

311
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:21,806
<i>People's Revolutionary Strike Force.</i>
<i>Remember Fessenheim.</i>

312
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:23,961
"Fessenheim"?

313
00:30:24,493 --> 00:30:25,721
It's being checked.

314
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:29,124
People's Revolutionary Strike Force.
They on your list?

315
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:33,332
Nothing.

316
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:35,928
- Think it's legit?
- Probably not.

317
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:40,162
Lieutenant Bressler in Homicide.

318
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:44,083
What are you doing
about those records?

319
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:45,965
What do you mean?

320
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:48,647
L just talked to you about them!

321
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:53,444
Homicide! Fillmore District!
Inspectors Callahan and DiGeorgio.

00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:58,407
What do you mean, "written request"?

323
00:30:58,653 --> 00:31:00,564
Well, who's got the keys?

324
00:31:01,013 --> 00:31:03,652
L'm coming down there
in five minutes...

325
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:08,205
...you get those files open,
you pencil-pushing son of a bitch!

326
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:14,409
- You don't have to make threats.
- L'm gonna nail the guy...

327
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:17,213
...who carved DiGeorgio
on my own time!

328
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:18,647
That's unnecessary...

329
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:22,249
...you're back in Homicide
since 9, didn't you know?

330
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:26,804
L've been down in Records
looking up a homicide.

331
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,042
Any luck?

332
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:31,285
Well, l've got eleven names
of known pimps.

333
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:36,007
- I think our man's one of them.
- Judson, Maddox, Skidmore.

334
00:31:36,693 --> 00:31:39,161
Shall l tell you my instinct on this?

335
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:42,211
- Black Militants.
- No, it's all hookers.

336
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:44,921
The girl shot in the warehouse?
Miki Waleska.

337
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:46,606
A known prostitute.

338
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:50,448
What we've got is a
well-organized group of militants...

339
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:54,163
...with enough explosives to blow
San Francisco away...

340
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,405
...including L.A.W.S. Rockets.
- L.A.W.S. Rockets?

341
00:31:57,573 --> 00:32:00,133
The Army's giving a demonstration
at the firing range...

342
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:02,091
...in exactly 35 minutes.

343
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,722
L'd like everybody
on the case there...

344
00:32:04,973 --> 00:32:06,884
...to see what you're against.

345
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:10,569
L've already been checked out
on the L.A.W.S. Rocket.

346
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:12,132
Your partner hasn't.

347
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:14,608
My partner?

348
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:23,525
Shit!

349
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,924
You know Inspector Moore?

350
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:29,326
Inspector.

351
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:32,242
L'll see you at the firing range.

352
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:35,124
Inspector?

353
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:43,365
Inspector, l know you aren't
overjoyed by this assignment.

354
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:46,685
- You don't think l'm up to it, do you?
- Right.

355
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:48,608
All right...

356
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:51,970
...let's get one thing straight.
L'm a woman.

357
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:54,681
L consider that fact irrelevant...

358
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:58,608
...because l don't expect
any special consideration.

359
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,127
Marvelous.

360
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,811
The L.A.W.S. Rocket: For all purposes...

361
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:06,812
...a one-shot disposable bazooka.

362
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,888
A fiberglass tube, 45 inches long...

363
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:13,966
...which fires a single projectile...

364
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:18,411
...designed to penetrate armor
three-quarters of an inch thick.

365
00:33:18,653 --> 00:33:22,532
If you've all seen it,
l'll demonstrate how it works.

366
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:26,011
To fire the rocket, pull this pin...

367
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,130
...dropping the cover...

368
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:30,251
...then pull.

369
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:32,404
Front and rear sights spring up.

370
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:34,922
Got word from Pathology.

371
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:39,405
At noon they're posting the guard
that was killed. Check on it.

372
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:40,648
L'll be there.

373
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:42,732
- Captain?
- Go ahead.

374
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:46,769
Keep your eyes on that truck...

375
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:50,005
...l'll show how effective
this weapon can be.

376
00:34:09,093 --> 00:34:11,926
Coming, inspector?

377
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,852
- Inspector?
- Yeah?

378
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,482
- 13.5 in my gym shorts.
- What?

379
00:34:47,773 --> 00:34:50,810
My time in the hundred.
You asked me before.

380
00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:53,362
- Think l was picking on you?
- Yes.

381
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:56,767
- It was nothing personal.
- Right.

382
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,652
L don't think you know
what Homicide does.

383
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:02,771
- L'll find out.
- I hope not the hard way.

384
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:04,651
How fast do you run the hundred?

385
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:06,485
Beats me.

386
00:35:07,013 --> 00:35:09,573
L meant to say l'm sorry
about your partner.

387
00:35:09,813 --> 00:35:11,371
He's not the first one.

388
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:15,845
Fanducci in '68 and Smith in '72,
but it wasn't your fault.

389
00:35:16,093 --> 00:35:18,687
- How'd you know?
- Checked your records.

390
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:21,083
L don't want to get killed either.

391
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,448
What's the matter?

392
00:35:22,693 --> 00:35:25,332
Black guy with the briefcase.
L know him.

393
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,086
- Tan suit?
- Yeah.

394
00:35:28,013 --> 00:35:29,685
What did he do?

395
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:32,567
Can't remember. It's not important.

396
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:37,932
- Ever been to one of these before?
- No.

397
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:41,525
In that case, l'd suggest
you sit out here.

398
00:35:42,013 --> 00:35:44,686
Don't concern yourself, inspector.

399
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,281
Hello, Harry.

400
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,205
Who's the pretty lady?

401
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:55,763
My partner, Inspector Moore.

402
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:59,484
- You missed most of it.
- We were at the firing range.

403
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:03,009
L have it on tape.
We finished the abdomen.

404
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:04,766
The wound matters.

405
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:08,005
The entry wound
was above the renal area...

406
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:11,410
...between ribs,
penetrating the chest cavity...

407
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,166
...piercing the lung.

408
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:16,325
There was also damage
to some other organs...

409
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,529
...pancreas, kidneys.

410
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,772
- What kind of knife?
- A long, heavy blade.

411
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:24,284
We're going in the skull now.

412
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:29,163
L'd say it was one of those
killing knives...

413
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:32,644
...a Marine Corps boy,
or Special Forces.

414
00:36:32,893 --> 00:36:34,167
Bruises on the face?

415
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:37,849
The killer put his hand
over the mouth from behind.

416
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:40,084
- Professional?
- Textbook.

417
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:44,649
On first exam,
no exterior damage to the skull.

418
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:25,493
Subject brain shows no
contrecoup damage or clotting.

419
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:28,342
Jesus H. Christ, come look at this!

420
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:31,494
- It's the damnedest thing l ever saw.
- What?

421
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:34,495
It says "Eat at Luigi's!"

422
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,860
Welcome to Homicide.

423
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:10,818
What are you doing?

424
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,134
Excuse me, l'm with him.

425
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:23,900
L was coming down the hall
to take a leak when it blew!

426
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:25,900
Anybody in there?

427
00:38:27,822 --> 00:38:30,177
- I don't think so.
- Where you going?

428
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:32,458
A group of kids, some are missing.

429
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,499
- Help him out.
- Me?

430
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:37,131
Great, just step out here, will you?

431
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,577
Well, we were lucky this time.

432
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:44,173
It's getting so you can't
even pee in peace.

433
00:38:48,822 --> 00:38:51,017
- We got them, they're okay.
- Good.

434
00:38:51,902 --> 00:38:52,937
You didn't...

435
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:56,254
...see anybody go in there, did you?
- No.

436
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:59,779
You sure? Black guy,
tan hat and suit, briefcase.

437
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:03,779
- I saw a guy like that.
- Short guy, about 5' 1 "?

438
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:05,774
No, this dude was six foot.

439
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:07,296
That's him.

440
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:13,773
It's a bomb. L saw who did it.

441
00:39:14,022 --> 00:39:15,580
- Any idea?
- Looked familiar.

442
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:17,460
Just a minute.

443
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,813
You'd better check mug shots.

444
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:23,134
Honey, we're talking.
This is very important.

445
00:39:23,382 --> 00:39:26,499
Better check mug shots,
we got another message.

446
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:28,334
They want two million.

447
00:39:28,582 --> 00:39:29,617
- Two?
- I just saw him.

448
00:39:29,862 --> 00:39:32,535
- Who?
- Tan suit, hat, and a briefcase.

449
00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:35,452
- Where?
- Right down here.

450
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:39,695
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- Why the hell didn't you ask?

451
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:51,660
There he is, look!

452
00:42:02,942 --> 00:42:03,931
Jesus!

453
00:42:42,262 --> 00:42:43,251
Damn it.

454
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:24,178
What the hell's going on?

455
00:43:26,662 --> 00:43:28,254
What are you doing here?

456
00:43:39,222 --> 00:43:41,577
- Who are you?
- Police officer.

457
00:44:31,862 --> 00:44:33,818
Speedy, you're under arrest.

458
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:36,735
God, this is a church!
What are you doing?

459
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:39,018
L'm a cop. He's under arrest.

460
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:42,299
Father, l did nothing!
This guy's rousting me!

461
00:44:42,542 --> 00:44:45,340
Is it asking too much
to see a badge, officer?

462
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:48,010
He runs like a rabbit, l won't let go.

463
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:50,901
L'd like to see the badge now!

464
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:52,731
If you insist.

465
00:44:57,382 --> 00:45:00,260
- Callahan, Inspector.
- Callahan...

466
00:45:01,582 --> 00:45:04,050
...you're a disgrace to this city!

467
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,338
Okay! Nobody move!

468
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:16,130
Marvelous.

469
00:45:18,022 --> 00:45:21,139
L think so.
Harry, wait, l'm talking to...

470
00:45:21,382 --> 00:45:22,735
Jesus Christ!

471
00:45:23,382 --> 00:45:24,497
Give him my best.

472
00:45:24,742 --> 00:45:25,970
L'll call you back!

473
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:28,577
It's been disarmed
by the bomb squad.

474
00:45:28,822 --> 00:45:32,178
It's the explosive from
the Hamilton Firearms works.

475
00:45:32,382 --> 00:45:35,931
At times l can only
stand you as a human.

476
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:38,174
What about the punk?

477
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:40,777
- The suspect.
- "Suspect," my ass!

478
00:45:41,022 --> 00:45:44,935
He won't talk, but we have a make.
He's Henry Lee Caldwell.

479
00:45:45,182 --> 00:45:48,379
Member of a Black Militant group
called Uhuru.

480
00:45:49,182 --> 00:45:51,537
- Pusseau, shelve that.
- Uhuru?

481
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,854
It's run by a guy called
Big Ed Mustapha.

482
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:58,014
Mustapha, in the Mission District.

483
00:45:58,262 --> 00:46:01,095
L thought he was familiar.
Where's my partner?

484
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,253
She's in the can.

485
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:05,572
Been there since she found out...

486
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:09,178
...she was packing this thing
all over San Francisco!

487
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:11,697
Do me a favor. Go easy on her.

488
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:15,093
It's her first day
and it's been a long one.

489
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:19,739
She wants to play lumberjack,
she has to handle her end of the log.

490
00:46:38,622 --> 00:46:40,374
L give up. What's this?

491
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:44,217
The Fillmore chapter of the V.F. W:
Very Few Whites.

492
00:46:44,822 --> 00:46:48,337
Can l suggest you wait in the car,
inspector?

493
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:50,698
Don't concern yourself, inspector.

494
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:58,779
Well, if it ain't
Mighty Whitey and friend.

495
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:02,057
L'm looking for Big Ed Mustapha.

496
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:05,977
Sorry, honky, she can stay,
but you got to go.

497
00:47:06,462 --> 00:47:10,137
Yeah, baby, we trying to keep up
standards, understand.

498
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:13,021
- You aren't making us welcome.
- You're welcome!

499
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:16,060
As welcome as a turd in a pool!

500
00:47:26,342 --> 00:47:28,856
Well, look here, if it ain't the fuzz.

501
00:47:29,102 --> 00:47:30,615
L'm looking for Ed Mustapha.

502
00:47:30,862 --> 00:47:35,060
- You got a warrant, honky?
- What l got is Henry Lee Caldwell.

503
00:47:35,702 --> 00:47:37,101
L never heard of him.

504
00:47:37,342 --> 00:47:41,335
Let's see how fast you fuzz
can get your white asses out.

505
00:47:42,182 --> 00:47:43,934
What is Henry Lee into now?

506
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,694
He's playing with dynamite.
You Mustapha?

507
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:53,974
Yeah, that's right.

508
00:47:54,782 --> 00:47:57,171
Just come into my office here.

509
00:47:58,862 --> 00:47:59,931
Just you.

510
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:04,780
Don't worry, pig,
she won't get Ionesome.

511
00:48:07,782 --> 00:48:09,773
That's mighty white of you.

512
00:48:12,622 --> 00:48:15,182
Before we do anything uncalled-for...

513
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:18,653
...l'd like to point out
that l'm an officer.

514
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:28,895
Callahan.

515
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:31,054
Where do l know you from?

516
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:35,691
You don't.

517
00:48:37,462 --> 00:48:38,815
L just know you.

518
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:47,492
Now, what's Henry Lee been up to?

519
00:48:47,782 --> 00:48:49,295
Saying you don't know?

520
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:53,057
He don't come around here,
not for a long time.

521
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:54,781
Where is he?

522
00:48:55,742 --> 00:48:59,212
He went white.
Why, he do something else foolish?

523
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:05,101
He and his friends helped
rip off the Hamilton Firearms.

524
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:06,974
L heard about that.

525
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:09,574
You wanna buy into that?

526
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,972
Four counts of murder,
aiding and abetting?

527
00:49:12,222 --> 00:49:16,374
You got the wrong number, boy.
We don't deal in violence.

528
00:49:16,622 --> 00:49:18,977
- What do you deal in?
- Waiting.

529
00:49:19,942 --> 00:49:21,091
For what?

530
00:49:23,742 --> 00:49:26,210
Waiting for all you honkies...

531
00:49:26,462 --> 00:49:29,852
...to blow each other up
so we can move on in.

532
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:34,417
Talk about Henry Lee
and his friends.

533
00:49:34,622 --> 00:49:38,615
Some dudes he met in Vietnam. Why?

534
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,496
Anybody on this list here grab you?

535
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:46,775
Hey, man, why should l help you?

536
00:49:47,662 --> 00:49:51,291
L can talk to Robbery.
They'd be interested in this...

537
00:49:51,662 --> 00:49:53,334
...elaborate furnishing.

538
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:55,220
What are you talking about?

539
00:49:57,182 --> 00:49:58,979
"Room 401, Fairmont."

540
00:50:00,742 --> 00:50:02,494
"Rest at the Holiday Inn."

541
00:50:03,302 --> 00:50:05,054
Okay, okay, okay, so?

542
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:07,659
Maybe they're a little warm.

543
00:50:08,022 --> 00:50:09,501
L tell you what...

544
00:50:10,182 --> 00:50:13,333
...one of my boys got busted
on possession.

545
00:50:13,582 --> 00:50:17,211
You get him off, and ignore
my interior decorator...

546
00:50:17,622 --> 00:50:19,533
...and l'll see what l can do.

547
00:50:19,782 --> 00:50:22,535
- That's a lot.
- You want a lot.

548
00:50:24,102 --> 00:50:27,299
A thing like this can ruin my image.

549
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,055
L'll see what l can do.

550
00:50:32,982 --> 00:50:34,700
What about the list?

551
00:50:43,382 --> 00:50:44,735
Bobby Maxwell.

552
00:50:47,942 --> 00:50:50,900
- He's the main man.
- You know him?

553
00:50:51,342 --> 00:50:53,298
Stone waste of white.

554
00:50:53,542 --> 00:50:55,339
Where can l find him?

555
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:58,340
L'll check around.

556
00:50:59,782 --> 00:51:02,819
You do that. Much obliged.

557
00:51:03,062 --> 00:51:06,532
Callahan, you're on the wrong side.

558
00:51:06,782 --> 00:51:08,613
How do you figure that?

559
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:10,699
You put your ass on the line...

560
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:14,571
...for dudes who wouldn't
let you in the door any more...

561
00:51:15,622 --> 00:51:16,896
...than they would me.

562
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:19,617
- It's not for them.
- Who, then?

563
00:51:23,262 --> 00:51:25,457
You wouldn't believe me if l told.

564
00:51:29,262 --> 00:51:32,618
...if l pull this piece...
- Having fun, inspector?

565
00:51:32,862 --> 00:51:35,979
If you're done socializing,
we have work to do.

566
00:51:36,582 --> 00:51:39,301
Son of a bitch.

567
00:51:41,782 --> 00:51:45,252
If you have an objection
to how l handled myself...

568
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,094
...I wish you'd say so!

569
00:51:47,862 --> 00:51:49,818
L thought l was doing all right.

570
00:51:56,582 --> 00:51:57,856
Marvelous.

571
00:52:49,382 --> 00:52:51,452
All right, Mustapha...

572
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,817
...this is Captain McKay
of the S.F.P.D.

573
00:52:57,062 --> 00:53:01,055
Throw down your weapons
and come out peacefully.

574
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:09,653
You are totally surrounded.

575
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:12,340
Mustapha, do you hear me?

576
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:17,057
Come out with your hands raised
over your head.

577
00:53:49,022 --> 00:53:50,978
L don't want to seem ungrateful...

578
00:53:51,222 --> 00:53:53,577
...I just feel that
it might be better.

579
00:53:53,822 --> 00:53:56,382
Well, l'm still a little confused...

580
00:53:57,302 --> 00:53:59,611
...you and the S.W.A.T. Team
did it...

581
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,820
...but credit goes to
Moore and Callahan?

582
00:54:03,062 --> 00:54:05,576
L felt it might be a better tactic...

583
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:08,780
...politically, with
the election coming up...

584
00:54:09,022 --> 00:54:12,856
...to show the guidelines for
the police department worked.

585
00:54:13,102 --> 00:54:16,253
Kind of "l told you so,"
if you know what l mean.

586
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:20,700
Yes, l see. It's an excellent idea.
What do you think, Jimmy?

587
00:54:21,382 --> 00:54:23,338
L couldn't agree more.

588
00:54:24,582 --> 00:54:26,812
You have proved to be an asset...

589
00:54:27,062 --> 00:54:29,451
...to the force and
the administration.

590
00:54:29,702 --> 00:54:30,578
Thank you.

591
00:54:30,822 --> 00:54:34,531
The commendation presentation
starts in five minutes.

592
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:37,455
- We better get going.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

593
00:54:37,702 --> 00:54:40,421
Off the record,
there will be changes...

594
00:54:40,662 --> 00:54:44,860
...after the election,
and you'll figure greatly in my plans.

595
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:48,094
L'm sure you'll make
the right decision.

596
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:55,050
Can you comment on the
arrest of the Black Militants?

597
00:54:55,502 --> 00:54:57,299
Later, Jim, later.

598
00:54:58,342 --> 00:55:02,335
As mayor of San Francisco,
l want to make it official.

599
00:55:02,742 --> 00:55:06,576
This is one hell of a cop!
And here come a couple more.

600
00:55:06,822 --> 00:55:08,380
Hello. Right this way.

601
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:11,694
Lt. Bressler, Inspector Moore,
move to the stairs.

602
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,933
Mayor, would you join them?

603
00:55:14,182 --> 00:55:16,776
We'll have some photographs taken.

604
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:22,534
- Is this all right?
- Yes.

605
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:25,250
Would you move in a little tighter?

606
00:55:26,822 --> 00:55:30,417
Gentlemen, the inspectors who made
the Mustapha arrest.

607
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:33,495
This is Inspector Moore and Callahan.

608
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:38,018
How about one with
the mayor and Inspector Moore?

609
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,812
Captain McKay, switch places
with Inspector Moore?

610
00:55:43,702 --> 00:55:44,976
Move in close.

611
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:47,690
Callahan, you get in there too.

612
00:55:48,742 --> 00:55:49,731
We're ready.

613
00:55:49,982 --> 00:55:53,418
Inspector Moore is one of
the first of her sex...

614
00:55:53,662 --> 00:55:56,335
...to become a homicide investigator.

615
00:55:56,582 --> 00:56:00,370
We're very proud of her
stunning professionalism.

616
00:56:01,742 --> 00:56:03,619
Thank you very much.

617
00:56:04,062 --> 00:56:07,657
Jimmy, give me time with these people.

618
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:10,541
Certainly. Can we move to the right?

619
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:12,898
L'll see you at the conference.

620
00:56:14,142 --> 00:56:16,895
Anybody have the
letters of commendation?

621
00:56:17,702 --> 00:56:19,215
- Jimmy?
- Yes, sir?

622
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:21,851
- Who's got the letters?
- Right here.

623
00:56:22,942 --> 00:56:25,820
- Wait, what's this?
- Some form letters.

624
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:29,214
So you hand them
something for the cameras.

625
00:56:29,462 --> 00:56:30,611
Well, all right.

626
00:56:30,862 --> 00:56:32,261
Thank you, Jimmy.

627
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:36,814
The Mayor will introduce you,
hand you the letters...

628
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:39,622
...and then move
to the left off-camera.

629
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:41,853
L'll take this opportunity...

630
00:56:42,102 --> 00:56:44,377
...to deliver a boot in the rear...

631
00:56:44,622 --> 00:56:48,058
...to the people who think
the force has failed...

632
00:56:48,302 --> 00:56:50,020
...under this administration.

633
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:51,941
Two minutes, Mr. Mayor.

634
00:56:52,182 --> 00:56:53,854
Well, ready? Let's go.

635
00:56:57,182 --> 00:56:59,742
- Just one minute, Mr. Mayor.
- Harry!

636
00:56:59,982 --> 00:57:02,860
Can you tell me what these are for?

637
00:57:03,102 --> 00:57:05,457
- Wait until after the broadcast.
- No.

638
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:07,579
All right, just watch it.

639
00:57:07,822 --> 00:57:11,735
He has a right to know
what he's being commended for.

640
00:57:12,382 --> 00:57:17,331
Specifically, it's for your part in
smashing the group of terrorists...

641
00:57:17,582 --> 00:57:22,019
...who were trying to blackmail
the city out of two million dollars.

642
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:23,411
Let's look at...

643
00:57:23,662 --> 00:57:26,734
If you mean Mustapha,
nobody smashed a thing.

644
00:57:27,662 --> 00:57:30,654
L made a deal with Mustapha
to help me find them.

645
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:34,019
- Moore and l weren't there.
- What's he mean?

646
00:57:34,262 --> 00:57:38,460
- No weapons or explosives were found?
- We'll find them!

647
00:57:38,702 --> 00:57:41,694
They're still out there!
They'll blow the city!

648
00:57:41,942 --> 00:57:43,898
You're saying how great we are.

649
00:57:44,142 --> 00:57:45,894
Callahan, button your lip!

650
00:57:46,142 --> 00:57:49,339
Don't jerk them off with me!

651
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:53,495
- You got yourself a 60-day suspension!
- Make it 90!

652
00:57:53,742 --> 00:57:55,698
180! Give me your star!

653
00:57:58,182 --> 00:58:00,901
Here's a seven-point suppository,
captain.

654
00:58:01,302 --> 00:58:05,056
- What did you say?
- I said stick it in your ass.

655
00:58:17,422 --> 00:58:20,892
- Mayor, you're on.
- I know, Jimmy, l know.

656
00:58:25,542 --> 00:58:27,578
L'll have to go down there...

657
00:58:29,662 --> 00:58:32,893
Go down there and jerk them off.

658
00:58:37,742 --> 00:58:38,777
Inspector!

659
00:58:40,422 --> 00:58:42,094
Inspector Callahan!

660
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,697
Damn it, Harry, slow down!

661
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:53,981
What's the matter?

662
00:58:54,342 --> 00:58:55,411
Nothing!

663
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:58,574
Why aren't you getting
your commendation?

664
00:58:59,182 --> 00:59:02,140
- Do you ever give up?
- Sometimes.

665
00:59:02,942 --> 00:59:04,500
Not you.

666
00:59:05,182 --> 00:59:07,093
What makes you think so?

667
00:59:07,582 --> 00:59:09,493
Woman's intuition.

668
00:59:13,782 --> 00:59:18,298
If you need anything or
if there's anything l can do...

669
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:21,138
...access to records or files...

670
00:59:21,342 --> 00:59:24,300
...anything. Call me up.

671
00:59:25,182 --> 00:59:26,934
L might just do that.

672
00:59:27,182 --> 00:59:28,581
Fine.

673
00:59:31,582 --> 00:59:32,697
Any time.

674
00:59:33,582 --> 00:59:37,018
- Come on, take a walk.
- All right.

675
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:47,212
L wonder if l'll still have a job
when l get back.

676
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,293
What's the difference?

677
00:59:50,662 --> 00:59:52,937
Why'd you want to be a cop, anyway?

678
00:59:53,622 --> 00:59:56,534
Why don't you marry and have kids?

679
00:59:56,782 --> 00:59:58,135
Why aren't you?

680
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,901
Nobody in their right mind's asking.

681
01:00:03,822 --> 01:00:06,973
- Coitus interruptus.
- I beg your pardon?

682
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:10,897
Coit Tower.
It's vaguely phallic, don't you think?

683
01:00:12,982 --> 01:00:15,098
Never thought of it that way.

684
01:00:16,142 --> 01:00:17,939
L make up names for things.

685
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:22,858
You're "Cold, Bold Callahan"
with a great big.44.

686
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:29,051
Every other cop is satisfied
with a.38 or a.357...

687
01:00:29,302 --> 01:00:31,770
...why must you carry that cannon?

688
01:00:32,302 --> 01:00:34,497
So l can hit what l aim at.

689
01:00:34,742 --> 01:00:37,893
.357 is good, but l've seen 38s
careen off windshields.

690
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,774
No good in the city.

691
01:00:40,022 --> 01:00:44,015
L see. So it's for the penetration.

692
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:48,699
Does everything have
a sexual connotation?

693
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:51,933
Only sometimes.

694
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:55,291
Want to go have a few beers?

695
01:01:00,382 --> 01:01:04,898
You got a lot of nerve the way
you talk to the mayor, and McKay.

696
01:01:05,702 --> 01:01:07,693
They're wrong and stupid.

697
01:01:08,182 --> 01:01:12,221
They got the wrong guy,
but their egos won't admit it.

698
01:01:12,422 --> 01:01:15,095
- You mean Mustapha.
- Yeah.

699
01:01:15,702 --> 01:01:17,658
L had a deal with Mustapha.

700
01:01:17,902 --> 01:01:21,895
He put me onto Bobby Maxwell,
the guy who knifed DiGeorgio.

701
01:01:22,102 --> 01:01:27,096
- Where do we find Maxwell?
- We can't with Mustapha busted.

702
01:01:27,302 --> 01:01:30,100
Maxwell's a prime candidate,
a tough cookie.

703
01:01:30,342 --> 01:01:32,139
Was in Vietnam, likes combat.

704
01:01:32,382 --> 01:01:35,180
He was busted out on a Section Eight.

705
01:01:35,422 --> 01:01:38,300
We're good people.
Let's post Mustapha's bail.

706
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:39,941
Not a bad idea.

707
01:01:40,622 --> 01:01:43,341
Question is, will he work with us now?

708
01:01:45,502 --> 01:01:47,732
Want to have a few beers?

709
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:50,819
Why didn't l think of that?

710
01:01:57,582 --> 01:01:59,459
All they had was apple juice.

711
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:01,374
- Anything's okay.
- Here.

712
01:02:01,622 --> 01:02:03,101
L'm sorry.

713
01:02:04,742 --> 01:02:06,334
You like fishing?

714
01:02:07,262 --> 01:02:10,379
L have an Auntie Kate.
L'm called after her.

715
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,697
When l was a little girl,
she had a ranch in Oroville.

716
01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:19,296
We used to fish.
L'd even bait my own hooks.

717
01:02:20,422 --> 01:02:22,617
Is that what they call you? Kate?

718
01:02:23,582 --> 01:02:25,493
That or Inspector Moore.

719
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:31,257
Inspector Moore, l don't
get friendly with partners.

720
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:34,619
L know. L mean, l understand.

721
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:36,494
Kate...

722
01:02:37,262 --> 01:02:41,096
...whoever gets you as
a partner could do much worse.

723
01:03:06,142 --> 01:03:10,499
L think if we want to beat
the crowds, we should leave.

724
01:03:10,742 --> 01:03:14,212
Think so? You may be right.

725
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:16,180
L'll see you, Karl.

726
01:03:16,422 --> 01:03:17,980
No need to come with us.

727
01:03:18,222 --> 01:03:20,497
- Take over.
- Take it easy.

728
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:22,294
You hold on to this.

729
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:29,695
- Nice to see you!
- We're running late, sir.

730
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:50,058
All right, talk to me.

731
01:03:50,302 --> 01:03:52,099
- He's on his way.
- Beautiful.

732
01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:55,017
- Everything set?
- L'm ready.

733
01:04:42,262 --> 01:04:43,331
Hi there.

734
01:04:43,622 --> 01:04:47,058
Hello there, young lady.
What can l do for you?

735
01:04:47,662 --> 01:04:49,493
Raise the bridge.

736
01:04:50,862 --> 01:04:52,659
Raise the bridge?

737
01:04:53,462 --> 01:04:54,781
Are you kidding?

738
01:04:55,462 --> 01:04:56,861
When l tell you to.

739
01:05:04,742 --> 01:05:06,460
L wish we could've stayed.

740
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,217
L think the Giants will finally win.

741
01:05:10,462 --> 01:05:14,660
L don't know, mayor, looked like
it would end a no-hitter.

742
01:05:15,222 --> 01:05:17,577
You have the testimonial tonight.

743
01:05:17,822 --> 01:05:23,021
Oh, God, testimonials.
They never end, do they?

744
01:05:26,302 --> 01:05:28,099
Give me the Taser gun.

745
01:05:28,302 --> 01:05:29,655
Karl?

746
01:05:36,502 --> 01:05:39,380
This looks like something from
James Bond.

747
01:05:39,622 --> 01:05:41,055
Sure it'll work?

748
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:44,695
Karl, there's 25,000 volts
in this thing.

749
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:49,060
Even the fat boy will do
what we want once we zap him.

750
01:05:56,942 --> 01:05:58,375
Okay, Tex.

751
01:06:07,942 --> 01:06:09,534
Raise it.

752
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:36,892
What the hell? Get me out of this.

753
01:06:43,062 --> 01:06:45,018
Don't hit the mayor, damn it!

754
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:10,258
- Who are you? What do you want?
- You.

755
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:14,292
Son of a bitch!
L'm not going anywhere with you!

756
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:16,180
The hell you aren't!

757
01:08:14,142 --> 01:08:18,215
We're trying to get details,
and as they come in you'll get them.

758
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:20,453
<i>They said the mayor was killed.</i>

759
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:23,460
At first. Then we heard
he was kidnapped.

760
01:08:23,662 --> 01:08:26,301
There's something going on
in China Basin.

761
01:08:26,942 --> 01:08:29,217
L've got to go. Thanks for calling.

762
01:08:29,462 --> 01:08:31,134
You're rapping with Bubba.

763
01:08:31,622 --> 01:08:34,216
The mayor has been taken
prisoner of war...

764
01:08:34,462 --> 01:08:37,454
...by the People's
Revolutionary Strike Force.

765
01:08:39,022 --> 01:08:42,458
Everybody's a comedian.
Look, this is serious!

766
01:08:42,822 --> 01:08:47,373
L'm leaving a tape of our demands
in the phone booth across the street.

767
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:49,931
<i>Power to the people!</i>

768
01:08:50,782 --> 01:08:54,457
We'll do a little music and
l'll be right back!

769
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:14,177
Harry?

770
01:09:15,862 --> 01:09:18,695
- What can l do for you?
- We've got to talk.

771
01:09:18,982 --> 01:09:20,495
Go right ahead.

772
01:09:22,142 --> 01:09:25,896
L want all the info that
you have on this case.

773
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:30,658
- Black Militants, remember?
- Come on, so we were wrong.

774
01:09:31,742 --> 01:09:35,451
- L'll handle this one.
- No! We play as a team.

775
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:40,895
The last time we did that
l got the cue stuck in my ass.

776
01:09:41,142 --> 01:09:44,691
We just got a tape.
Now they want five million.

777
01:09:44,942 --> 01:09:47,581
Or they send back the mayor in pieces.

778
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:50,052
The negotiations are crucial now.

779
01:09:50,262 --> 01:09:52,856
What will you do, pay the bastards?

780
01:09:53,342 --> 01:09:58,257
The mayor's family is loaded,
they can afford it.

781
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:02,212
What about those who were killed?
Isn't that illegal?

782
01:10:02,462 --> 01:10:05,215
We're not debating the point.

783
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:06,611
You're saying...

784
01:10:06,862 --> 01:10:10,980
...anyone with the balls to take
hostages can walk away?

785
01:10:11,502 --> 01:10:13,060
L'm saying you're out.

786
01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:17,056
If l hear otherwise,
you're finished as a cop here.

787
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:22,456
L want all the information
you have on this case, every lead.

788
01:10:22,982 --> 01:10:25,257
- May l speak, McKay?
- Go ahead!

789
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:28,056
Your mouthwash ain't making it!

790
01:10:39,982 --> 01:10:41,654
Callahan...

791
01:10:45,262 --> 01:10:47,617
...you got more surprises for me?

792
01:10:48,262 --> 01:10:49,820
What do you mean?

793
01:10:50,142 --> 01:10:52,497
Are you and McKay throwing another...

794
01:10:52,742 --> 01:10:55,893
...paddy-wagon party for me?

795
01:10:57,102 --> 01:10:59,900
Frigging McKay.
He's something, isn't he?

796
01:11:00,782 --> 01:11:04,013
L want a line on this
Revolutionary Strike Force.

797
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:08,817
- You gots to be kidding!
- No, l'm not kidding.

798
01:11:09,062 --> 01:11:11,701
If you don't,
l'll say you're an ear.

799
01:11:11,942 --> 01:11:15,252
Hey, don't say that, not even joking.

800
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,260
Who's joking?

801
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:25,455
You really are a dirty bastard,
ain't you, Harry?

802
01:11:25,662 --> 01:11:26,856
The dirtiest.

803
01:11:31,822 --> 01:11:34,256
Word has it that Bobby Maxwell...

804
01:11:35,102 --> 01:11:36,421
...and his chick Wanda...

805
01:11:37,022 --> 01:11:39,456
...they're running around
calling themselves...

806
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:42,978
...the People's Revolutionary
Strike Force.

807
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:47,010
- "Calling themselves"?
- They don't believe in that shit...

808
01:11:47,462 --> 01:11:51,091
...they're into the bread,
that's how they think.

809
01:11:51,502 --> 01:11:53,458
Where do l find this Wanda?

810
01:11:53,702 --> 01:11:58,139
She's a tall brunette, works at
Tiffany's on Broadway.

811
01:12:00,702 --> 01:12:01,896
Thanks.

812
01:12:02,502 --> 01:12:03,730
Callahan.

813
01:12:06,342 --> 01:12:07,980
Do them in.

814
01:12:09,022 --> 01:12:10,978
You can count on that.

815
01:12:40,142 --> 01:12:41,131
Hi there!

816
01:12:41,382 --> 01:12:43,850
- Is this Tiffany's?
- Like the sign says.

817
01:12:44,102 --> 01:12:45,501
L'm Larry Dickman...

818
01:12:45,742 --> 01:12:48,336
...my brother was here,
tall, balding?

819
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:49,691
Remember him well!

820
01:12:49,902 --> 01:12:53,178
- Has a gold tooth in front?
- That's him.

821
01:12:55,262 --> 01:12:57,492
You know what l bet you'd like?

822
01:12:57,822 --> 01:13:00,416
L bet you want to learn
the love tussle.

823
01:13:00,902 --> 01:13:04,417
That sounds swell,
but l'm looking for a certain girl.

824
01:13:04,662 --> 01:13:06,857
We have many, warm and willing.

825
01:13:07,102 --> 01:13:09,058
- Her name's Wanda.
- Anybody you want.

826
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:11,372
My brother says she's terrific.

827
01:13:11,622 --> 01:13:12,611
Can l trust you?

828
01:13:12,862 --> 01:13:13,738
Yeah.

829
01:13:13,982 --> 01:13:16,177
What it is, is $ 75.

830
01:13:16,422 --> 01:13:20,301
- $ 75?
- Of course, that includes...

831
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:25,617
We shouldn't do this,
because the heat's on.

832
01:13:25,862 --> 01:13:27,898
Seeing your brother was here...

833
01:13:29,222 --> 01:13:32,373
...the $ 75 includes
personal instructions...

834
01:13:32,622 --> 01:13:35,420
...in 32 positions of lovemaking!

835
01:13:35,942 --> 01:13:37,295
That many?

836
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:41,735
$ 75, you pay me first.

837
01:13:42,822 --> 01:13:44,255
Oh, yeah.

838
01:13:50,942 --> 01:13:52,421
Right this way.

839
01:14:02,622 --> 01:14:03,611
What's this?

840
01:14:03,862 --> 01:14:07,138
You've seen dummies.
It's the same principle.

841
01:14:08,222 --> 01:14:11,532
For $ 75 you get to make it
with a rubber dolly.

842
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:13,215
Thirty-two ways!

843
01:14:13,422 --> 01:14:14,411
Any objections?

844
01:14:14,662 --> 01:14:17,813
Is there one where
the man gets on top?

845
01:14:18,022 --> 01:14:19,455
That's 33!

846
01:14:19,742 --> 01:14:23,257
Take your duds off.
L'll send the teacher in.

847
01:14:27,782 --> 01:14:30,342
- Hi there.
- You're not Wanda.

848
01:14:30,582 --> 01:14:33,255
These are the breaks. Needs air.

849
01:14:33,662 --> 01:14:36,130
Can't hump a limp dummy, l say.

850
01:14:38,902 --> 01:14:41,575
Speaking of limp dummies, strip.

851
01:14:41,822 --> 01:14:42,811
Where's Wanda?

852
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:45,860
Beats the hell out of me, Tom.

853
01:14:51,582 --> 01:14:53,652
L'll ask you just one last time.

854
01:14:53,902 --> 01:14:56,780
- Where's Wanda?
- I don't know, l don't know.

855
01:14:57,022 --> 01:14:59,252
She left a couple weeks ago.

856
01:14:59,502 --> 01:15:02,141
Ask Buchinski!
He runs the whole street.

857
01:15:02,382 --> 01:15:06,136
- Where's Buchinski?
- Down the hall to the right.

858
01:15:50,142 --> 01:15:52,178
<i>Yes, nearer my God to thee...</i>

859
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:54,060
<i>... so brother Bob 's here.</i>

860
01:15:54,302 --> 01:15:56,497
<i>Brother Bob will bring you to God.</i>

861
01:15:56,742 --> 01:15:59,654
<i>Bring you to the Man</i>
<i>to save your soul.</i>

862
01:15:59,902 --> 01:16:01,893
<i>Salvation is where it's at.</i>

863
01:16:03,022 --> 01:16:06,059
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

864
01:16:06,302 --> 01:16:09,499
- You a lawyer?
- Yes, l am. Whoever you are...

865
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:11,937
l'm looking for a tall brunette,
Wanda.

866
01:16:12,182 --> 01:16:15,970
L'll tell you something, punk.
It's a protected operation.

867
01:16:16,222 --> 01:16:19,134
You'll end up with
your balls in spaghetti sauce.

868
01:16:19,382 --> 01:16:22,021
You have clout with the syndicate?

869
01:16:22,262 --> 01:16:26,141
L can blow you away with one call,
so get the hell out!

870
01:16:26,382 --> 01:16:30,739
To me, you're just a maggot
who sells dirty pictures.

871
01:16:51,102 --> 01:16:53,058
- Wanda! Where is she?
- Go to hell.

872
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:56,973
- One more time. Wanda?
- All right, all right.

873
01:16:59,222 --> 01:17:01,861
She quit a few weeks ago,
it's all l know.

874
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:05,340
She got religion.

875
01:17:06,062 --> 01:17:09,737
- What do you mean?
- Hanging by a church on Garvey.

876
01:17:14,462 --> 01:17:18,660
<i>Have you received another tape</i>
<i>from the People's Strike Force?</i>

877
01:17:18,902 --> 01:17:20,540
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Is the mayor all right?</i>

878
01:17:20,782 --> 01:17:25,139
<i>We've been assured that he's</i>
<i>all right, but there'll be...</i>

879
01:17:25,462 --> 01:17:28,932
<i>... no payment or transportation</i>
<i>until we have...</i>

880
01:17:29,182 --> 01:17:30,740
<i>... seen the mayor.</i>

881
01:17:30,982 --> 01:17:34,213
<i>- Then you're letting them go?</i>
<i>- That's the agreement.</i>

882
01:17:34,462 --> 01:17:37,499
<i>- Any idea where they are?</i>
<i>- Not yet.</i>

883
01:17:37,742 --> 01:17:41,257
<i>We should get one more</i>
<i>message this evening.</i>

884
01:17:41,502 --> 01:17:46,337
<i>- Is Inspector Callahan off this case?</i>
<i>- Sorry, no more questions.</i>

885
01:17:54,942 --> 01:17:55,931
What do you have?

886
01:17:56,182 --> 01:18:00,061
The priest, Father John Voss.
Militant, big in prison reform.

887
01:18:00,302 --> 01:18:04,739
He runs rehab seminars in all
the prisons in this area.

888
01:18:04,982 --> 01:18:07,974
Here's a list of the cons
that took it in San Quentin.

889
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:11,259
Bobby Maxell never missed a session.

890
01:18:12,222 --> 01:18:13,655
- You wait here.
- Wait.

891
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,814
The new ransom tape
said "Fessenheim" again.

892
01:18:17,062 --> 01:18:18,541
What does that mean?

893
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:23,060
Last year two bombs blew at a
nuclear plant in Fessenheim, France.

894
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:26,061
How about that.

895
01:18:35,102 --> 01:18:36,615
The body of Christ.

896
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:42,334
The body of Christ.

897
01:18:46,782 --> 01:18:48,534
The body...

898
01:18:49,102 --> 01:18:50,820
Remember me, Father?

899
01:18:51,422 --> 01:18:52,332
Yes.

900
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:57,014
- What is it you want?
- To talk about Bobby Maxwell.

901
01:18:57,982 --> 01:19:00,052
Then get a warrant.

902
01:19:18,022 --> 01:19:21,253
- Just a minute.
- I thought l made it clear to you.

903
01:19:21,502 --> 01:19:24,062
L have nothing to say to you!

904
01:19:24,862 --> 01:19:28,741
Why do you come here
and harass me in my church?

905
01:19:29,662 --> 01:19:32,654
- Is that a confessional?
- You want to confess?

906
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:35,462
You first!

907
01:19:37,422 --> 01:19:39,060
Where the hell's Maxwell?

908
01:19:39,262 --> 01:19:41,218
God may forgive, but l...

909
01:19:41,662 --> 01:19:44,301
Why do you protect them?
Many have died.

910
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:47,852
Sacrifices have to be made!

911
01:19:48,302 --> 01:19:51,260
- The people are at war!
- So am I!

912
01:19:51,822 --> 01:19:54,700
How dare you pull a gun
in the house of God.

913
01:19:54,942 --> 01:19:56,773
If you don't believe in the sanctity...

914
01:19:57,022 --> 01:19:59,934
l don't have time to argue
religion with you!

915
01:20:07,862 --> 01:20:10,137
Look at her hands!
Look at her hands!

916
01:20:19,622 --> 01:20:23,501
- There wasn't supposed to be killing.
- Is she dead?

917
01:20:29,342 --> 01:20:32,254
L close my eyes to this.

918
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,854
Father in heaven, help.

919
01:20:36,262 --> 01:20:38,856
You can't close your eyes anymore.

920
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,458
Now where's Maxwell?

921
01:20:54,142 --> 01:20:56,019
Alcatraz.

922
01:20:56,222 --> 01:20:57,655
A place to hole up.

923
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:02,141
It wouldn't do
any good to suggest...

924
01:21:03,862 --> 01:21:05,261
Forget it.

925
01:21:08,662 --> 01:21:11,130
<i>No communications</i>
<i>were received since...</i>

926
01:21:11,382 --> 01:21:15,295
Nothing! You sure Wanda
got those tapes to the cops?

927
01:21:15,742 --> 01:21:18,893
Bobby, l don't know.

928
01:21:19,102 --> 01:21:21,775
L don't know.
L wasn't with her!

929
01:21:27,462 --> 01:21:29,851
- Lf you didn't think she...
- Shut up!

930
01:21:30,102 --> 01:21:32,616
- What're you doing?
- Having some coffee.

931
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:48,099
Get the hell out of here!

932
01:21:51,502 --> 01:21:54,414
Christ, man, get your ass out there!

933
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:51,811
Lalo.

934
01:22:52,062 --> 01:22:54,530
Get the mayor, bring him in here.

935
01:25:03,422 --> 01:25:06,653
L'll get the bar.
Get him out of there.

936
01:25:20,302 --> 01:25:21,417
Freeze!

937
01:25:22,982 --> 01:25:25,735
All right, let him go!
Let him go!

938
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:31,257
Move over there, Your Honor! Fine.

939
01:25:33,222 --> 01:25:37,010
Okay, now, l want you very slowly...

940
01:25:38,062 --> 01:25:39,939
...to put down the weapon...

941
01:25:40,422 --> 01:25:43,255
...then on the deck and spread them.

942
01:25:44,982 --> 01:25:46,893
Are you kidding me?

943
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:51,260
Laugh at me, bastard,
and l'll shoot you where you stand.

944
01:26:02,222 --> 01:26:05,532
Let's go, Your Honor. Let's go!

945
01:26:05,822 --> 01:26:08,780
Let's get out of here. Now, speed!

946
01:26:10,222 --> 01:26:11,735
Stay with me.

947
01:26:12,182 --> 01:26:13,376
Hold it, hold it.

948
01:26:13,622 --> 01:26:16,659
Just take it very easy.

949
01:26:17,822 --> 01:26:21,815
You relax, do just as l say,
and l'll get you home, all right?

950
01:26:22,062 --> 01:26:24,451
- Yeah.
- Take it slow.

951
01:26:25,462 --> 01:26:26,861
Wait a minute.
