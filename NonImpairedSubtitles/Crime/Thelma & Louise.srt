No. I didn't tell him.

Want to lighten
the load a little?

793
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,644
Yeah.

794
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,166
I think that's better.
What do you think? Yeah.

795
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,367
Take me, break me, make me mad.

796
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,362
- Watch your head.
- It'e all right.

797
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,520
Who are you, anyway?

798
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,962
The great and powerful Oz.
Who do you want to be?

799
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,564
You're not just some schoolboy.

800
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,720
Nobody ever telle me ehit.

801
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,721
I'm juet some guy,

802
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:20,928
a guy whoee parole officer
ie probably having a ehit-fit.

803
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,319
What do you mean,
parole officer?

804
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,401
Are you a criminal?

805
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,765
No, not no more, Thelma.

806
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:31,968
Besidee busting parole,
I haven't done one wrong thing.

807
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,599
- What'd you do?
- I'm a robber.

808
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:40,323
- You're a bank robber?
- No. I don't rob no banks.

809
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,520
What did you rob?

810
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:49,201
Well, let's eee.
Let's add it up here.

811
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,564
Robbed a gae station,

812
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,165
a couple convenience stores,
liquor storee.

813
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,400
Oh, my God.

814
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,283
How?

815
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,649
Come on.

816
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,642
OK. First, you pick your place.

817
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:11,723
Then I sit back and watch it
for a little while,

818
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,768
wait for that right moment
to make my move.

819
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,966
That ehit cannot be taught.

820
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,804
And... Shit, I don't want
to talk about thie.

821
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,642
I do.

822
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:25,889
All right.

823
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:29,167
Then I'd waltz right in.

824
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:33,564
Yep. I just waltz
on in and I say,

825
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:37,165
"Let's see who wins the prize
for keeping their cool.

826
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,081
"Everybody on the floor."

827
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:42,526
"Nobody lose their head,
and nobody loses their head.

828
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:45,568
"You, sir, you do the honoure.

829
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:49,802
"Put the cash in a bag and you
got a great story to tell.

830
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:53,644
"If not, you got a tag
on your toe. You decide."

831
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,039
Simple as that.

832
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,280
Then I just slip on out

833
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,001
and get the hell out of Dodge.

834
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:08,563
My goodnees. You were
gentlemanly about it.

835
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,323
I've always believed,
if done properly,

836
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:15,039
armed robbery doesn't have to be
a totally unpleaeant experience.

837
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,644
- What?
- You're a real live outlaw.

838
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,800
I may be an outlaw, darling,

839
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,723
but you're the one
stealing my heart.

840
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:28,200
- Smooth.
- Oh, isn't he?

841
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:31,282
- You're emooth.
- Isn't he? That'e right.

842
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:33,326
I like it that way.

843
00:58:38,778 --> 00:58:38,858
Remember when we first met?

844
00:58:38,858 --> 00:58:41,372
Remember when we first met?

845
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,411
Yeah.

846
00:58:46,058 --> 00:58:48,014
Tell me what you said.

847
00:58:48,098 --> 00:58:51,010
I said you had
a nice pair of eyes.

848
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:55,530
And what did I say?
Do you remember?

849
00:58:57,338 --> 00:58:59,727
Yeah. You shut them,

850
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:03,174
aeked me if I knew
what colour they were.

851
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:05,567
And what did you eay?

852
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:08,854
I didn't know.

853
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:15,690
Jimmy, what colour
are my eyes?

854
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:20,889
They're brown.

855
00:59:58,299 --> 01:00:00,335
[Thelma] Mmm... boy.

856
01:00:00,539 --> 01:00:02,257
<i>Everything is silent</i>

857
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:04,455
<i>Night upon the rocks</i>

858
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:07,178
<i>I'm over by the roadhouse</i>

859
01:00:07,259 --> 01:00:09,898
<i>With them rusted engine blocks</i>

860
01:00:09,979 --> 01:00:12,129
<i>A ghost town with a gold mine</i>

861
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:14,938
<i>A pickaxe in my head</i>

862
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:17,613
<i>I'm beggin', mama,</i>
<i>please move over</i>

863
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:20,054
<i>Kick the stones out of my bed</i>

864
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:34,731
<i>Met my sister Sandra</i>
<i>With them jewels and the cross</i>

865
01:00:34,819 --> 01:00:37,731
<i>Eyes on my lever now</i>
<i>She paint with chili sauce...</i>

866
01:00:39,851 --> 01:00:40,451
<i>I cannot do no business</i>
<i>with your candle lit in red</i>

867
01:00:40,451 --> 01:00:43,488
<i>I cannot do no business</i>

01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:47,086
<i>I'm beggin', mama,</i>

869
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:50,129
<i>Kick the stones out of my bed</i>

870
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:31,565
- You all want some more coffee?
- Thank you.

871
01:01:34,931 --> 01:01:37,491
<i>And tied that rolling river...</i>

872
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:43,162
Look, I don't know
what'e going on with you

873
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:46,402
or what happened
or what you all did,

874
01:01:46,491 --> 01:01:50,200
but I'm not going
to tell anybody anything,

875
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,486
or say I even saw you.

876
01:01:56,611 --> 01:02:01,002
Did you take some pill that
makes you say the right etuff?

877
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:06,283
Yeah. I'm choking on it.

878
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:12,367
Er... Sure you don't want me
to go with you?

879
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:17,167
Lt'e probably not
a real good idea right now,

880
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:20,800
but I'll catch up
with you later...

881
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:22,764
on down the road.

882
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:25,490
<i>Oh, yes, I try</i>

883
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:28,324
<i>But I can't untie you</i>

884
01:02:30,171 --> 01:02:33,800
Well... my taxi's here.

885
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:41,970
So why don't you
just keep that?

886
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:45,088
- OK?
- Thanke.

887
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:49,209
[Jimmy]
I juet want you to be happy.

888
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:53,204
I am happy, sweetie.
Happy as I can be.

889
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:55,721
<i>Holding on to nothing at all</i>

890
01:02:55,811 --> 01:02:57,403
All right.

891
01:02:59,331 --> 01:03:03,688
Well, why don't you give
old Jimmy a kiss goodbye,

892
01:03:03,771 --> 01:03:06,922
and I'll be getting
out of here.

893
01:03:09,771 --> 01:03:11,966
Come here, old Jimmy.

894
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:17,125
<i>Oh, the truth in your heart</i>

01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:22,566
<i>Oh, baby</i>

897
01:03:23,691 --> 01:03:27,400
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to say something else</i>

898
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:32,725
<i>And I walked a thousand miles</i>

899
01:03:32,811 --> 01:03:38,010
<i>To the edge of every sea</i>

900
01:03:38,091 --> 01:03:43,609
<i>And I try</i>

You have a eafe trip.

904
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:59,081
<i>Your name is on the wall</i>

905
01:04:00,731 --> 01:04:05,247
<i>It is written</i>
<i>on the deep, green lake...</i>

906
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:10,920
[Waitress]
Good thing he left when he did.

907
01:04:11,011 --> 01:04:13,889
We thought we'd have
to put out a fire.

908
01:04:25,674 --> 01:04:27,392
Hi.

909

Nothing. Why?
Do I seem different?

Now that you mention it, yeah.

914
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:46,152
You seem like
you're crazy or on druge.

915
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:49,465
Well, I'm not on drugs,

916
01:04:49,554 --> 01:04:51,704
but I might be crazy!

917
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:58,143
Thelma, what happened?

918
01:05:00,834 --> 01:05:03,394

919
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:05,066

921

01:05:18,034 --> 01:05:21,709
Darling, I'm so happy for you,

926
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:25,150
You finally got laid properly.
That'e so sweet.

927
01:05:26,514 --> 01:05:29,472
- Where is he?
- He's taking a shower.

928
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,108
You left him alone
in the room?

929
01:05:36,594 --> 01:05:38,346
Where'e the money?

930
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,551

931
01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:43,431
It'e OK!

932

Lt'e on the nightstand.
It'e OK!

Oh, God damn it!

934

I have never been lucky,

935
01:06:01,154 --> 01:06:04,863
Shit! That son-of-a-bitch
burgled me.

936
01:06:04,954 --> 01:06:06,467
I don't believe it.

937
01:06:06,554 --> 01:06:08,510
I don't believe it.

- No, Thelma, it'e not OK.

944
01:06:37,354 --> 01:06:39,868
It'e definitely not OK.

945
01:06:41,474 --> 01:06:43,783
None of this is OK.

946
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:49,312
I mean, what are we going
to do for money, huh?

947
01:06:49,394 --> 01:06:51,305
How are we going to get gas?

948
01:06:51,394 --> 01:06:53,862
I mean,
trading on our good looks?

949

01:58:56,812 --> 01:58:58,643
Damn it!

1573
01:58:59,892 --> 01:59:04,283
Cut your engine off and place
your hands in plain view.

1574
01:59:09,972 --> 01:59:13,328
OK, then, listen.
Let'e not get caught.

1575
01:59:13,412 --> 01:59:16,085
What are you talking about?

1576
01:59:18,172 --> 01:59:20,163
Let's keep going.

1577
01:59:20,252 --> 01:59:22,561
What do you mean?

1578
01:59:25,932 --> 01:59:27,570
Go.

1579
01:59:32,412 --> 01:59:34,130
You sure?

1580
01:59:37,012 --> 01:59:39,890
Yeah. Hit it.

1581
01:59:54,972 --> 01:59:56,405
Hey!

1582
02:01:18,868 --> 02:01:24,022
<i>I felt it when the sun</i>
<i>came up this morning</i>

1583
02:01:25,988 --> 02:01:31,506
<i>I knew I could not wait</i>
<i>another day</i>

1584
02:01:33,668 --> 02:01:38,617
<i>Darling, there is something</i>
<i>I must tell you</i>

1585
02:01:40,748 --> 02:01:45,617
<i>Distant voices calling me away</i>

1586
02:01:47,908 --> 02:01:52,982
<i>Until we find the bridge</i>
<i>across forever</i>

1587
02:01:54,668 --> 02:02:00,106
<i>Until this grand illusion</i>
<i>brings us home</i>

1588
02:02:02,068 --> 02:02:07,700
<i>You and I will</i>
<i>always be together</i>

1589
02:02:09,668 --> 02:02:14,458
<i>From this day on,</i>
<i>you'll never walk alone</i>

1590
02:02:16,988 --> 02:02:19,661
<i>You're a part of me</i>

1591
02:02:19,748 --> 02:02:23,218
<i>I'm a part of you</i>

1592
02:02:24,388 --> 02:02:27,266
<i>Wherever we may travel</i>

1593
02:02:27,348 --> 02:02:30,658
<i>Whatever we go through</i>

1594
02:02:30,828 --> 02:02:34,946
<i>Whatever time may take away</i>

1595
02:02:35,028 --> 02:02:38,657
<i>It cannot change</i>
<i>the way we feel today</i>

1596
02:02:38,748 --> 02:02:43,424
<i>So hold me close,</i>
<i>and say you feel it, too</i>

1597
02:02:45,628 --> 02:02:47,778
<i>You're part of me</i>

1598
02:02:47,868 --> 02:02:50,177
<i>And I am part of you</i>

1599
02:02:56,068 --> 02:03:01,665
<i>I can hear it</i>
<i>when I stand beside the river</i>

1600
02:03:03,428 --> 02:03:08,661
<i>I can see it</i>
<i>when I look up in the sky</i>

1601
02:03:10,188 --> 02:03:16,707
<i>I can feel it when I hear</i>
<i>that lonesome highway</i>

1602
02:03:18,548 --> 02:03:23,224
<i>So many miles to go</i>
<i>before I die</i>

1603
02:03:25,668 --> 02:03:30,662
<i>We can never know</i>
<i>about tomorrow</i>

1604
02:03:32,868 --> 02:03:37,623
<i>Still we have to choose</i>
<i>which way to go</i>

1605
02:03:40,188 --> 02:03:45,216
<i>You and I are standing</i>
<i>at the crossroads</i>

1606
02:03:47,468 --> 02:03:52,781
<i>Darling, there is one thing</i>
<i>you should know</i>

1607
02:03:54,148 --> 02:03:57,060
<i>You're a part of me</i>

1608
02:03:57,148 --> 02:04:00,618
<i>I'm a part of you...</i>

1609
02:04:01,348 --> 02:04:07,139
