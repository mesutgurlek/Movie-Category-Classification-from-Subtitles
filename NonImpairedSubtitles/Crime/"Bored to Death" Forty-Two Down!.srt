- What do you need?

2
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:04,859
<i>A signed first edition
of "On the Road."</i>

All "edition" employees are
subject to a mandatory drug test.

5
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:14,044
How long does marijuana
stay in a person's system?

6
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:16,416
- What are you doing?
- George, I have to go.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,885
- What's your name?
- Trouble.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,190
That was my mom's name.
I don't like that.

9
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:23,830
- Snort this, 5-0, and show us
you ain't a cop. - I refuse.

10
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:28,973
I admit I've been smoking
marijuana for medicinal purposes.

I never had the guts to try out
for "The New Yorker" before,

22
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:32,979
but now I'm ready.

23
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:34,983
Is this magazine still around?

24
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:38,755
Of course. Anyway, I think
I can win this contest.

25
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:40,691
I'm going to turn
my cases into stories,

26
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,861
but I need to come up
with a heroic alter ego.

27
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:46,332
- Like you did with Super Ray.
- I have a new alter alter ego:

28
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,967
- Kevin Bacon.
- What do you mean Kevin Bacon?

29
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:52,301
He emailed me this morning.
Somehow he saw "The Birth of Super Ray."

30
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:56,370
He wants to meet tonight.
He thinks he can option it for like $10,000.

31
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:58,905
My God, this is huge!
He wants to play Super Ray?

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,807
Yes. He thinks it can finally
be his big franchise character.

33
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:04,275
Kind of like a drunken
Batman with a big cock.

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,211
This is amazing.
I love Kevin Bacon.

35
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:08,413
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

36
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:10,782
Oh, it's George.
I've got to grab this real quick.

37
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,951
I'm gonna get some more iced coffee.
It's free refills.

38
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,586
- Hello, George?
- Hey, Jonathan.

39
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,389
I'm just calling to confirm...
8:30, your class, right?

40
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:19,557
Yes, and you can talk about
whatever you want.

41
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,391
It... you know,
writing related.

42
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:24,361
Oh, I'm gonna give a good talk, I promise.
I'm feeling very inspired.

43
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,196
I just wrote what might be
my best column ever.

44
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,931
Oh, that's wonderful.

45
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,933
Oh hey, gotta go.
I got another call coming in.

46
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:32,768
- Hello?
- Hello.

47
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:35,737
<i>- Hello, who's this?
- Hello, George?</i>

48
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:39,473
<i>George?</i>

49
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:42,176
Thank you.

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,012
Oh my God, you just
spilled coffee on my baby!

51
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:47,781
I'm so... I'm so sorry! It's iced coffee.
It's just iced coffee.

52
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:50,549
- Oh my God, this is terrible.
- I think you should call the police.

53
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,317
Are you crazy?
It's just iced coffee.

54
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,018
I had much worse things happen
to me when I was a kid.

55
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:56,553
<i>- It's fine. - Don't tell
me how my child is doing!</i>

56
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,922
<i>Are you okay, sweetie?</i>

57
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:00,890
Can I get another
refill, please?

58
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:02,759
I'm sorry.
Ow, ck!

59
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:08,196
Wow, I've never been
86'd from a cafe.

60
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,932
Screw those Brooklyn moms.
I hate women.

61
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:13,801
Really? What about the
new woman you're dating?

62
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,636
Oh, I gotta break up with her.

63
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,138
She's paranoid,
needy and jealous.

64
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,808
All of which make her good in
bed, but the rest of the time

65
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,410
- it is hell.
- Man, that does sound bad.

66
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,579
She also hacked
into my email account

67
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:27,147
and put her picture
on my phone.

68
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:29,449
Everytime I make a call
I have to see her face.

69
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,717
Oh my God, that's Jennifer Gladwell.
I know her!

70
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:35,186
- Brooklyn is so small.
- Wait, how do you know her?

71
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,555
She's one of my first clients.
She's definitely nuts.

72
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,222
She hired me to tail
her boyfriend.

73
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:41,024
I'm gonna break up with her later.
I wanna feel

74
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:43,826
like everything's in order before
my meeting with Kevin Bacon.

75
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,694
So if he options it, what are
you gonna do with the money?

76
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,263
Well, probably get some health insurance.
Go to the dentist.

77
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:50,131
I haven't been to
the dentist in 14 years.

78
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,167
I have more plaque
on my teeth than teeth.

79
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:54,402
Shit, 14 years?
What else?

80
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:56,637
I don't know.
I'll get some drawing pencils,

81
00:03:56,672 --> 00:03:58,172
a new Insulin pump for my mom,

82
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:01,442
maybe cover up some
of these varicose veins.

83
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,479
Come come.

84
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,982
So, table for one, my friend?

85
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,184
- Hmm?
- Jonathan Ames.

86
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,286
- Yes.
- He's for me, Akhil.

87
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,856
Hello.

88
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,891
You must be Lakshmi Bhargava.

89
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,526
Very good.
I'm impressed by your pronunciation.

90
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,761
Thank you. I listen
to a lot of n.P.R.

91
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:28,297
Come.

92
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,902
So how can I help you,
Mrs. Bhargava.

93
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:35,804
Well, I'm so ashamed
to say this,

94
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:39,440
but I suspect my husband
of 15 years, Vikrum,

95
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:41,909
is having a love affair.

96
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:44,679
- What makes you think so?
- He's a limousine driver,

97
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:48,816
but he's been coming home for weeks
only after I've gone to sleep.

98
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,417
- What excuse does he give?
- No excuse.

99
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:55,487
He must be with a woman who cooks
bacon after they make love.

100
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:59,523
I smell it on his clots
and s bald head.

101
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,758
I should have never
married a poet!

102
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:06,129
But it was arranged.
Still I... I've come to love him.

103
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:08,431
He's a limo driver and a poet?

104
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:11,133
That's great.
I'm a detective and a writer.

105
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,602
It's good to have more than one profession.
I also teach.

106
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:16,605
I don't care.
I just want you to follow my husband.

107
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,207
Right.

108
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:13,852
Oh!
Uh hey, buddy?

109
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,653
Why don't you go ahead
and pour me another one?

110
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:17,855
This time make it
a big-girl glass.

111
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:26,930
Jennifer, I...
Jesus Christ.

112
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:29,032
Jennifer, I hate to, um,

113
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:31,967
spring this on you right here,

114
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:34,069
but I think that

115
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:37,038
maybe we should stop
seeing each other.

116
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:41,308
Just for a little while.
You know, maybe take a break.

117
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:43,710
What are you talking about?
I don't want to take a break.

118
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:46,512
- I really like you. - I just have
a lot of stuff going on right now.

119
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:48,214
What's that supposed to mean?

120
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:50,288
My big meeting
with Kevin Bacon tonight

121
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,620
so you can't date me 'cause
you're seeing Kevin Bacon?

122
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:55,722
I'm not seeing him.
I have a meeting.

123
00:06:55,756 --> 00:06:58,760
- That's what you're making it sound like.
- I'm not dating Kevin Bacon.

124
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,626
Well, I don't know, are you?

125
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,694
I don't... I mean...
what?

126
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:04,496
No.

127
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,097
I just want
to focus on my work.

128
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:07,898
Okay?

129
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:09,766
It's not me, it's you.

130
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,901
No, that's backwards.

131
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:13,536
You say,
"it's not you, it's me"

132
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,404
- to someone.
- Right.

133
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,072
It's not you, it's me.

134
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:19,474
All right, why don't you just
be honest with me, Ray, okay?

135
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:21,408
I can take it.

136
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:24,177
Okay, I will be honest.

137
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:28,748
You drink too much
and I'm not used to it.

138
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,717
I like to be the heavy drinker
in a relationship.

139
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:33,286
So I'll quit drinking.
I've done it a million times.

140
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,555
I quit three weeks ago, okay?
I can do it again.

141
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,556
Okay look, here.

142
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,693
And that's it.
I'm done.

143
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,795
It's over.
Wait.

144
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,798
- It's over.
- Jennifer, you're beautiful.

145
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:50,734
But you're too much for me.

146
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:54,337
Someone will love you
one day, I promise you.

147
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:57,973
It's just like Dylan said:
It ain't me, babe.

148
00:07:58,007 --> 00:08:01,842
- Did you just quote Bob Dylan?
- Yes, because you love Bob Dylan.

149
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:05,312
Okay, this is now the most
disgusting breakup

150
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:07,213
of my life.

151
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:24,663
Do you have a air dryer in the
bathroom or are there paper towels?

152
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,478
Sorry to bother you.

153
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:45,681
I can't get 42 down.
Can you help me?

154
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:49,484
The answer to 42 down
is "nincompoop."

155
00:08:49,518 --> 00:08:52,453
Nincompoop!
Oh man, thank you.

156
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:55,522
I had the poop part,
but not the nincom.

157
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:58,691
Nincomop's not a word
one hears every day,

158
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,859
but I got the answer
immediately because, well,

159
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:03,593
that's what I am...
a bloody nincompoop.

160
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,428
Well, I've just met you, but you don't
seem like a nincompoop to me.

161
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,930
Well, I am.
I'm a poet who can't be published

162
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,732
and I'm a driver
who doesn't drive.

163
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,300
The two things I love,
I fail at.

164
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:17,137
Why don't you drive anymore?

165
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:19,640
I was let go.
For 12 years I gave everything I had

166
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,908
to the number one
limo company in New York,

167
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:23,775
but they show me no respect.

168
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,144
Number one in N.Y.,
that's impressive.

169
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:29,647
No, that was the name of the company,
but we were number one in queens.

170
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,882
<i>- Have you tried other companies?
- Yes.</i>

171
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:35,085
37 applications so far,
but no luck.

172
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:37,053
So I sit here,

173
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:39,321
hiding from my beautiful wife,

174
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:42,190
too ashamed to face her.

175
00:09:45,694 --> 00:09:48,161
I know your wife.

176
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:50,329
Lakshmi Bhargava.

177
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:53,699
Hey, your pronunciation...
how do you know her?

178
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,868
I'm a private detective.
She thought you were having an affair,

179
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:59,071
<i>- so she hired me to follow you.
- What?</i>

180
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:02,473
Well, how much do you cost?
We can't afford you. I lost my job.

181
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:05,042
My rates are very reasonable.
But don't you see?

182
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:06,911
She loves you.

183
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:09,379
And she'll be relieved to know
that this is all that's going on.

184
00:10:09,414 --> 00:10:12,815
Look, I know how to
help you and your wife.

185
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,383
You lost your job?!

186
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,251
I can't believe you lied to me.

187
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:18,954
We have a mortgage.
Get out!

188
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:20,755
Poet.

189
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,257
No no, he couldn't help it.
It's the economy.

190
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,559
He filled out 37 applications.

191
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,461
At least he's not
cheating on you, right?

192
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:30,597
This is worse.
This jeopardizes everything.

193
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,066
You are a terrible detective.

194
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,434
- I'm not paying you.
- Wait a second... wait!

195
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,204
You love him; He loves you; Case closed.
I'm a good detective!

196
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,510
Idiot!

197
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,113
- You've wrecked my life.
- But...

198
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,489
Table for one?

199
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:02,825
"We need to...
we need to defend

200
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,596
the written word."
Ah, that's better.

201
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,165
"Books are essential
to our humanity.

202
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,735
We need to defend
the written word."

203
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,703
- That is so good.
- George.

204
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:18,271
Oh hi. Come on in.

205
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:19,839
I'm just working on this talk

206
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:21,974
I have to give to this
writing class tonight.

207
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,043
You know, rally the youth
and all of that.

208
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:26,078
Sit down actually.
Let me do it for you. Come on.

209
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:28,146
- Well, George, I...
- I was thinking,

210
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,816
speaking to young writers is something
that I could do for the magazine.

211
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,951
You know, I could
go around the country...

212
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,453
like Mark Twain, right?

213
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,455
You know, giving
inspirational talks.

214
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,857
- Mark Twain? - I could also, you
know, like wear one of those,

215
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:45,627
uh, what do you call 'em?
You know, prosthetic mustaches.

216
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:49,664
It could be very theatrical.
Mark twain had white hair as well.

217
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:52,833
You know? And he loved three-piece suits.
I'm just saying.

218
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:54,668
We can discuss
this later, George,

219
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:56,169
but a more pressing issue

220
00:11:56,203 --> 00:11:59,105
is that we need to cut
columns from the magazine.

221
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,173
Ugh, again?

222
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:05,277
All right, how about
the astrology column?

223
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:07,178
We can lose that.
It's frivolous.

224
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:10,214
No, it's very popular.
The people love it.

225
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:13,016
I'm sorry, George,
but the board in Dallas

226
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,918
wants to cut your column.

227
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,721
My "By George" column?

228
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,521
Oh no no no no.

229
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:23,324
Katherine, Kath...
I've written that for 20 years.

230
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:27,227
Just this morning
I wrote my best piece ever

231
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:28,728
about my prostate.

232
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:31,697
Oh no no no.
They can't take that away from me.

233
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:34,032
I know, George,
but they are adamant.

234
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,801
- There's nothing we can do.
- No, Katherine,

235
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:40,070
I am my column.

236
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:43,072
I mean, I'm writing it
in my mind all the time.

237
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:45,908
Well, maybe you could,
um, keep a diary.

238
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:47,843
I'm sorry, what?
A diary?

239
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,978
Oh...

240
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:53,848
You know, let me ask you
something here.

241
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:56,884
What exactly do you see as
my role here at the magazine?

242
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,588
- I know it's been diminished, George.
- Diminished?

243
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:01,958
But you're still very good
at cocktail parties.

244
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:04,427
Our advertisers love you.

245
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,030
Cocktail parties?

246
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:09,164
Well,

247
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:13,402
maybe I'll have a little
drink right now then.

248
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,037
Yeah, hey, cocktail party.

249
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:18,805
"Hey I'm George Christopher.

250
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,509
You're from Dallas.
Oh, you must be an asshole."

251
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,485
Jonathan?

252
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,354
Oh hey, Nina.

253
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:36,256
Come in, come in.

254
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,893
Are you okay?
We can reschedule this if you want.

255
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:43,126
No no, it's fine.
I just, um,

256
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:46,696
I destroyed a man's life today.

257
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,431
That happens.

258
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:50,366
I destroyed someone last week

259
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:54,403
but people are a lot stronger
than we give them credit for.

260
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:58,340
At least that's what
my therapist says.

261
00:13:58,374 --> 00:13:59,842
That's true.

262
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:02,912
Uh, okay, enough about me.
Let's discuss your story.

263
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:10,652
Well, first of all
I love your prose.

264
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:13,921
Thank you!
That means a lot to me.

265
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:15,722
My main question is this:

266
00:14:15,756 --> 00:14:19,959
Is it believable that a
beautiful 16-year-old girl

267
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,227
would fall in love
with a high-school teacher

268
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,462
who has a weak chin
and forehead psoriasis?

269
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,730
Oh yes, it is believable.

270
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:30,334
Teachers can be
very charismatic.

271
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,370
Really?

272
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,511
You have a very beautiful hand.

273
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:45,479
Thank you.

274
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:48,949
I'm sorry.
That was not appropriate.

275
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:50,417
You're my student.

276
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:52,952
Jonathan, I'm almost your age.

277
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:55,287
You haven't done
anything wrong.

278
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:57,889
I've been wanting
to tell you...

279
00:14:57,923 --> 00:15:00,391
the virginity scene
in your novel

280
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:03,127
is really hot
even though you...

281
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:07,098
I mean your narrator...
had a premature ejaculation.

282
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:13,504
<i>Oh hi, George.</i>

283
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,173
Come in.
We were just...

284
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,241
this is my student
Nina Cassidy.

285
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:19,377
- Hi. - Nina, this is
George Christopher.

286
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:21,946
- He's my mentor.
- Mentor?

287
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,814
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

288
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:27,016
George is gonna speak
to our class tonight.

289
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,550
Oh really?
What are you gonna talk about?

290
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:31,317
Ah.

291
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:34,685
So just like I have
cancer of the prostate,

292
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,588
the publishing industry
also has cancer.

293
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:40,724
Magazines are dying.

294
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,493
Books are dying.

295
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,928
<i>Newspapers are dying.</i>

296
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:51,699
Print is dead.

297
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,569
Questions?

298
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:58,872
<i>Anybody?</i>

299
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:01,908
Okay, that was bleak.

300
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:05,277
Thank you, George, but like
things with the environment,

301
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:08,213
we have at least a few more
years before the end of time.

302
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,984
I always have this dream
where I'm flying, you know?

303
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:14,752
And then I wake up
and I'm heartbroken

304
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:16,854
that I can't fly.
What do you think that means?

305
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:18,255
I don't know.
I never dream.

306
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,156
I smoke pot right
before I go to bed,

307
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:22,325
and it shuts down
the dream side of my brain.

308
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:25,594
Right. You know, that's one of the
things I love about Super Ray...

309
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:29,231
is that he flies. I have always wanted
to play a superhero who could fly.

310
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:31,499
- Oh, great, I...
- Listen, about my process.

311
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,835
I'm gonna need
to get close to you.

312
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,970
Maybe move in,

313
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,674
wear your clothes, t-shirts...
kinda get your scent on me.

314
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,442
- Really? That's necessary?
- Definitely.

315
00:16:41,477 --> 00:16:43,711
I'm just gonna warn you...
I don't wear deodorant.

316
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:45,579
I gotta tell you,
I think it's amazing

317
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:47,481
that he uses his
huge cock as a weapon.

318
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:49,616
I mean that's just awesome.

319
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,118
I mean that just seems
really true to life.

320
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:54,286
Thanks.
I kinda see his huge cock

321
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,354
as like Thor's hammer.

322
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:58,756
Yeah well, I can
definitely do that.

323
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:11,701
I'm sorry, Jonathan.
I didn't mean to wreck your class.

324
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,704
It's just...

325
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:18,007
Between the cancer
and things falling apart

326
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:22,344
at the magazine
I'm just all muddled.

327
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:26,214
- I'm sorry, George. - And I'm not
gonna quit, so don't even suggest it,

328
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:28,615
but I think I'm addicted
to marijuana again.

329
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,917
- Oh no, why?
- Well, for one thing

330
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:33,586
I'm not happy
unless I'm stoned.

331
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,487
The other night I got high

332
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,555
and I took a walk and I...

333
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,660
Separated from my shadow.

334
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:43,095
Shit, that does sound strange.

335
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,563
Oh... and then
I'm driving stoned

336
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,632
and that's just
dangerous, you know.

337
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,100
Especially because
when I'm smoking

338
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,703
the left and the right
sides of my body

339
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:56,272
just, you know, don't
communicate with each other.

340
00:17:57,507 --> 00:18:00,674
Do you think you might
wanna hire a driver?

341
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:09,042
Yeah, I see what you mean.

342
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:11,544
Your driving really
has deteriorated.

343
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:15,582
Yeah, I know. That marijuana makes
parking especially difficult.

344
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,084
It's a spatial issue.

345
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:21,620
Hey, thanks so much for helping
me out with this, George.

346
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:23,589
- Ah.
- I never should have meddled.

347
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:25,757
Yeah, in life when
in doubt, never meddle.

348
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:28,192
It only causes problems.

349
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:32,261
He should be here.

350
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:36,766
There's Vikrum.
This is gonna be great.

351
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,770
- You're gonna make him really happy.
- Everybody get on the ground!

352
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:43,939
And throw your cell phones to
the middle of the floor. Now!

353
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:45,807
Vikrum, Vikrum,
what are you doing?

354
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:48,910
You! You idiot detective.

355
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,111
Get on the floor!
Both of you.

356
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:52,846
I just had my suit
dry-cleaned

357
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,681
and I have a bad knee too
actually.

358
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:56,249
Do you mind if I stand?

359
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:58,017
Dry-clean?

360
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:59,351
Shut up!

361
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,419
Vikrum, don't do this.
Don't do...

362
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:09,125
this is who you
wanted me to hire?

363
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:11,326
- He's not really like this.
- Well?

364
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,061
I can talk him down.

365
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:17,429
Vikrum.
Vikrum, listen to me.

366
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:19,264
Just give me the gun, okay?

367
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:21,299
<i>- You'll go to prison.
- I don't care anymore.</i>

368
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:24,169
I already see all of life as a prison.
At least when I was a driver

369
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:25,971
I was in a moving prison.

370
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,007
Vikrum, you can't give up.

371
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,879
I'm also a struggling writer, but I'm
gonna submit a story to "The New Yorker."

372
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:34,349
Don't talk to me about
"The New Yorker."

373
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:37,851
Those bastards rejected
66 of my poems.

374
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:42,088
Hey, you know, they rejected all of my
submissions to the caption contest.

375
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:44,057
Maybe it's just the magazine.

376
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:48,727
I'm not mechanically inclined.

377
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:51,363
Vikrum, you haven't done
anything wrong yet, okay?

378
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:54,299
- You haven't taken any money.
- That's because I can't open the drawer.

379
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,434
No, if you really wanted money
you could have taken

380
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:58,769
everyone's wallets
and jewelry, but you didn't.

381
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:02,272
Everybody! Throw your wallets and
jewelry to the center of the floor!

382
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:04,741
- Thank you.
- Nice one.

383
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:07,610
Ugh, Jesus.

384
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:09,712
So I can try to gain
the weight,

385
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:12,314
but chances are I'm probably gonna
have to go with a fat suit.

386
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:15,450
Uh well, I'm really not fat.

387
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:18,820
I mean, I kinda see myself
as stocky or portly

388
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:21,790
and I mean, you can wear a
stocky suit or a portly suit.

389
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:23,659
Yeah, that's true.

390
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:26,094
Well, except for maybe
in the belly area.

391
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:28,063
I'm just kinda washboardy.

392
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:30,299
You know, so I can just
pad that up a little bit.

393
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,467
And, uh, I'll try to grow
the beard but really

394
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:35,670
this is all I get and I'm
just highly evolved.

395
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:38,604
Oh, God damn it,
motherfucking piece of shit.

396
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:41,673
<i>- I can't believe it.
- Ray?</i>

397
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,909
I didn't know you'd be here.

398
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,377
Jennifer, this is Kevin Bacon.
Kevin this is Jennifer.

399
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,579
- Hi. Kevin Bacon.
- Oh, he's been bragging about meeting you.

400
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:51,246
I thought he was lying.

401
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,847
Which he does pathologically.

402
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:54,882
- Excuse me?
- Jennifer, will you just please...

403
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,351
- I don't know if he's made love to you yet.
- No not yet.

404
00:20:57,385 --> 00:20:59,586
When he does
you should be careful

405
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:02,388
because he gave me oral
chlamydia of the mouth.

406
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:05,090
- I... what? - I didn't know
you could get oral chlamydia.

407
00:21:05,124 --> 00:21:06,658
I've only had it
the normal way.

408
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,259
We'll be right back.

409
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,095
Don't touch my elbow!
That is assault.

410
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,964
- That's not cool, bro.
- He assaulted me.

411
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:15,166
When you don't wanna be
touched that is assault.

412
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:18,568
- Yeah, that is the legal definition.
- I did not assault you.

413
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:20,134
Yes, you did, super chlamydia.

414
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:22,536
Don't... but I don't have
chlamydia, Kevin. I don't.

415
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,306
- What's going on here? - This fat bully
gave me an s.T.D. And assaulted me.

416
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:29,076
All right, that's it. An s.
T.D.? You're out of here.

417
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,510
Excuse me.

418
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:37,612
Oh, oww!

419
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,613
No no no,
that is not cool, man.

420
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:41,615
I'm an actor!

421
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,052
What are you thinking?
I've made a living off this nose for 30 years.

422
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,853
Put those phones away!

423
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:49,588
Look what you've do to me.

424
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:51,023
You know what?

425
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:53,357
I don't think you're
cut out to play Super Ray.

426
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:10,779
So you want to buy me a drink?

427
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:12,580
Yeah.

428
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,848
But listen, can we get
out of Brooklyn?

429
00:22:14,882 --> 00:22:17,784
It's just not as cool
as I thought it was gonna be.

430
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:19,085
Oh yeah.

431
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:23,021
- Excuse us.
- Here's a really really big tip.

432
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:26,224
- I'm okay.
- Kevin Bacon's okay.

433
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:27,992
Kevin Bacon's all right.

434
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,327
I can't believe it.

435
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:33,897
- Jonathan, say something.
It's time to meddle. - Yeah.

436
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:37,700
You know Lakshmi will be furious with
you if you go through with this.

437
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,769
Well, she's already
furious thanks to you.

438
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:41,571
You know something?

439
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:43,973
I take back what I said.

440
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:46,374
You are a nincompoop.
Yeah.

441
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:48,043
You are a 42 down.

442
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:51,178
Hey!
Don't be rude.

443
00:22:51,213 --> 00:22:54,114
You have no idea
what I've gone through.

444
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:57,450
You don't understand what it's
like to turn up to work one day

445
00:22:57,485 --> 00:22:59,886
and to be told "pffft!
You're worthless"

446
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,854
after so many years.

447
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,724
Yeah, excuse me,
but I understand.

448
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:09,627
You know my whole identity
is wrapped up in my job,

449
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:11,629
but they won't listen
to me anymore.

450
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:14,698
I'm being pushed aside.
You know, I'm slowly

451
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:16,800
losing my place in the world.

452
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:19,402
Yes, that's...
that's what happened to me.

453
00:23:19,436 --> 00:23:23,439
I suggested to the boss that they put a
line of poetry on all the business cards

454
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:27,542
and I had great ideas about the schedule,
but they just... they didn't care!

455
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:31,345
Hey, can I call you Vikrum? Vikrum, see, you
and I are going through the same thing here.

456
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,481
Why don't you...
why don't you put the gun down?

457
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:36,516
'Cause, um, see, I have a job
that I'd like to offer you.

458
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:38,484
- You have a job for me?
- Yes.

459
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,455
See, he told me about you
and I need a driver.

460
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:46,725
And I really...
I admire poets

461
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,394
and I'd very much like
to read your work.

462
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,262
So why-why... why don't
you just give me the gun?

463
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,298
- You really like poetry?
- He does.

464
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,533
- I do.
- He does.

465
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:00,436
Thank you.

466
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,071
It's not even loaded.

467
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:05,240
My father gave it to me in 1983
because of the cricket riots.

468
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:07,609
It's been on the bottom
of a drawer ever since.

469
00:24:07,643 --> 00:24:09,243
- Huh!
- I'm gonna call 911.

470
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:10,911
- No no.
- Ma'am, that's not necessary.

471
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,113
- Yes!
- No no no.

472
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,847
It's fine, really.
Everything's fine here.

473
00:24:13,882 --> 00:24:17,050
It's just a normal
human reaction to stress.

474
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:20,251
- Thank you.
- I mean, come on... the gun's not even loaded.

475
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:23,220
Oh, what? I don't want it!

476
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,455
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

477
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,757
All right,
nobody call the cops!

478
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:34,228
I can get us out of here.
I know a service road the police won't think of.

479
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:36,098
- If you trust me to drive, that is.
- I trust you.

480
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:39,067
- Great, let's go!
- I love this orange color!

481
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:48,467
