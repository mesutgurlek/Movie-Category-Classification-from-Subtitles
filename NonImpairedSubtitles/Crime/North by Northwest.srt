1
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,420
"Even if you accept the belief that a high
Trendex means a rising sales curve...."

2
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,900
-Mr. Thornhill?
-Good night, Eddie.

3
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,300
-Say hello to the missus.
-We're not talking.

4
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,220
"My recommendation is still the same.

5
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,220
"Spread the good word in as many
small time segments as we can.

6
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,940
"Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.

7
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,700
"Let's colonize at the Colony
one day next week for lunch.

8
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,260
"Let me hear from you, Sam.
Happy thoughts, etc...."

9
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,860
You better walk me to the Plaza.

10
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,020
-I didn't put a coat on.
-Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.

11
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,540
-Next?
-Gretchen Sabinson.

12
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,300
Oh, yes.

13
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,180
Send her a box of candy from Blum's.
$10. You know the kind.

14
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,660
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll think she's eating money.

15
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,380
Just tell her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours--"

16
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,420
-You sent that one last time.
-I did?

17
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,420
Put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts! "

18
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,420
I know.

19
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,700
Could we take a cab?

20
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,860
-For two blocks?
-You're late and I'm tired.

21
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,500
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.

22
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Here. Taxi.

23
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,220
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?

24
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,460
Thank you very much.

25
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,980
Perfectly all right.

26
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,580
First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.

27
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,580
Poor man.

28
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,780
I made him a happy man.
I made him feel like a good Samaritan.

29
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,460
He knew you were lying.

30
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,420
In the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.

31
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,780
There's only "the expedient exaggeration."
You ought to know that.

32
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,060
Do I look heavyish to you?

33
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,020
What?

34
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,380
I feel heavyish.

35
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,060
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin."

36
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,380
"Think thin."

37
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,180
Better make it the 59th Street entrance.

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,980
Okay.

39
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,860
Soon as you get back, call my mother.

40
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,221
Remind her we have theatre tickets
for tonight.

41
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,021
Dinner at 21, 7:00.

42
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,101
I'll have had two martini's at the Oak Bar
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.

43
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:50,861
-She doesn't do that.
-Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.

44
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:54,541
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first for tomorrow.
The Skin Glow rehearsal's at noon.

45
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:56,461
Then lunch with Falcon and his wife.

46
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,021
-Where was that?
-Larry and Arnold's, 1 :00.

47
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:01,821
-Will you check in later?
-Absolutely not.

48
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,781
Here, Driver. Take this lady
back where she belongs.

49
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,781
-Right.
-That ought to cover it.

50
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,941
-Don't forget, call my mother right away.
-I won't.

51
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:13,621
-Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
-Good night.

52
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,261
Wait, Maggie! You can't call her.
She's at Mrs.--

53
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:42,021
Good evening, Mr. Thornhill.

54
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,421
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.

55
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,141
Yes, sir. Right this way.

56
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:47,901
Herman.

57
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,621
-Hello, Roger.
-I'm a little late.

58
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,381
Roger Thornhill. Fanning Nelson.

59
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,501
-We've gotten a head start here.
-That won't last long.

60
00:04:56,581 --> 00:05:00,821
I was saying that you may be slow
in starting, but there's nobody faster.

61
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,981
What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.

62
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:07,701
I told my secretary to call Mother and
I realized she won't be able to reach her.

63
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,661
Why not?

64
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,901
She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.

65
00:05:10,941 --> 00:05:12,581
-Your secretary?
-No. My mother.

66
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,541
Mr. Kaplan?

67
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,621
It's one of those new apartments,
wet paint and no telephone yet.

68
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:18,741
Perhaps if I send her a telegram.

69
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:20,101
Mr. George Kaplan?

70
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:20,981
Boy!

71
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,261
Kaplan.

72
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,781
I have to send a wire.

73
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,221
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?

74
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:34,261
I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me....

75
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,501
-Will you excuse me?
-Go right ahead.

76
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:41,741
-Right through there, sir.
-Thanks.

77
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:43,061
Thank you, sir.

78
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:46,941
What's that supposed to be?

79
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:50,381
The car is waiting outside.
You'll walk between us saying nothing.

80
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:52,661
-What are you talking about?
-Let's go.

81
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,261
Go where? Who....

82
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:55,781
Who are you?

83
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:57,981
Mere errand boys,
carrying concealed weapons.

84
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:01,821
His is pointed at your heart, so, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.

85
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,661
What is this? A joke or something?

86
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,061
Yes, a joke. We'll laugh in the car.

87
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,061
Come.

88
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,541
This is ridiculous.

89
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:31,661
Don't tell me where we're going.
Surprise me.

90
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,141
I left some friends
back there in the Oak Bar.

91
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:38,101
They'll think I'm awfully rude.

92
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,981
Could we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...

93
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,141
...so that I could explain
I'm being kidnapped?

94
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:47,702
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?

95
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:57,662
Locked.

96
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,582
TOWNSEND

97
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,502
Who's Townsend?

98
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:14,782
Really?

99
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:16,662
Interesting.

100
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,302
-Where is he?
-Upstairs, dressing.

101
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:03,822
-Tell him I'm here.
-The dinner guests are expected.

102
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:05,862
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan."

103
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:08,182
By the way,
what are we having for dessert?

104
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,862
-Is anyone in the library?
-No.

105
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:10,902
This way.

106
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,222
You will wait here.

107
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:26,142
Don't hurry. I'll catch up on my reading.

108
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:47,062
MR. LESTER TOWNSEND
169 BAYWOOD, GLEN COVE, N.Y.

109
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,542
Good evening.

110
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:33,022
Not what I expected. A little taller...

111
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:36,462
...a little more polished than the others.

112
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:40,142
I'm so glad you're pleased, Mr. Townsend.

113
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:42,502
But, I'm afraid, just as obvious.

114
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:46,702
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?

115
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:50,703
Games? Must we?

116
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:56,743
Not that I mind a slight case of abduction,
but I have tickets for the theatre tonight.

117
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:58,583
To a show I was looking forward to.

118
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:01,023
I get unreasonable about things like that.

119
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:05,063
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theatre.

120
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:09,423
Leonard, have you met
our distinguished guest?

121
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:13,023
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?

122
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:16,583
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.

123
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,743
Elusiveness, however misguided--

124
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:20,183
Wait a minute.

125
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:22,263
Did you call me "Kaplan"?

126
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:26,543
I know you're a man of many names,
but I'll accept your current choice.

127
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:27,863
Current choice?

128
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:31,423
My name is Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.

129
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:32,663
Of course.

130
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:37,183
Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.

131
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:38,983
Sit down, Mr. Kaplan.

132
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:42,143
I told you, I'm not Kaplan, whoever he is.

133
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:44,023
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

134
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:45,423
The guests are here, dear.

135
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:48,143
Look after them.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

136
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,383
Now, shall we get down to business?

137
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:53,503
I'm all for that.

138
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,903
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...

139
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:59,023
...and how you've come by
this information.

140
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:01,623
-I don't expect to get this for nothing.
-Of course not.

141
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,783
Don't misunderstand.

142
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,343
I don't expect you to fall in
with the suggestion...

143
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:09,623
...but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.

144
00:11:12,823 --> 00:11:14,703
What is that supposed to mean?

145
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:17,383
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?

146
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:18,543
I've told you--

147
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,223
We know where you're headed for.

148
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:23,543
I know where I'm headed.
The Winter Garden Theatre in New York.

149
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,703
And I think I'd better get going.

150
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,943
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.

151
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:39,823
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.

152
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:41,463
I'm not Kaplan!

153
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:43,103
I do wish you would reconsider.

154
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:47,023
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh
since Jason committed suicide.

155
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:50,623
What contact?
I've never been in Pittsburgh.

156
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,823
On June 16, you checked
into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...

157
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:57,263
...as Mr. George Kaplan
of Berkeley, California.

158
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:00,183
A week later, you registered
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...

159
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:02,623
...in Philadelphia
as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.

160
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,823
On August 11,
you stayed at the Statler in Boston.

161
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:08,783
On August 29, George Kaplan of Boston
registered at the Whittier in Detroit.

162
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,063
At present, you are registered
in Room 796...

163
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:14,583
...at the Plaza Hotel in New York
as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.

164
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:18,303
In two days, you are due
at the Ambassador East in Chicago.

165
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:22,143
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel
in Rapid City, South Dakota.

166
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:22,943
Not me!

167
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:25,983
There's no sense in maintaining
that you are deceiving us...

168
00:12:26,063 --> 00:12:28,063
...any more than we are deceiving you.

169
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:31,143
I suppose it wouldn't do any good
to show you ID cards...

170
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:33,023
...a driver's license, things like that?

171
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:34,943
They provide you with such good ones.

172
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:38,023
It's getting late. I have guests.

173
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,943
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

174
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:43,223
A simple no.

175
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:47,223
For the simple reason that I simply
don't know what you're talking about.

176
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,984
Give Mr. Kaplan a drink, Leonard.

177
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:54,824
A pleasant journey, sir.

178
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,184
Scotch? Rye?

179
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:08,984
Bourbon? Vodka?

180
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:11,784
Nothing. I'll take a quick ride
back to town.

181
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,464
That has been arranged.

182
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,864
But first, a libation.

183
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,064
Bourbon!

184
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:21,504
You drink it.
I've had enough stimulation for one day.

185
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:25,824
It'll be easier if you take this yourself.
Otherwise, we'll have to insist.

186
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:40,544
Cheers!

187
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:29,344
Don't worry about me. I'll take the bus.

188
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:15,625
Thanks for the lift.

189
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:18,425
I want this man examined for driving
while intoxicated.

190
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:19,505
Really?

191
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,745
You see, they tried to kill me.

192
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:23,545
He won't listen to me.

193
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,825
In a big house. They tried to kill me.

194
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:28,905
-All right. Let's just go inside.
-I don't want to go inside.

195
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:30,345
Somebody call the police.

196
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,945
Come on. Come on now.

197
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:33,745
Okay.

198
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:43,225
Sit down.

199
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:45,625
I don't want to sit.

200
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,785
Perfectly all right. See?

201
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:51,985
We'll get 'em. We'll throw the book
at them. Assault and kidnapping.

202
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,625
Assault with a gun and a bourbon
and a sports car.

203
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:55,665
We'll get 'em.

204
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:59,265
You'll be fine after a good night's sleep.
We got a nice cell all made up.

205
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:01,425
I don't want a cell. I want a policeman.

206
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:03,545
The car was just reported stolen.

207
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:06,785
A Mrs. Babson up on Twining Road.

208
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:09,585
I got to call someone. Where's the phone?

209
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,225
You're allowed one call.

210
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:12,785
Over here.

211
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:13,905
Thanks.

212
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,665
You better make it your lawyer.

213
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:19,265
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

214
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,425
What am l, a telephone operator?

215
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:23,185
Butterfield 8-1-0-9-8.

216
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:37,505
Just a minute, please.

217
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:39,105
-Here.
-Thank you.

218
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:42,665
Hello, Mother?

219
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,265
Mother, this is your son, Roger Thornhill.

220
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:50,545
Wait a minute, I'll find out.

221
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:52,465
Where am l?

222
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,465
Glen Cove Police Station.

223
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:57,145
Glen Cove Police Station.

224
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:01,346
No, Mother, I have not been drinking.

225
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:05,906
No, these two men, they poured
a whole bottle of bourbon into me.

226
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,346
No, they didn't give me a chaser.

227
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,506
Come on, let's go.

228
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,826
-Wait, I'm not finished yet.
-Yes, you are. Come on.

229
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:19,906
Mother, I got to go now.

230
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:22,906
Get my lawyer right away
and come and bail me out.

231
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,826
Tomorrow morning, tell her.

232
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:26,746
Tomorrow morning, he says.

233
00:19:28,026 --> 00:19:29,266
I don't know. I'll ask him.

234
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:31,026
She wants to know who says.

235
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:32,866
Sergeant Emil Klinger.

236
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:34,626
Sergeant Emil....

237
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,146
Emil?

238
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,466
Sergeant Emil Klinger.

239
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:43,026
No. I didn't believe it either.

240
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:47,226
I'm all right, Mother. Good night.

241
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,346
That was Mother.

242
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:55,106
Let's go.

243
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,186
Here's your man, Doctor.

244
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:07,346
What's your name?

245
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,066
Roger Thornhill.

246
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,306
Stick out your tongue and say: "ah."

247
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:12,866
You better move back.

248
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,226
Have you been drinking?

249
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:18,266
Doctor, I am gassed.

250
00:20:18,866 --> 00:20:20,146
What were you drinking?

251
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,306
Well, bourbon. See, these two fellas--

252
00:20:22,386 --> 00:20:24,946
-How much would you say you drank?
-What?

253
00:20:24,986 --> 00:20:28,106
-How much would you say you drank?
-About this much.

254
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:32,266
Mr. Thornhill, my opinion
is that you are definitely intoxicated.

255
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:33,506
No question about it.

256
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,666
I won't ask your permission to draw blood.

257
00:20:35,706 --> 00:20:36,706
How disgusting!

258
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,186
"You may refuse to permit a blood test
to be made...

259
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,666
"...but if you do,
your license will be revoked."

260
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:47,066
It was at this point
that Mr. Thornhill succeeded in escaping...

261
00:20:47,106 --> 00:20:50,066
...from his would-be assassins,
and when they gave chase...

262
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:54,066
...he, naturally, had to drive
as best he could under the circumstances.

263
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,826
How long have you known your client?

264
00:20:57,026 --> 00:20:58,386
Seven years, Your Honor.

265
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:00,506
Do you know him to be a reasonable man?

266
00:21:00,746 --> 00:21:01,986
Absolutely.

267
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:04,826
Mother!

268
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,866
Do you believe there is some credence
to this story?

269
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,186
Credence!

270
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:12,226
Yes, Your Honor. If my client says
this is what happened...

271
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:14,106
...I'm certain it must've happened.

272
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:15,026
Damn right.

273
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,306
I want this turned over
to the County Detectives for investigation.

274
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:21,546
Call them and have them
come here immediately.

275
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:22,666
Right, Your Honor.

276
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:27,306
Counselor, I'm going to set this over
for final disposition tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.

277
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:31,506
I expect you and the defendant to be here,
ready to go to trial.

278
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:35,546
In the meantime, the County Detectives'll
determine if his story has any basis in fact.

279
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:40,026
"Basis in fact"? lf I were brought in dead,
you still wouldn't believe--

280
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,026
Wait a minute.

281
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:43,866
After all, Your Honor,
would I make up such a story?

282
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:47,586
That is precisely what were intending
to find out, Mr. Thornhill.

283
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,267
Remember me?

284
00:22:07,387 --> 00:22:08,707
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

285
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:12,147
-Is Mr. Townsend at home?
-No, I'm sorry he's left for the day.

286
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:13,387
Mrs. Townsend?

287
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:16,947
-Who shall I say is calling?
-County Detectives.

288
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,427
Come in, please.

289
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:29,507
This way, please.

290
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:40,827
This is the room.

291
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:42,067
I'll call Madam.

292
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:43,067
You do that.

293
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:45,107
Here's the sofa where they held me down.

294
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:48,307
They spilled bourbon all over it.
I'll show you the stains.

295
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:52,947
Somebody must've cleaned them off.

296
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:55,627
This is the cabinet
where they keep the liquor.

297
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,267
Scotch, gin, vodka....

298
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:00,387
And bourbon.

299
00:23:02,787 --> 00:23:05,187
I remember when it used to come
in bottles.

300
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:12,507
Dear, we were so worried about you!

301
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:14,907
Did you get home all right?

302
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,027
Of course you did.

303
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:19,467
Let me look at you.
A little pink-eyed, but aren't we all?

304
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:22,107
It was a dull party.
You didn't miss a thing.

305
00:23:22,507 --> 00:23:26,227
I want you all to know,
I never saw this woman before last night.

306
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:29,307
Mrs. Townsend, I'm Capt. Junket
of the Nassau County Detectives.

307
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:30,547
This is Lt. Harding.

308
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:34,347
You haven't gotten into trouble, Roger?

309
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,827
-Stop calling me Roger.
-Has he gotten into trouble?

310
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:41,147
Mr. Thornhill was picked up last night
driving under the influence of alcohol...

311
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:42,987
...incidentally, in a stolen car...

312
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:43,987
Stolen car!

313
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:46,427
...belonging to Mrs. Babson
of Twining Road.

314
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:48,827
Roger, you said you were going
to call a cab.

315
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,187
You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes?

316
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:53,627
No, I didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes!

317
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:57,987
Mr. Thornhill has told us that he was
brought here against his will last night...

318
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:02,707
...and forcibly intoxicated by some friends
of your husband and set out on the road.

319
00:24:02,747 --> 00:24:04,707
Do you know anything about this?

320
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:08,507
Roger was a bit tipsy
when he arrived here by cab for dinner.

321
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:09,467
She's lying.

322
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:12,787
And I'm afraid he became even worse
as the evening wore on.

323
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,947
Finally, he told us he had to go home
to sleep it off.

324
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:18,427
I knew I should've served dinner earlier.

325
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:19,907
What a performance!

326
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:23,547
Mrs. Townsend, does the name
George Kaplan mean anything to you?

327
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:24,867
George Kaplan?

328
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,387
-No.
-I didn't think so.

329
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,027
Where's her husband?
He's the one you should be questioning.

330
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:32,787
Is there any place he can be reached?

331
00:24:32,827 --> 00:24:34,587
Yes. The United Nations.

332
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:39,387
He's addressing the General Assembly
this afternoon.

333
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:43,827
All right. So he's addressing
the General Assembly.

334
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,587
-Sorry we had to bother you.
-No bother at all.

335
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:51,267
Now, wait a minute.

336
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,547
Do you want to get in touch
with my husband, Captain?

337
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:01,827
No, Mrs. Townsend,
that won't be necessary.

338
00:25:01,907 --> 00:25:04,827
Do you mean you're not going
to do any more about this?

339
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:07,548
Pay the two dollars.

340
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,628
Goodbye.

341
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:53,308
-I don't see why you want me along.
-You lend a certain air of respectability.

342
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:55,068
Don't be sarcastic, Roger.

343
00:26:05,988 --> 00:26:08,388
There you are, dear. Park yourself there.

344
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:10,108
Well, here it goes.

345
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:12,188
Hello, Operator.

346
00:26:12,268 --> 00:26:14,748
Have you got a George Kaplan
staying here?

347
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:17,388
That's right.

348
00:26:18,068 --> 00:26:19,028
You have?

349
00:26:19,148 --> 00:26:20,388
Room 796.

350
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:23,068
Ring it, will you please?

351
00:26:23,388 --> 00:26:25,108
-You see?
-I see.

352
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:28,828
I hope he clears up this silly business.
You're ruining my whole day.

353
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:33,028
Did he leave word when he'd be back?

354
00:26:34,148 --> 00:26:35,228
Really?

355
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:36,628
Thank you.

356
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:40,628
That's odd. He hasn't answered
his telephone in two days.

357
00:26:40,708 --> 00:26:42,588
Maybe he got locked in the bathroom.

358
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:44,548
Mother, do me a favor, will you?

359
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:48,948
Put on that innocent look you do so well
and go to the desk and get the key to 796.

360
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,748
I wouldn't do such a thing!

361
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:53,028
-$10?
-Not for all the money in the world.

362
00:26:53,148 --> 00:26:55,468
-$50?
-Roger, you are disgraceful.

363
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:03,988
Car theft, drunk driving,
assaulting an officer, lying to a judge...

364
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:05,868
...and now, house-breaking.

365
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:09,108
-No, hotel-breaking. There's a difference.
-Of five to ten years.

366
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:10,468
Just a minute, please.

367
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:15,508
Will you be wanting me
to change your bedding, sir?

368
00:27:15,548 --> 00:27:17,468
Yes. Well, but not right now.

369
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:20,708
I mention it, because the bed
doesn't seem like it's been slept in...

370
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:23,708
...and I was wondering
if I ought to change the linens.

371
00:27:23,828 --> 00:27:25,588
Thank you for your interest.

372
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:28,028
Come on.

373
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:33,588
She seemed to think I'm Kaplan.

374
00:27:34,428 --> 00:27:36,308
I wonder if I look like Kaplan.

375
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:48,668
-Look who's here.
-Who? Where?

376
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:52,388
Our friend who's assembling
the General Assembly this afternoon.

377
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:54,588
Roger, I think we should go.

378
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:55,908
Don't be nervous.

379
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:59,868
-I'm not. I'll be late for the bridge club.
-Good. You'll lose less than usual.

380
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,909
Bulletin, Kaplan has dandruff.

381
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:18,869
In that case, I think we should leave.

382
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:20,029
Too late.

383
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,189
-You rang for me, sir?
-Yes. Come in for a moment.

384
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:31,349
-What's your name?
-Elsie, sir.

385
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:36,389
-Do you know who I am?
-You're Mr. Kaplan.

386
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:39,589
When did you first see me?

387
00:28:39,949 --> 00:28:40,989
Outside the door.

388
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:44,629
Out in the hall a couple of minutes ago.
Don't you remember?

389
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:46,789
Is that the first time you laid eyes on me?

390
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:49,189
Can I help it if you're never around,
Mr. Kaplan?

391
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,189
Then how do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

392
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:53,349
-What?
-How do you know I'm Mr. Kaplan?

393
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:54,789
Of course you are.

394
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:56,549
This is Room 796, isn't it?

395
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:59,549
So, you're the gentleman in Room 796,
aren't you?

396
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:01,949
All right, Elsie, thanks.

397
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:04,709
-Will that be all, sir?
-For the time being, yes.

398
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:11,349
Valet.

399
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:12,629
Yes, come in.

400
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:16,789
-Should I hang it in the closet, Mr. Kaplan?
-Yes, please.

401
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:23,909
Tell me....

402
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:26,469
What time did I give you that suit?

403
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,469
Last night. Around 6:00.

404
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,989
-Did I give it to you personally?
-Personally?

405
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:36,469
No. You called down on the phone
and described the suit to me.

406
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:39,709
Said it would be hanging in your closet.
Like you always do.

407
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,389
-Anything wrong?
-No, I'm just curious.

408
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,509
-Here. Thanks.
-Thank you.

409
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,749
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kaplan.

410
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,749
Isn't that the damnedest thing?

411
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:56,189
I'm beginning to think that no one
in the hotel has actually seen Kaplan.

412
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:59,149
Maybe he has his suits mended
by invisible weavers.

413
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,549
Let me see something.

414
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:15,069
I don't think that one does
anything for you.

415
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:21,509
Now, that's much better.

416
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:25,469
Obviously they've mistaken me
for a much shorter man.

417
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:31,469
-Should l?
-Certainly not.

418
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:34,549
Hold that.

419
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:41,509
It's good to find you in, Mr. Kaplan.

420
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:43,029
Who is this?

421
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:46,149
We met only last night and still
you do not recognize my voice.

422
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:48,069
I should feel offended.

423
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:51,389
Yes, I know who you are
and I'm not Mr. Kaplan.

424
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:55,189
Of course not. You answer his telephone,
you live in his hotel room...

425
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:57,349
...and yet you are not Mr. Kaplan.

426
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:00,029
Nevertheless,
we are pleased to find you in.

427
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,149
Now wait....

428
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:04,829
Operator?

429
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:08,669
Operator, this is Mr. Thorn....
Kaplan in 796.

430
00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:12,469
Where did that call come from?
From the outside or from the lobby?

431
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,910
-Just a minute. I'll see.
-Hurry, please.

432
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,910
Who was it?

433
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,270
One of the men
who tried to kill me last night.

434
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,910
We're back to that one, are we?

435
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,230
-That call was made from the lobby, sir.
-It was?

436
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,990
They're probably on their way up here.

437
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,470
-Let's get out of here.
-I think I'd like to meet these killers.

438
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,830
You gentlemen aren't really trying
to kill my son, are you?

439
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,070
Lobby, please. Watch your step.

440
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,190
Gentlemen, please. Ladies first.
Come along, ladies.

441
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,150
That's right. Come along. Good.

442
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,470
Roger, will you be home for dinner?

443
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,750
-Where to?
-I don't know. Just keep going.

444
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,550
-Take me to the United Nations.
-Right.

445
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,270
General Assembly Building.

446
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,310
Right.

447
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,190
-I'm being followed. Can you do anything?
-Yes, I can.

448
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,750
Do it.

449
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,230
-May I help you?
-Yes, please.

450
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,350
Where will I find Mr. Lester Townsend?

451
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,590
Mr. Lester Townsend of UNIPO?

452
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,150
Did you have an appointment, sir?

453
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,510
Well, yes. He expects me.

454
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,070
Your name, please?

455
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,710
-My name?
-Yes, please.

456
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,910
Kaplan. George Kaplan.

457
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,790
One moment, please.

458
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:20,511
Wait for me at the corner of 47th.

459
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:31,511
If you'd give this to one of the attendants
in the public lounge, she'll page him.

460
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,311
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome, Mr. Kaplan.

461
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:57,911
Page Mr. Lester Townsend, please?

462
00:34:57,991 --> 00:34:59,791
Certainly, Mr. Kaplan.

463
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,591
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

464
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:03,471
Mr. Townsend of UNIPO.

465
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:07,111
Please call at the communications desk
of the Public Lounge.

466
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:16,871
You paged me?

467
00:35:17,111 --> 00:35:18,431
-Mr. Kaplan?
-Yes.

468
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:21,551
You wanted to see Mr. Townsend.
This is Mr. Townsend.

469
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:23,391
How do you do, Mr. Kaplan?

470
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,551
This isn't Mr. Townsend.

471
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:26,911
Yes, it is.

472
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:30,311
There must be some mistake.
Mr. Lester Townsend?

473
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:32,791
That's me. What can I do for you?

474
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,591
Are you the Townsend
who lives in Glen Cove?

475
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,831
That's right. Are we neighbors?

476
00:35:41,751 --> 00:35:44,631
A large, red-brick house
with a curved, tree-lined driveway?

477
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:46,111
That's the one.

478
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,871
Were you at home last night?

479
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:50,671
-You mean in Glen Cove?
-Yes.

480
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:53,471
I've been staying in my apartment
in town for the last month.

481
00:35:53,511 --> 00:35:55,791
I always do when we're in session here.

482
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:57,231
What about Mrs. Townsend?

483
00:35:57,711 --> 00:36:00,071
My wife has been dead for many years.

484
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,231
Mr. Kaplan, what's this all about?

485
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:04,831
Who are those people living in your house?

486
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:07,271
What people?
The house is completely closed up.

487
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:10,551
There's just a gardener and his wife
living on the grounds.

488
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:13,151
Now, Mr. Kaplan, tell me who you are
and what you want.

489
00:36:18,111 --> 00:36:19,671
Do you know this man?

490
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:28,551
Look!

491
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:34,551
He's got a knife! Look out!

492
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:37,031
Listen to me.
I had nothing to do with this.

493
00:36:37,351 --> 00:36:39,671
-Call the police.
-Don't come any nearer!

494
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:40,751
Get back!

495
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:59,031
UNITED STATES INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

496
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:02,631
"The photograph has been identified
as that of Roger Thornhill...

497
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:07,271
"...a Manhattan advertising executive,
indicating that the name George Kaplan...

498
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:10,511
"...which he gave to an attendant
in the General Assembly Building...

499
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:11,791
"...was false.

500
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:15,991
"A possible motive for the slaying
was suggested by the discovery...

501
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:19,991
"...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared
in a Glen Cove police court...

502
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:23,032
"...charged with drunk driving
with a stolen car...

503
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:27,392
"...and in his defense he charged
that the murder victim, Mr. Townsend...

504
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:29,952
"...had tried to kill him the night before."

505
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:31,032
Brother!

506
00:37:31,312 --> 00:37:32,672
What about that?

507
00:37:33,472 --> 00:37:35,712
Does anyone know this Thornhill?

508
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:37,272
No, not me.

509
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:38,552
Never heard of him.

510
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:40,072
Professor?

511
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:43,672
Apparently, the poor sucker got mistaken
for George Kaplan.

512
00:37:44,072 --> 00:37:47,312
How could he be mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?

513
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,552
Don't ask me how it happened,
but obviously it happened.

514
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:54,272
Vandamm's men must have grabbed him
and tried to put him away...

515
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:56,272
...using Lester Townsend's house.

516
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,552
And the unsuspecting Townsend winds up
with a stray knife in his back.

517
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,152
C'est la guerre.

518
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:04,952
It's so horribly sad.
Why is it I feel like laughing?

519
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,672
What are we going to do?

520
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:07,592
Do?

521
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,592
About Mr. Thornhill?

522
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:12,632
We...do nothing!

523
00:38:13,712 --> 00:38:14,392
Nothing?

524
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,272
That's right. Nothing.

525
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:20,792
We could congratulate ourselves
on a marvelous stroke of good fortune.

526
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:25,912
Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan,
created to divert suspicion...

527
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:29,752
...from our actual agent,
has fortuitously become a live decoy.

528
00:38:29,832 --> 00:38:31,232
Yes, Professor.

529
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:33,592
How long do you think he'll stay alive?

530
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,072
That's his problem.

531
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:37,792
What Mrs. Finley means--

532
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:39,232
I know what she means.

533
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:42,392
We can't sit back calmly and wait to see
who kills him first!

534
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,352
Vandamm and company or the police?

535
00:38:45,632 --> 00:38:48,952
What can we do to save him
without endangering our own agent?

536
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:51,672
Aren't we being just a wee bit callous?

537
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,392
No, my dear woman,
we're not being callous.

538
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:58,792
We didn't invent our non-existent man
and give him the name of George Kaplan...

539
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:01,752
...establish elaborate behavior patterns
for him...

540
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:06,232
...move his prop belongings in and out
of hotel rooms, for our private amusement.

541
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:08,792
We created George Kaplan...

542
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:11,312
...and labored successfully
to convince Vandamm...

543
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:15,192
...that this was our agent hot on his trail
for a desperately important reason.

544
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:17,432
Nobody's denying that!

545
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:18,752
Very well, then.

546
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:23,152
If we make the slightest move to suggest
there's no such agent as George Kaplan...

547
00:39:23,232 --> 00:39:27,512
...give any hint to Vandamm he's pursuing
a decoy instead of our own agent...

548
00:39:27,552 --> 00:39:30,792
...then our agent, working right under
Vandamm's very nose...

549
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:33,912
...will immediately face suspicion,
exposure...

550
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:36,112
...and assassination.

551
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:39,152
Like the two others who went before.

552
00:39:39,432 --> 00:39:42,432
Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are.

553
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:52,872
Train number 25...

554
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,432
...the 20th Century Limited...

555
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:01,432
...due to leave in 6:00 p.m. for Chicago....

556
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:07,712
Yes, dear. I know.

557
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:11,152
Now, listen to me, Mother,
I called the Plaza.

558
00:40:11,552 --> 00:40:14,672
Kaplan checked out and went
to the Ambassador East in Chicago.

559
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:16,112
That's why I'm--

560
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,352
I can't go to the police. At least not yet.

561
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:22,152
You saw the newspapers.
My fingerprints are on the knife.

562
00:40:22,232 --> 00:40:25,193
I'm a car thief, a drunk driver,
and a murderer.

563
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:26,793
I wouldn't have a chance.

564
00:40:26,873 --> 00:40:31,353
I won't have, until I find George Kaplan
who obviously knows what this is about.

565
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,433
No, the train. It's safer.

566
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:37,873
Because there's no place to hide on a plane
if anyone should recognize me.

567
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:40,993
You want me to jump off a moving plane?

568
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,793
Well, thank you so much, Mother.
Goodbye.

569
00:40:58,113 --> 00:40:59,833
MANHUNT ON FOR U. N. KILLER

570
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:24,713
Give me a bedroom
on the 20th Century, please.

571
00:41:24,793 --> 00:41:26,273
It's leaving in five minutes.

572
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,033
I know. Will you make it snappy?

573
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,953
I think they're all sold out.

574
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:30,993
Sold out?

575
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:32,673
You can always go coach.

576
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,393
No, I can't do that.
What time is the next train?

577
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:38,313
Nothing till 10:00. You're in a hurry, huh?

578
00:41:38,993 --> 00:41:41,433
Could you call them
and see what they have?

579
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:43,073
Something wrong with your eyes?

580
00:41:43,153 --> 00:41:46,153
Yes, they're sensitive to questions.
Will you call them?

581
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:47,593
Sure. Sure.

582
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,593
Don't go away!

583
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:03,313
He's at Window 15, upper level. Hurry.

584
00:42:05,193 --> 00:42:06,873
You're in luck, mister.

585
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:16,313
-Ticket?
-I'm just seeing some friends off.

586
00:42:18,033 --> 00:42:19,513
I have to know their names.

587
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:21,673
Come here!

588
00:42:52,953 --> 00:42:53,753
I'm sorry.

589
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:55,513
-I'm sorry.
-My fault.

590
00:42:56,513 --> 00:42:57,473
Sorry.

591
00:43:06,673 --> 00:43:08,673
He went that way. I think he got off.

592
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:10,833
All aboard!

593
00:43:14,473 --> 00:43:16,673
-Thank you.
-Quite all right.

594
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:18,513
Seven parking tickets.

595
00:44:35,034 --> 00:44:37,154
-Good evening, sir. One?
-Please.

596
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:52,074
A cocktail before dinner?

597
00:44:52,154 --> 00:44:54,274
-Yes, please. A Gibson.
-Right away.

598
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:04,954
Here we are again.

599
00:45:05,754 --> 00:45:06,634
Yes.

600
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:09,834
You recommend anything?

601
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:13,434
The brook trout.
A little "trouty" but quite good.

602
00:45:14,274 --> 00:45:15,194
Sold.

603
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,554
"Brook...

604
00:45:18,794 --> 00:45:19,794
"...trout."

605
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:21,994
-There you are.
-Yes, sir.

606
00:45:33,794 --> 00:45:35,594
I know. I look vaguely familiar.

607
00:45:35,674 --> 00:45:36,554
Yes.

608
00:45:36,994 --> 00:45:39,274
You feel you've seen me
somewhere before.

609
00:45:41,074 --> 00:45:43,794
I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.

610
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:46,594
It's a nice face.

611
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:50,354
-You think so?
-I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

612
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:52,914
Oh, you're that type.

613
00:45:52,994 --> 00:45:54,034
What type?

614
00:45:54,394 --> 00:45:55,394
Honest.

615
00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:56,994
Not really.

616
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:59,994
Good. Because honest women
frighten me.

617
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:00,994
Why?

618
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:04,194
Somehow they seem to put me
at a disadvantage.

619
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:07,434
-Because you're not honest with them?
-Exactly.

620
00:46:07,674 --> 00:46:10,714
Like that business about
the seven parking tickets?

621
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:13,914
What I mean is,
the moment I meet an attractive woman...

622
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:18,634
...l have to start pretending I've no desire
to make love to her.

623
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:21,034
What makes you think
you have to conceal it?

624
00:46:21,674 --> 00:46:23,554
She might find the idea objectionable.

625
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:26,034
Then again, she might not.

626
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:31,555
Think how lucky I am
to have been seated here.

627
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:33,635
Luck had nothing to do with it.

628
00:46:34,195 --> 00:46:34,835
Fate?

629
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:40,475
I tipped the steward $5 to seat you here
if you should come in.

630
00:46:44,795 --> 00:46:46,035
Is that a proposition?

631
00:46:47,675 --> 00:46:49,835
I never discuss love on an empty stomach.

632
00:46:50,755 --> 00:46:51,955
You've already eaten.

633
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:53,715
But you haven't.

634
00:47:01,075 --> 00:47:03,195
Don't you think it's time
we were introduced?

635
00:47:03,635 --> 00:47:06,715
I'm Eve Kendall. I'm 26 and unmarried.

636
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,515
Now you know everything.

637
00:47:10,235 --> 00:47:13,755
What do you do besides lure men
to their doom on the 20th Century Limited?

638
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:15,715
I'm an industrial designer.

639
00:47:17,555 --> 00:47:18,635
Jack Phillips.

640
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:21,475
Western sales manager
for Kingby Electronics.

641
00:47:21,635 --> 00:47:23,915
No, you're not. You're Roger Thornhill...

642
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:25,635
...of Madison Avenue...

643
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:28,635
...and you're wanted for murder
on every front page in America.

644
00:47:29,035 --> 00:47:30,675
Don't be so modest.

645
00:47:33,635 --> 00:47:34,515
Don't worry.

646
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:37,035
-I won't say a word.
-How come?

647
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:39,635
I told you.

648
00:47:40,195 --> 00:47:41,195
It's a nice face.

649
00:47:41,715 --> 00:47:43,075
Is that the only reason?

650
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:45,115
It's going to be a long night.

651
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:47,555
True.

652
00:47:47,835 --> 00:47:50,195
I don't particularly like the book
I've started.

653
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,195
You know what I mean?

654
00:47:54,635 --> 00:47:55,995
Let me think.

655
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,435
I know exactly what you mean.

656
00:48:10,915 --> 00:48:12,315
R.O.T.

657
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:15,355
That's my trademark. R.O.T.

658
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:18,475
Roger O. Thornhill.
What does the "O" stand for?

659
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:20,635
Nothing.

660
00:48:43,035 --> 00:48:45,755
I'd invite you to my bedroom
if I had a bedroom.

661
00:48:46,315 --> 00:48:47,155
A roomette?

662
00:48:47,235 --> 00:48:48,675
Nothing, not even a ticket.

663
00:48:48,835 --> 00:48:52,395
I've been playing hide-and-seek
ever since the train left New York.

664
00:48:53,395 --> 00:48:54,595
How awkward for you.

665
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:55,715
Yes, isn't it?

666
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:56,955
No place to sleep.

667
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,515
I have a large drawing-room all to myself.

668
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:02,875
That doesn't seem quite fair.

669
00:49:04,035 --> 00:49:05,315
Drawing-room E.

670
00:49:06,115 --> 00:49:07,795
Car 3901 .

671
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:10,035
Such a nice number.

672
00:49:11,555 --> 00:49:13,315
It's easy to remember.

673
00:49:13,435 --> 00:49:14,835
3901 .

674
00:49:16,115 --> 00:49:16,915
See?

675
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:19,355
No luggage.

676
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:23,675
So?

677
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:26,875
You wouldn't happen to have
an extra pair of pajamas, would you?

678
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:28,195
Wouldn't l?

679
00:49:30,195 --> 00:49:32,355
I wouldn't order any dessert if I were you.

680
00:49:33,355 --> 00:49:34,475
I get the message.

681
00:49:35,356 --> 00:49:36,956
That isn't exactly what I meant.

682
00:49:37,636 --> 00:49:40,036
The train seems to be making
an unscheduled stop.

683
00:49:40,116 --> 00:49:43,516
I saw two men get out of a police car
as we pulled into the station.

684
00:49:44,196 --> 00:49:45,396
They weren't smiling.

685
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:09,476
You better go out
and tell those police to hurry.

686
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:11,076
Patience is a virtue.

687
00:50:11,196 --> 00:50:12,636
So is breathing.

688
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:14,196
Just lie still.

689
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:17,516
Have you got any olive oil?

690
00:50:17,596 --> 00:50:18,756
Olive oil?

691
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:21,836
I want to be packed in olive oil
if I'm going to be a sardine.

692
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:24,276
Come in.

693
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:28,156
-Who are you?
-State Police.

694
00:50:29,316 --> 00:50:30,756
Your name please?

695
00:50:30,796 --> 00:50:33,116
Eve Kendall. Is anything wrong?

696
00:50:33,276 --> 00:50:35,756
There was a man at your table tonight
in the dining car.

697
00:50:36,516 --> 00:50:37,436
Yes.

698
00:50:37,596 --> 00:50:39,036
Friend of yours?

699
00:50:39,556 --> 00:50:40,876
I never saw him before.

700
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:43,516
Is this the man?

701
00:50:44,956 --> 00:50:47,796
Yes, I think so.
It's not a very clear picture.

702
00:50:48,196 --> 00:50:51,116
It's a wire-photo.
We just got it from the New York police.

703
00:50:51,196 --> 00:50:52,036
Police?

704
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:53,396
He's wanted for murder.

705
00:50:54,636 --> 00:50:56,196
Good heavens, no!

706
00:50:56,676 --> 00:50:59,036
The steward said
you left the dining car together.

707
00:50:59,636 --> 00:51:03,076
We might have happened to leave
at the same time but not together.

708
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:05,316
What did you two talk about?

709
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:07,236
Talk about?

710
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:10,236
The waiter said you were getting along fine
with this Thornhill.

711
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:11,916
Is that his name? Thornhill?

712
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,516
He didn't tell you?

713
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:17,596
He didn't tell me anything.

714
00:51:17,796 --> 00:51:20,956
All we did was chat about
different kinds of food...

715
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:23,996
...train travel versus plane travel,
that sort of thing.

716
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:28,316
Rather innocuous, I must say,
considering he was a fugitive from justice.

717
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:29,876
Who did he kill?

718
00:51:29,996 --> 00:51:31,716
He didn't say where he was going?

719
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:33,636
No.

720
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:35,316
I assumed Chicago.

721
00:51:35,716 --> 00:51:37,676
Perhaps he got off when you got on?

722
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:40,996
If you happen to see him again, Miss...

723
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:42,356
Kendall.

724
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,156
...will you let us know?

725
00:51:44,756 --> 00:51:49,116
I'm going to bed and I'll lock my door.
I doubt if I'll see anybody else tonight.

726
00:51:49,316 --> 00:51:52,676
In case you do, we'll be in
the observation car at the rear of the train.

727
00:51:53,596 --> 00:51:55,076
It's comforting to know that.

728
00:51:56,556 --> 00:51:57,596
Good night.

729
00:51:59,556 --> 00:52:00,916
Still breathing?

730
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:03,196
Either hurry up or get me a snorkel.

731
00:52:04,196 --> 00:52:07,516
I'm looking for the can opener
I stole from the porter.

732
00:52:12,556 --> 00:52:13,916
Hello, there.

733
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:15,196
Hello.

734
00:52:27,196 --> 00:52:29,316
Tell me, why are you so good to me?

735
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:32,516
Shall I climb up and tell you why?

736
00:52:46,117 --> 00:52:47,517
I've been thinking...

737
00:52:48,157 --> 00:52:51,997
...it's not safe for you to roam Chicago
looking for this George Kaplan...

738
00:52:52,077 --> 00:52:54,037
...you've been telling me about.

739
00:52:54,477 --> 00:52:57,917
You'll be picked up by the police
the moment you show your face.

740
00:52:58,357 --> 00:52:59,957
It's such a nice face, too.

741
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:07,317
Don't you think it'd be a better idea
if you stayed in my hotel room...

742
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:11,237
...while I located him for you
and brought him to you?

743
00:53:12,037 --> 00:53:14,597
I can't let you get involved.
It's too dangerous.

744
00:53:15,677 --> 00:53:16,997
I'm a big girl.

745
00:53:18,317 --> 00:53:20,717
Yeah, and in all the right places, too.

746
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:28,397
You know, this is ridiculous.
You know that, don't you?

747
00:53:28,477 --> 00:53:29,357
Yes.

748
00:53:29,677 --> 00:53:31,637
I mean, we've hardly met.

749
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:32,997
That's right.

750
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:35,837
How do I know you aren't a murderer?

751
00:53:36,357 --> 00:53:37,557
You don't.

752
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:41,477
Maybe you're planning to murder me,
right here, tonight.

753
00:53:42,357 --> 00:53:43,437
Shall l?

754
00:53:44,677 --> 00:53:45,877
Please do.

755
00:54:05,877 --> 00:54:07,517
Beats flying, doesn't it?

756
00:54:09,877 --> 00:54:11,317
We should stop.

757
00:54:11,637 --> 00:54:12,917
Immediately.

758
00:54:13,477 --> 00:54:15,397
I ought to know more about you.

759
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:17,637
What more could you know?

760
00:54:20,397 --> 00:54:22,557
You're an advertising man,
that's all I know.

761
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:24,317
That's right.

762
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,957
The train's a little unsteady.

763
00:54:28,997 --> 00:54:30,197
Who isn't?

764
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:32,837
What else do you know?

765
00:54:34,157 --> 00:54:37,277
You've got taste in clothes, taste in food....

766
00:54:40,037 --> 00:54:42,797
And taste in women. I like your flavor.

767
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:52,997
You're very clever with words.

768
00:54:53,317 --> 00:54:55,877
You can probably make them
do anything for you.

769
00:54:56,997 --> 00:54:59,157
Sell people things they don't need...

770
00:54:59,317 --> 00:55:02,237
...make women who don't know you
fall in love with you.

771
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:07,197
I'm beginning to think I'm underpaid.

772
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,477
Look out.

773
00:55:32,637 --> 00:55:35,317
-Don't bother with the washroom.
-Yes, ma'am.

774
00:55:35,397 --> 00:55:38,197
By the way, I found this on the floor.
Does it belong to you?

775
00:55:38,277 --> 00:55:40,317
Yes, ma'am. I've been looking for it.

776
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:42,438
-I'll wait outside.
-Thank you.

777
00:55:58,798 --> 00:55:59,838
Thank you, Porter.

778
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:01,958
Thank you, ma'am. Good night now.

779
00:56:02,038 --> 00:56:03,238
Good night.

780
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:09,638
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

781
00:56:14,478 --> 00:56:15,558
The porter.

782
00:56:17,718 --> 00:56:18,918
So I see.

783
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:28,398
Where were we?

784
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,598
Here.

785
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:36,758
Nice of him to have opened the bed.

786
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:40,038
Only one bed.

787
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:44,558
That's a good omen, don't you think?

788
00:56:44,638 --> 00:56:45,798
Wonderful.

789
00:56:47,198 --> 00:56:48,958
Do you know what that means?

790
00:56:49,758 --> 00:56:50,998
What? Tell me.

791
00:56:52,038 --> 00:56:54,678
It means you'll sleep on the floor.

792
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:17,478
A message from the lady in 3901 .

793
00:57:22,558 --> 00:57:26,398
What do I do with him
in the morning? Eve.

794
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:02,158
-You keep walking. I'll catch up.
-Yes, ma'am.

795
00:58:03,718 --> 00:58:04,998
Anything to report?

796
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:07,758
Yes. I had a fine night's sleep.

797
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,838
I mean, have you seen the man
we're looking for?

798
00:58:11,518 --> 00:58:12,638
Mr. Thornycroft?

799
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:14,438
Thornhill.

800
00:58:16,078 --> 00:58:17,958
No, no. I'm awfully sorry.

801
00:58:18,478 --> 00:58:20,198
But good luck to you both.

802
00:58:24,598 --> 00:58:27,718
-How are we doing?
-I may collapse at any moment.

803
00:58:28,158 --> 00:58:30,878
Not yet. First we have to run the gauntlet.
Look.

804
00:58:36,518 --> 00:58:40,278
I'm accustomed to having a load on,
but what have you got in these bags?

805
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:42,798
-Bowling balls, naturally.
-Oh, naturally.

806
00:58:43,118 --> 00:58:45,078
Which one of these has my suit in it?

807
00:58:45,158 --> 00:58:47,439
The small one underneath your right arm.

808
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:49,839
Thanks. That ought to do the suit
a lot of good.

809
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,199
I'm sure Mr. Kaplan won't mind
a few wrinkles.

810
00:58:52,399 --> 00:58:54,879
Yeah, if he's still there. What time is it?

811
00:58:55,279 --> 00:58:56,319
9:10.

812
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:59,279
9:10! He may have left
his hotel room by now.

813
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,079
I'll call him for you as soon
as we get inside the station.

814
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:03,519
Thank you. I can do it.

815
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:06,439
A redcap in a phone booth?
Slightly suspicious.

816
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:10,439
All right. Do you know
what you'll tell him?

817
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:14,239
You want to see him right away.
Terribly urgent. Matter of life and death.

818
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,999
-No explanations.
-Right.

819
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,879
While I'm calling,
you can change your clothes.

820
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:22,279
Where do you propose I do that?
In Marshall Field's window?

821
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,559
I sort of had the men's room in mind.

822
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:26,079
Did you, now?

823
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,399
You're the smartest girl
I ever spent the night with on a train.

824
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:42,999
I think we made it.

825
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:47,839
Where did he go?

826
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:50,039
-Which way did he go?
-Where did he go?

827
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:53,039
I don't know. He took my clothes.
He went up that way.

828
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,440
What took you so long?

829
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,720
I have a big face. Small razor.
Tell me, did you get Kaplan?

830
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,680
Yes.

831
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,240
Fine. What did he say?

832
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,240
He'll see you but not at the hotel
under any circumstances.

833
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,560
-He'll see you on the outside.
-Where? When?

834
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,040
-I've got it all written down for you.
-Thanks.

835
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,480
Take the Greyhound Bus
that leaves Chicago...

836
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,320
...for Indianapolis at 2:00 and ask the driver
to let you off at Prairie Stop, Highway 41 .

837
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,280
Prairie Stop, Highway 41 . Good.

838
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,720
It's about an hour-and-a-half's drive
from Chicago.

839
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,040
Fine. I'll rent a car.

840
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:36,040
No car. Mr. Kaplan said bus.
He wants to be sure you're alone.

841
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,040
All right. What'll I do when I get there?

842
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,480
Just wait beside the road.
He'll be there at 3:30.

843
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,520
-How will I know him?
-He'll know you.

844
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,600
You made the Chicago papers, too.

845
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,440
Have you set your watch for Central time?

846
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,360
Yes, I did that. Thanks.

847
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,640
What's the matter?

848
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,440
Matter?

849
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,240
Yes, you seem.... I don't know.
You seem tense.

850
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,720
You better go before the police
run out of red caps.

851
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,120
We'll see each other again, won't we?

852
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,560
Sometime, I'm sure.

853
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,040
I never had a moment
to thank you properly.

854
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,320
-Please go.
-But where will I find you?

855
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,920
I've got to pick up my bags now.

856
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,280
Yes. These are the checks
for the large cases.

857
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,560
Wait a minute.

858
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,240
Please.

859
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,960
They're coming.
