1
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:28,140
Sometimes things happen in life
that turn everybody silent.

2
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,700
So silent that nobody dares 
to talk about it any more.

3
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,140
To no one. Not even themselves.

4
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,780
Not in their own head, not aloud,
not a fucking word.

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,700
Because everything has been lingering.
There deep in those fields, year after year.

6
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:55,180
But out of the blue it is all back.
Just like that, from one day to another.

7
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,580
It may be ever so long ago, there is always 
someone who digs it up again.

8
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,420
Whatever you do, and whatever you think,
one thing you can be sure of:

9
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,980
you're always fucked.

10
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,180
Now, tomorrow, next week and next
year, until the end of time.

11
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,790
Fucked.

12
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,620
What did I hear, man?

13
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,580
You don't want to sell us 
your cows any more?

14
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,820
That's a little late, huh.

15
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,180
You have no say in that any more.

16
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,580
You do what we tell you.

17
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,140
You use our products
when we say so.

18
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,180
You bring your animals to my uncle
when we say so.

19
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,790
Mate, you're lucky that your father
used to know my father.

20
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,420
When I get home ...

21
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,510
I want to hear that you have
called Uncle Eddy.

22
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,700
Do you understand that?

23
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,780
Do you understand that?

24
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,220
You sell your bulls only to him
and at his price.

25
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,590
Marc. Léon.

26
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,700
Which one is it?
- That white one.

27
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,100
Yes, open it.

28
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,830
Yes, that's ok.

29
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Put that one in my trunk
and the rest in the truck. And quickly.

30
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,030
Come on, guys,
the rest in the truck.

31
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,820
Diederik, call me.

32
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,350
De Kuyper Marc...

33
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,140
can't answer your call.

34
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Hey, grandma.

35
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,500
Grandma is going to get you.

36
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,950
Come inside with grandma.

37
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,820
Hi, Jacky.

38
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,710
Hi, bro.

39
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,140
New wheels?
- Not bad, huh?

40
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,940
They look expensive.
- No.

41
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,580
A bargain.

42
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,500
How much?
- Six hundred.

43
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,220
Where did you get them?
- At David's.

44
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,620
David?
- David, David, that Walloon from Waremme.

45
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,780
Everything all right, mate?
- Yes, yes.

46
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,140
What happened?
- Football, huh

47
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,790
Why is he wearing a suit?

48
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,470
It looks chic, right.

49
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,660
I can pay it, eh. Voilà.

50
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,820
That's it, androstenedione?

51
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,260
It disappears completely
half an hour after you've injected it.

52
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,900
No trace, nothing.

53
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,150
Animals fattened up in eight weeks
instead of ten, and ten percent more fat.

54
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,980
Making big money.
- That's good.

55
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,420
Even in the Hormonic States of America
they don't know that.

56
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,700
Say, that Uncle Eddy ...
- He will come to here.

57
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,380
Yes, I'll call you back later. See you, huh.

58
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,150
Here, see.
- Eddy.

59
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,140
Are you going to the moon or what?
- Eddy, everything all right?

60
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,700
Stieve. Jacky.
The slaughterhouse is once again packed.

61
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,220
Sam wants to propose something to you.
- Tell it.

62
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,220
A former business partner of mine
from West-Flanders told me ...

63
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,140
that a client of his, Marc De Kuyper,
is looking for a new supply channel.

64
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,230
But I can't deal with it alone,
so I'm looking for support.

65
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,180
What do these people from West Flanders
suddenly see in us?

66
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,620
Limburg is far away.
Just West Flanders isn't right either.

67
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,710
Jackie, what do you think?
- We can always go and talk.

68
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,020
Let me know when, Sam.

69
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,100
That's okay.

70
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,220
And?

71
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,380
Go ahead, those Walloons don't 
understand a thing we say.

72
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,740
Not simple, Richter. Daems shot back.
I had to put five bullets in it.

73
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,100
Where are the toilets?

74
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,510
Where are the toilets?
- There in the corner.

75
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,750
Say are those the original wheels?
- We have stolen it like that.

76
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,830
Those are the original wheels.
Right, David?

77
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,100
David? That we stole it like that.
- Yes, yes, we have stolen it that way.

78
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,500
That's the rest: 1,500 euros.

79
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,620
Listen well, friends. This car
must disappear. No hassle.

80
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,980
Dis-Ap-Pear.

81
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,860
Yes, yes, I understand.
Disappear.

82
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,820
Let's go, we're gone.

83
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,300
Chef?. You forgot your box.
- No. That's a gift. From my boss.

84
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,710
Christian?
- What is that crap?

85
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,940
A steak?
- Christian?

86
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,500
What?

87
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,030
A hole.
- They can lick my arse.

88
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,060
Here, it's a bullet hole. Here.
- What?

89
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,460
That's a bullet hole.

90
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,700
You're right. That's a bullet hole.
- Yes, I'm right. That's ...

91
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,420
a bullet hole.

92
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,060
Top detective and hormone hunter
Gilbert Daems ...

93
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,180
was found murdered last night.

94
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,780
Daems was slain by
several bullets.

95
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,300
His car was cornered 
by a stranger near his home.

96
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,780
Jacky?
- Yes?

97
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,140
Where are you?
- Here.

98
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,830
Phone for you. Get off that ladder.

99
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,780
What is it?
- It's Uncle Eddy.

100
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,660
Yes.
- Quick, turn on the TV.

101
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,460
On the news.

102
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,300
Well, now there is talk of 
Daems himself shooting back.

103
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,180
No trace of the perpetrators,
but everyone agrees ...

104
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,660
they must be sought
amongst the hormone Mafia.

105
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,420
David? David?
- I'm here.

106
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,980
Daems, that's him. I know it for sure.
They have killed a cop.

107
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
How do you know?

108
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,340
You think it's the first time
I've worked for these Flemish butchers?

109
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,980
I didn't know that.
- You never know anything.

110
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,230
Mafia. Supporters of 't Vlaams Gezang.
All fascists.

111
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,940
Let them be damned, those dirty Flemings.

112
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,060
How can you know for sure?
- Don't you get anything?

113
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,990
The night of the murder
two Flemings arrive here ...

114
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,670
in a car with a bullet hole.

115
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,540
Even if I'm wrong, no risks.
Certainly not for those Flemish bastards.

116
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,380
Watch your steak.

117
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,500
What are we going to do?
- What we are going to do?

118
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,340
We're going to dump that car. We have
nothing to do with their affairs.

119
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,420
Let it disappear? My ass.

120
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,460
Ikske seen nothing, Ikske done nothing.
- Ikske what?

121
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,660
Don't bother. It's Flemish.
You know?

122
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,540
We dump that car in their town
and wash our hands of innocence.

123
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,020
Wait, wait, wait.
They are going to find that car.

124
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,500
Think about it, that's the idea.
A car found, nothing special.

125
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Nobody will think of a murder.

126
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,620
We have a problem.
- What problem?

127
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,020
The tires.
- What tires?

128
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,660
The original tires.

129
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,070
Ah yes, shit.
- Yeah, shit.

130
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,750
You just have to think about it, eh?

131
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,100
When they find out that
it's not the original tires...

132
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,700
I say it:
We should dump it into the canal.

133
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,540
That can't hurt.
- That can't hurt. Are you crazy?

134
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,180
Driving 30 km and risking someone
seeing us dump the car into the canal.

135
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,590
We're going to get them back.

136
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,980
We're going to get them back.

137
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,140
See, with a little effort ...
- What?

138
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,020
Your steak burns.

139
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,260
You'll see.
The front does not match the back.

140
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,260
This is a disaster, huh, kid.

141
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,780
Look, look, he's there.
- Marc.

142
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,540
He's there. You see it well, huh.

143
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,900
Hello.
- Marc.

144
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,060
See that? He's still not getting away.

145
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,950
You help me with a Limburg connection.

146
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,630
Limburg ...

147
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,220
You can sit at the table, but mouth shut.
Look carefully, listen carefully.

148
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,580
See that?
That isn't right again, eh.

149
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,860
Guys see him jump.
There you have it.

150
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,790
Who is it?
- Sam Raymond, a veterinarian ...

151
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,470
and a contact of him from Limburg.

152
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,740
What's his name again?
- Jacky. Jacky Vanmarsenille.

153
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,820
Jacky?

154
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,140
Vanmarsenille?

155
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,220
Marc, are you OK?
- Yes, everything OK.

156
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,540
Jacky Vanmarsenille. Leon.

157
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,900
Sam Raymond.
- Diederik.

158
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,620
Let's go eat.

159
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,820
Yes, Limburg ...

160
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,500
I've been there many times.

161
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,900
Chaussée d'amour, surely?

162
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,260
Chaussée d'amour. Do you know that?

163
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,860
Chaussée d'amour, you know that?

164
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,700
Hearsay.
- He will be familiar with it.

165
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,740
It's fun there, man. That's one
whorehouse next to the other.

166
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,780
Everyone drives thirty there.
No speed cameras there, I bet.

167
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,940
A stake in your pants, yeah.

168
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,470
What is the matter with him?
- I don't know.

169
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,460
Hold on.

170
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,740
Some-thing's not right.

171
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,860
You should not worry so much.
I'll take care of it. Just hurry up.

172
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,100
I'll call you later, okay?

173
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,790
My brother.

174
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,180
You go look.

175
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,910
Come on, mate, go take a look.

176
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,780
Jack.

177
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,030
I do not know you.

178
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,620
You know what bothers me?

179
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,980
They have destroyed that Daems.

180
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,660
Nobody makes a problem of that.

181
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,180
We can no longer work
like we should.

182
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,500
True or not?

183
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,740
Maybe they keep an eye on us.
You, me, here, now.

184
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,220
What then?

185
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,100
Nobody keeps an eye on me.

186
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,180
I keep an eye on you.

187
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,260
Then we can talk.

188
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,820
I swear, I actually thought 
for a moment it would go wrong.

189
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,780
But then ... beautifully played, Jacky.

190
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,140
"I keep an eye on you."

191
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,300
We should celebrate this.
I know how we will celebrate this.

192
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,420
Drop me off at home first.
- You can really be a spoilsport.

193
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,460
Allee, hup.

194
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,540
Jacky, come on.

195
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,990
Come on.

196
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,420
What's the problem, kid? I'll pay.

197
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,060
Hey, it is along here, huh.
- Yes ...

198
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,150
I will tell you in a moment where it is.

199
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,260
Allee.

200
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,950
Okay, okay. Just go, partner.

201
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,420
I will do yours also.
But at your expense.

202
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,180
Run, Jacky, run. Run.

203
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
You can run well.

204
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,700
Did you watch Merlina yesterday?

205
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,420
Go on.

206
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,580
Jean, I'm coming.

207
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,780
Allee, Stieve.

208
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
They're going to teach me how to inject.
- Cool.

209
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,060
Stieve, be careful with those syringes.

210
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Hi, pretty boy.
Come here, you.

211
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,300
Why did God invent hot water?

212
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,900
Bah, that tastes like coffee.
- Go give your brother some help.

213
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,350
Are they getting injected again?
- Yes, we must strengthen them.

214
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,140
Right, Renaat?
- Yes, yes, certainly.

215
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,980
What's in those bottles, is called DES.
Diethylstilbestrol.

216
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,020
DES?
- DES, yes.

217
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,710
Growth hormone, eh.

218
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,580
Because everything in the body,
is regulated by various substances.

219
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,940
And hormones are the most important.

220
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,740
Sometimes we have to give nature
a helping hand.

221
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,940
Like methanol, in the mopeds.
- Well done, lad.

222
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,420
Try to pay attention to the syringes.

223
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:42,340
Jean? From now on always use new ones.
To avoid infections.

224
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,580
Inject it in the arse or between the hooves.

225
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,300
Gendarmes.

226
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,780
What are those gendarmes doing here?
- Wait a little.

227
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,620
Come.

228
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,340
I'll be back soon. Be good.
Don't touch anything.

229
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,470
Yes.

230
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,660
What are they doing out here?

231
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,340
Getting products for the animals.
I don't know.

232
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,740
At a truck company?

233
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,740
Methanol, methadone, hormones ...
All the same, sure.

234
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,830
Look at that.

235
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,700
I fancy her.
- Your French isn't good enough.

236
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,140
Oh, Jacky, I love you.
I have big boobs. Oh, yes ...

237
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,820
Hey. You're laughing with my sister?
- We don't speak good French.

238
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,860
Laughing with my sister?
Do you want to fuck her?

239
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,860
Bruno, let it go.
- Want to fuck my sister?

240
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,260
Bruno, stop it.

241
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,790
Want to fuck?
- What is that?

242
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,020
Have sex.
You know what that is, sex?

243
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,630
So.
- Enough. Stop it.

244
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,790
What are you laughing at? Laughing at me?
Looking for a fight?

245
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,660
Want to fuck? Wait.
- Stop it.

246
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,580
Shut up.

247
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,460
5,000 francs, and you can fuck Lucia.
- Let me go.

248
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,820
Want to fuck?
- You're hurting me.

249
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,540
Shut up. Fuck him.
How much do you give to fuck her?

250
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,180
Do you want to come into my sister?

251
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,460
It is your contact.
If that Italian doesn't pay ...

252
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,420
Listen ...
- You are going to listen.

253
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,860
No money, no merchandise.
Clear? Do not play with my balls.

254
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,260
Bruno, have you done what
I asked you?

255
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,900
Then go.
Another one who plays with my balls.

256
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,500
Jacky. What did I say:
don't touch anything. Allee, come.

257
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,270
In the car.

258
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,140
Just pay attention, those chicks.

259
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,740
Tits, their rules
and god knows what else. Already, eh.

260
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,270
And then?

261
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,580
And then we ... We have to wait
until we can shoot, eh.

262
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,940
Shoot?

263
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,030
We must wait, that's all.

264
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,220
Let's go one more time. The last.

265
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,140
We have been so many times already.
The eleventh time she won't be there either.

266
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,260
I'll buy you an ice cream. With four scoops.

267
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,420
And whipped cream?

268
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,900
Diederik?

269
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,030
Yes, Jacky.

270
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,790
Where were you now?
- I had to pee.

271
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,020
It does not matter. I have seen something.
Come see. Duck.

272
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,470
What did you see?

273
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,950
Come, come.

274
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,420
Come on.

275
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:57,340
Let me go, you're crazy.
- Bitch, behave.

276
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,980
Who wants a new one?
Want a new one? Here.

277
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,220
And you?
- Me too.

278
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,310
What are they doing?
- I don't know.

279
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,660
Are those sex magazines?
- I think so.

280
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,980
Turn around.

281
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,020
Look there. Don't look, huh.
Hey, don't look.

282
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,980
Watch him go.

283
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,300
Invasion of the enemy. Attack.

284
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,260
I'll beat you up.

285
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,660
I've got one of those little bastards.

286
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,580
You're a little bastard,
I got you.

287
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,940
And we're going to fuck you over.

288
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,220
Grab his arm.
And pick up a stone also.

289
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,980
Asshole. We will crush your balls.
Grab his leg. Give me a stone.

290
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,340
I'm going to knock your balls.

291
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Asshole. Asshole.
(Literal translation Ballsack. Ballsack.)

292
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,180
You're crazy.

293
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,740
Shit.
- I didn't think he would do it.

294
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,660
Asshole.

295
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,940
Hi, Rikkie.
Well? Are you hiding?

296
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,740
Let's go fuck.
- Are you crazy?

297
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,350
Crazy? No, I'm horny.

298
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,350
Come to the hotel. Or do you want 
Mustafa of cell 12 in your ass later on?

299
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,060
Does it have to be like this every time?
- We're lovers and lovers fuck.

300
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,980
OK, what was that at the Hippodrome?

301
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,670
Just a meeting.
- Jacky Vanmarsenille.

302
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,260
Sam Raymond. At the Hippodrome.
With De Kuyper.

303
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,380
Do you think we don't know
Vanmarsenille?

304
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,460
That has nothing to do with Daems.

305
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,390
Every day brings more evidence ...

306
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,140
that at the least De Kuyper is
the instigator of the murder.

307
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:22,470
But of those clues suspiciously
few come from you.

308
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,420
I'm waiting. Jacky Vanmarsenille.
- I don't know those men.

309
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,110
They come from fucking Limburg.

310
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,340
Coincidence or what?
- Yes. Coincidence.

311
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,180
Coincidence does not exist, Maes.

312
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,420
Coincidence is for dumb guys.
Stupidities, those exist.

313
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,750
Coincidence is used by dumb guys
if they don't know what else to say.

314
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,180
He just came for business. That's what 
he came for. Business. That's it.

315
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,660
Meat, meat, meat. That's all.

316
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,580
That's what we are working on. So, yes, 
no coincidence, if you look at it like that.

317
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,780
Okay, listen up.

318
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,620
That order has to come from your corner.

319
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,260
Diederik.

320
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,660
You're going to help us ...

321
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,220
otherwise it is accessory to murder.

322
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,740
You don't think ...
I can't believe it.

323
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,220
Can we trust you, Diederik?

324
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,860
Trust?

325
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:25,500
You'll have to, right?
- I'm not supposed to share this with an informant.

326
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,260
But they have seen a BMW drive away
shortly after the murder.

327
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,140
Such a big one, 5-series.

328
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,060
Can you help us, Diederik?

329
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,980
I'll see what I can do.

330
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,060
Antony, wait.

331
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,230
Would you ... Would you sometime ...

332
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,700
want to have something to drink with me?

333
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,060
I mean, if all this is over?

334
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:13,020
The sooner this here is resolved,
the better, Diederik.

335
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,460
Okay. Okay, then.

336
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,060
A BMW 5. I'm going to check.
I promise.

337
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,460
And? Are you ready?
- Almost.

338
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,380
Move away, so I can see something.
- Wait.

339
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,070
Make room.

340
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,900
Nice work,
no more bullet hole in sight.

341
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,340
David, what have you done?
- Got them back.

342
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,020
What tires did you give then?
- To Stieve? None.

343
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,630
We'll give him new ones.

344
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,140
New ones? Did you win the lottery or something?
Who will pay for those?

345
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,420
We'll give him back the old ones
and when we got rid of that car ...

346
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,260
we'll search for others.

347
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:10,020
On those tires are traces of
the murder location.

348
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,180
Do you think you're a cop?
They'll never look at Vanmarsenille.

349
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,940
It's better to spread everything.
- OK, we'll spread everything.

350
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,110
Stieve.

351
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,030
Stieve.

352
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,860
What now?
- Where are your tires?

353
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,030
David came to get them back.
- What do you mean, get back?

354
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,740
Something about a manufacturing defect.
He'll bring others.

355
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,660
David-David?
- Yes, yes ...

356
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,590
That guy only sells manufacturing defects.

357
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,300
Didn't you get spare tires?
- No, you can see that.

358
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,550
Stieve, buy your tires in a
tire shop.

359
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,220
I only have two hands.
I have put the men to work.

360
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,660
Say something to David
instead of always chewing on me.

361
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,350
Those were chic tires.

362
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,780
Call me back later. Yes, see you later.

363
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,420
How was the horse race?
- Good.

364
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,700
Were you able to arrange something?
- It looks like that, yes.

365
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,180
All the better then.
- Something is not right.

366
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,140
What's wrong?
- De Kuyper ...

367
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,180
Wait, one minute. Wait.
Hold on. My phone's ringing just now.

368
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,670
Yes. Yes, that's about the raffle.
You were supposed to do that, eh.

369
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,340
The most important now is, Irene ...

370
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,500
that he can develop 
secondary sexual characteristics.

371
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,020
What is that?
- The male sex characteristics.

372
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:19,460
get a beard, have more body here,
stronger muscles, a deeper voice ...

373
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,470
penis development for erections.
He has to become a man.

374
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,020
And ejaculations.

375
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,780
It is possible he'll 'be able'.

376
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,500
But then you definitely will have to
treat him with testosterone, otherwise ...

377
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,620
That will be it, that they'll
shoot up my little guy with that.

378
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:41,140
But Jacky has no testicles any more.
So in his teenage years we'll have to ...

379
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:47,660
give him the necessary extra testosterone
so that he can develop sufficiently.

380
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,750
You must do that,
otherwise he'll never be a man.

381
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,660
Ask it now.
- Yes ... You ask it.

382
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,830
Irene, go on. We are adults.
Ask what you want to ask.

383
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,820
Will he be gay now?

384
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,180
Diederik is the only one
who can testify against that ass-hole.

385
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,270
No, no. Jean, listen to me.

386
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,110
If Diederik testifies against
Schepers' son ...

387
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:35,460
Schepers snaps his fingers
and we are done. You and me too.

388
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,380
Would you like to start world war three
against such a Mafia figure?

389
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,780
I don't want to go to jail, Jean.
Schepers knows much too much about us.

390
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,380
The prison, that's what awaits us.
And then Jackie will be all by himself as well.

391
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,470
Do you know who the real criminal is here?

392
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,020
You, coward.

393
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,180
Jacky, come.

394
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,740
I wasn't allowed to talk by my dad.

395
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,190
Get lost. If you can't do anything,
go to hell.

396
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,220
It is Okay, kid.

397
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,380
Diederik. Why are you here? Huh?

398
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,740
Well?

399
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:11,060
There he goes. Ask him
whether it was an accident.

400
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,430
Wait. It wasn't an accident.

401
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,540
Stay here, eh, Jacky.

402
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,660
Hey.

403
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,180
Remember me?
- What?

404
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:01,500
Come on. You know that boy?
- I don't understand you.

405
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,340
You know him, eh?

406
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,420
Come look what you've done.

407
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,100
On your knees. On your knees.
- Let me go.

408
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,780
Look what you did.

409
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,420
Stop it, you.
What's the matter? Huh?

410
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,620
I'll kill him.
- You do nothing.

411
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,220
Don't you see that he's disturbed.
It was an accident.

412
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,910
An accident?
- Yes, it was an accident.

413
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,300
Get out of here. Go away.

414
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,140
Away.

415
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,900
Good day, sir. Can I help you?
- Good day.

416
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:19,430
Aftershave, please.
- Certainly. Do you have a favourite brand?

417
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,990
No.
- Then we'll try a few.

418
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,100
Follow me?

419
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:34,260
So. This is something special,
a hint of iris, slightly powdery.

420
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,620
This is seen typically in
women's fragrances.

421
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:41,780
Otherwise we have this,
our most masculine fragrance.

422
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,380
The slight smell of wood.
It's a classic. Very popular.

423
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,500
And this is my personal favourite.

424
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:55,700
Sporty, slightly lemony,
fresh, young ... For the active man.

425
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,980
It's hard to choose, eh.

426
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,820
I know what we're going to do.

427
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:10,220
I'll give you some samples, all right.
You try them at home at ease.

428
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,550
It is important to feel good,
not only smell good.

429
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,710
If you have chosen,
you'll simply return.

430
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,460
I'll take this.
- A cologne.

431
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,740
Why not?
- For my mom.

432
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:30,140
Of course. What a spoiled mama.
Follow me to the checkout?

433
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,420
Voilà. 28 euros, sir.
- Here you are.

434
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,340
Thank you.

435
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,980
There.

436
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,670
Do you already have a loyalty card?

437
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,940
No.
- May I have your details?

438
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,740
Jacky.

439
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,380
Vanmarsenille.

440
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:08,060
Steenweg, Heers.
- Heers?

441
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,020
The other side of the linguistic border?
My mother lives near there.

442
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,030
I will keep them, right? Well.

443
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,540
So, good day, sir. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

444
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,900
It's off.
- What are you saying?

445
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,140
Why?
- Just so. Some thing's not right.

446
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,380
Okay, De Kuyper has a reputation ...

447
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,900
but you said it yourself:
We need him.

448
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,780
This is an opportunity.

449
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,460
De Kuyper has a fucked up head.
He scores his own shit.

450
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,860
Be inconspicuous, that's what we need now.

451
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,420
Wait until they've got Daems' killer
and see who remains. True or not?

452
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,870
We're fine.

453
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,460
We do not fuck this up by working 
with a circus monkey from the polders.

454
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:20,870
You seriously blow this up. You act
like De Kuyper whacked him.

455
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,500
Call it off.
- Call it off?

456
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,860
Come on, eh, stay calm. Let's
just get something to drink later.

457
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,540
What did you spray yourself with?

458
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,900
Sam Raymond.

459
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,860
11:37.
Leaves the Vanmarsenille farm.

460
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,380
Antony.
- Hey, man.

461
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,740
I already thought, Eva is not here,
it must be something special.

462
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,780
Not everything has to be according to the book.
- That's what I think also.

463
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,420
We're not by the book either, huh.

464
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:28,860
I'll get straight to the point, Rikkie.
I'd like to see you again, but afterwards.

465
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,380
We need to separate business from ...
- From personal? Of course, man. Shoot.

466
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,260
Sit down.

467
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:45,060
You hold back things from us.
- I? Not at all.

468
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,510
No bullshit. I am warning you, don't.

469
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,140
I mean it. I am a cop,
I figure things out, that's my nature.

470
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,470
I get you. I feel you. I smell you.

471
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,620
And I sense that something is not right.

472
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,950
At that time Jacky's dad informed
against your dad to the court.

473
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,900
At that time, few resources
and little political interest.

474
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:11,660
And suddenly Dad Vanmarsenille comes
with a case, ideal for press and morality.

475
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,830
Vanmarsenille free from persecution,
your dad into jail.

476
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,900
And yet they were good friends.

477
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,910
And now that Jacky suddenly pops up
in your entourage.

478
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:28,020
Diederik, this feels wrong.
- Jacky has nothing to do with this.

479
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,220
We knew each other, 20 years ago.

480
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:37,900
When we were little, shit has happened
with Jacky and me, heavy shit.

481
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,660
Pedophilia or what?
- No, man.

482
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,900
Look, what his dad did,
I would have done as well.

483
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,940
Set your father up?
- My father?

484
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,590
My father is a coward.
Was a coward.

485
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,500
He made me keep quiet.
And then himself.

486
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,780
I gotta go.
- Me too.

487
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,380
An appointment with your primary suspect.

488
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,110
Diederik, give us that one thing.

489
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,900
Do it for yourself.

490
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,260
And for us.

491
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,910
The zoo had to close because of GAIA ...

492
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,460
and I as a veterinarian
had to kill those animals.

493
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,420
Instead of bringing them to the 
meat plant, I sold them.

494
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,620
Restaurants.

495
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,340
That month, all Congolese from
Matonge in Brussels ate monkeys ... 

496
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:52,740
from the zoo in Limburg.
And snakes and all that shit.

497
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:57,460
Dinner's ready. Pork Roast,
croquettes and vegetables.

498
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:12,500
And, Richter? What do you do for a living?

499
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,660
Ask and I deliver it.
My product is called networking.

500
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,590
Very important. Very important.

501
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,940
That's also more or less the reason
why we are here together.

502
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:29,860
Some networks
can sometimes break down.

503
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:34,030
Especially the pharmaceutical,
if you know what I mean.

504
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,750
The court found hormones in my meat
which led to Pharmakin.

505
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,940
What did Pharmakin do? Drop us.

506
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,380
I need not draw it all out,
a deal with the cops.

507
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,780
They said:
We make sure that he gets caught.

508
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,020
What can you do in such a case?

509
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:59,140
Dare to be faster than them. Harder.
- Ensure that they are afraid of you.

510
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,460
So they no longer rattle with my balls.

511
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,790
They will know by now, 
we're not to be trifled with.

512
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,870
Anyway ...

513
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:22,540
We will now be more concerned
with the smaller supply channels.

514
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,660
Small is beautiful, as we say here.

515
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,430
We need to fill the hole.
No other way.

516
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,230
And you will be our new supplier.

517
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:36,180
Diederik, you're gonna help him.
And Richter provides the contacts.

518
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,340
What? Isn't it okay?

519
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:44,420
Yes, yes, of course.
I did not expect it, that's all.

520
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:50,940
I drive back to Limburg tonight.
Why don't you come with me?

521
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:55,860
Then you can see the Vanmarsenilles again.
If we have to develop a network anyway.

522
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:01,220
I think that's a good idea of Sam.

523
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,940
The Vanmarsenilles.

524
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,660
That's good.

525
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:56,740
Excuse me, sir.
You must wear a shirt.

526
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,780
I don't have a shirt.
- Patrick.

527
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,860
Hello, friend.
- Good day.

528
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,420
Do you know anyone here?
- No. And you?

529
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,580
I am the owner.

530
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:15,070
You're a Fleming? First time here?
I love Flemings.

531
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,540
Business sense, ambitious, correct.
I like it like that.

532
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,140
But here, everyone has to wear a shirt

533
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,780
We sell them here for fifteen euros.

534
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:29,150
Thirteen euros.
- Fifteen euros, friend.

535
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,100
Okay.

536
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,700
Two vodka. Twenty euros.

537
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:34,940
What?
- Twenty euros.

538
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,900
Two champagne.

539
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:21,820
Two.

540
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:26,260
Shit, guys. I'm drunk.

541
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,350
I need to take a leak.

542
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:42,460
Yes, hello? God damn, anyway.
No, I'll call you back. Yes.

543
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,380
Buddy, come along.
I think we have a problem.

544
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,550
Richter, come along.
Let it stand. Come on.

545
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,710
How is possible that car was found?

546
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,140
Nothing was to be left of it.

547
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:07,340
How can the cops find it
along the side of the road?

548
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,220
Marc, listen. I clearly said
that the car had to disappear.

549
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:15,140
Who was responsible?
- Two garage owners from Liege.

550
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:19,980
From Liege? From fucking Liege? Goddamn.
What's wrong with West-Flanders?

551
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:23,940
Who is this guy
that's staring at you the whole time?

552
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,300
It is a customer. Stop it.
- A customer?

553
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,660
Have you seen how he looks at you?
Not normal.

554
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,460
I don't know.
- Don't you like him?

555
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:36,220
He is too ... I don't know ... too bulky.
- Muscular?

556
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:41,740
Bitch, you don't have to marry him, huh.
Go for it. It will do you good.

557
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,300
Hello.

558
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,980
Everything okay? Everything okay?
- Yes.

559
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:01,460
You come here often?
- First time.

560
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,230
For me too.

561
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:07,820
My girlfriend dragged me along
because she is in love with the boss.

562
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,260
That negro?
- We here say 'black'.

563
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:19,230
Have you applied that perfume sample?
It suits you.

564
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:23,580
Come to the store if you want to buy it.
We are open tomorrow.

565
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:27,420
And what do you do for work?
- Meat.

566
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,980
Then you must do many barbecues.

567
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:38,060
What? Where is there a barbecue?
And when? Too bad, I can't come.

568
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,460
Vincent and his jokes ...
- Lucia, what are you standing here?

569
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,260
Can't you see ...
- Come dance.

570
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:47,860
I'll show you a great African dance.
- Vincent, no ...

571
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,260
Come on, beautiful.
See you later, mate.

572
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,500
My dear, good boy. Oh, God ...

573
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,860
Look, our circus monkey is also present.

574
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:42,740
Where were you today?
Hey, I'm talking to you. Where were you?

575
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:47,100
He has been drinking again.
Look. He has been drinking again.

576
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:50,820
Come, sit down somewhere. It's okay.

577
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,380
Go sit down somewhere. There in the corner.

578
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,860
Look here, you drunk.

579
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,190
I've brought someone.

580
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,340
What say you, Jacky?

581
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:43,460
Call it quits? Diederik here
guarantees us trust.

582
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,110
Come on.

583
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,870
Are you negotiating with De Kuyper
behind my back?

584
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,460
It's ... No ... No.

585
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:58,910
I mean ...

586
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,540
It's more like a surprise.

587
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:04,700
To show that everything is okay.

588
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,700
What did I tell you?

589
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:13,780
I told you that the deal 
with De Kuyper was cancelled.

590
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:21,660
You know what it is with you?
You have nothing. You have no balls.

591
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,660
Want to know how it is?

592
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,700
Come on, Jack.
- What do you want?

593
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:54,580
You'll never know how it is.

594
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,580
Both. You have to do both.

595
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:38,580
Ah, mister Vanmarsenille.
How are you? Everything alright?

596
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,420
Nice weather today, eh.

597
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:47,220
Good day,
you are Steve's brother?

598
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:51,140
It's annoying.
We only have the old tires.

599
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:56,140
The new ones are coming, they are ordered.
Just a little more patience, they're coming.

600
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:00,900
My brother has already paid?
- Yes.

601
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:05,710
So he has paid for tires
which he already had?

602
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:13,780
You circus monkey.

603
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:17,940
No, no. Please.
- Shut up.

604
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,140
I'll never do it again.

605
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:21,990
Why are you cheating us?
- I will not do it again.

606
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,300
What have we done?

607
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:24,940
I will not do it again.

608
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:28,220
He always talks too fast.
- It's all about the tires, eh?

609
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,060
What about it?
- A special brand.

610
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,750
I'll give you a special brand.

611
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:36,660
Jacky. What is going on here?
What are you doing?

612
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,900
That's not normal any-more.

613
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,990
I told you:
Buy your tires at a tire shop.

614
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,430
True or not?

615
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,300
Don't you want to take a shower?

616
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,780
Bunch of Flemish assholes.
Get lost.

617
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:59,780
You're sick.
- Come on, Christian.

618
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,220
All that for a set of tires?

619
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,910
Have you seen what state they were in?

620
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:33,470
You never answer. For years I try.
And yet you treat me just like shit.

621
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:37,060
You know what I've done for you?
I was always there for you.

622
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:39,340
With your thirtieth birthday ...

623
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:43,540
I went to remove posters when they 
wanted to celebrate your ox party.

624
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:44,940
Yes. And I am the fat neck ...

625
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:48,100
because I tell people never to say
klootzak (ballsack/asshole) when you're around.

626
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,100
Shut your mouth.
- Hit me.

627
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,980
I am the only one you got left.

628
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,860
Don't you forget it.

629
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,660
Stieve ...

630
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:00,420
Stieve.

631
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,270
Don't you forget it.

632
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:44,500
Here, Sustanon. Good stuff,
no derivative from Poland or Russia.

633
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:50,380
How much for you? 250 mg?
Intramuscular injection, eh. Okay?

634
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,260
Testoviron. You had asked for it?
- No, you didn't.

635
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,030
No? Mestanolone, very aggressive, huh.

636
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,060
I also have derivatives, such as DHT.

637
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:01,060
No BHV, eh.
- No, no ...

638
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:05,940
Okay, Mestanolone, ten to thirty mg
per day, thirty mg maximum.

639
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:11,980
And absolutely no alcohol. Otherwise, 
your liver breaks down within a week.

640
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,300
We don't know each other.
I'd rather say it.

641
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,660
And that?
- That?

642
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:22,260
That Methyltestosterone. Do you know it?
That's what we call high caliber.

643
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:26,540
Bazooka. Very, very dangerous.
I don't give that to everyone.

644
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:28,740
I take a risk here.

645
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,260
Long ago, Bruno.

646
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:04,660
Should we call your sister?

647
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:23,260
Lucia here. Leave a message ...
- Want to leave a message?

648
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,870
You know why I'm here?

649
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:06,740
You know it? Because I'm getting something.

650
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,540
You know what I'm getting?
A memory.

651
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:24,340
That face you have never drawn before.

652
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,260
Say, Mom,
I think I've seen him.

653
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:35,900
That boy. His father came to show him,
twenty years ago or so.

654
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:41,230
I have to constantly think of him.
It's him. I'm sure.

655
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,790
Did he come to threaten you?
- No, Mom.

656
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:55,270
Because ... it was an accident, eh ...
- Yes, yes, Mom.

657
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:58,190
We know that,
those accidents of Bruno.

658
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:21,580
Therese, there's still gin?
- I come.

659
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:23,420
Diederik, for you too?
- Yes.

660
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:33,300
That case in Limburg, I'm pulling out.
There's too much shit in the air.

661
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,620
Diederik, you speak French?
- A little.

662
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:43,980
Go to Liege. There are two garage owners
who rattle my balls.

663
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:48,380
Say Richter sent you.
Not me, Richter.

664
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,420
Can't Richter go himself?

665
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:02,340
When they open their mouths
about Richter and his car ...

666
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,100
he'll grind them into the meat.
What's up.

667
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,620
If you dare open your mouth once ...

668
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,310
In French, boy.

669
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:16,700
Eva, Diederik here.
There's something going on.

670
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:23,510
I have to intimidate two guys.
A certain David and Christian.

671
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:27,980
I think that they ...
know more about that BMW of yours.

672
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,620
Eve, the results are in.
of that BMW.

673
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,660
Ah, Eva. Come inside.

674
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:57,060
The lab has found a bullet from Daems
in that BMW.

675
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:01,020
Impact number four is just
inside that BMW.

676
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:03,300
The bullet hole has been filled with polyester.

677
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:07,020
Inside the car body,
two fingerprints.

678
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,540
David Filippini. Convicted for 
receiving stolen goods.

679
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:12,550
Nephew of Christian Filippini,
ditto plus assault and robbery.

680
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:15,100
Those guys have been seen at Vanmarsenille.

681
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:19,580
The SIE is on its way to arrest them.
- A message from my informant. Just a sec.

682
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,020
Eva, Diederik here.
There's something going on.

683
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:27,220
I need to intimidate two guys.
A certain David and Christian.

684
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,910
Oh, fuck.

685
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:57,420
You are the garage owners?
David and Christian?

686
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:00,700
Who wants to know?
- Richter.

687
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:02,740
Damn.
- I got a message from him.

688
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:07,620
If you say one word about that BMW,
he'll make sausages from your nuts.

689
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:10,820
What?
- And where?

690
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,340
Tripe, damn.

691
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:09,580
Shit, shit, shit.
Lucia, stupid goat.

692
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:20,820
Hello.
- What are you doing here?

693
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,300
A friend.
She'll have to wait.

694
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,580
Why did you come here?

695
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:40,180
Oh, but what does she want? You know her.
Daphne. She was with me in the club.

696
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,580
Did you stay long?
- No.

697
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:44,990
Again.

698
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:51,940
I should call her back. It looks
urgent, must be something with the store.

699
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:57,180
Yes, Daphne. What is it?
- That guy in the disco ...

700
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,500
Who? Vincent? That womaniser?

701
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:05,540
Yes. Did he sleep with you that night?
- I don't dive into bed with just anyone.

702
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:09,300
Wait. He's in a coma.
He was beaten up like an animal.

703
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:16,900
He will remain a plant.
If he ever wakes up.

704
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:22,460
Hello? Lucia? Hello?

705
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,030
Everything okay?

706
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:34,700
Yes, yes. But I got to go.
An urgent case. I have to go there.

707
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:38,940
I will come for that perfume.
- Yes. Okay.

708
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:40,550
See you then.

709
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,900
Hello, Peter.

710
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,820
Sit down. Come on.

711
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:51,670
Nobody can see you.
Antony stays with you.

712
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,460
Shit, I am fed up with you.
I'm sick of all you Flemings.

713
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:08,660
Bunch of assholes.
I didn't do anything.

714
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:11,540
But I did not kill him, huh.

715
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:15,300
It's David.
He introduced me to that Fleming.

716
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:20,460
I want you to steal a car for me.

717
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:26,380
Christian is my cousin, a cool guy,
but he has those friends who ...

718
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:31,660
Do not worry, Flemish friend.
Letting cars disappear is our business.

719
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:36,940
He would never get rid of that car.
He wanted to sell the parts.

720
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:42,140
The next day Christian appears 
with a Bayerische Motoren Werke ...

721
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:44,990
a BMW 5.
- It's over.

722
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,820
Stolen ...
- In Liege.

723
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:50,020
No, David has stolen that BMW
in Namur.

724
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:53,460
Richter came back with a bastard
from 't Vlaams Gezang.

725
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:56,820
A butcher, with a Bruges scarf.

726
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:00,380
I did not say anything,
but I was wondering:

727
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:03,500
David, how do you know those Flemish
bastards?

728
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,300
My Flemish friends.

729
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:08,020
What are you doing with those people,
I wondered.

730
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:16,230
Suddenly, five hours later that
Flemish legionnaire was back there.

731
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:24,060
He dumps the car in the garage
and what do I see? The bullet hole.

732
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,740
I think they have ...
- Killed someone.

733
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,420
The hormone hunter.

734
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:34,300
Which tires?
- Christian wanted to sell them.

735
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,380
Ah, those tires.

736
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:39,340
I knew that one of the Vanmarsenille 
brothers drove a BMW ...

737
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:41,140
So I thought, why not him?

738
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:44,660
I know him reasonably well.
He passes by when he goes to the whores.

739
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:50,340
I have changed the tires and put the old
tires on Richters BMW.

740
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,620
The next day I hear the news
on the radio.

741
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:58,820
So I drive straight to the Vanmarsenilles
to retrieve the tires.

742
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:03,540
That's where it went wrong.

743
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:08,020
Especially ... Especially for Christian.

744
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:10,340
My mobile.

745
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:15,740
You want to know where those tires are?

746
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:20,300
Richter and those other Flemish
assholes work for Jacky Vanmarsenille.

747
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:22,940
That guy is sick,
got a head like a bull.

748
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:27,500
The tires? Those of the murder?
Well, they are with him.

749
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,900
This is Richter's address.
De Kuyper and Leon are with that woman.

750
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:34,860
Diederik.
- Eva.

751
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:38,870
Those Vanmarsenilles? They have nothing,
and I mean nothing, to do with it?

752
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:43,500
I've never seen Sam with De Kuyper,
let alone Jacky. That were just ...

753
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,900
Stop whining, Diederik.

754
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,830
I don't want to demonize him just
because he happens ...

755
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,380
Coincidence? You know how I feel about coincidence.

756
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:54,260
It is what it is. Okay?

757
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:57,860
You go home and mention nothing to
De Kuyper about your arrest.

758
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,630
Message conveyed.
Basta.

759
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:01,980
All I want ...

760
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,460
is that you go over this list again.

761
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:08,260
Who do you remember?

762
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:21,300
What?
- Nothing.

763
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:23,340
Nothing?
- Lucia.

764
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,270
Someone that I was in school with,
was called that name.

765
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:28,140
Lucia?

766
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,580
Send him away.
- Diederik. Come on.

767
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,060
Go home, Diederik.

768
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:00,870
What? There's no one to see us.

769
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,700
When it's done.
- When it's done ...

770
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:06,860
Yes, when it's done, Diederik.

771
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:32,420
Lucia Schepers?

772
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:36,980
According to surveillance it's nothing.
- No risks. We tap this girl.

773
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,700
Fuck you, Antony. Fuck you.

774
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:31,700
What's for dinner?
- Roast chicken with apricots.

775
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:35,060
With cocktail sauce?
- Yes.

776
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:39,260
Shouldn't Dad eat?
- Just let him sit down a little longer.

777
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:03,380
Is that intentional?
Diederik just arrived at the Bullhead.

778
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:06,660
What? Diederik? At Vanmarsenille?

779
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:43,900
Anyone else check the transponder?
- Just now he was riding to the coast.

780
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:48,140
Diederik, goddamn, pick up.

781
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:57,780
Jean.

782
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:03,980
Jean?

783
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:24,260
Jacky, there's someone with Dad. Do you know him?

784
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:27,910
Does he come for you?

785
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,700
Stay here.

786
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:47,310
What are you doing here?

787
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:50,500
Jack.

788
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,620
What do you want?

789
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:59,500
Jack, listen.
Make sure your family are gone from here.

790
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:01,060
Why?

791
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:04,940
Nine out of ten that the POSA will be here
within a few hours,.

792
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:07,900
I don't understand.
- The cops.

793
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:11,300
Special whatever squadron.
- What are you saying?

794
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:16,940
I'm an informant with the cops.

795
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:19,140
I said you had nothing to do with it.

796
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,220
What?
- Jacky, stop it.

797
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:25,060
What?
- They're going to pick up everyone.

798
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,910
De Kuyper, Sam, you.

799
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:29,420
According to the cops you have something to do
with the murder of Daems.

800
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:32,350
I know you have
nothing to do with it.

801
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:35,940
Pure coincidence. But if you want your family ...

802
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:49,580
Okay, Mom. Go to Stieve and take pa with you.
Tell Stieve he should not come.

803
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:51,740
What about the animals?
- Get away.

804
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:54,140
Yes, but ...
- Get away.

805
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,740
You stay here.

806
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:24,660
I gotta go.
- You stay here.

807
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:28,900
De Kuyper will know that I talked.
- No way.

808
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,780
Sure they'll come tonight?
- Not one hundred percent.

809
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:34,300
I hope tonight.
I'll be gone from all this misery.

810
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,100
Yes, yes ...

811
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:26,500
You must help me.

812
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:51,140
Anything else?

813
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:33,380
All my life.
Known nothing else than beasts.

814
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:38,060
I've always felt like those bulls.

815
01:43:39,100 --> 01:43:43,310
I never knew what it was
to protect someone.

816
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:49,550
Calves, a flock,
like a wife, children.

817
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:56,860
Really have to protect.
As it should, because it is your nature.

818
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:05,350
I don't have what should have been my nature.

819
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,740
You're not gay?

820
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:31,180
I? Are you crazy?

821
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,260
Where is your car?

822
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:46,060
Diederik Vanmarsenille leaves.
He is alone.

823
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,260
When will the intervention team be here?

824
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:23,100
What's in there?

825
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,420
Vitamins.

826
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:33,420
Yes?

827
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:37,580
Why, Diederik away again?

828
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,270
Yes? Liege?

829
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:45,950
Fuck.

830
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:08,980
It is here that you have to be?
- Yes.

831
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:12,340
And who lives here?

832
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:21,020
Lucia or what?
- How do you know?

833
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:27,500
I did not expect anything else
from such a guy.

834
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,860
Come on, go.

835
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:36,740
Then go. Go get that girl.

836
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:12,460
Yes?
- It's Jacky.

837
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:15,820
Jacky? You surprise me.

838
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:19,860
It's a bad time, I have visitors.
Can you come back tomorrow?

839
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:22,630
Okay? Until tomorrow. Bye, bye.
- Lucia.

840
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:01,300
Hello, police?

841
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:06,420
There's a guy at my door
and I think he wants to get inside.

842
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:20,620
Yes, I'm afraid.

843
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:30,710
His name is Jacky.
Jacky Vanmarsenille.

844
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:39,340
Chef?

845
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:43,220
There was a distress call received
for the local police in Liege.

846
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:45,380
From Lucia Schepers.

847
01:49:10,340 --> 01:49:14,310
Jacky?
Jacky, I can't let you in.

848
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:17,390
I am not alone.
- Five minutes, Lucia.

849
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,980
Why don't you just go home?

850
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:26,900
We see each other tomorrow, okay?
Then you can tell me everything. Good?

851
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:28,460
Who is with you?

852
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:34,500
Don't do that now, Lucia.
Don't do that.

853
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:40,140
Okay, don't trash my door.

854
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:46,260
I'll open the door. Okay?

855
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:48,260
Yes.

856
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:00,140
What is it, Lucia?

857
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:19,710
You are alone?

858
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:38,780
Are you afraid of me?
- Afraid? But no.

859
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:43,060
You come here at nine o'clock in the
evening, you almost trash my door.

860
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:45,460
No, of course I'm not afraid.

861
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:54,580
Why did you come to my house?

862
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:57,540
Because I am a woman.
Because I'm stupid.

863
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:10,380
Okay. You know what we do?
I go get something to drink.

864
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:13,510
We calm down.

865
01:51:14,020 --> 01:51:18,820
Then you go home and tomorrow
We see each other again. Okay?

866
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:22,460
Stay where you are and don't break anything.

867
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:53,460
Yes, I called the police.

868
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:58,180
I realise it,
I know what you did.

869
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:05,550
You are ...

870
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:12,580
You're all animals.
So. Now you know.

871
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:20,580
He attacked me.

872
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:25,940
I did not do anything.

873
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:30,780
I'm not an animal.

874
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:33,550
I understand nothing of what you say.

875
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:41,910
If you leave now,
you can still get away.

876
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:52,630
The bathroom.

877
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:55,070
There.

878
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:59,620
We're too late.

879
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:04,060
Police.

880
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:06,460
Mister Vanmarsenille, come out.

881
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,460
Come out.

882
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:30,620
Hands up. Are you alone?
Forward. Hurry. Come on, come on.
