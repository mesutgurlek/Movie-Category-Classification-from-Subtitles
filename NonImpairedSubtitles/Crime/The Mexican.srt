Radio) '..in downtown Los Angeles
right now. Here with the traffic...'

4
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,497
I've been waiting for 15 minutes.

5
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:03,300
- Thought you were stuck in traffic?
- You late?

6
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,849
- You got all the paperwork?
- Yeah.

7
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:08,853
Are you pissed off at me?
I'm just doing my part.

8
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:11,899
- I know, I know.
- You're my guy, Jerry, my guy.

9
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:21,252
'Margolese Holdings,
how may I direct your call? '

10
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,174
- Yes, I'll put you through.
- Hey, Estelle.

11
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:26,456
Is that Nayman's little nephew?

12
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:30,090
- Yeah, that's Big Tom.
- Big Tom! Sure, it is.

13
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,412
- How's it goin' there, Big Tom?
- Hey, hey. Look.

14
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:39,056
Shh. See? See?

15
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:40,893
Why are you scaring the kid?

16
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,018
- I-I was just...
- Did you get that passport?

17
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,773
Yes.

18
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,935
- I have issues.
- Issues, Jerry.

19
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:53,252
It burns my ass to write you
a cheque every week.

20
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,457
I can explain what happened.

21
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,816
You say that
when it's once in a while.

22
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:01,496
- It's every time, Jerry.
- It's every fuckin' time.

23
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,971
And I can certainly
understand that perspective.

24
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:07,655
But I've been having
some personal problems...

25
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:10,335
uh, with my life.

26
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:14,300
My girlfriend, she's a great girl,
but she has complaints.

27
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:17,532
I don't but, she does.
If you want to know the truth,

28
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,216
I can't even believe this,
but we go to a group.

29
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,775
So...last week,

30
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:30,058
when you guys told me to pick up
the thing at the thing,

31
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:33,497
well, Samantha says she needs
the car to pick up some things.

32
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:38,291
And, I don't have to tell you boys,
I mean, things got heated, right?

33
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,849
And she hid them.

34
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:42,738
She hid them?

35
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,221
Oh! The keys. She hid them.

36
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:53,896
She... You know, and I couldn't
get to the thing on time,

37
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,814
and it all got messed up
and I think that maybe...

38
00:03:56,901 --> 00:04:00,655
Maybe some things
aren't meant to happen.

39
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,737
Jerry, you're a fucking moron.

40
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:09,620
Here are your options. Number one,
I roll you up in a carpet,

41
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,169
stuff you in a Sedan
and set fire to you.

42
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:15,731
- You with me? Choice one.
- Yeah.

43
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,018
Number two. You like sex and travel?

44
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:22,491
What, you like to have sex?
You like to travel?

45
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:26,733
Get on a flight to Mexico. All the
hookers you can shake your stick at.

46
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:29,210
Pick up a pistol
that belongs to Margolese.

47
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,657
- What's it gonna be?
- OK, I was under the impression

48
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:36,939
with Margolese getting out of jail,
that the last job was my last job.

49
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:39,819
- You fucked up that job.
- You fucked it up.

50
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:41,778
This job will be your last job.

51
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:43,772
OK, but a trip right now...

52
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:47,490
He asked for you. Want me to call him
and say you can't go?

53
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:50,493
Because I'll call. I'd love to.

54
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:54,415
You're goin' on a fucking trip.
The town's called San Miguel.

55
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,937
You look for a kid in a bar,
the El Alamo.

56
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:02,856
This is a simple fucking task.
Write it down. Roll up your sleeves.

57
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:05,501
- Get involved!
- Ow!

58
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:09,893
The kid's name is Beck. He's got this
particular gun. He's waiting on you.

59
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:12,449
- Beck.
- When you find him, bring him

60
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,736
and the gun back Stateside, got it?

61
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:17,733
Last chance, Jerry.
I'm telling you. The last.

62
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:20,130
Even he's getting tired of your shit.

63
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,212
I'll take care of it, Bernie.

64
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,611
Vaya con Dios, motherfucker.
You're in coach.

65
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,418
Baby, what are you doing?

66
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,617
You said this was your last job!

67
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,499
What do you want me to say?
"Sorry I can't,

68
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:42,095
"the old lady wants me to quit.
Fuck off."

69
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:45,491
Yes! Something like that.
Like exactly!

70
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,537
I'm not in insurance, sweetie!

71
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:51,739
If you get on that plane, you will
never, never, ever see me again.

72
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,574
You got me?
We talked about this. I told you.

73
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,221
I wanted us to go
to Las Vegas for me.

74
00:05:57,301 --> 00:06:00,498
- Not you, me.
- Baby, you're overreacting. OK?

75
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:04,733
Don't do that! Don't you do that!
Don't diminish my needs.

76
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:07,699
Sweetheart, I don't have a choice.
I gotta go.

77
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:11,251
- I go down there, I come right back.
- "I, I, I, I, I!"

78
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:14,458
I wonder what the group
would have to say about that.

79
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,534
No. You cannot use that against me!
We are not even married, but I go.

80
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,452
The group thinks we're married.

81
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,931
I accepted the potato slicer
for our anniversary.

82
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,818
Right, sweets? I go along.

83
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:30,133
That's it. That is it.
You... You... You go along!

84
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:34,499
You don't want to get married.
And this is the way you deal with it!

85
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:37,414
Huh? You're back to
the same old selfish,

86
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,459
self-involved, vile, disgusting...

87
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,179
- Oh, God. You are...
- ..self!

88
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:46,459
You're missing the grand design here!
If I don't go, I'm dead.

89
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,419
Yeah. And it's difficult
to have a relationship

90
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:51,935
if I'm stuffed with formaldehyde.

91
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:56,572
- Now, if anyone is being selfish...
- Oh! Now you blame-shift?

92
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:59,653
- You are blame-shifting?
- Stop analysing!

93
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:01,254
I'm calling a time-out!

94
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:03,216
Ah!

95
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,410
All right...

96
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,652
Jerry, I want you to acknowledge...

97
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:21,813
that my needs mean nothing to you
and you're selfish.

98
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:25,052
- Oh, my God!
- Jerry, acknowledge.

99
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:28,292
I... OK.

100
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:33,057
I will acknowledge that I promised
I would go to Vegas with you.

101
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,530
But now we're just slightly delayed.

102
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:42,220
If you want to construe my wanting
to stay alive as being selfish, OK.

103
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:47,056
I have every intention of going with
you. Your needs are important to me.

104
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:53,458
Come on. Look at all my stuff here,
all over the pavement.

105
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,772
Come on, baby. Huh?

106
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:02,576
What do you say?

107
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:05,050
OK?

108
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,969
I'm going with or without you, Jerry.

109
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:14,579
What's it gonna be?

110
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:19,659
- A bastard!
- A bastard.

111
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,892
What happened to, uh,
"sweetheart" and "big love"?

112
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:25,734
All those things
you called me last night?

113
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:28,813
The only thing I'm interested
in calling you is a cab!

Excuse me, speak English?
Excuse me, you speak English?

117
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:05,216
- (Speaking Spanish)
- What?

118
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:07,740
All set, Mr Welbach.

119
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:11,416
If you go to the front,
a shuttle will take you to your car.

120
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:14,971
- What kind of car is it?
- It's a Chrysler. Brand-new.

121
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,892
Yeah.

122
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,972
Is there a problem, Mr Welbach?

123
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:22,940
You know, it's my first trip
to Mexico and...a Chrysler?

124
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,296
I mean,
I drive a Chrysler in America.

125
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,818
I thought you might have something
more authentic, a little more...

126
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:33,371
- Mexican?
- You know, get into the spirit?

127
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:35,577
- Your first time?
- Yeah.

128
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:37,140
Wow. Exciting.

129
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,576
(In Spanish)
Do you speak Spanish, Mr Welbach?

130
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,299
Huh?

131
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,453
(In Spanish) I didn't think so. Just
what you learned on Speedy Gonzales?

132
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,372
Yeah, Speedy Gonzales.

133

Oh, I think I have just the thing.

How would you like...an El Camino?!

136

Ooh! I like that. Yeah.

Somebody using this chair?

I guess you wanna see it, right?

177
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:15,936
- Yeah.
- You want to see it, don't you?

178
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,296
Yeah. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to.

This is what they call The Mexican.

Wow. Yeah, that's pretty.

- Can I?
- Uh-huh.

186

It was made for a rich landowner,
a nobleman,

187
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,930
by a poor Mexican gunsmith.

188
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,536
He fashioned this gun as a gift
to go along with the hopes

189
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:09,899
that the nobleman's son would take
his daughter's hand in marriage.

'The gun is in your possession?'

235

As we speak.
But, like I said, there's, uh...

236

There's a problem.

What? You lost the kid? He's a souse,
he'll be in another bar.

How?

Bad luck, act of God, fuck if I know.

guns up into the sky.

The kid got tagged by a loose one.

244

Right in the fuckin' head.
I mean... Fu...

'Geez, you really
fucked it this time.'

252
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:07,295
What did I have to do with it? One
minute he's pissin', next he's dead.

253

'Don't even move.'

00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:05,569
Um, um... Sir?

314
00:27:06,701 --> 00:27:09,056
- Can you stop the car? Please.
- Why?

315
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,779
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Just open...

316
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:37,855
She told me, "Don't go. I don't want
you on that highway alone."

317
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:41,616
I said, "It'll be fine, Mom.
It'll be OK." But it's not, is it?

318
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,135
- I'm dead.
- Well, you're not dead.

319
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:48,373
You would have been dead
if I hadn't saved your life.

320
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:51,100
Would you rather
it was you back there?

321
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:53,297
I didn't think so.

322
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:58,817
Are you gonna kill me?

323
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:02,780
Depends on
too many variables to answer.

324
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:07,172
Are you gonna rape me?

325
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:10,453
That's not likely, no.

326
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:13,413
Well, what do you want?

327
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:17,175
I suspect the same thing
as the other guy.

328
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:20,418
The pistol.

329
00:28:21,461 --> 00:28:25,739
The one that Jerry's havin' a hard
time coming back from Mexico with.

330
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:26,890
Jerry?

331
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:31,133
I work for Bernie Nayman,
who works for Arnold Margolese.

332
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:34,293
- You heard of these people.
- Yeah, I have.

333
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,054
- And your husband works for 'em.
- No.

334
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:38,972
Well, he does.

335
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:42,895
I know the selfish, no-good liar
works for them. He isn't my husband.

336
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:47,577
Well, whatever he is to you,
Jerry is in the shit books.

337
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:52,496
When you're in as much shit as he is,
you get skittish about your future.

338
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:54,299
Clouds your judgement.

339
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:57,612
There's a lot of people
interested in that gun.

340
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,453
So what we got here is a...

341
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:04,410
"he who controls the girl,
controls the pistol" situation.

342
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:08,540
I'm a hostage? You blew that guy
to pieces for a fucking gun?

343
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,373
This is so Jerry. Look...

344
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:12,691
Sit down. Sit down.

345
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:15,614
Um...

346
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:17,578
Uh, uh...

347
00:29:18,981 --> 00:29:20,130
Look.

348
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:23,850
Jerry and I broke up,
so if he's doing...

349
00:29:24,941 --> 00:29:28,456
I don't know what he's doing.
It's got nothing to do with me.

350
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,892
You seem like a very nice girl.

351
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,937
Thank you.

352
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:39,173
But it's a fact,
in these life-threatening situations,

353
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:41,775
human beings...lie.

354
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,172
So you are gonna kill me.

355
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:49,979
All right, look.

356
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:53,940
If everything goes OK and Jerry comes
through without this getting funky,

357
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:55,977
I don't think that'll happen.

358
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,131
He gives me the pistol,
I give you to him.

359
00:29:59,461 --> 00:30:03,613
I'm just here
to regulate funkiness. OK?

360
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:05,770
Go on.

361
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:13,570
Great.

362
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:19,618
Donkey braying)

363
00:30:21,901 --> 00:30:24,176
Hyah. Hyah!

364
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:25,614
Hyah!

365
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:32,975
Come on, buddy. Come on, OK?
Just you and me. Yeah.

366
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:34,619
Go!

367
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:38,414
Go. Oh! You're such an ass.

368
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,492
What are you...? No, no, no!

369
00:30:40,581 --> 00:30:42,572
I'm sorry! I didn't mean...

370
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:44,014
Fuck!

371
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:46,653
Fuck!

372

Horn)

373
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:53,856
Hey!

374
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,530
- ?Que pasa?
- Buenas noches.

375
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:02,091
- Buenas noches.
- I need a lift to the next town.

376
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:04,854
Speaking Spanish)

377
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:09,617
I need a ride
in your automobile to the next town.

378
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,137
I can't pay you.
I have no money. No dinero.

379
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:14,973
- De Niro?
- Sí. None.

380
00:31:15,061 --> 00:31:16,210
Robert De Niro?

381
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,458
Robert De Niro!

382
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:24,820
Yeah. Uh, I need a lift
in your el truck-o

383
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,778
to the next town-o.

384
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:30,934
- Uh, village-o. Uh, uh, pueblo.
- Ah, pueblo.

385
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:33,376
- Yeah, sí!
- Al otro pueblo. OK.

386
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:35,338
- Yes?
- Señor De Niro!

387
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:44,449
Self-winding. You never have
to wind it. It's very fine.

388
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:48,295
Yeah. Shake like...
Perpetual calendar.

389
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:50,497
It's good.

390
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:55,061
Is this even gonna run?

391
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:56,972
Yeah?

392
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:04,100
Hey. That your ball?

393
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:08,657
Shit. Hey. Hey, man.

394
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,732
You got a rabid dog back here.

395
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:12,539
Go. Go!

396
00:32:12,621 --> 00:32:14,930
Go. Out.

397
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:22,373
You gotta do something
about this dog.

398
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:34,658
(Operator) 'I have a collect call
for Samantha from Jerry Welbach.

399
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:37,813
- 'No one there, sir.'
- (Jerry) 'Give it a second.'

400
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:41,450
Sam, pick up the phone.
Sams? Samsonite?

401
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,338
Baby, please don't do this.

402
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:45,537
- 'Please try again, sir'
- No!

403
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,976
Just give it a second. She's there...

404
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:16,258
What are you doing?

405
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:18,809
- You're gonna make a call.
- To whom?

406
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:20,619
To Jerry.

407
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:24,171
You're gonna tell him that Leroy
is with you then you hang up.

408
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:27,014
- Leroy?
- Yeah. Leroy, that's right.

409
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:29,296
Then you're gonna hang up. Simple.

410
00:33:29,381 --> 00:33:31,212
That's it?

411
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,257
It's enough. Believe me.

412
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:41,938
You gonna make the call
or do I have to make you? Cos I will.

413
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,455
- No. I'll call.
- Good.

414
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:48,336
Dial it.

415
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:51,493
OK. What's the number?

416
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:54,572
You have the number.

417
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:59,258
I don't know where he is.
You should have the number.

418
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:03,812
What are you tellin' me? You don't
have a number, a motel, nothing?

419
00:34:03,901 --> 00:34:08,099
What's the matter, don't you listen?
We broke up. No longer together.

420
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:10,137
Why would I have the number?

421
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:24,096
I'm sensing you have trust issues.

422
00:34:26,061 --> 00:34:28,017
You got one minute.

423
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:48,059
I'm a professional.
I do this for a living.

424
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:50,097
Goody for you.

425
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:00,897
You're wasting your time.

426
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:06,534
(Radio) # You're nobody
till somebody loves you... #

427
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:08,691
I think I believe you.

428
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:15,737
# You're nobody
till somebody cares...

429
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,733
What's in Vegas?

430
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:27,893
Uh, well...I'm gonna be a waitress,
then make a career as a croupier.

431
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:32,975
They can make $100,000 a year but you
have to have the hands, which I do.

432
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:35,859
I got them from Grandma Vega,
which is a good thing

433
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:39,172
cos my Granny Barzel
had hands like a circus midget.

434
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:41,411
How come you can't live with Jerry?

435
00:35:42,861 --> 00:35:44,613
Do you know Jerry?

436
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:50,214
He has trouble expressing feelings.
He had a fucked-up childhood.

437
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:54,852
His mom is nuts. One of those people
who thinks the iron is always on.

438
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:59,173
- Don't you love him?
- I think that's the problem.

439
00:35:59,261 --> 00:36:01,570
We love each other too much.

440
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,538
But he's... He's so selfish.

441
00:36:03,621 --> 00:36:06,374
It's like we've been living
his life forever.

442
00:36:06,461 --> 00:36:10,818
He'd tell you a different story,
but I give and he just keeps taking.

443
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:14,371
Our counsellor totally
agrees with me, by the way.

444
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:17,419
I don't put much stock
in those counsellor types.

445
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:20,334
All they do is sit around
and smoke joints.

446
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:23,299
Maybe, but Jerry is still a taker
and I'm a giver.

447
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,258
It's obvious.

448
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:28,014
A lot of people
are under the impression

449
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:30,296
that you get to choose who you love.

450
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:33,901
I'm sorry, are you...

451
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:37,053
Are you taking his side?
You're a man, of course.

452
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:41,692
- You're taking his side.
- You love him. You said so yourself.

453
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:44,136
It's all that matters.

454
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:50,493
You're a very sensitive person
for a killer.

455
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,417
Thank you, Sam.

456
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:17,534
Shit.

457
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,856
Get. Get out. Out.

458
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:29,330
Look, you gotta get out.

459
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:31,218
Get out!

460
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,418
Muttering)

461
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,054
Go!

462
00:37:59,421 --> 00:38:01,093
Truck horn blaring)

Speaking Spanish)

464
00:38:11,861 --> 00:38:14,295
Hola, shithead! Where's my stuff?

465
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:16,292
Get back! Where's my stuff?

466
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:20,260
- Pistol. Pistolero. Get back.
- La pistola.

467
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,453
Get back!

468
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,657
Stay calm. Get back, get back!

469
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:30,250
Don't move.
What the f...? Give me those.

470
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:33,411
Back! Back, back.

471
00:38:33,501 --> 00:38:36,698
Get in the car. Get in! OK.

472
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,136
Is that my...? Is that my jacket?

473
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:44,341
Put it in the car! What is wrong
with you people? Get back!

474
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:10,577
- (Sam) You don't have to be in here.
- I go by track record.

475
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:15,052
- I don't hear any tinkle, tinkle.
- Stage fright.

476
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:17,814
Look around,
there's not even a window.

477
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:23,498
So what's with this "We've been
livin' his life forever" thing?

478
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:25,458
I didn't mean it literally.

479
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:29,375
Jerry's been working for Margolese
for five years less a day.

480
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:31,372
It just feels lifelong.

481
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:33,770
- Sounds like jail terms.
- It is.

482
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:37,695
Arnold Margolese is in jail
because Jerry put him there.

483
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,294
Jerry ratted out Arnold Margolese?

484
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,772
No. Jerry was coming across Ventura,
over there by Laurel Canyon.

485
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:50,329
- Yeah?
- He wasn't paying attention,

486
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,777
ran a red light,
smashed into Margolese's Cadillac.

487
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:56,534
When the cops came,
Margolese got busted

488
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:58,816
cos he had a person in the trunk.

489
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:01,495
That's how Margolese
got sent to jail?

490
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:02,934
Mm-hmm.

491
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,739
- Live person or dead person?
- Live person.

492
00:40:07,821 --> 00:40:10,415
Huh. What's the big deal, then?

493
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:13,061
He probably wasn't
gonna stay that way.

494
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:16,178
He was taped up in a trunk
for a reason, wasn't he?

495
00:40:16,261 --> 00:40:19,617
I would think this was
right up your alley, Swifty.

496
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,772
- He saw something?
- Whatever it was this guy saw,

497
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:27,659
or was going to say to the cops,
he got the chance.

498
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:32,212
Since it was Jerry's fault, Margolese
had him work off the jail time.

499
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:35,179
My whole relationship
has been hijacked

500
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:38,537
because he doesn't pay attention
when he drives.

501
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:42,970
I... I can't go with you in here.

502
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:55,778
Urinating)

503
00:40:57,741 --> 00:40:59,697
Sam urinating)

504
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:05,689
Man) We didn't think we were getting
a dead man with the car.

505
00:41:05,781 --> 00:41:08,420
I got no use for a dead gringo.
Take a left.

506
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:24,133
Flies buzzing)

507
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:32,892
Come on.

508
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:40,699
If you're going to kill me,
at least tell me

509
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:43,249
who it is that's going
to send me to God.

510
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:45,735
Tell me!

511
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:49,298
Look, I'm not gonna kill you.

512
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:53,817
But I am gonna have to shoot you.

513
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:57,338
But why, sir? Why?

514
00:41:57,421 --> 00:41:59,377
Why? Because you stole from me,

515
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:02,419
you know about the pistol
and you'll steal again.

516
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:05,493
I can't have you coming back
like a fly in the ointment.

517
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:08,141
I won't be a fly!
You'll never see me again.

518
00:42:08,221 --> 00:42:09,939
You're gettin' shot, that's it.

519
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:13,218
It'll take time to walk to town,
especially limping...

520
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:14,859
Wait, wait. Limping?

521
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:18,729
Can't you just tie me up some more?
Fuck! You shoot me? Tie me!

522
00:42:18,821 --> 00:42:21,096
Yeah. I don't have a rope.

523
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:22,819
So you shoot me?

524
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:25,734
It's the American way.

525
00:42:27,821 --> 00:42:29,777
Where do you want it?

526
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:33,810
OK.

527
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:38,099
Not the leg! There's arteries.
I could bleed to death in seconds.

528
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,409
The foot.

529
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:44,729
That's fair where I come from. OK?
It'll hurt, but it'll heal.

530
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:47,176
What if you take off a fucking toe!

531
00:42:47,261 --> 00:42:49,456
Wait, wait, wait. Not the left.

532
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:51,736
Oh, sorry.

533
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:54,096
On the count of three.

534
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:57,059
- One...
- (Screams)

535
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:01,453
Look, I'm agreeing with you.
But there's a few ways to look at it.

536
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:03,816
Sex is, no matter what anybody says,

537
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:06,574
a very important part
of any relationship.

538
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:10,176
The fact that Jerry
is a considerate lover says a lot.

539
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:15,452
- You lost me.
- Well, he's a considerate lover.

540
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:19,932
You gotta find a way to get him to
expand this quality he has during sex

541
00:43:20,021 --> 00:43:22,410
to other areas of your relationship.

542
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:25,857
Even if it only comes out in sex,
it's there just the same.

543
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:30,250
That's a good point.

544
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:34,778
If a person's a considerate lover,
he can't be all selfish, right?

545
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:39,213
Unless of course he's...

546
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:48,494
- He's, uh, being a considerate...
- What was that?

547
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:51,650
What?

548
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:54,892
That. That moment you had.

549
00:43:56,061 --> 00:43:58,370
What moment?

550
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:02,857
Leroy, you just checked out
that guy and had a moment.

551
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:05,250
That was a moment.

552
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:10,492
I don't know if it was a moment.

553
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:13,339
Are you gay?)

554
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:18,698
- As in happy?
- As in homosexual.

555
00:44:21,221 --> 00:44:25,134
What does my sexual orientation
have to do with our conversation?

556
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:26,813
Nothing.

557
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:31,133
Nothing. Except something that you
said back there really bugged me

558
00:44:31,221 --> 00:44:33,974
and this would kind of
help it make sense.

559
00:44:34,061 --> 00:44:36,529
Yeah? What's that?

560
00:44:36,621 --> 00:44:39,897
I asked if you were gonna rape me,
you said, "Not likely."

561
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:42,449
You said it so coldly,
like I was repulsive

562
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,853
and it was ludicrous to think I was
actually at risk of being raped.

563
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:52,295
First of all, it's a crime of anger,
not attraction.

564
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:56,772
Second of all, you're not repulsive.
You're very beautiful.

565
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,658
Thank you.

566
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:01,175
- You want me to rape you?
- Are you gay?

567
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:03,821
- You want me to rape you?
- You're gay.

568
00:45:05,021 --> 00:45:07,012
You're gay. I knew it!

569
00:45:07,101 --> 00:45:09,934
Oh, I so knew it.
I just knew it. What a relief.

570
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:14,492
Do you want a medal? A little trinket
saying you identified a homosexual?

571
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:16,890
No.

572
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,812
Are you full throttle?

573
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:23,299
Full throttle?

574
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:33,452
Yeah, I guess I am.

575
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:36,772
Oh. I'm not... I mean...

576
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:40,331
I'm not trying to be a smart-ass
or anything like that.

577
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:42,651
I just... I think this is great.

578
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:44,572
Wow. This is...

579
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:47,858
This is...major, OK?

580
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:52,093
I...know the kind of people
in your business, OK?

581
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:56,299
- Yeah?
- And to me, it seems that...

582
00:45:56,381 --> 00:46:02,058
Well, being gay isn't really...
conducive to the environment.

583
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:07,214
Like I should be an interior
decorator. That's insulting.

584
00:46:07,301 --> 00:46:11,010
- I am very good at what I do.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

585
00:46:13,461 --> 00:46:15,213
No, I don't.

586
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:20,050
Unfortunately,
I seem to be unable to keep...

587
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:21,972
relationships together.

588
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:28,698
Seems like everybody's having trouble
keeping relationships together.

589
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:04,652
It's ringing, señor.

590
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:10,171
- Thank you for that.
- No, no, no. No necesario.

591
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,092
Really?

592
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:16,541
That's so kind.
You have no idea what...

593
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:18,691
'Hi, this is Ted. Leave a message.

594
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:21,136
'If this is my guy in need,
I'm on my way.

595
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:25,055
'Go to the Hotel de la Plaza.
Wait for me there, OK? Sit tight.'

596
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,974
OK, OK. Forget aeropuerto.

597
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:30,131
Uh, Hotel de la Plaza.

598
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:37,259
- (Muttering in Spanish)
- Hola.

599
00:47:37,341 --> 00:47:39,571
- Is this your dog?
- Sort of.

600
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:42,016
Came along for the ride.

601
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:45,979
He has a personality
and that does count.

602
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:49,531
- He's a good guy.
- Is this your car?

603
00:47:49,621 --> 00:47:52,135
It's a rental. I'm an American.

604
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:54,451
- No shit? Really?
- Yeah.

605
00:47:55,741 --> 00:47:57,094
I'm Mexican.

606
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:01,018
Cool.

607
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:03,535
Do you have a passport?

608
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:14,890
- Jerry Wellbatch, Los Angeles, USA.
- Welbach... Wellbatch.

609
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:18,698
Can I ask you a question, Jerry?

610
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:22,379
How long have you been in Mexico?

611
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:28,010
- A few days. Pleasure.
- I see.

612
00:48:28,101 --> 00:48:30,535
- Pleasure, huh?
- Yeah.

613
00:48:30,621 --> 00:48:35,411
I see. Can you tell me,
uh, what happened here?

614
00:48:38,341 --> 00:48:41,014
That's not accurate, I'm afraid.

615
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:45,219
The gunsmith did craft this pistol
for a prospective husband,

616
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:47,815
and he was a nobleman's son, true.

617
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:51,860
But the motif was darker, my friend.

618
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:54,216
It's cursed, this gun.

619
00:48:57,781 --> 00:49:02,536
(Policeman) 'The key to this tale
involves the gunsmith's assistant,

620
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:07,330
'a poor, but honourable
young man in blinding love

621
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:10,094
'with the gunsmith's daughter.

622
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:14,015
'For months at a time,

00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:25,173
'only to discover that what he hoped
could be a wedding gift for him...

626
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:28,219
'was for another.

627
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:32,089
'The gunsmith insisted his daughter
marry the nobleman's son,

628
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,456
'forbidding their love.

629
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:40,816
'Angered in his bitter pain,
the assistant cursed the gun,

630
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:43,620
'vowing the creation

631
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:51,498
'But the gunsmith
was racing against time.

00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:26,613
Church bell chiming)

637
00:50:28,421 --> 00:50:31,493
This gun never worked properly.

638
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:35,699
Some say its very creation
ended the gunsmith's life.

639
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:49,334
Well, my friend, you're free to go,
but without the gun.

640
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,379
This gun doesn't belong
to you or to your boss.

641
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:54,417
Now it belongs to me.

642
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:59,651
(Man) Yeah, Vegas.
It can be tough that way.

643
00:50:59,741 --> 00:51:03,290
(Sam) Expensive?
Man) Yeah, emotionally.

644
00:51:03,381 --> 00:51:05,736
I had a serious relationship problem.

645
00:51:05,821 --> 00:51:09,416
Well, you fit right in here.

646
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:15,292
- What do you do now, Frank?
- Now...I am a postman.

647
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:17,770
Get out of here.

648
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:20,011
- That's so rigid.
- Swear to God.

649
00:51:20,101 --> 00:51:22,740
There's a seedy underbelly
to the postal service.

650
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:25,415
- Is that the key to it?
- That's the key.

651
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:27,731
You have no idea how many small,

652
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:30,893
unmarked brown paper packages
I deliver.

653
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:33,734
- What, porno?
- Yeah, daily.

654
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:35,334
Like what?

655
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:39,937
Videos, blow-up dolls,
dildos, pocket pussies.

656
00:51:40,061 --> 00:51:43,019
- Don't leave nothing out.
- Oh, yeah?

657
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:46,980
But even with all that
dirty excitement at my fingertips,

658
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:49,495
I still have to take off
once a year

659
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:54,177
I just get up and I know I'm going
to Vegas, I just don't know how.

660
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:57,059
All I've got is my wallet
and an attitude.

661
00:51:58,861 --> 00:52:01,329
I don't know, it keeps me sane.

662
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:04,891
After all, guns don't kill people...

663
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:07,097
postal workers do.

664
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:33,412
OK, you're all set, Mr Shurker.

665
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:36,413
If you go to the front,
a shuttle will pick you up.

666
00:52:36,501 --> 00:52:38,537
What kind of car is it exactly?

667
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:40,532
It's a Chrysler, sir, brand-new.

668
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:44,654
You wouldn't happen to have
something a little more...

669
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:46,015
Raoul!

670
00:52:57,221 --> 00:52:59,018
Yeah, man!

671
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:01,410
Yeah. Never fear, Teddy's here.

672
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:03,731
How are you?

673
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:17,975
- 'Rosco!'
- (Speaks Spanish)

674
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:21,497
Come on, Jerry.
The Mexican thief, the dirty cop?

675
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:24,220
The word is out.
It's a big-ticket item.

676
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,657
A lot of fucking people
are interested in that gun.

677
00:53:29,421 --> 00:53:32,731
No fucking...
Is that what they think?

678
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:34,698
That I'm selling them out?

679
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:38,456
Maybe they think you're scared
and might do the wrong thing.

680
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:40,611
- Ted.
- You know, I don't know.

681
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:44,774
- I'm just doing my portion here.
- Yeah, and what is that?

682
00:53:44,861 --> 00:53:49,377
To find out what's going on, assess
the damage, try to calm you down,

683
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:52,612
help find the pistol, get us home.

684
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:57,092
I get on that plane, pistol or not.
it'll be the last flight I ever take.

685
00:53:57,181 --> 00:54:00,298
- Oh, come on, Jerry.
- "Come on"? You know it.

686
00:54:00,381 --> 00:54:03,339
- I know what I have to know.
- Doing your part.

687
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:05,173
I know what I have to know.

688
00:54:05,261 --> 00:54:07,934
You sound like Schultz
from Hogan's Heroes.

689
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:10,137
German accent) I know nothing!

690
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:13,019
I don't like Nayman
running things either.

691
00:54:13,101 --> 00:54:16,935
I got a few years on you and I'm
telling you, keep your nose clean,

692
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:19,899
look straight ahead
and do what you're told.

693
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:24,133
That's why I nearly paid off
Boca Raton. I do my fuckin' portions.

694
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:28,057
I don't care how you look at it,

695
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:31,417
the first step out of this
is to get the pistol back.

696
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:34,452
I never took a pay-off in my life.

697
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:38,056
Jerry, look,
I know where your loyalties lie.

698
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:41,770
But the kid's dead.
The pistol's gone.

699
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,659
I mean, you can see
how it looks, right?

700
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:46,094
Come on.

701
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:49,539
You're my guy.

702
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:55,294
Phone)

703
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:02,577
Ringing continues)

704

# We can dance if we want to
we've got all your life and mine

705

# As long as we abuse it,
never gonna lose it

706

# Everything will work out right

707

# I say, we can dance if we want to

708

# We can leave your friends behind

709

# Cos your friends don't dance
and if they don't dance, well they're

# I say, we can dance, we can dance,
everything's out of control

712

# We can dance, we can dance

713
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:01,371
# They're doing it from pole to pole

714
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:05,090
# We can dance, we can dance,
everybody look at your hands... #

715
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:07,854
- (Music stops)
- Not the safest dance!

716
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:28,336
I'm not going anywhere.

717
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:36,737
(Sam) We are in the city
where I'm going to be living.

718
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:43,059
Go.)

719
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:47,730
Go.

720
00:56:50,341 --> 00:56:52,297
What's wrong? Huh?

721
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:59,535
You know when you're in
a bad relationship and you separate?

722
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:04,411
All of a sudden, everywhere you look
there's love and possibility.

723
00:57:08,661 --> 00:57:10,538
I'm worried about Jerry.

724
00:57:12,141 --> 00:57:13,938
All right, don't worry.

725
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:16,774
I'll call Nayman
and check in on everything.

726
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:25,577
You want me to stay?

727
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,812
I want you to go.

728
00:57:30,901 --> 00:57:33,369
You sure?

729
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:36,970
I really want you to go.

730
00:57:42,581 --> 00:57:44,537
Clicking)

Snoring)

732
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:14,131
Ted) I couldn't sleep all night.

733
00:58:14,221 --> 00:58:19,659
Yeah. No, he said he followed
the cop to the pawn shop.

734
00:58:19,741 --> 00:58:22,574
He's taking me over there
after breakfast.

735
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:26,449
We're booked on the seven o'clock
if all goes well.

736
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:30,500
No, now wait... No...
No, you wait a minute, Nayman.

737
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:33,971
Now what do you gotta go
and say that for?

738
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:36,097
Well, now or later?

739
00:58:36,181 --> 00:58:38,900
How could I misinterpret?

740
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:42,769
No, you didn't send the wrong guy.
I'm handling things.

741
00:58:42,861 --> 00:58:44,977
But I never signed up for that.

742
00:58:45,061 --> 00:58:49,213
Listen, I promise you, when I tell
him, it'll make a difference.

743
00:58:51,621 --> 00:58:53,100
Bye.

744
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:56,412
Toilet flushing)

745
00:59:02,101 --> 00:59:06,379
Hey, sweets. I keep calling
and I haven't heard a word from you.

746
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:08,338
I'm starting to wonder.

747
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:11,379
I know you're angry with me,
but, uh...

748
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:16,091
You know,
"Ain't no sunshine when she's gone".

749
00:59:17,661 --> 00:59:19,458
OK?

750
00:59:22,741 --> 00:59:25,494
I think she actually went to Vegas.

751
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:29,210
I keep telling you,
these women are problems, you know?

752
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:32,418
You should try to be like me -
I answer to myself.

753
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:37,097
No hassles, nobody ridin' my ass like
a goddamn horse in a saddle. Free.

754
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:42,209
You close yourself off so you have
no shot at meeting the right woman.

755
00:59:42,301 --> 00:59:45,691
Any woman can be the right woman
if the numbers work.

756
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:48,249
No way. Not me.

757
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:52,732
You settle. You open yourself up.
You become vulnerable.

758
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:55,335
What's the insight
into my relationship?

759
00:59:57,981 --> 01:00:01,815
OK, look, Jerry. She is in Vegas.

760
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:03,619
What?

761
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,931
Hey, shit falls down, you know?

762
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:07,773
Shit falls down?

763
01:00:07,861 --> 01:00:11,820
Margolese called Nayman all pissed
off cos you were fucking this up,

764
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:14,290
told him to keep an eye on Sam
in case...

765
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:18,932
In case I get any funny ideas.
You're just telling me this now?

766
01:00:19,021 --> 01:00:22,218
- There's other things to consider.
- Like what?

767
01:00:22,301 --> 01:00:26,214
That gun's worth a lot. People know
you have it. Sam could be in danger.

768
01:00:26,301 --> 01:00:28,257
No shit. Who did they put on her?

769
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:30,696
You don't know him,
but you know of him.

770
01:00:30,781 --> 01:00:33,090
- Who?
- That fucking psycho Leroy.

771
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:35,775
- Leroy!
- Nayman had to. It was an order.

772
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:38,170
Margolese would know if he didn't.

773
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:40,217
Wait.

774
01:00:40,301 --> 01:00:42,656
They're just trying to scare me.

775
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:45,574
Well, that would sure do it for me.

776
01:00:45,661 --> 01:00:48,300
We've all heard
the kidney story, Jerry.

777
01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:53,136
Nayman wants us on that seven o'clock
flight, pistol in tow. No buts.

778
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:57,533
They'll meet us at the airport
and then Leroy will take the pistol.

779
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,214
Yeah.

780
01:02:33,981 --> 01:02:35,733
I had to borrow...

781
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:37,777
Do you mind?

782
01:02:40,461 --> 01:02:42,258
Sleep well? !

783
01:02:43,661 --> 01:02:45,731
Yeah. You?

784
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:51,894
Who's Winston?

785
01:02:54,741 --> 01:02:57,460
Somebody I don't like very much.

786
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:00,453
You can have that removed, you know?

787
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,497
Yeah, maybe I will someday.

788
01:03:16,301 --> 01:03:18,417
You wanna get some breakfast?

789
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:32,656
# War: "Why Can't We Be Friends?")

790
01:03:33,701 --> 01:03:35,578
Knocking)

791
01:03:48,981 --> 01:03:51,051
Knocking)

792
01:04:06,661 --> 01:04:11,689
# I've seen you round
for a long, long time

793
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:15,410
# I really remember you
when you drank my wine

794
01:04:15,501 --> 01:04:20,052
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

795
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:26,497
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

796
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:31,416
# I seen you walking
down in Chinatown

797
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:35,210
# I called you
but you could not look around

798
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:39,852
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

799
01:04:40,421 --> 01:04:45,370
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? #

800
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:48,771
At first,
I thought this guy is all right.

801
01:04:48,861 --> 01:04:52,695
And then I'm thinking he's more than
all right, he's terrific.

802
01:04:52,781 --> 01:04:56,490
But there's no way he's gonna
feel the same way about me.

803
01:04:58,181 --> 01:04:59,739
Then I find out he does.

804
01:05:02,741 --> 01:05:05,619
Then I'm thinking...

805
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:09,216
what happens when
he finds out what I do...

806
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:11,656
and who I am and what I've done?

807
01:05:13,101 --> 01:05:16,332
You know, who am I kidding, right?
Let's get serious.

808
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:18,377
What are you gonna do about it?

809
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:20,975
That's it.
I didn't have to do anything.

810
01:05:21,061 --> 01:05:24,815
It happened absent of my will
to consciously make it happen.

811
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:26,732
Oh, really?

812
01:05:26,861 --> 01:05:29,295
I was a little drunk last night.

813
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:33,579
I took my gun and I put it in
the towels in the bathroom, you know?

814
01:05:36,301 --> 01:05:38,053
And he found it.

815
01:05:42,341 --> 01:05:45,139
And he said,
"The past doesn't matter.

816
01:05:47,821 --> 01:05:49,857
"It's the future that counts."

817
01:05:49,941 --> 01:05:51,693
Leroy.

818
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:55,973
See, life can change.

819
01:05:56,061 --> 01:05:57,972
People can change.

820
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:08,297
I haven't cried in 12 years.

821
01:06:10,581 --> 01:06:12,139
What are you lookin' at?

822
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:16,537
Don't look at me like that.
You're makin' it worse.

823
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:18,851
What are you, Barbara Walters?

824
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:21,535
It's just beautiful.

825
01:06:21,621 --> 01:06:24,294
Let's talk about somethin' else.

826
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:29,136
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Anything. Anything else. Whatever.

827
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:33,734
What was it over,
the last time you cried?

828
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:35,971
Let's talk about that.

829
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:38,780
Oh, yeah,
that'll bring the sun right out(!)

830
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:42,295
(Ted) I heard
it was this guy Leroy's mother.

831
01:06:42,381 --> 01:06:44,531
OK, that's what we call bullshit.

832
01:06:44,621 --> 01:06:46,930
If I told one guy
at the next convention

833
01:06:47,021 --> 01:06:49,979
that you kept your mother
cut up in the freezer,

834
01:06:50,061 --> 01:06:51,858
you'd have a reputation too.

835
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:54,250
Fact or not, it makes no difference.

836
01:06:56,901 --> 01:06:59,017
- The guy's a star.
- Oh, my God.

837
01:06:59,101 --> 01:07:02,411
Why are you so worried
then if you think it's bullshit?

838
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:05,493
I met Leroy once.
It was for all of two seconds.

839
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:08,049
I shook his hand.
He seemed like a nice guy.

840
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:11,531
Whether or not he lives up
to his legend isn't the point.

841
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:15,375
Or if he sits in his garage
soaked in gasoline lighting matches,

842
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:16,814
I don't care.

843
01:07:16,901 --> 01:07:20,291
What concerns me
is he was hired in the first place.

844
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:24,340
- Are you with me?
- Geez, Jerry, you really met him?

845
01:07:24,421 --> 01:07:26,252
Oh, my God!

846
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:29,617
Ted is not gonna let anything happen,
OK? I'm here.

847
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:31,692
Thanks, Ted. I feel real safe.

848
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:37,780
- Hola.
- I no fuck around, comprende?

849
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:41,012
Gun, gun, loaded.
Bang, bang. You, dead.

850
01:07:41,101 --> 01:07:43,979
Do you have a speech impediment?

851
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:48,014
- Give me the gun. The pistol.
- The pistol?

852
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:50,171
You know what I'm talkin' about.

853
01:07:50,261 --> 01:07:53,139
- The pistol?
- OK, what's your name?

854
01:07:53,221 --> 01:07:55,018
Joe.

855
01:07:55,101 --> 01:07:58,616
Joe, do what he says and we'll
be out of here before you know it.

856
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:00,657
- The pistol, please.
- OK.

857
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:02,299
Thank you.

858
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:05,179
Excuse me.

859
01:08:13,941 --> 01:08:16,501
Come on. Go.

860
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,337
Got it.

861
01:08:22,421 --> 01:08:24,696
Just have a seat right here, amigo.

862
01:08:39,301 --> 01:08:41,417
Jerry! Have you lost your mind?

863
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:43,571
What were you talking about
on the phone?

864
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,379
Put the gun away.

865
01:08:45,461 --> 01:08:48,658
Was it to off me?
Is that what you two were discussing?

866
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:51,653
- Jerry, I would never...
- Go ahead, deny it! Go ahead.

867
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:53,379
- Go ahead!
- OK, OK.

868
01:08:53,461 --> 01:08:55,929
Jerry, that's what he said.

869
01:08:58,741 --> 01:09:02,097
So you were lying when you said
I'd walk away from this?

870
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:06,254
- No, Jerry, that's what he said.
- Then you're lying to me now.

871
01:09:06,341 --> 01:09:09,811
No, no. Nayman told me to do it,
Jerry, but...

872
01:09:09,901 --> 01:09:12,256
- But?
- But...

873
01:09:12,341 --> 01:09:16,220
But you're just doing your portion.
Isn't that how it works?

874
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:19,338
17 portions left for Boca...
Boca Raton, right?

875
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,730
I wouldn't do that. Come on, I swear!

876
01:09:21,821 --> 01:09:25,655
They tell you to bring me in,
then they tell you to take me out.

877
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:28,892
Why are you being told
two contradicting things?

878
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:33,532
- You don't ask a question?
- I-I just... I... I don't know.

879
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:37,853
- You don't think it's weird?
- Yeah, it's... It's weird.

880
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:41,251
Right! Because something's going on.
What is it?

881
01:09:48,061 --> 01:09:51,497
Exactly. You don't know,
you're just doing your fucking part.

882
01:09:51,581 --> 01:09:54,573
Well, I'm not going down
because you don't know!

883
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:58,532
You see my predicament?

884
01:10:02,141 --> 01:10:04,496
You're my guy, Ted.

885
01:10:04,581 --> 01:10:06,651
Handcuffs locking)

886
01:10:06,741 --> 01:10:08,493
You're my guy, Jerry.

887
01:10:41,261 --> 01:10:43,013
Wait. What happened here?

888
01:10:43,101 --> 01:10:46,332
Someone killed themselves.
Swan-dived off the balcony.

889
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:47,854
Let's go.

890
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:51,731
Stay back. Nothin' to see here.

891
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,372
Walk on.

892
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:58,259
Thank you very much.
Sorry to have disturbed you.

893
01:11:01,141 --> 01:11:02,938
Man) Hotel security.

894
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:23,971
No.

895
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:25,892
Please, no.

896
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,537
Knocking)

897
01:11:34,221 --> 01:11:36,018
No. No.

898
01:11:40,981 --> 01:11:42,733
Leroy) Coming.

899
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:46,010
Sir, there's been
a terrible incident.

900
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,934
Are all parties
in your room accounted for?

901
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:52,457
Yeah. Yeah.
Just me and my wife. Honey!

902
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,657
No, that's OK, sir. Thank you.

903
01:11:54,741 --> 01:11:57,016
- What happened?
- Sorry to disturb you.

904
01:11:58,501 --> 01:12:00,457
Everything all right?

905
01:12:03,581 --> 01:12:05,412
Leroy...

906
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:09,737
Pack your shit.

907
01:13:31,661 --> 01:13:33,333
Shh, shh.

908
01:13:54,261 --> 01:13:55,694
Leroy) Psst.

909
01:13:57,661 --> 01:14:01,017
You're a stupid motherfucker,
you know that?

910
01:14:01,101 --> 01:14:04,457
You're well dressed,
I'll give you that, but stupid.

911
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,297
Wear Kevlar? Huh?

912
01:14:10,341 --> 01:14:12,013
Yeah.

913
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:14,330
Leroy.

914
01:14:16,221 --> 01:14:19,213
Please don't do this. Please.

915
01:14:20,781 --> 01:14:23,295
You think I should
listen to her? Huh?

916
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:26,373
What do you think?

917
01:14:27,661 --> 01:14:29,413
Huh?

918
01:14:31,381 --> 01:14:33,178
Wanna know what I think?

919
01:14:34,701 --> 01:14:36,259
Kevlar is for pussies.

920
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,493
This is for Frank.

921
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:54,171
Woman speaking Spanish on PA)

922
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:12,453
- My bag will make the flight?
- They'll run it down.

923
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,453
- I just need to see your passport.
- Yeah.

924
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:22,933
- I'm afraid there's been a mistake.
- What?

925
01:15:23,021 --> 01:15:25,251
No! No!

926
01:15:25,341 --> 01:15:28,458
Mr Shurker most probably has yours.

927
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:49,818
Leroy) I told you, if Jerry makes it
and nothing gets funky, it'll be OK.

928
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:53,337
- Well, shit got funky.
- Why isn't he here? Why? Why?

929
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:56,572
Give me a second,
I'm trying to get the story here.

930
01:15:56,661 --> 01:16:00,893
Take it easy and stop acting like a
kidnapped chick on a carton of milk.

931
01:16:05,181 --> 01:16:09,493
Hmm. Yeah, you're right.
This is an offer for the gun.

932
01:16:09,581 --> 01:16:11,537
Yeah. I can see how this looks.

933
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:15,580
I've just been trying to get
some better numbers together.

934
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:19,051
You have no intention
of giving the gun to Margolese.

935
01:16:20,261 --> 01:16:23,537
Look, Bobby.
You know, I know that you're loyal.

936
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:27,330
That's good.
I mean, nobody's debating that.

937
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,810
Let me ask you,
in your skulking around,

938
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:33,177
going through private things
in people's offices,

939
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:35,855
did you discover
that he's shutting us down?

940
01:16:35,941 --> 01:16:39,172
That's right. You, me, everybody.

941
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,377
I don't... I don't understand.

942
01:16:41,461 --> 01:16:44,419
What, you didn't get the memo,
the bonus? No?

943
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:47,493
No. Nothing.

944
01:16:47,581 --> 01:16:52,496
Me neither. Difference is I know
when I'm being fucked and you don't,

945
01:16:52,581 --> 01:16:55,937
cos you're standing
on the wrong fucking line.

946
01:16:57,661 --> 01:17:00,573
Let me help you get on
the right side of the line

947
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:03,539
and do for you what
he should've done, Bobby.

948
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:09,975
He's changed in prison.

949
01:17:10,061 --> 01:17:12,495
I'm telling you,
something's changed him.

950
01:17:12,581 --> 01:17:15,175
- He's not the same guy.
- (Door opens)

951
01:17:15,261 --> 01:17:17,900
They're still holding.
What shall I tell 'em?

952
01:17:20,381 --> 01:17:22,941
Can I count on your co-operation?

953
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:25,455
Yeah, yeah, Bobby. I'm here. Yeah.

954
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:30,651
Yeah, that's his hotel.

955
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:34,652
Yeah, all right. Sure.

956
01:17:37,421 --> 01:17:39,730
- What?
- Plan B is now in effect.

957
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:42,812
I hope you don't get airsick.

958
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:15,897
Get in the car.

959
01:18:19,981 --> 01:18:22,370
- Hola, señor.
- Hola, Señor Welbach.

960
01:18:22,461 --> 01:18:25,180
Has the US Consulate called back yet?

961
01:18:25,261 --> 01:18:26,660
No, sir, not yet.

962
01:18:26,741 --> 01:18:31,861
Look, this is a muy, muy important
call. I've lost my passport, OK?

963
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,933
I'll be sitting right there.
I'm not gonna move.

964
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:37,137
Do you see that man over there?

965
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:40,414
Yeah.

966
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:43,413
- That's Mr Williamson.
- So?

967
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:46,140
He's been waiting
for that very same call.

968
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:49,770
Really? What, the whole morning?

969
01:18:49,861 --> 01:18:52,853
- Since March, señor.
- Oh, come on!

970
01:18:54,661 --> 01:18:57,129
Phone)

971
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:00,452
Hotel de la Plaza.

972
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:03,135
Yes, as a matter of fact,
he's right here.

973
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:05,496
Señor, it's for you.

974
01:19:05,581 --> 01:19:08,573
Oh. Oh. Hey. Yes, hello?

975
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:13,371
You bastard. Hello? Like, "Hello, my
life is great. Everything is fine."

976
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:15,850
- Sam?
- 'I thought you could be dead.'

977
01:19:15,941 --> 01:19:18,580
I was worried sick
and you answer "Hello,"

978
01:19:18,661 --> 01:19:21,129
like you're confirming
a room service order?!

979
01:19:23,061 --> 01:19:24,858
Sam? Sam?

980
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:28,371
I'm done with Mr Jerry Welbach.
Mr "Hi". No, no.

981
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:31,498
- (Leroy) 'Ask about the gun.'
- Is that Leroy?

982
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:35,017
- 'Did he fucking touch you?'
- Do you have any idea

983
01:19:35,101 --> 01:19:37,057
what I have just been through?

984
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:41,259
Multiply it by 1,000 and you'll have
a vague conception of where I'm at.

985
01:19:41,341 --> 01:19:45,095
Oh! Oh, isn't that typical, Jerry?
It's all a competition!

986
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:49,413
- Tit for tat, tat for tit...
- Stop yelling, for Christ's sake!

987
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:51,969
How are you? Are you OK?
Are you all right?

988
01:19:52,061 --> 01:19:55,610
- 'Where are you?'
- Toluca airport, Jerry.

989
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:58,169
And things are shitty, really shitty!

990
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:01,173
Tell him if he shows up with
the pistol, it'll be OK.

991
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:04,139
'He doesn't care.
He only cares about himself.'

992
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:07,338
Why are you airing
personal matters with strangers?

993
01:20:07,421 --> 01:20:11,016
Oh, let me see. Uh, I don't think
that you really classify

994
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:15,617
someone who you just perpetrated
a killing with a fucking stranger!

995
01:20:15,701 --> 01:20:18,977
And I can't find my Kotex cards
or my credit cards...

996
01:20:19,101 --> 01:20:20,659
Sam, what did you say?

997
01:20:20,741 --> 01:20:22,538
Jerry, just settle down.

998
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:24,179
What'd you do to her?

999
01:20:24,261 --> 01:20:28,573
- Jerry, just settle down. OK?
- Yeah.

1000
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:31,129
We had a situation
but I'm a professional

1001
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:32,973
and I know what I'm doing.

1002
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,655
So why don't we chill out
a minute here?

1003
01:20:35,741 --> 01:20:39,620
- 'Now, what happened? You get lost?'
- Yeah, five years ago.

1004
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:43,410
- What did you...? I can't hear you.
- No, nothing. Nothing.

1005
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:45,969
Nothing. I hope you have something.

1006
01:20:46,061 --> 01:20:48,131
Yeah, you just... You don't...

1007
01:20:48,221 --> 01:20:51,054
Make sure you return her
with all ten toes.

1008
01:20:51,141 --> 01:20:53,575
- Huh?
- 'I understand. I understand.'

1009
01:20:53,661 --> 01:20:57,620
'Just come down here, pick us up.
We'll square things away.'

1010
01:20:57,701 --> 01:20:59,657
You got a very special woman here.

1011
01:20:59,741 --> 01:21:02,653
But we all know
how you can get, right?

1012
01:21:02,741 --> 01:21:04,413
- 'So none of that.'
- What?

1013
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:07,379
This is a time for selflessness.

1014
01:21:07,461 --> 01:21:10,578
What? Wha...?

1015
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:14,414
- You all right?
- Yeah, come on.

1016
01:21:18,021 --> 01:21:19,852
Stupid gun.

1017
01:21:26,141 --> 01:21:27,859
Out!

1018
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:45,295
Leroy) I have to ask you a question.

1019
01:21:46,821 --> 01:21:48,573
And it's an important one

1020
01:21:48,661 --> 01:21:52,893
so I want you to think about the
answer before you give it to me, OK?

1021
01:21:52,981 --> 01:21:54,812
OK.

1022
01:21:55,901 --> 01:22:00,258
When two people really love each
other but they can't get it together,

1023
01:22:00,341 --> 01:22:03,777
when do you get to that point
where enough is enough?

1024
01:22:06,741 --> 01:22:09,380
That... Oh, well, that's...
You know?

1025
01:22:09,461 --> 01:22:13,932
Um, you know it's over when...

1026
01:22:14,021 --> 01:22:19,812
OK, I have, like, these psychosomatic
insomniatic manifestations of...

1027
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:22,051
Well, here's the thing about me.

1028
01:22:22,141 --> 01:22:26,453
I'm a product of my emotions, not a
product of my environment, like him,

1029
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:31,057
which he is, exactly,
just that environmental...

1030
01:22:31,141 --> 01:22:34,292
I-I need sunshine to grow.
That's who I am.

1031
01:22:34,381 --> 01:22:36,611
And with the projection of...

1032
01:22:38,101 --> 01:22:40,012
I have goals.

1033
01:22:45,901 --> 01:22:48,335
- That's your answer?
- Yeah.

1034
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,217
That's not right.

1035
01:22:55,301 --> 01:22:58,771
I mean, there's a right answer here,
but that's not it.

1036
01:23:04,301 --> 01:23:08,340
Look, in my business
you're surrounded...

1037
01:23:08,421 --> 01:23:11,015
by loneliness and finality.

1038
01:23:12,661 --> 01:23:15,494
I don't care what your take is
on an afterlife,

1039
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:19,256
when people die, it's scary,
and they go alone.

1040
01:23:21,141 --> 01:23:24,531
Now, the people that I send off,

1041
01:23:24,621 --> 01:23:27,897
that have experienced love...

1042
01:23:27,981 --> 01:23:30,051
They're a little less scared.

1043
01:23:30,141 --> 01:23:33,690
They're still scared,
but there's a calmness to 'em.

1044
01:23:33,781 --> 01:23:38,297
I think that comes from the knowledge
that somebody somewhere loved 'em

1045
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:40,770
and cared for 'em and will miss 'em.

1046
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:46,980
Now, I see that from time to time
and I am awed by it.

1047
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:57,250
I don't think I'd be telling you this
if it wasn't for Frank.

1048
01:24:00,421 --> 01:24:02,730
Anyway, it's a loaded question.

1049
01:24:02,821 --> 01:24:06,894
Look, when two people
love each other, totally, truthfully,

1050
01:24:06,981 --> 01:24:09,370
all the way love each other,

1051
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:13,852
the answer to that question
is simple, especially in your case.

1052
01:24:15,861 --> 01:24:19,251
When do you get to that point
where enough is enough?

1053
01:24:19,341 --> 01:24:20,933
Never.

1054
01:24:22,021 --> 01:24:24,137
Never.

1055
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:29,692
I just hope Jerry's not stupid.

1056
01:24:50,181 --> 01:24:52,649
What is he driving?!

1057
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:28,217
It's a funky rental.

1058
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:36,093
I know we're all
a little grouchy right now.

1059
01:25:36,181 --> 01:25:38,012
We'll get something to eat,

1060
01:25:38,101 --> 01:25:41,650
you'll get the pistol
and then we'll go our separate ways.

1061
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:44,255
- Really separate ways.
- Don't start.

1062
01:25:44,341 --> 01:25:46,901
Shut up.
I'll start because I have the...

1063
01:25:46,981 --> 01:25:49,336
Why do you do that?
Do not tell me to shut up.

1064
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:51,332
- I count.
- We had an agreement.

1065
01:25:51,421 --> 01:25:54,174
- Shut up.
- Why don't we all shut up a bit?

1066
01:25:54,261 --> 01:25:57,970
- I swear, I will crash this car.
- Jerry, don't do that.

1067
01:25:58,061 --> 01:26:02,134
I will. One more word out of you.
Another word, Sam. One more word.

1068
01:26:02,221 --> 01:26:04,177
I swear to fucking God.

1069
01:26:04,261 --> 01:26:05,819
Naugahyde.

1070
01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:08,369
- All right.
- Jerry!

1071
01:26:08,461 --> 01:26:09,974
- You finished?
- Yes!

1072
01:26:10,061 --> 01:26:12,131
- You gonna shut up?
- Yes, yes, yes!

1073
01:26:12,221 --> 01:26:14,530
Jerry, I will, I will!

1074
01:26:14,621 --> 01:26:16,418
Sam screaming)

1075
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:22,291
Stop the car, Jerry!
Stop the car.

1076
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:28,570
Sam) Stop, stop, stop!

1077
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:30,936
Oh, my God!

1078
01:26:37,421 --> 01:26:39,571
Horn)

1079
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:41,652
Driver) Pendejo!

1080
01:26:43,421 --> 01:26:45,889
Jerry...I want you to know,

1081
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:48,256
you're the craziest fuck I ever met.

1082
01:26:51,781 --> 01:26:55,899
You know what? Go!
Go to Vegas. I've had it!

1083
01:27:25,061 --> 01:27:26,938
Son of a bitch!

1084
01:27:27,021 --> 01:27:29,251
I had a flat down in Florida once.

1085
01:27:30,341 --> 01:27:32,411
Out in the middle of nowhere.

1086
01:27:32,501 --> 01:27:36,938
So I go to the trunk,
there's no spare.

1087
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:40,775
Four hours in the baking sun,
waiting for a truck to come by.

1088
01:27:41,821 --> 01:27:43,652
Ow!

1089
01:27:43,741 --> 01:27:45,572
Now I always check.

1090
01:28:06,181 --> 01:28:07,773
Let me give it a rip.

1091
01:28:09,781 --> 01:28:13,694
Sometimes you need a little more
torque, you know what I mean?

1092
01:28:14,741 --> 01:28:18,734
Wouldn't kill the bastards
to oil these every once in a while.

1093
01:28:18,821 --> 01:28:20,777
Fucking car rentals.

1094
01:28:20,861 --> 01:28:22,419
Yeah.

1095
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:40,371
Gunshot)

1096
01:28:58,101 --> 01:29:00,820
- Walk away, baby.
- What did you do?

1097
01:29:00,901 --> 01:29:02,698
He was gonna kill us.

1098
01:29:02,781 --> 01:29:05,579
What the fuck did you do?
Look at his head!

1099
01:29:05,661 --> 01:29:09,495
Stop! Stop! Listen, listen.
I met Leroy in 1997.

1100
01:29:09,581 --> 01:29:12,015
- And that's not him!
- No, no, Jerry.

1101
01:29:12,101 --> 01:29:14,137
You made a terrible mistake.

1102
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:17,531
He was my friend!
You made a terrible mistake!

1103
01:29:17,621 --> 01:29:20,579
Baby, Leroy is black. Leroy's black.

1104
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:23,459
- OK?
- No.

1105
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:25,816
- Yes! He's black.
- No.

1106
01:29:25,901 --> 01:29:28,369
African-American. A person of colour.

1107
01:29:28,461 --> 01:29:32,420
The guy he killed in Vegas is Leroy.
That's Margolese's Leroy.

1108
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:35,095
So, this guy...

1109
01:29:35,181 --> 01:29:38,253
Oh, I'm such an ass.
Such an ass. Of course.

1110
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:42,573
"Give the gun to Leroy. He'll get it
down to Margolese." Ha fuckin' ha!

1111
01:29:42,661 --> 01:29:44,652
You see? Do you see?

1112
01:29:44,741 --> 01:29:47,301
I'm being set up!

1113
01:29:47,381 --> 01:29:50,817
Nayman hires this prick
to take out Leroy,

1114
01:29:50,901 --> 01:29:54,735
get the gun and pin it all
on Jack-off Jerry.

1115
01:29:54,821 --> 01:29:57,381
Isn't that right, Mr Winston Baldry?

1116
01:29:57,461 --> 01:30:01,090
I met Leroy and there's no way
you could have known that.

1117
01:30:01,181 --> 01:30:04,491
And that's your mistake.
You fucked up.

1118
01:30:21,381 --> 01:30:23,611
I can't believe it.

1119
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:26,852
Every fucking time.
Every fucking time, I fuck up.

1120
01:30:26,941 --> 01:30:30,331
Not this time. This time, I win.

1121
01:30:30,421 --> 01:30:32,537
This time, I win!

1122
01:30:32,621 --> 01:30:35,419
I fucking win! I win!

1123
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:43,813
Oh, my God.

1124
01:30:46,341 --> 01:30:49,139
I'm lucky I didn't
lose you three days ago.

1125
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:55,451
I wanna go home.

1126
01:31:16,261 --> 01:31:20,095
Did you call about your passport?
Did you call the consulate?

1127
01:31:20,181 --> 01:31:22,251
Yeah.

1128
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:24,457
Do you have enough money?

1129
01:31:26,061 --> 01:31:27,972
Yeah, I'm all right.

1130
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:13,615
I wanna ask you a question.

1131
01:32:15,021 --> 01:32:17,091
It's a good one, so think about it.

1132
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:32,933
If two people love each other...

1133
01:32:33,021 --> 01:32:36,809
but they just can't seem
to get it together...

1134
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:43,373
when do you get to that point
of enough is enough?

1135
01:32:47,981 --> 01:32:49,130
Never.

1136
01:33:32,901 --> 01:33:34,493
They'll call.

1137
01:33:34,581 --> 01:33:37,891
I've left 60 messages.
I said it was an emergency.

1138
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:43,971
Why would Nayman ask you
if you like sex and travel?

1139
01:33:44,061 --> 01:33:46,177
W-w-what is it supposed to mean?

1140
01:33:46,261 --> 01:33:49,298
That you fool around or something?
Is that...

1141
01:33:49,381 --> 01:33:53,215
I tell you the whole, long debacle
and this you have a problem with?

1142
01:33:53,301 --> 01:33:56,134
Yeah, I do.
I think that when you ask someone

1143
01:33:56,221 --> 01:33:59,293
who is involved
in a relationship of the heart

1144
01:33:59,381 --> 01:34:03,499
if they like sex and travel, that...
that's m-m-mean-spirited.

1145
01:34:03,581 --> 01:34:07,460
It's stupid. I'll tell you this,
we're not running any more, no.

1146
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:11,819
No, no. So done with the running.
The packing and the running and...

1147
01:34:11,901 --> 01:34:14,734
Sooner or later,
that phone is gonna ring.

1148
01:34:14,821 --> 01:34:17,335
We are going to get
your passport in order

1149
01:34:17,421 --> 01:34:20,060
and you are gonna give the gun
to Margolese.

1150
01:34:20,141 --> 01:34:23,531
Nayman is fucking Margolese.
That has nothing to do with us.

1151
01:34:23,621 --> 01:34:25,771
By the grace of God,
I don't know what,

1152
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:29,376
you have managed to Forrest Gump
your way through this.

1153
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:32,498
And just, if we run now...

1154
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:35,379
we're gonna be running
the rest of our lives.

1155
01:34:38,981 --> 01:34:40,972
We want our life back.

1156
01:34:42,061 --> 01:34:43,972
Yes, baby, we do.

1157
01:34:46,501 --> 01:34:49,618
Jerry) No, that can't be right.
Can you just check again?

1158
01:34:49,701 --> 01:34:51,931
Ow! Baby, don't. Margolese.

1159
01:34:52,021 --> 01:34:54,171
M as in Mary.

1160
01:34:54,261 --> 01:34:58,095
Baby, can you turn that down?
You don't even speak Spanish.

1161
01:34:58,181 --> 01:35:01,617
Real emotion
transcends language, Jerry.

1162
01:35:01,701 --> 01:35:04,613
You don't have to understand
to hear their pain.

1163
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:07,818
No, that's impossible. That's...

1164
01:35:07,901 --> 01:35:11,689
Do you know when? Ay-yi-yi!

1165
01:35:11,781 --> 01:35:13,692
No, no, all right. All right.

1166
01:35:13,781 --> 01:35:17,091
Margolese is out.
He got out this morning. He's out.

1167
01:35:17,181 --> 01:35:20,059
What's going on?
He's not due out till Thursday.

1168
01:35:20,141 --> 01:35:22,814
It is Thursday, hon.

1169
01:35:22,901 --> 01:35:25,051
Dog barking)

1170
01:35:29,501 --> 01:35:31,969
- What is it?
- Shh. Come on.

1171
01:35:32,061 --> 01:35:34,450
Just stay away from the window.

1172
01:35:36,581 --> 01:35:38,537
Shit. Shit.

1173
01:35:40,261 --> 01:35:42,650
Here, give me it.

1174
01:35:44,701 --> 01:35:46,293
Good one.

1175
01:35:54,581 --> 01:35:56,890
What is it, boy?

1176
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:02,259
Hey!

1177
01:36:02,701 --> 01:36:04,214
Get out of there.

1178
01:36:40,141 --> 01:36:42,450
Come on, man. You're freaking me out.

1179
01:36:45,901 --> 01:36:47,016
Huh?

1180
01:36:48,181 --> 01:36:50,297
Ow.

1181
01:37:02,741 --> 01:37:04,936
Where are you taking me?

1182
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:10,011
It's not your fault
you know nothing about this gun.

1183
01:37:10,101 --> 01:37:14,458
You're American.
This gun does not belong to you.

1184
01:38:08,741 --> 01:38:10,493
Whispering)

1185
01:38:15,981 --> 01:38:17,494
Mr Margolese.

1186
01:38:22,101 --> 01:38:25,855
Well, I-I... I don't understand.

1187
01:38:27,981 --> 01:38:29,937
What's it gonna take, Jerry?

1188
01:38:30,021 --> 01:38:31,613
What?

1189
01:38:31,701 --> 01:38:33,419
For the gun, Jerry.

1190
01:38:33,501 --> 01:38:36,652
What's it gonna take for you
to give it to me and not to another?

1191
01:38:38,861 --> 01:38:40,772
You... Man!

1192
01:38:42,421 --> 01:38:44,173
What'll it take?

1193
01:38:44,261 --> 01:38:47,970
I don't know what it takes.
I'm new in the "fuck you" business.

1194
01:38:48,061 --> 01:38:52,100
- You tell me, what does it take?
- I didn't fuck you, Jerry.

1195
01:38:52,181 --> 01:38:54,775
I had Nayman send you down here,

1196
01:38:54,861 --> 01:38:57,773
but I didn't know
he was looking for a buyer.

1197
01:38:57,861 --> 01:39:01,490
When I found out he was,
I didn't know who on my team was...

1198
01:39:01,581 --> 01:39:04,379
still on my team,
or even if there was a damn team.

1199
01:39:04,461 --> 01:39:07,976
Who...? Who the fuck are these guys?

1200
01:39:08,061 --> 01:39:10,495
They work for this man, Tropillo.

1201
01:39:10,581 --> 01:39:13,937
And who the fuck is Trop...?
You know? Not important.

1202
01:39:14,021 --> 01:39:18,458
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't
fight to not give you the gun.

1203
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:20,896
If it comes to that,
someone will leave here

1204
01:39:20,981 --> 01:39:24,337
missing an ear
or not being able to fuck any more.

1205
01:39:24,421 --> 01:39:28,016
One reason, now that you let me know
what you think I'm made of.

1206
01:39:33,101 --> 01:39:34,853
Are you a fatalist, Jerry?

1207
01:39:34,941 --> 01:39:38,172
Uh, I never really thought about it.

1208
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:43,814
Por favor... Gracias.

1209
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:48,813
When you do think about it,

1210
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:54,055
about that afternoon you smashed
into my life, into my car,

1211
01:39:54,141 --> 01:39:56,496
ever think there's anything to that?

1212
01:39:58,021 --> 01:40:00,455
I honestly never thought about it.

1213
01:40:02,421 --> 01:40:04,377
Because of that afternoon,

1214
01:40:04,461 --> 01:40:08,420
I'm doomed to remember a backwards
inmate with a paper clipping.

1215
01:40:10,581 --> 01:40:13,937
When you're in jail, a small box...

1216
01:40:14,021 --> 01:40:17,730
you learn a lot about the fella
you're in a cage with.

1217
01:40:20,541 --> 01:40:24,932
I grew to love that boy,
like he was my own son.

1218
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:27,137
But he was his.

1219
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:31,691
One day the boy came to me
with a clipping.

1220
01:40:31,781 --> 01:40:36,013
"This is my destiny.
This is my birthright."

1221
01:40:36,101 --> 01:40:38,296
It was a story about the pistol...

1222
01:40:38,381 --> 01:40:41,657
how they found it
in the mines, stashed away.

1223
01:40:41,741 --> 01:40:44,619
When I asked why
it meant so much to him,

1224
01:40:44,701 --> 01:40:47,420
the story he told changed my life.

1225
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:54,056
(Tropillo's son) 'The night
before the nobleman's arrival,

1226
01:40:54,141 --> 01:40:58,976
'the assistant could not sleep...
his heart in aching pain.'

1227
01:41:05,381 --> 01:41:08,020
'The day was here when
the gunsmith would present

1228
01:41:08,101 --> 01:41:10,171
'his gift to the nobleman.

1229
01:41:18,181 --> 01:41:21,856
'The nobleman's son
was a notoriously vicious soldier,

1230
01:41:21,941 --> 01:41:24,501
'worldly and wicked.

1231
01:41:24,581 --> 01:41:29,132
'For him, his father demanded
something more beautiful,

1232
01:41:29,221 --> 01:41:32,816
'more perfect than
he'd ever laid eyes on before.

1233
01:41:32,901 --> 01:41:38,692
'But nothing, no words or description
could have given justice to it...

1234
01:41:38,781 --> 01:41:42,217
'or have prepared him
for that gun's flawless grace.

1235
01:41:44,861 --> 01:41:49,377
'When the nobleman's son
saw his intended bride-to-be...

1236
01:41:49,461 --> 01:41:51,611
'it was love at first sight.

1237
01:41:57,901 --> 01:42:01,735
'The nobleman's son took
the mighty weapon into his hands.

1238
01:42:01,821 --> 01:42:03,777
