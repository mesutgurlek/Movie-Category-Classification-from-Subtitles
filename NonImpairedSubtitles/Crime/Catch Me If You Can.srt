I needed the money

and I thought
this list of careers

61
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:22,845

62

63
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:26,522

a tour of the apartment.

It's very, uh, uh,
spacious, Paula.

489

Dad's at the store.

490
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,200
So, Frank...
you're getting to look

491
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:40,000
more like your old man
every day.

492
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,842
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

493
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:46,605
I'll see you later, eh?

494
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:48,558
Wait.

495
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,523
Is this yours?

496
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:57,206
Oh.

497
00:22:57,247 --> 00:22:58,805
Well, thanks, Frank.

498
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:01,077
Uh, that's the President's pin.

499
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,436
I'd be in deep trouble
if I lost that.

Are you hungry, Frankie?

503
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,836
I'll make you a sandwich.

504
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:35,639
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

505
00:23:35,687 --> 00:23:39,475
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.

506
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:43,765
That is not legal,
what they're doing to us.

507

Why aren't you saying anything?

508

You're not going to tell him...

No.

There's nothing to tell.

512

from the tennis club and...

514
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:12,997
when I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.

515

Right?

516
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,878
But you won't say anything

517
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:20,158
because it's...
it's just silly, isn't it?

518
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,118
How could we sue anybody?

519
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:30,205
Oh... do you need
some money, Frankie?

520
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:33,876
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

521
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:36,919
Here, take five dollars.

522

You stay away from me...
I don't know who you are

but if you ever

Frankie! Frank, Frank,
calm down, will you?

534
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,042
I'm Dick Kesner.

535
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,157
Now, I want you
to leave your things here

PAULA:
You don't have to be scared.

539
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,684
I'm right here, Frank.
I'll always be here.

540
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,365
But there are laws.

541
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:46,523
Everything in this country has
to be legal.

542
00:25:46,567 --> 00:25:49,400
So what we need to do is
make some decisions.

543
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,005
That's what Mr. Kesner
is here for.

544
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:53,277
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts

545
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:54,726
but that can be
very expensive, Frank

over their children.

547

Nobody is fighting.

Look at me, Frank.
Nobody is fighting.

Do you remember your grandma,

She arrived this morning.

Hello.

Do you understand what
we're saying to you, Frank?

558
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:31,555
Your father and I
are getting a divorce.

559
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:33,996
(<i>speaking French</i>)

560

Nothing's gonna change.

00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:36,845
We're still gonna see
each other.

562
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,718
Stop it, please, Frank.
Don't interrupt.

563
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:40,962
Frank, you don't
have to read all of this.

564
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:43,999
Most of it's for your parents...
boring adult business...

565
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,686
but this paragraph right here,
this is important

566
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:49,287
because it states
who you're gonna live with...

567
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:51,204
after the divorce...

568
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:53,078
whose custody you will be in.

569
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,119
And there's a blank space
right here.

(<i>Eve speaking French</i>)

571
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,480
And I want you to go

Your mother or your father.

Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

Carl, when do I get
to call my father?

You can call him

FRANK:
<i>Dear Dad:</i>

647
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:18,681
<i>I have decided to become</i>
<i>an airline pilot.</i>

648
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:21,002
<i>I have applied</i>
<i>to all the big airlines</i>

649
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,959
<i>and I have several</i>
<i>promising interviews lined up.</i>

650
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,645
<i>How's Mom?</i>

651
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:27,564
<i>Have you called her lately?</i>

652
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:29,598
<i>Love, your son, Frank.</i>

653
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,559
Hello.

654
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:36,802
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School

655
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:39,315
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

656
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:40,561
You're the young man

657
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,404
who's writing the article
for the school paper.

658
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:43,880
Yes, ma'am, that's me.
I want to know

659
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:45,804
everything there is to know
about being a pilot.

660
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:47,360
What airports
does Pan Am fly to?

661
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,045
What does a pilot make
in a year?

662
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:51,317
And who tells them
where they're gonna fly to?

663
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,482
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

664
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:53,642
Just take 'em one at a time.

665
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:54,802
All right. What does it mean

666
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,360
when one pilot says
to another pilot:

667
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:57,806
"What kind of equipment
are you on?"

668
00:31:57,847 --> 00:32:00,236
They just want to know what kind
of aircraft you're flying:

669
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:01,606
Is it a DC-8, 707,
Constellation?

670
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:04,207
And what about those I.D. Badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

671
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:06,317
Well, every pilot has to have
two things with him

672
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:08,403
at all times: One is
his airline personnel badge...

673
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:10,324
looks just like this one here,
from Pan Am...

674
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,881
the other one is
their FAA license...

675
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:15,157
and that looks just like this.

676
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:18,756
Oh. Sir, do you think I can
make a copy of this

677
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:20,525
to put into my article?

678
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:22,285
Oh, Frank,
you can have that one.

679
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:23,601
It's three years expired.

680
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,160
Aw, thanks!
And what about your I.D. Badge?

681
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:26,606
You have an extra one
I could borrow?

682
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,524
Oh, no, I can't help you there.

683
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,398
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

684
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:31,880
The only way
to get one of those

685
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:34,395
is to become a real live pilot
for Pan American Airways.

686
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:37,117

Pan Am, may I help you?

689
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:41,960
FRANK (<i>Southern accent</i>):
Yeah, hello.

690
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:42,962
I'm calling about a uniform.

691
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:44,725
WOMAN:
Hold for Purchasing.

692
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:45,677
FRANK:
Thank you.

693
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:46,955
WOMAN 2:
Purchasing.

694
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,884
FRANK (<i>Southern accent</i>):
Hi. I'm a copilot

695
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:50,121
based out of San Francisco.

696
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,964
I flew a flight
into New York last night

697
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:52,962
but the problem is

698
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:54,486
I'm headed out to, uh, Paris
in three hours.

699
00:32:54,527 --> 00:32:56,279
WOMAN 2:
How can we help you?

700
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:57,601
FRANK:
I sent my uniform

701
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,399
to be cleaned through the hotel

702
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:01,677
and I... I guess
they must have lost it.

703
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:04,082
WOMAN 2:
<i>They lost a uniform.</i>
<i>Happens all the time.</i>

704
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:06,038
<i>Go down to the Well-Built</i>
<i>Uniform Company</i>

705
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,122
<i>at Ninth and Broadway.</i>

706
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,520
<i>They're our uniform supplier.</i>

707
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:10,159
<i>I'll tell Mr. Rosen</i>
<i>you're coming.</i>

708
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:12,323
ROSEN:
You look too young
to be a pilot.

709
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,005
I'm a copilot.

710
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:15,605
Why so nervous?

711
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:17,399
How would you feel if you, uh

712
00:33:17,447 --> 00:33:19,881
lost your uniform
first week on the job?

713
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:21,406
Relax.

714
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:23,881
Pan Am's got lots of uniforms.

715
00:33:23,927 --> 00:33:26,077
It's gonna be $164.

716
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:28,322
Great. I'II, uh,
I'll write you a check.

717
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,358
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

718
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:32,443
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. Number

719
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:33,522
and then I'll bill Pan Am.

720
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,444
They'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

721
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:39,119
Even better.

722
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:42,924

I sure am, little lady.
What's your name?

731

Celine.

Celine, it's a pleasure

It's a pleasure

Good.

745
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:36,439
Have you stayed with us before?

746
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:39,718
Uh, no, I've been primarily
based on the West Coast.

747
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:42,964
Is it all right if I write you

Uh...

751
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,122
I was also wondering

00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,964
if I could write you
a personal check?

753

For airline personnel, we cash
personal checks up to $100.

Payroll checks
we cash up to $300.

Carl, for those of us who are

you mind telling us
what the hell

you're talking about?

913

numbered zero-one to zero-six.

actually mean something?

If you change...
a zero-two to a one-two

920
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:14,646
that means that check,
which was cashed in New York

921
00:42:14,687 --> 00:42:16,245
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch

Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.

If you were having
so much fun undercover

why did you transfer
to bank fraud?

I didn't transfer.

I was censured

I was punished.

Well, tough luck, Carl.

Five minutes earlier

It's all right.

1174

Ten seconds later,

There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

That's the kind of thing

that can make you
section chief someday.

Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

Shh. Now... what if...

1758
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:47,924
what if I spoke
to your parents, right?

1759
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:49,798
May-Maybe I can
straighten things out, huh?

1760
01:17:49,847 --> 01:17:51,758
Well, I ask them all the time

1761
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:54,321
but they said I still
can't come home.

1762
01:17:54,367 --> 01:17:58,406
And my daddy's... a lawyer.

01:17:58,447 --> 01:18:00,358
Aw...

what if you were engaged
to a doctor?

1766
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,964
Will that change anything?

1767
01:18:14,007 --> 01:18:15,565
What?

1768
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:22,515
What if I went
to your parents...

1769
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:24,603
and I spoke to your father...

1770
01:18:27,927 --> 01:18:31,044
and I asked permission
to marry you?

1771
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:44,797
It's empty.

1772

Nobody here.

Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

1777
01:19:12,607 --> 01:19:17,681
Yes, l-I am a Lutheran,
but, please, call me Frank.

1778
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:20,287
Frank, would you like
to say grace?

1779
01:19:24,887 --> 01:19:28,482
Unless you're not comfortable.

1780
01:19:28,527 --> 01:19:30,438
Absolutely.

Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1783
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:46,763
The first mouse quickly
gave up and drowned

1784
01:19:46,807 --> 01:19:48,957
but the second mouse,
he struggled so hard

1785
01:19:49,007 --> 01:19:51,475
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter

1786
01:19:51,527 --> 01:19:53,404
and he walked out.

- Amen.
- Amen.

1788

Amen. Oh, that was beautiful.

1789
01:20:00,367 --> 01:20:02,835

that cream into butter.

Thank you.

1794
01:20:09,407 --> 01:20:11,045
Frank, have you decided
which hospital

1795
01:20:11,087 --> 01:20:12,839
you want to work at
here in New Orleans?

1796
01:20:12,887 --> 01:20:14,957
Well, um, to be quite honest

1797
01:20:15,007 --> 01:20:18,079
I'm thinking
about getting back into law.

1798
01:20:18,127 --> 01:20:19,799
Oh, my!

1799

Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1800
01:20:22,007 --> 01:20:26,125
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

1801
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:27,998
I practiced law for one year

then I decided why not
try my hand at pediatrics?

1803
01:20:31,287 --> 01:20:33,960
You're just full of surprises.

1804

1813

Maybe Frank could come work
for you, Roger.

1814
01:20:50,447 --> 01:20:52,085
You're always saying

Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth,

I tell you. Meaner than ever.

And that dog of his?

1825

Tell me, Frank, what was
the name of his little dog?

1826

I'm sorry. Uh...

1827
01:21:28,087 --> 01:21:29,964
The dog was dead.

Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

No.

Give me half that eclair
and I'll tell you.

I'm going to figure it out
sooner or later.

Now...

1898
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:57,403
Look at this photograph,
Mr. Stewart.

1899
01:25:57,447 --> 01:26:00,484
It's a photograph
of Prentice York

where they found him, dead.

1901
01:26:02,527 --> 01:26:06,122
Now, here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

1902
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:08,601
This is a photograph
of the defendant's signature

on a canceled check.

1904
01:26:10,087 --> 01:26:12,476
Now, here is an enlargement
of that same signature

1905
01:26:12,527 --> 01:26:13,642
which matches

1906
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:16,565
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon

1907
01:26:16,607 --> 01:26:18,279
which discuss the possibility

1908

of defrauding
the great State of Louisiana.

Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury

1910
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:25,325
this is irrefutable evidence

1911
01:26:25,367 --> 01:26:28,564
that the defendant is,
in fact, lying.

Mr. Conners, this is
a preliminary hearing.

1915
01:26:38,647 --> 01:26:42,037
There is no... defendant.

1916

Well... I sort of

The IRS wants more.

Hey, it's great

Listen, sit down, I...
I want to show you something.

I came here to give you this.

1978

It's an invitation
to an engagement party.

Daddy, I'm getting married.

Can you believe that?
I'm getting married.

You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad.

1982

Listen, I'm getting
a brand-new Cadillac.

I'm getting a $60,000 house.

All-All the jewelry,
all the furs, everything, Dad.

1986

Everything they took from us,
I'm going to get it back.

1987

Now...

has Ma seen you
dressed like this?

1989
01:30:16,727 --> 01:30:20,083
Yeah, she came
to pick up some boxes.

1990
01:30:20,127 --> 01:30:21,685
That's okay, that's okay,
you know why?

1991
01:30:21,727 --> 01:30:23,683
'Cause she... she's going
to the wedding with us.

I'm going to get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1993
01:30:25,527 --> 01:30:26,846
I'm getting you
a brand-new suit.

1994

One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button, black pearl suits.

You'll look great.

Those are nice. Yeah.

1997

She won't see me.

1998

Well, have you tried
to call her?

1999

Uh-uh.

2000

Dad, just call her.
Call her for me.

2003

You call her, and you tell her

2004

I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

Your mother's married now,

- Why won't you sit down?

- Why would she do that to you?
- Come on, sit.

You've stolen almost $4 million.

You think we can just
call that a wedding present?

Nah, this isn't something you

No truce.

the kid would've

2074
01:34:12,767 --> 01:34:14,200
changed his name by now.

2075
01:34:14,247 --> 01:34:16,886
Mm-mm. He can't change it.

2076
01:34:16,927 --> 01:34:18,724
She thinks he's Conners.

2077
01:34:18,767 --> 01:34:20,883
If he loses the name,
he loses the girl.

2078
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:22,440
I can't give you anything

2079

But love, baby

Not at all.
What can I do for you?

2106
01:35:26,247 --> 01:35:29,478
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.

2107
01:35:29,527 --> 01:35:32,360
Is there a problem?

(<i>whispering</i>):
Yeah. Come here.

2111
01:35:36,767 --> 01:35:38,962
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

2112

They're for us, so we can
start a new life... Hey!

What are you doing?
What's wrong?

2114
01:35:42,767 --> 01:35:44,405
We have to leave.

What?!

2116
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:48,084
Brenda, you love me, right?

2117
01:35:48,127 --> 01:35:49,526
Yes.

2118
01:35:49,567 --> 01:35:51,125
I mean, you'd love me
no matter what.

2119
01:35:51,167 --> 01:35:52,077
Yes.

2120
01:35:52,127 --> 01:35:53,037
I mean, you'd love me

2121

or whether I was poor

2122
01:35:54,607 --> 01:35:55,881
or even if I had
a different name.

2123
01:35:55,927 --> 01:35:57,326
Frank, where'd you get
all that money?

2124
01:35:57,367 --> 01:35:58,561
Brenda, listen. A name, right?

2125
01:35:58,607 --> 01:35:59,801
A name, it doesn't matter.

2126
01:35:59,847 --> 01:36:01,360
My name is Frank Conners, right?

2127
01:36:01,407 --> 01:36:02,601
- That's who I am with you.
- Yes.

2128
01:36:02,647 --> 01:36:03,841
But-but we all have secrets.

2129
01:36:03,887 --> 01:36:05,240
You know,
sometimes when I travel

2130
01:36:05,287 --> 01:36:07,482
I use the name Frank Taylor.
That-That's my secret.

2131
01:36:07,527 --> 01:36:09,404
- Frank Taylor?!
- Yeah, Frank Taylor, you know?

2132
01:36:09,447 --> 01:36:10,596
- Frank Black.
- Frank Black?!

2133
01:36:10,647 --> 01:36:11,716
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2134
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:14,361
Why are you saying all this?

2135
01:36:14,407 --> 01:36:17,001
Brenda... Brenda, I don't want
to lie to you anymore.

2136
01:36:17,047 --> 01:36:18,446
All right? I'm not a doctor.

2137
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:20,159
I never went to medical school.

2138
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:22,801
I'm not a lawyer or a Harvard
graduate or a Lutheran.

2139
01:36:22,847 --> 01:36:25,281
Brenda, I ran away from home
a year and a half ago

2140
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:27,079
when I was 16.

2141
01:36:27,127 --> 01:36:29,766
Frank...

2142
01:36:29,807 --> 01:36:31,957
Frank?

2143
01:36:32,007 --> 01:36:33,884
You're not a Lutheran?

2144
01:36:33,927 --> 01:36:36,282
Brenda... you see
all this money?

2145
01:36:36,327 --> 01:36:38,238
You see all this money?
I have more.

2146
01:36:38,287 --> 01:36:40,755
I have plenty more.

2147
01:36:40,807 --> 01:36:41,762
I have enough money

2148
01:36:41,807 --> 01:36:43,604
to last us
for the rest of our lives

2149

- Look.

01:36:45,087 --> 01:36:47,601
Frank, stop teasing me.

2151
01:36:47,647 --> 01:36:48,875
You're Frank Conners.

2152
01:36:48,927 --> 01:36:51,839
You're Frank Conners,
and you're 28 years old and...

2153
01:36:51,887 --> 01:36:53,115
(<i>whispering</i>):
Brenda...

2154
01:36:53,167 --> 01:36:55,078
Why would you lie to me?

2155
01:36:55,127 --> 01:36:57,243
- Brenda, Brenda...
- I want to know your name.

2156
01:36:57,287 --> 01:36:59,278
- Listen to me, Brenda.
- Tell me your name.

2157
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:00,601
We can live anywhere we want

2158
01:37:00,647 --> 01:37:02,160
but you have to trust me,
Brenda.

- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

- Yes.

Excuse me, Mother.

2163

- Yes.

You're going to leave the house
after your parents go to sleep.

You're going to take a taxicab.

2174

You give the taxi driver
this money right here

and you tell him to drive
all through the night.

The International Terminal

Okay, the International

Two days, Brenda. Two days.

You're not going

You have to promise me, now.

01:48:40,367 --> 01:48:41,277
Carl?

2398
01:48:41,327 --> 01:48:42,442
Carl!

2399
01:48:43,847 --> 01:48:45,200
Merry Christmas!

2400
01:48:45,247 --> 01:48:47,966
How is it that we're always
talking on Christmas, Carl?

2401
01:48:48,007 --> 01:48:49,759
Every Christmas
I'm talking to you!

2402
01:48:49,807 --> 01:48:50,922
(<i>laughing</i>)

2403
01:48:50,967 --> 01:48:52,719
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

2404
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:54,678
Hey, are you hungry?
Do you want some beans, Carl?

2405
01:48:54,727 --> 01:48:56,080
They got the best
French beans here.

2406
01:48:56,127 --> 01:48:57,037
Here, give these a try.

2407
01:48:57,087 --> 01:48:58,918
There's two dozen French
police officers outside.

2408
01:48:58,967 --> 01:49:00,525
Carl, I gotta tell you,
they're delicious.

2409
01:49:00,567 --> 01:49:01,636
They wanted to bring you in.

2410
01:49:01,687 --> 01:49:02,802
You want a bite?

2411
01:49:02,847 --> 01:49:04,280
But they needed the help
of an American.

2412
01:49:04,327 --> 01:49:05,476
Are you hungry?
You want a bite?

2413
01:49:05,527 --> 01:49:07,085
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you

2414
01:49:07,127 --> 01:49:08,719
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

2415
01:49:08,767 --> 01:49:10,280
Well, you have a gun?
You have a gun?

2416
01:49:10,327 --> 01:49:11,396
- No gun?
- No.

2417
01:49:11,447 --> 01:49:12,436
No gun.

2418
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:15,639
And-and you're...
and you're telling me what?

2419
01:49:15,687 --> 01:49:17,120
There's, uh,
there's uh... (<i>chuckles</i>)

2420
01:49:17,167 --> 01:49:18,964
There's two dozen
French police officers out there

2421
01:49:19,007 --> 01:49:19,996
right now on Christmas Eve?

2422
01:49:20,047 --> 01:49:21,162
That's what you're telling me?

2423
01:49:21,207 --> 01:49:22,401
Yeah.

2424
01:49:22,447 --> 01:49:23,721
(<i>chuckling</i>):
All right, all right.

2425
01:49:23,767 --> 01:49:25,405
Well, there's no windows here.

2426
01:49:25,447 --> 01:49:27,881
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

2427
01:49:27,927 --> 01:49:28,996
No! No!

2428
01:49:29,047 --> 01:49:31,641
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal.

2429
01:49:31,687 --> 01:49:33,040
Here, you can
put these on yourself.

2430
01:49:33,087 --> 01:49:34,600
No, I can't do that!
I can't do that.

2431
01:49:34,647 --> 01:49:35,716
You know why?

2432
01:49:35,767 --> 01:49:36,802
(<i>panting</i>)

2433
01:49:36,847 --> 01:49:38,280
'Cause I think
you're full of shit.

2434
01:49:38,327 --> 01:49:40,636
I don't... I don't think
there's anyone else out there.

2435
01:49:40,687 --> 01:49:42,518
I think... I think
it's just me and you.

2436
01:49:42,567 --> 01:49:43,761
That's right.

2437
01:49:43,807 --> 01:49:45,684
I think it's just me and you,
and you know what?

2438
01:49:45,727 --> 01:49:47,365
You're going to have
to catch me yourself!

2439
01:49:47,407 --> 01:49:49,967
I wo... we don't have time
for this.

2440
01:49:50,007 --> 01:49:52,077
Ah, that's good. That's good.

2441
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:54,766
Tell me what you want me to see,
huh?

2442
01:49:54,807 --> 01:49:55,762
I wouldn't lie to you.

2443
01:49:55,807 --> 01:49:57,240
Look, you're wearing
a wedding ring.

2444
01:49:57,287 --> 01:49:58,766
You're wearing
a wedding ring, Carl!

2445
01:49:58,807 --> 01:49:59,842
You lied to me about that!

2446
01:49:59,887 --> 01:50:01,240
Didn't you lie about that?!

2447
01:50:01,287 --> 01:50:02,879
You asked me if I had a family.

2448
01:50:02,927 --> 01:50:04,406
I did, but I don't anymore.

2449

Yes? No, no, no,
there is no problem.

2453
01:50:14,767 --> 01:50:16,166
We're coming out right now.

(<i>laughing</i>)

2455
01:50:18,127 --> 01:50:19,765
Whoa, that was good.
That was good.

2456
01:50:19,807 --> 01:50:21,684
What, did you...
you pay some hotel desk clerk

2457
01:50:21,727 --> 01:50:23,763
to make that call for you,
is that what you did?

2458
01:50:23,807 --> 01:50:24,717
It was Captain Luc.

2459
01:50:24,767 --> 01:50:25,882
I've got one minute
to bring you out.

2460
01:50:25,927 --> 01:50:27,246
Captain Luc? Captain Luc!

2461
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:28,197
Ooh, Captain Luc.

2462
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:29,441
Well, Carl, I gotta say

2463
01:50:29,487 --> 01:50:31,478
that-that sounds
pretty official to me

2464
01:50:31,527 --> 01:50:33,597
but like I said, I...
I think it's just

2465
01:50:33,647 --> 01:50:34,921
me and you here,
it's me and you.

2466
01:50:34,967 --> 01:50:36,320
So you're going to have
to catch me.

2467
01:50:36,367 --> 01:50:37,277
Frank. Frank!

2468
01:50:37,327 --> 01:50:39,124
You have to trust me on this!

2469
01:50:39,167 --> 01:50:41,806
These people
have been embarrassed, Frank.

2470
01:50:41,847 --> 01:50:42,916
They're angry.

2471
01:50:42,967 --> 01:50:44,605
You rob their banks,
you steal their money

2472
01:50:44,647 --> 01:50:45,682
you live in their country.

2473
01:50:45,727 --> 01:50:47,445
I told you this was
what was going to happen

2474
01:50:47,487 --> 01:50:49,159
that there was no other way
for it to end.

2475
01:50:49,207 --> 01:50:51,846
Don't make a mistake!

2476
01:50:51,887 --> 01:50:53,002
That's good.

2477
01:50:53,047 --> 01:50:55,242
That's good, Carl, you know?

2478
01:50:55,287 --> 01:50:56,197
Keep pushing that lie.

2479
01:50:56,247 --> 01:50:57,157
Keep pushing it.

2480
01:50:57,207 --> 01:50:58,765
Keep pushing
till you make it true.

2481
01:50:58,807 --> 01:51:01,196
They're going to kill you!

2482
01:51:01,247 --> 01:51:03,807
You walk out that door,
they're going to kill you.

Yeah.

2486
01:51:20,087 --> 01:51:22,555
You have any children, Carl?

2487
01:51:22,607 --> 01:51:26,156
I have a four-year-old daughter.

2488
01:51:26,207 --> 01:51:28,721
You swear on your daughter?

2489
01:51:30,647 --> 01:51:33,002
You swear?

2490
01:51:37,007 --> 01:51:40,204
You swear?

to let me call my father
when we land.

02:01:32,847 --> 02:01:37,363
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

2702
02:01:37,407 --> 02:01:38,999
You'd be placed
in the custody of the FBI

2703
02:01:39,047 --> 02:01:41,083
where you'd serve out
the remainder of your sentence

2704
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:42,765
as an employee
of the federal government.

2705
02:01:45,327 --> 02:01:47,318
Under whose custody?

2706

(<i>phone ringing</i>)

2707
02:01:55,687 --> 02:01:58,247
Hi. L-I'm Frank Abagnale.

2708
02:01:58,287 --> 02:02:00,642
I'm supposed to start work
here today.

2709
02:02:00,687 --> 02:02:03,155
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

2710
02:02:03,207 --> 02:02:05,323
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.

2711
02:02:05,367 --> 02:02:06,720
I'm going to call you back.

2712
02:02:16,327 --> 02:02:19,080
(<i>melancholy melody playing</i>)

2713
02:02:35,767 --> 02:02:37,644
Hello, Carl.

2714
02:02:37,687 --> 02:02:39,245
Welcome to the FBI.

2715
02:02:39,287 --> 02:02:41,243
I'll show you
where you're working.

2716
02:02:48,327 --> 02:02:51,603
Carl... how long
do I have to work here?

2717
02:02:51,647 --> 02:02:54,241
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon.

2718
02:02:54,287 --> 02:02:56,164
45 minutes for lunch.

2719
02:02:56,207 --> 02:02:58,084
No, I...

2720
02:02:58,127 --> 02:03:00,277
I mean, how long?

2721
02:03:02,007 --> 02:03:04,077
Every day.

2722
02:03:04,127 --> 02:03:06,197
Every day, Frank,
till we let you go.

2723
02:03:55,967 --> 02:03:58,003
- (<i>tapping</i>)
- Yeah.

2724
02:03:58,047 --> 02:04:00,880
- Hey, Carl.
- Hi.

2725
02:04:00,927 --> 02:04:03,157
How you doing?

2726
02:04:03,207 --> 02:04:04,560
It's not a good time, Frank.

2727
02:04:04,607 --> 02:04:06,484
I'm clearing my desk
for the weekend.

2728
02:04:09,367 --> 02:04:12,120
Carl, you mind if I come
to work with you tomorrow?

2729
02:04:12,167 --> 02:04:14,123
Tomorrow is Saturday.

2730
02:04:14,167 --> 02:04:16,123
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

2731
02:04:16,167 --> 02:04:17,680
I'll be back to work on Monday.

2732
02:04:17,727 --> 02:04:18,796
You're going to see Grace, huh?

2733
02:04:18,847 --> 02:04:20,360
Well, that's the plan.

2734
02:04:22,847 --> 02:04:23,836
(<i>heavy sigh</i>)

2735
02:04:23,887 --> 02:04:26,037
So what should I do till Monday?

2736
02:04:26,087 --> 02:04:27,725
I'm sorry, kid,
I can't help you there.

2737
02:04:27,767 --> 02:04:28,756
Excuse me.

This is Hanratty.

2740
02:04:37,647 --> 02:04:39,558
Oh, yeah, put him on.

2741
02:04:47,247 --> 02:04:49,124
Mr. Sawyer.

2742
02:04:49,167 --> 02:04:50,919
How are you?

2743
02:04:50,967 --> 02:04:52,878
I have a half a dozen
more checks

2744
02:04:52,927 --> 02:04:54,918
on that tour operator
at the BVI.

for passenger check-in.

2750
02:05:33,327 --> 02:05:36,478
How'd you do it, Frank?

2751
02:05:36,527 --> 02:05:39,644
How'd you pass the bar
in Louisiana?

2752
02:05:39,687 --> 02:05:41,996
What are you doing here?

2753
02:05:42,047 --> 02:05:44,038
Listen...

2754
02:05:44,087 --> 02:05:46,078
I'm sorry I put you
through all this.

2755
02:05:46,127 --> 02:05:48,925
You go back to Europe, you're
gonna die in Perpignan Prison.

2756
02:05:48,967 --> 02:05:50,480
You try to run
here in the States

2757
02:05:50,527 --> 02:05:52,597
we'll send you
back to Atlanta for 50 years.

2758
02:05:52,647 --> 02:05:55,844
I know that.

2759
02:05:55,887 --> 02:05:58,242
I spent four years trying
to arrange your release.

2760
02:05:58,287 --> 02:05:59,959
Had to convince my bosses
at the FBI

2761
02:06:00,007 --> 02:06:02,202
and the Attorney General
of the United States

2762
02:06:02,247 --> 02:06:03,157
you wouldn't run.

2763
02:06:03,207 --> 02:06:05,960
Why'd you do it?

2764
02:06:06,007 --> 02:06:07,360
You're just a kid.

2765
02:06:07,407 --> 02:06:09,125
I'm not your kid.

2766
02:06:09,167 --> 02:06:11,442
You said you were
going to Chicago.

2767
02:06:11,487 --> 02:06:13,318
My daughter can't see me
this weekend.

2768
02:06:13,367 --> 02:06:15,244
She's going skiing.

2769
02:06:15,287 --> 02:06:16,845
You said she was four years old.

2770
02:06:16,887 --> 02:06:17,922
You're lying.

2771
02:06:17,967 --> 02:06:19,480
She was four when I left.

2772
02:06:19,527 --> 02:06:20,846
Now she's 15.

2773
02:06:20,887 --> 02:06:23,924
My wife's been remarried
for 11 years.

2774
02:06:23,967 --> 02:06:26,117
I see Grace every now and again.

2775
02:06:26,167 --> 02:06:28,044
I don't understand.

2776
02:06:28,087 --> 02:06:29,964
Sure you do.

2777
02:06:30,007 --> 02:06:32,567
Sometimes it's easier
living the lie.

2778
02:06:35,887 --> 02:06:38,720
I'm going to let you
fly tonight, Frank.

2779
02:06:38,767 --> 02:06:40,564
I'm not even going
to try to stop you.

2780
02:06:40,607 --> 02:06:42,837
That's 'cause I know
you'll be back on Monday.

2781
02:06:42,887 --> 02:06:46,038
Yeah? How do you know
I'll come back?

No, he hasn't.

HANRATTY:
<i>Good morning.</i>

2793
02:07:30,567 --> 02:07:32,523
I've, uh, called this meeting
to discuss

2794
02:07:32,567 --> 02:07:34,762
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting

2795
02:07:34,807 --> 02:07:37,116
which the unsub is washing
and altering checks

2796
02:07:37,167 --> 02:07:39,044
then passing them
throughout Arizona.

(<i>panting</i>)

2798
02:07:43,087 --> 02:07:44,566
This unsub is a big dog

02:07:44,607 --> 02:07:46,677
passing checks
as large as five figures.

2801
02:07:49,887 --> 02:07:52,720
Sorry I'm late.

2802
02:07:52,767 --> 02:07:54,678
Sorry.

2803
02:07:58,207 --> 02:08:01,483
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

2804
02:08:01,527 --> 02:08:03,438
Why don't we step out
to the bullpen?

2805
02:08:07,607 --> 02:08:11,361
There's impressions
on every line.

2806
02:08:11,407 --> 02:08:15,002
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

2807
02:08:18,567 --> 02:08:19,761
Mind if I take a look?

2808
02:08:23,127 --> 02:08:26,005
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

2809
02:08:27,767 --> 02:08:30,565
Cost the bank $16,000.

2810
02:08:30,607 --> 02:08:32,484
It's a real check.

2811
02:08:32,527 --> 02:08:34,438
Yeah.

2812
02:08:34,487 --> 02:08:35,636
Yeah. It's been washed.

2813
02:08:35,687 --> 02:08:37,564
The only thing original
is the signature.

2814
02:08:37,607 --> 02:08:39,359
But it's perfect, Carl.
I mean...

2815
02:08:39,407 --> 02:08:41,602
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

2816
02:08:41,647 --> 02:08:43,842
No.

2817
02:08:43,887 --> 02:08:45,525
Something new.

2818
02:08:45,567 --> 02:08:47,523
Maybe a nail polish remover
where the acetone

2819
02:08:47,567 --> 02:08:49,444
removes the ink
that's not been printed?

2820
02:08:53,327 --> 02:08:56,160
How did you do it, Frank?

2821
02:08:56,207 --> 02:08:59,085
How did you cheat
on the bar exam in Louisiana?

2822
02:09:04,287 --> 02:09:07,359
I didn't cheat.

2823
02:09:07,407 --> 02:09:10,877
I studied for two weeks
and I passed.

2824
02:09:11,927 --> 02:09:14,122
Is that the truth, Frank?

2825
02:09:14,167 --> 02:09:16,317
Is that the truth?

2826
02:09:16,367 --> 02:09:18,756
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

2827
02:09:18,807 --> 02:09:21,241
He washes off their names
and he puts on his own.

2828
02:09:23,007 --> 02:09:25,157
You're saying that he's a local?

2829
02:09:25,207 --> 02:09:26,435
Well, if it were me, you know

2830
02:09:26,487 --> 02:09:28,682
I'd call the bank first,
I'd check out the balance...

2831
02:09:28,727 --> 02:09:30,285
Make sure there's enough money
in there

2832
02:09:30,327 --> 02:09:31,476
to make it worth your while.

2833
02:09:31,527 --> 02:09:32,596
Exactly.

2834
02:09:32,647 --> 02:09:34,558
You know, Carl, I think
this guy's pretty smart.

2835
02:09:34,607 --> 02:09:36,165
I guess all we have to do now
is catch him.

2836
02:09:36,207 --> 02:09:37,640
We'll start first thing
in the morning.

2837

We'll run the name
Eric Anthony Feeders.

In Nevada, Arizona, California.

Frank Abagnale, Jr. Has
been married for 26 years.

He has three sons and lives
a quiet life in the midwest.

2841
02:09:44,407 --> 02:09:47,001
Since his release
from prison in 1974,

2842
02:09:47,047 --> 02:09:51,598
Frank has helped the FBI capture
some of the world's most elusive

2843
02:09:51,647 --> 02:09:53,797
check forgers
and counterfeiters

2844
02:09:53,847 --> 02:09:57,840
and is considered one of the
world's foremost authorities

2845
02:09:57,887 --> 02:09:59,718
on bank fraud and forgery.

2846
02:09:59,767 --> 02:10:03,396
Frank has also designed many
of the secure checks

2847
02:10:03,447 --> 02:10:07,281
that banks and Fortune 500
companies use every day.

2848
02:10:08,287 --> 02:10:10,118
For his services,
these companies pay

2849
02:10:10,167 --> 02:10:12,601
Frank Abagnale, Jr.
Millions of dollars a year.

2850
02:10:13,687 --> 02:10:18,602
Frank and Carl remain close
friends to this day.
