2
00:00:01,685 --> 00:00:03,145
This has nothing to do with us.

3
00:00:03,282 --> 00:00:06,861
No. Your secret, illegitimate 
child affects neither you nor me.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,014
I found them in my daughter's room.

5
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:09,319
We were trying to help Grace.

6
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:11,834
They've been abusing her.
They had her locked in the closet.

7
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:15,577
Their adoption contracts are 
all about religious indoctrination.

8
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,645
When I think of my child 
brought up like that...

9
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:19,376
Astrid, if you're done gaping...

10
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,737
How can you put up with her?

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,492
She promised to pay my way
through grad school.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,903
We're leaving now.

13
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,597
Honey, there's something 
I need to tell you.

14
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,006
Meg died.

15
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:28,167
The baby?

16
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:29,433
She survived.

17
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:42,725
Hi, ho.

18
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:46,262
What did you say?

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,067
Oh, your uniform.

20
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:50,825
Hi, ho,
it's off to work you go.

21
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:54,430
I guess that makes me Snow White.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,078
You must be on your
way up to see Mopey.

23
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:58,489
How's he doing, Sleazy?

24
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,447
Wouldn't know.
He doesn't come out of his room.

25
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,331
Old italian ladies 
don't grieve like this.

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,265
Boy, he must have really loved Meg.

27
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:09,678
Well, then there's that other thing

28
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,409
you know,
he can't see his baby.

29
00:01:11,512 --> 00:01:12,291
A baby?

30
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,795
How'd that happen?

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,960
There she goes...
the angel of mercy.

32
00:01:30,134 --> 00:01:31,740
Time to fake the doughnut.

33
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,200
Uh-oh.

34
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:38,179

35
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,056

36
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:43,573

37
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:44,697
How about you?

38
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,381
Lost?

39
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:04,523
Oh, quit standing there so smug.

40
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,716
Tomorrow you're just gonna call 
me at 2:00 in the morning

41
00:02:06,766 --> 00:02:08,213
saying you want some company.

42
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:09,825
For your information,

43
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,046
that really doesn't satisfy me, Logan.

44
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,327
Really?

45
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:14,451
You always come.

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,860
Logan told me what happened.

47
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,148
You got to let it go,
Ronnie.

48
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,720
Take a deep breath and let it go.

Just trying to be helpful.

60
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:05,574
So, where were you yesterday?

61
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:07,280
I stayed home.

62
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,906
No, you didn't.
I came by.

63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,650
I stayed home, then in the 
afternoon, I went for a drive.

64
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,179
I called your cell 10 times.

65
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,459
I had it turned off.

66
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,483
Yeah,
I figured that out.

67

God, what's your problem?

68
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:21,167
I needed some time to think.

69
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:24,292
My problem starts with 
finding Kendall in your shower.

70
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:27,361
Kendall? She probably 
got the bedrooms confused.

71
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:28,496
Don't lie to me!

72

I'm nobody's fool.

74
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,259
Perfect. Meg's dead.
I can't see my daughter.

75
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,245
But by all means Veronica
let's make this about you.

76
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:38,633
Why shouldn't it be like any other day?

77
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,790
God, shut up about Meg already!

78

00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,888
<i>Bring it on, bring it on, yeah!</i>

167
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:43,439
<i>Just remember me when</i>

168
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,493
<i>We used to be friends</i>

169
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:47,983
<i>A long time ago</i>

170
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:49,986
<i>We used to be friends</i>

171
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:54,532
[New!] Find out more about this episode in our
dedicated topic on www.forom.com

172
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:14,623
Number five, step forward.

173
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,224
What was that all about?

174
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:29,470
You were picked 
out of the lineup

175
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,994
by a merchant from 
the L.A. Jewelry district.

176
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:33,322
Oh.

177
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,239
What do you mean, oh?

178
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:36,927
I was expecting shock and indignation.

179
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:39,358
Yeah, I know what 
they must be thinking.

180
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:43,811
The witness claims you sold him some 
5-karat diamond earrings for $80,000,

181
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:45,948
earrings that belonged to Celeste Kane.

182
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:48,111
The sheriff thinks you're an accomplice

183
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:51,999
and that you helped Duncan plan 
and finance this kidnapping.

184
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:55,344
That's a lot of thinking for Lamb.
He may tire himself out.

185
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,783
This is not a joke.
This is kidnapping.

186
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:00,345
What Duncan's done is wrong,

187
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:02,463
and if you've helped him in 
any way, you're going to prison.

188
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,771
Now, straighten up.

189
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:08,441
I did sell the earrings,
Duncan asked me to,

190
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:10,504
but not to finance a kidnapping.

191
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:11,915
We had a plan.

192
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:12,711
A plan?

193
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,141
A plan to get custody of the baby...

194
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:16,866
legally.

195
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:19,461
Duncan wanted to hire a lawyer,
but he needed money.

196
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,261
Did you know the 
earrings were Celeste's?

197
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:22,455
I  didn't ask.

198
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:23,253
Veronica.

199
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,263
I figured they were, but his 
parents didn't want Duncan adopting.

200
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,008
Celeste isn't quite ready
to be a grandmother.

201
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,440
Veronica,
listen to me clearly.

202
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:33,914
You're gonna cooperate with Lamb.

203
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:37,366
You're  gonna answer every
question he asks, truthfully.

204
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,147
And when Duncan Kane is found,

205
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:40,207
and he will be found,

206
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:43,862
there's gonna be no doubt 
whose side you were on in all this.

207
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:44,754
Understood?

208
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:49,826
Here's Veronica for you.

209
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,917
Hey, Veronica,
what's the haps?

210
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:56,737
Oh, you know, I didn't think 
there'd be air conditioning, but...

211
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,234
other than that, this is pretty
much how I pictured hell.

212
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,898
She knows where my son is, sheriff.
I guarantee it.

213
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,186
If she doesn't cooperate fully,

214
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:08,798
I want her prosecuted for her 
involvement in the theft of my jewelry.

215
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:10,669
What are you doing here?

216
00:11:11,062 --> 00:11:13,128
Big case, missing person.

217
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,631
So, where do you got him stashed?

218
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,927
All right, enough.
I'll ask the questions.

219
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,804
You're only here as 
a guest of mrs. Kane.

220
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:21,036
Mrs. Kane, a word of advice...

221
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,290
private investigators...

222
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:26,558
just make the work of law 
enforcement officers more difficult.

223
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,908
Save your money. We'll find Duncan.
We'll bring him in safely.

224
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:33,802
It's kind of weird, huh ?

225
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:37,587
Hoping Lamb is competent 
rather than betting he's not?

226
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,327
Keep me posted on any developments.

227
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:46,496
I find comfort in knowing
the child isn't yours.

228
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:48,221
Let's hope she's got your smile.

229
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:49,507
Mr. Vanlowe.

230
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:05,805
Sit.

231
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,830
Write down everything you can think of.

232
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,863
You know what I'm looking for --

233
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,665
fake I.Ds, secret credit cards,

234
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,071
hiding spots, favorite restaurants,

235
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:23,137
anyone who might let him borrow 
a car or a vacation home.

236
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:24,389
Let me ask you a question.

237
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:28,138
Do you think the baby is 
better off now with Duncan,

238
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,831
or with the Mannings?

239
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:31,222
I should have busted you that night.

240
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:34,189
Now my ass is in a sling 
if I don't find the Kane kid.

241
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,546
You're not going home 
tonight unless that pad is full.

242
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,014
When this is all over,
if you left anything off,

243
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:43,573
I will make it my mission to put
you in prison as an accessory.

244
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,253
<i>Nice spiker.</i>

245
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,016
Dig it out, baby.
Dig it out.

246
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,514
Make daddy proud.

247
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,695
Hey, listen, I need 
you to do me a favor.

248
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,550
It's not that favor Bobby Brown
does for Whitney, is it?

249
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:06,406
No.

250
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,139
Yeah, then, what up?

251
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,376
I need you to try to buy some 
ecstasy from a couple P.C.H.Ers.

252
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:12,539
Yeah, no sweat.

253
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,038
I'm like this with those guys.

254
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:19,267
Oh, no, honey,
bad set, bad set.

255
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,852
Don't make daddy hose you down.

256
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:24,949
You're not real complicated,
are you, Dick?

257
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,931
I try not to be.

258
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:32,408
That's everything.

259
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:38,066
Better be.

260
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,058
Waiting for your 
girlfriend to make bail?

261
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:47,725
No, no, no.

262
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,536
Her shift ends at 5:00.

263
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,802
I'm  waiting for you, V-dog.

264
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:53,598
What for?

265
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:55,944
I thought maybe you'd tell me 
where you're keeping Duncan,

266
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:57,364
save us all some time, you know,

267
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,144
earn some karma points.

268
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,099
I have no idea where he is,

269
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,546
and if I did,
you would be the...

270
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:06,124
last person I'd tell.

271
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,167
Am I hearing you right?

272
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,784
Because you'd tell Osama Bin Laden
before you'd tell me?

273
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,937
Because back in my day,

274
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:12,775
we had a little thing
called patriotism.

275
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:15,918
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
It's a negotiation, right?

276
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,623
Okay, let's say I sweeten the pot.

277
00:14:17,675 --> 00:14:18,552
Let's make it...

278
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:22,967
$5,000. The karma points
are yours to keep,

279
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,756
and if you act now, I'll throw
in a free set of steak knives.

280
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,816
I don't know where he is.

281
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,182
All right, say no more.

282
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,800
I gave it a shot.
You can't blame a guy for that.

283
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,511
Hey, Vinnie...

284
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:39,735
you dropped your pen in my bag.

285
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:43,050
You sure it's mine?

286
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:44,427
I don't think I'm missing a pen.

287
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:49,952
"Sugars cabaret invitational
long ball championship."

288
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:56,977
Pretty sure it's yours.

289
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:07,627
Veronica, 72 hours from now,
I'm gonna have that kid back,

290
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:10,519
and you'll wish you 
had those steak knives.

291
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,469
The next question in the 
search-engine olympics.

292
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,504
Contestants, get ready.

293
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:29,384
What is the Varsity Boys' basketball 
team's record in district play?

294
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:30,424
Go!

295
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:32,012
I kill in this game.

296
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:34,224
See, while my nimrod 
classmates are typing in

297
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:37,677
"Neptune High basketball"
and getting 50 pages of results,

298
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:40,094
all I have to do
is type in Wallace's name,

299
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,462
then click the most recent
box score, then...

300
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:45,636
box scores from Chicago?

301
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,587
Wallace lied.

302
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,190
He didn't come back to Neptune
to play basketball.

303
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:51,742
By the looks of this,

304
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,919
he was having a dream 
season in Chicago.

305
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,286
Hey, what's the word?

306
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:59,267
The one they call bootsy told me no

307
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,653
and went on to suggest I perform sexual
intercourse upon my own person.

308
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:04,338
Doesn't he understand?

309
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:06,172
If you could do that,
you'd never come to school.

310
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:07,719
Boy, that's the truth.

311
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:08,599
Then after?

312
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:11,557
- Sold me 10 hits of "E"
-  Mint?

313
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,354
I gave you enough cash for 20.

314
00:16:14,585 --> 00:16:16,519
He gave me the 09er discount,

315
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:17,481
charged me double.

316
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:18,435
And you paid it?

317
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:19,716
What's time to a hog?

318
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:34,961
Off me, boy.

319
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:44,156
If he came to the border, sheriff,

320
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:46,658
it was probably before anyone
knew the baby was missing.

321
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,466
We'd like to consider 
scaling the searches back.

322
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,231
You know, I don't think 
he's left town yet.

323
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,031
It's really a zoo down here.
If you could see it...

324
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,470
I understand perfectly what
this is doing at the border crossing.

325
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:58,268
Let me give it some thoughts.

326
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,003
I'd appreciate if you would, sheriff.

327
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,935
We could really use some relief.

328
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:05,593
Listen, I'm gonna check it out.
We've got the feds coming in.

329
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,880
Maybe we'll call off the dogs.

330
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:11,810
You've got company.

331
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,443
Not now.

332
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,475
It's the FBI.

333
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,337
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

334
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:21,421
- I'd appreciate if you would, sheriff.
- Yes. Bye.

335
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,497
Send them in.

336
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,903
Right in here.

337
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,322
S heriff?

338
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,192
Oh.

339
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:53,409
Agent Morris.

340
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:54,530
Agent Wills.

341
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:56,633
Sheriff Don Lamb.
Take yourselves a seat.

342
00:17:57,115 --> 00:17:57,958
Thank you.

343
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,377
Now, sheriff, I think we should make it
clear right from the get-go

344
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,167
that we are here to get that baby back,

345
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,794
and we are willing to 
combine our resources...

346
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:09,055
I'll share anything that you need...

347
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:11,299
...until such time as you piss us off.

348
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,374
And when that time comes...

349
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:16,219
and it usually comes 
quickly in Sleepyburg or...

350
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:18,226
"world's biggest ball of Stringsville"

351
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,430
 or wherever the hell
we are this week...

352
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:20,879
...when that time comes,

353
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:23,186
we will cut you out like
you were a meter maid.

354
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:25,018
You don't get the photo op,

355
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,830
and you don't get the fruit basket.

356
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:29,624
So, repeat after me.

357
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:33,043
Team.

358
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,925
Me.

359
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:39,354
Team.

360
00:18:40,717 --> 00:18:41,710
Come on, you can do it.

361
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,205
Team.

362
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:45,869
Me.

363
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:47,293
Me.

364
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,633
Great.

365
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,037
So, why don't you get us up to speed
with what you've been doing here.

366
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:58,110
Is the sheriff around?

367
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,686
He's in with the FBI.

368
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:03,131
You're Veronica Mars, aren't you?

369
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:04,697
That's me.

370
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,586
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.

371
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:07,973
Great.

372
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,623
You ever hit the clubs 
in L.A., Veronica?

373
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:16,591
I'm 18.

374
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,826
Yeah, show me a club that'll care.

375
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:20,883
I moonlight over at club thin.

376
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,068
Club thin?

377
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,243
I'm a bouncer.

378
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:24,944
Well I didn't think 
you were a cage dancer.

379
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,330
The reason why I ask --

380
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,029
you come up, I'll get you in.

381
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:30,106
Okay.

382
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:31,905
Cool.

383
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:34,141
Yes?

384
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:37,951
Sheriff, Veronica Mars
is looking for you.

385
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:39,940
She says she has something
you might be interested in.

386
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,467
Mars?
You mean the girlfriend?

387
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:42,909
Put her in interrogation.

388
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:45,505
Ex-girlfriend, ugly breakup,
from what I heard.

389
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:46,570
Before we go in there,

390
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,417
you should probably know something
about Veronica Mars.

391
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,416
We need to be careful with this one.

392
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:52,618
She's slippery.

393
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:58,570
Sheriff, we have interrogated
Al Qaeda members at Gitmo.

394
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,212
I think we can handle a teenage girl.

395
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:08,102
Nick and Jessica.

396
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,097
Is nothing sacred?

397
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:13,799
Whoa, Agent Wills,
call for backup.

398
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,360
- Just the chopper?
- Snipers.

399
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:20,262
What is it, Veronica?

400
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,398
Who are the suits?

401
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,325
Agent Morris, agent Wills...

402
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,134
...they're with the FBI.
What do you got?

403
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:31,956
Duncan may have taken his computer,
but he had a .Mac account.

404
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,831
He used it to back up his laptop.

405
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:34,640
What's a .Mac?

406
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:38,185
Online storage.
Users can back up their files or...

407
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,764
synchronize their computers,
calendars, addresses.

408
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:41,562
Browser bookmarks.

409
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:43,413
It wasn't on your list?

410
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:46,232
I just thought of it,
and I came straight here.

411
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:48,839
I can get a warrant 
so we can search it.

412
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:51,355
Yeah, get the computer
boys to break the password.

413
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,609
Sheriff, border patrol on line one.

414
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,711
Border patrol?
Don't bother.

415
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,410
Duncan hates Mexico.

416
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,609
Is that so, brer rabbit?

417
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:02,095
Yeah, this is Lamb.

418
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:03,946
No, don't back off 
those searches at all.

419
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,436
No, not at all.

420
00:21:07,384 --> 00:21:09,710
Veronica, why don't you 
wait outside in the hall?

421
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,522
Why don't you?

422
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:13,291
Your next option is a cell.

423
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:23,000
We'll take a coffee 
when you get a minute.

424
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:29,078
- Sacks, two coffees.
- What?

425
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:33,614
So...

426
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:37,043
the FBI.

427
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,227
I've thought about it,
you know?

428
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:43,300
But big fish, small town has its perks.

429
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,706
Still, who knows?

430
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:45,992
I still might apply.

431
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,046
You go to college?

432
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:48,016
For a year.

433
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:50,577
Blew out a knee at southwest
Texas playing ball.

434
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:51,748
Speak a foreign language?

435
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:53,518
A little mexican,
enough to get by.

436
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:55,564
I tell them to turn their music down.

437
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,457
Any expertise in computer science, law,

438
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:00,544
physics, chemistry,
forensics, mathematics?

439
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,654
Expertise?

440
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:06,259
Small town, big fish...

441
00:22:06,632 --> 00:22:07,827
You know,
I'd ride with that.

442
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:16,309
I don't know what 
you're talking about, Weevil.

443
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:18,503
I'm not in business
with the Fitzpatricks.

444
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:20,815
I know you're lying,
Hector.

445
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:23,579
I know you sold "E"
to an 09er just today.

446
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:24,320
That?

447
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,501
Yeah, that.

448
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,372
You did it,
didn't you?

449
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:30,487
Yeah, but I didn't get it 
from the Fitzpatricks.

450
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:32,881
Some white boy asked
me to get him some.

451
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:34,929
He looked dumb and desperate,

452
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:36,579
so I said I'd get it 
for him at $40 a hit.

453
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:37,905
He said yeah, so...

454
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:38,749
So what?

455
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:42,247
So I got it from this other 
white boy who I know deals.

456
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:43,235
He's lying.

457
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:45,100
What white boy?

458
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:47,382
What was so wrong?

459
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:50,483
I made a few bucks selling 
from one 09er to another.

460
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,723
Come on. Like you know
an 09er drug dealer?

461
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:54,001
Who was it?

462
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,622
My sister works with his dad.

463
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:57,732
I want a name.

464
00:23:00,437 --> 00:23:02,941
Veronica,
they got into the files.

465
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,171
They need you.

466
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:08,707
That was quick.

467
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:10,181
Two hours for the search warrant,

468
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:12,380
10 minutes to break his password.

469
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:13,434
What was it?

470
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,434
Enak gem.

471
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:17,867
What?
What's she gonna do with it?

472
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,197
Enak gem?

473
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:20,627
"Meg Kane" backwards.

474
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:22,376
Miss Mars,

475
00:23:22,626 --> 00:23:26,111
what can you tell us about 
Duncan Kane's sailing ability?

476
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:28,749
Duncan's been sailing
his whole life. Why?

477
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,484
Duncan bookmarked a boat for sail.

478
00:23:30,584 --> 00:23:31,843
We tracked down the seller.

479
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:35,677
Turns out he sold it last week
to a teenage boy who paid cash.

480
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:38,958
I assume that's a generous 
use of the term "we"?

481
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,291
I got a hundred bucks 
says he's heading south.

482
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,092
What do you think Veronica? Want to put
your money where your mouth is?

483
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:46,673
How much does your 
boyfriend hate mexico, huh?

484
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:48,545
Isn't gambling illegal?

485
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:50,498
That's what I thought.

486
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:53,521
It's the coast guard.
They spotted the boat.

487
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:55,092
It's ignoring their warning calls.

488
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,869
They're preparing to board.

489
00:23:57,393 --> 00:23:59,063
That kid's gonna get himself killed.

490
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:00,489
Put it on the speaker.

491
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:05,122
<i>There's no one on deck.
Our men are checking down below.</i>

492
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:06,841
<i>Anything?</i>

493
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:08,495
<i>We're all clear.</i>

494
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,675
<i>No one on board.</i>

495
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,578
<i>But we have found dirty diapers 
and 12 empty cans of spaghettios.</i>

496
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,292
What about history of mental issues?

497
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,844
Any chance that he just said,

498
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:22,948
"goodbye, cruel world"?

499
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:26,546
Duncan didn't kill himself,
and he didn't kill his baby.

500
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:28,095
Somebody picked him up.

501
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:30,819
He's still on the run.

502
00:24:56,854 --> 00:24:58,250
Morning, Sam.

503
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:01,028
Morning, Ralph.

504
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:04,193
Fritter?

505
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:06,409
You should be out looking for Duncan.

506
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:11,190
Oh, right! Duncan Kane.

507
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,726
I got so swept up in your beauty,
I almost forgot my assignment.

508
00:25:16,778 --> 00:25:19,952
If you do find him and
he gives you any trouble,

509
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,193
will you give him this?

510
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:27,487
Will do.

511
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:40,690
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

512
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:43,611
Do you remember last year

513
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,128
when you looked down on me 
like you were so much better?

514
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:50,340
Yeah. Did you get the impression
something has changed?

515
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,109
Well, yeah.

516
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:56,442
It seems both our families are 
in the domestic staffing industry.

517
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,822
That makes us like family.

518
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,367
I steal cars. You sell drugs.

519
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:03,824
Hey, I can hardly tell 
where you end and I begin.

520
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:04,801
I get it.

521
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,423
What can I get you?

522
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:09,222
A little crank,

523
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,463
some blow?

524
00:26:10,664 --> 00:26:12,361
Just tell me the name of your supplier.

525
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:13,750
Yeah, that's not happening.

526
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:15,198
Is it the Fitzpatricks?

527
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:16,619
The Fitzpatricks?

528
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:20,543
They take a blowtorch to you
if you're short a dime bag.

529
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:22,991
I'm not that dumb.

530
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,384
Am I free to go?

531
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,262
Have a nice day.

532
00:26:39,526 --> 00:26:40,569
You believe him?

533
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:43,276
Don't you?

534
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,041
One of my boys is mixed up
with the Fitzpatricks. I know it.

535
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:52,443
Has it crossed your mind that maybe
the one mixed up with the Fitzpatricks

536
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:53,605
is the one that's already dead?

537
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:57,264
You remember when Karen and Patrick
Fitzpatrick still went to school here

538
00:26:57,874 --> 00:26:58,886
back when we were freshman?

539
00:26:59,503 --> 00:27:01,233
They were like seventh-year seniors.

540
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,168
The only reason they stuck around was 
to keep the high-school drug trade going.

541
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,290
As soon as this school got 
smart and expelled them,

542
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,752
my predecessor...

543
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:08,828
the reaper, gus.

544
00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:12,180
Yes, the reaper,
decided to expand our business.

545
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:14,925
A couple months in,
he disappears like Jimmy Hoffa.

546
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:16,636
No one's seen him since.

547
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:18,190
You know why the reaper
was called that?

548
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:19,104
He lost a bet?

549
00:27:19,188 --> 00:27:21,657
His name...
Gustavio Toombs.

550
00:27:22,022 --> 00:27:23,666
He was Felix's big brother.

551
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:26,917
So, no, Felix wasn't working 
with the Fitzpatricks,

552
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:28,177
no way in hell.

553
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:40,765
Gonna eat your cake?

554
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:41,678
Take it.

555
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,810
I got a little present for you.

556
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:47,776
What is it?

557
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,072
Just a little scrapbook I put together.

558
00:27:50,476 --> 00:27:52,924
You were kicking butt in Chicago...

559
00:27:53,577 --> 00:27:56,160
8 points, 11 assists a game?

560
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,426
Undefeated?

561
00:27:58,881 --> 00:28:00,177
I wanted to tell you.

562
00:28:00,228 --> 00:28:02,045
Why did you really 
come back, Wallace?

563
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:05,067
If you read these stories, then you know
my new teammate was Rashard Rucker.

564
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:06,559
Is that supposed to mean something?

565
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:09,376
Yeah. He's the best high 
school player in the nation,

566
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:10,777
this year's Lebron James.

567
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:15,175
Just before christmas,
me and Rashard,

568
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,295
a couple of guys on the team,
hit this house party.

569
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:21,598
Rashard had a few beers, but
he said he was okay to drive.

570
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:23,163
On the way home,

571
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,547
this wino staggered out
in front of the car.

572
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:26,954
Oh, Wallace.

573
00:28:27,674 --> 00:28:28,170
He hit him.

574
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:30,844
I was yelling for him to stop,

575
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:31,596
but he panicked.

576
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:33,769
We drove to his uncle's.

577
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:34,894
His uncle's?

578
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:37,581
He's Rashard's agent,
manager, boss.

579
00:28:38,326 --> 00:28:41,551
He said we probably hit a dog and 
we should just keep our mouths shut.

580
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:45,675
"Millions of dollars are at stake." 
But I couldn't just let it go.

581
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:50,838
I couldn't go to practice and 
just pretend it hadn't happened.

582
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:54,014
So, I thought if I came back here,

583
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,336
I could just forget about it.

584
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:57,878
You know,
you could have told me.

585
00:28:57,879 --> 00:28:59,239
No, I couldn't.

586
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,241
Why?

587
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,350
Because you would've stayed.

588
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:03,379
You'd have done the right thing.

589
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,176
I'm embarrassed I didn't.

590
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:10,182
Hello?

591
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,124
Veronica, it's me.

592
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:12,147
Duncan, what are you doing?

593
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,399
Where are you?

594
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:14,681
You got to turn yourself in.

595
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,535
Where I am isn't important.
I'm doing the right thing.

596
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,690
No, you're not.

597
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:19,820
You need to turn yourself in.

598
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,509
You're not ready to raise that baby.
We'll win in court.

599
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,729
There's no way I'll ever...

600
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:24,702
No, don't hang up.

601
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:26,080
Tell me where you are.

602
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:27,353
You know what the Mannings...

603
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:29,455
Duncan, you're gonna get 
yourself thrown in prison.

604
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:32,072
They think I helped you.

605
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:38,508
You got it?

606
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:40,285
He's up in big bear.

607
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,431
Just give me five minutes.

608
00:29:42,591 --> 00:29:44,135
I'll have it down to a building.

609
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:45,992
We can be there in two hours.

610
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:48,889
Sheriff, we appreciate
your time, your effort,

611
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:51,449
and your cooperation,
but we got it.

612
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:20,831
It's time.

613
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:28,372
Duncan, she's beautiful.

614
00:30:29,113 --> 00:30:29,784
I know.

615
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,162
We're doing the right thing.

616
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,960
I think so.

617
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,802
You ready to travel?

618
00:30:40,348 --> 00:30:41,835
Ready for a big trip?

619
00:30:44,614 --> 00:30:47,149
The FBI is heading up to Big 
Bear. We got to move.

620
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:49,575
Kendall?

621
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:52,800
Everyone bought it,
including her.

622
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:53,925
The boat?

623
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,201
The same.

624
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,278
Everything's in motion.

625
00:30:57,348 --> 00:30:59,464
We got to go now,
or things are gonna fall apart.

626
00:30:59,514 --> 00:31:00,921
Veronica,
slow down one minute.

627
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,351
After we leave this room,
we can't call each other,

628
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,030
e-mail each other,
see each other...

629
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:06,605
Stop.

630
00:31:09,806 --> 00:31:11,480
Goodbye, Veronica.

631
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:12,715
I love you.

632
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,312
Always have, always will.

633
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:21,121
You better.

634
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:28,028
Sheriff.

635
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:29,267
Yeah?

636
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:31,104
We got a hit on Veronica's ATM card.

637
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:31,928
Where?

638
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:34,146
Mexico, a hotel near Jacumba.

639
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,666
It's big with american surfers.

640
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:41,940
I told them, didn't I?

641
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:44,182
Everything out of that
girl's mouth is a lie.

642
00:31:44,575 --> 00:31:46,005
Let's see how the FBI likes it

643
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:49,258
 when this high-school-educated 
local lawman brings back the prize.

644
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,739
It's veronica.
Leave a message.

645
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:58,498
Veronica...

646
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:02,744
Hey, I need to see you 
at home A.S.A.P., Kiddo.

647
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,366
We need a little 
daddy-daughter time.

648
00:33:11,363 --> 00:33:12,522
He knows you can shoot,

649
00:33:12,716 --> 00:33:13,772
just like I know you can shoot.

650
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:14,882
Wallace fennel?

651
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:16,421
Yeah.

652
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,515
Ernie sayers,
chicago statesman.

653
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:20,221
I was hoping to ask 
you a few questions.

654
00:33:22,264 --> 00:33:23,383
The night of december 14th,

655
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,366
a homeless man was 
the victim of a hit-and-run.

656
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:26,841
You mind?

657
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:31,885
That man is paralyzed 
from the waist down.

658
00:33:32,647 --> 00:33:35,040
Now, a convenience-store clerk 
who was locking up says...

659
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:39,305
...that the car that hit him was a red
hummer with 22-inch spinning rims.

660
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:41,109
Do you know how many of 
those there are in Chicago?

661
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:43,824
Less than you'd think.

662
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:46,175
I talked to some kids 
from your old school.

663
00:33:46,446 --> 00:33:48,588
They said that you,
Rashard Rucker,

664
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:51,784
and a couple of teammates left a house
party around 2:00 A.M. that night.

665
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:53,449
So, what's the question?

666
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:55,209
I guess the question is,

667
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:57,242
what kind of man were 
you planning on being?

668
00:34:00,602 --> 00:34:03,145
<i>[Old 97 - "four leaf clover"]</i>

669
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:29,004
<i>I got a four leaf clover</i>

670
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:32,570
<i>It ain't done one single lick of good</i>

671
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,596
<i>I'm still a drunk,
I'm still a loser</i>

672
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,084
<i>Living in a lousy neighborhood</i>

673
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:43,208
<i>Why don't you come over?</i>

674
00:34:43,256 --> 00:34:45,087
<i>I'll show you my four leaf clover</i>

675
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:46,729
<i>Who am I trying to kid?</i>

676
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:50,021
<i>I'm not the kind of guy you'd go for</i>

677
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:54,602
<i>I got a four leaf clover</i>

678
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:59,795
<i>But I ain't got no hope of getting you</i>

679
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,291
¿usted lo ha visto?

680
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:18,148
No.

681
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,117
But you all look alike to me.

682
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:25,173
Try the restaurant up the road.

683
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,951
If they take you away,

684
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:33,852
if you're sent to prison...

685
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:36,182
You read the letters,
though, right?

686
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,981
From Meg to child protection services...
they're about her parents.

687
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:43,750
It's not just your life you're 
gambling with, Veronica.

688
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:45,857
I would not survive without you.

689
00:35:46,153 --> 00:35:47,529
Do you understand what you've done?

690
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:53,912
We had to do it.

691
00:35:53,964 --> 00:35:55,133
I know you think you did.

692
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:55,789
We did.

693
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:57,886
You played me, Veronica.

694
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,830
I had to.

695
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,337
I love you.

696
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:09,278
I'll always love you,

697
00:36:10,442 --> 00:36:12,902
but I don't know how 
I'll ever trust you again.

698
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:30,251
Mr. Mars, we have a warrant
to search your premises.

699
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:51,282
Is this really necessary?

700
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:54,621
Hasn't my daughter 
cooperated in every way asked?

701
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:56,505
Funny thing happened 
in big bear, mr. Mars.

702
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:59,036
There was no sign of 
Duncan Kane anywhere.

703
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,184
But the manager of the condo did 
show a model unit to a cute,

704
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:03,201
young, blond woman.

705
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:08,073
We did find this mini cassette in 
a dumpster behind the complex.

706
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:10,325
<i>Where I am isn't important.
I'm doing the right thing.</i>

707
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,762
<i>There's no way I'll ever
get to keep the baby now.</i>

708
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,555
<i>I thought you'd understand.
I thought you'd help.</i>

709
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:16,219
<i>You know what the Mannings
would do to her.</i>

710
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,950
<i>Forget it. Forget it.
We'll go it alone.</i>

711
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:22,434
And I asked myself,

712
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:28,030
"is it possible to have an unrehearsed
conversation with a tape recording?"

713
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:31,401
I don't think so.

714
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:34,228
Sounds like they got you, honey.

715
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:38,963
Well, think of the money 
we'll save on a prom dress.

716
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:41,309
I'm gonna make a sandwich.
Anyone want a sandwich?

717
00:37:43,566 --> 00:37:44,775
You're cool, mr. Mars.

718
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,066
You're very cool.

719
00:37:46,421 --> 00:37:47,854
And you got a cool daughter.

720
00:37:49,507 --> 00:37:52,458
But kidnapping cases don't go 
away. You should know that.

721
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,772
Is that a no?

722
00:37:57,223 --> 00:37:58,179
Almost done?

723
00:37:58,575 --> 00:37:59,926
Getting there.

724
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,038
Oh, hey, man,
I got something for you.

725
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:10,863
What's this?

726
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:13,857
I was gonna put that on your buddy's 
chest before he got himself killed.

727
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:18,590
Good-looking girl.
Who is it?

728
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:22,536
The name's Molly Fitzpatrick.

729
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:28,283
Couple of hours ago he asked me
where there was a grocery store,

730
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,422
but I didn't see a baby.

731
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,232
What did you tell him?

732
00:38:31,897 --> 00:38:33,513
Another few miles, south,

733
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:34,966
past the old train station.

734
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,010
Thanks.

735
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,368
It might not be the guy, man.

736
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:41,234
