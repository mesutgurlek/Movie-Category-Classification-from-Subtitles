1
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:49,497
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey, it's Chicken-Noodle Campbell.

2
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:51,058
Shouldn't you be sittin' in a high chair?

3
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,333
Coroner's report.

4
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:54,171
Why don't you just try crack?

5
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,612
You call that humor?

6
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,974
The Captain says no more 976 calls.

7
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:14,615
Mr. Love Beads, you'll have to seek
higher enlightenment somewhere else.

8
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,769
I'm Lieutenant Cole.
Been assigned to the case.

9
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,212
They asked me to come
and look at the file.

10
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,369
Didn't mean to be discourteous.
Nice to meet you.

11
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,734
I heard about you.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

12
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,572
You worked in New York, right?
DeMarco killings?

13
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,458
This ain't New York
and this ain't the DeMarco killings.

14
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,450
We work as a team around here.

15
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,368
You know, the way I work is
I just like to solve the case.

16
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,529
I don't even care who gets the credit.

17
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,575
Beautiful. That's that.

18
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,772
We call this guy, "The Family Man."

19
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:43,373
He's killed six families
in the last eight months.

20
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:44,687
All ritual killings.

21
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,691
Have you found any connection
between the victims at all?

22
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:50,088
Other than the fact
that they're all Catholic...

23
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:52,295
...which ties into the crucifixion ritual, no.

24
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,370
They just found two more.

25
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,371
Fresh kill. Today's your lucky day.
Let's go.

26
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,011
This ain't the same, Jim.

27
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,294
Yeah, this is the first one in a motel.

28
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:31,128
All the rest have taken place
in their houses.

29
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:33,494
Normally, we can ID the couple, but...

30
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:36,572
...other than that,
it's pretty much the same MO.

31
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,493
No, there's a lot more than that goin' on.
I mean, this is different.

32
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:50,937
Are you married or what?

33
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,975
This is what I hate about new partners.

34
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,129
They always want to get personal.

35
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:58,373
I don't want to talk about it, all right?

36
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:02,299
Forget that I ever mentioned
anything at all.

37
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,611
Are you married, or what?

38
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,172
No, I'm not married.

39
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,610
Every cop I know who's married,
has a wife who won't sleep with him...

40
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:12,848
...two kids who don't listen to him...

41
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,373
...and a dog that'd rather lick himself
than fetch the paper.

42
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,132
All units respond to a barricaded suspect
with hostages...

43
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,618
...at the Saint Edmund's School.

44
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,259
-Possible suicide.
-Yeah, we're in that area.

45
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,178
-Hey, what are you doin'?
-It's right over here.

46
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,614
No, man. That's suicide. We're Homicide.

47
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,452
If some dumb ass wants to jump
off a buildin', that's his problem.

48
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,928
Somebody pushes his ass off a buildin',
then call me.

49
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:35,613
The way I look at it, death is death.

50
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:38,134
We gotta have compassion for the dead,
the dying...

51
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,255
...the could-be-dying
and the about-to-be-dead.

52
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,897
I'm going. I'm going.

53
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,775
Faster, come on. Quickly, quickly.

54
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:09,415
Detective Cole. Detective Campbell.
What have we got?

55
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,330
A boy named Johnny Deverell.
He's a senior.

56
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,330
He's got a gun and a class full of kids.

57
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:14,454
That's nice.

58
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,416
-What does he want?
-I don't know.

59
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:19,809
His girlfriend broke up with him.
He's got her up there too.

60
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,737
Has he been in trouble before?

61
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,538
He was arrested for drugs.
They had him seeing a therapist.

62
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:27,008
Yeah, must have been the wrong therapist.

63
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,733
Keep everybody quiet.
Keep everybody back.

64
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:34,010
Man, you know this ain't our gig.

65
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,532
Look, it's a love-sick kid.

66
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:38,258
A well-armed, love-sick kid.
Why do you think they got SWAT?

67
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,977
'Cause they look good in black.

68
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:43,654
See if you can get me a couple
of cell phones right away.

69
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,578
Johnny, please stop it.
They're gonna hurt you.

70
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:52,015
Shut your mouth, Millie!
I'm not in the mood for this!

71
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,168
Put the gun down, Johnny.

72
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:55,329
-Just put it down!
-Shut up!

73
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,689
Johnny, stop it! Please, Johnny!

74
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,014
This is Detective Cole, LAPD.

75
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:08,418
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here to help you.

76
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,171
I gotta get into a dialogue with you...

77
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,252
...before the guys in black get here,
'cause they don't listen to anybody.

78
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,056
I don't want you to get hurt.

79
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,057
I want you to step over to the window
and look at me.

80
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,290
You'll see that I'm unarmed.

81
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,338
Nobody move!

82
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,575
Come on over. Step over to the window
and look at me.

83
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,454
Sorry, Johnny. Put the gun down.

84
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,894
I don't want to shoot you,
and you don't want to be dead.

85
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:45,934
Why not?

86
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,737
Drop the gun! Come on.

87
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,098
What are you on?

88
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,857
Don't talk to me like you know me!

89
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,850
You want me to start shooting?

90
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:04,257
You're right, I don't know you.

91
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:06,136
I'm gonna put my gun down.

92
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,217
We'll start out like this.

93
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,897
Now, what's the problem?

94
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,777
You don't understand, man.

95
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,898
You don't understand.
I can't go back with him.

96
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,648
I can't, I won't.

97
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:19,455
With who?

98
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:22,576
You don't understand.
I can't go back with him.

99
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:23,575
With who?

100
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:25,331
I can't. I won't.

101
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,212
I love you, Johnny!

102
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,012
I love you, too.

103
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:42,132
I love you, too.

104
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:45,172
I hate this job.

105
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,498
-Calm down, son.
-Wait!

106
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,729
Watch your head. Calm down.

107
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,649
Now, you see?
SWAT would have killed this boy.

108
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,491
You know it, and I know it.

109
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,088
-You're not a freelancer, okay?
-Oh, no.

110
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,978
This ain't New York.

111
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,014
No shit.

112
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:09,089
Frank Deverell. It figures.

113
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,130
Rich people's kids are always fucked up.

114
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,335
Lieutenant, where will I find
Detective Cole?

115
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,649
-Right down there, sir.
-Thank you.

116
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,371
-Detective Cole?
-Yes, sir.

117
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,653
I'd like to thank you
from the bottom of my heart...

118
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:26,412
...for not letting my stepson
take his own life.

119
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,332
You look like a very sincere individual,
and l...

120
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,255
...really appreciate your coming down.
So nice of you.

121
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:38,618
Well, I sincerely hope that
if there's ever anything I can do for you...

122
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:40,690
...you won't hesitate to ask me.

123
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,335
You'll be the first one I dial.

124
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:45,297
Let's get out of here.

125
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:50,694
Nice coat.

126
00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:59,809
Detective Cole, can I have a minute?

127
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,014
I'm kind of busy right now.

128
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:05,409
I'll be very brief. Mr. Deverell asked me
to speak to you...

129
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:07,490
...on behalf of his stepson.

130
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,854
About what?

131
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,658
Mr. Deverell feels your testimony
would be very helpful...

132
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:14,811
...in getting Johnny acquitted on grounds
of temporary insanity.

133
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,096
There's a little problem.
First of all, I don't think he's insane.

134
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,330
Second of all, I like to testify
as to what actually happened.

135
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:22,818
Look, Detective...

136
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:28,010
...Johnny's been going
through a very difficult time.

137
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,454
He needs treatment, not prison.

138
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,689
Now, Mr. Deverell, as you may know...

139
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:38,488
...he's a very important man,
and a man with a lot of influence...

140
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,093
...a man who could help or hurt a career.

141
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,573
Just what is it that you do for this man?

142
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,613
I'm in charge of Mr. Deverell's security.

143
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:52,738
Could have fooled me.
I thought you were an attorney.

144
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,855
I want you to deliver a message for me.

145
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,693
You tell your asshole boss that nobody,
nobody threatens me.

146
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,929
I understand. I'll convey your feelings
to Mr. Deverell.

147
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,449
Now get your ugly, white ass out of here.
And don't come back.

148
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,217
The motel victim had some problems...

149
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,369
...l thought you might want to know about.

150
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,973
Besides bein' shot in the head
and crucified?

151
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,015
What are you gonna tell me,
she had a bad-hair day?

152
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,738
She would have been dead
in a couple of months.

153
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:27,448
From what?

154
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,494
I found advanced osteosarcoma
and interstitial fibrosis.

155
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,815
If you don't say it in English, I'll beat you
to death with a dictionary.

156
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:39,892
It's a rare form of bone cancer, and this
cancer had spread throughout her body.

157
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:42,334
-What'd cause that?
-What am l? The Amazing Randy?

158
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:44,808
We have tests to run, it will take time.

159
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,857
What'd you come up with on prints?

160
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,453
Nothing. I don't think she's local.

161
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:52,652
Neither do l.
I don't even think she's American.

162
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,577
I think she's Russian.

163
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,618
Wait, I thought he was the Amazing Randy.

164
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,531
Hair...cheekbones...

165
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:04,738
...genetic bone structure.
I think she's Russian, most likely Georgian.

166
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,739
You can tell all that just by lookin' at her?

167
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:11,248
Right. She's an Aquarius
and likes country music.

168
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,692
Was...an Aquarian.

169
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:15,089
You see, the spirit has left the body.

170
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,057
What we have here
is a mere broken vessel.

171
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:20,935
"A broken vessel?"

172
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:25,058
Anything else interesting about the body
that you'd like to comment on or--

173
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:29,298
She's got nice tits.

174
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,297
Precisely, Grasshopper,
but a little bit too nice.

175
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,335
Okay, partner, run this number.

176
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,459
Detective Cole's not gonna cooperate.

177
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,335
That's the problem with new cops.

178
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:00,532
They need to be taught
who to pay attention to.

179
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:04,294
I'd be happy to teach him that lesson.

180
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:09,969
Put some of our Russian friends on it.

181
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:12,488
Let them earn their money for a change.

182
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,130
Everything else in shape?

183
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,367
Like clockwork.

184
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,413
Everyone's still in the dark?

185
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:26,412
It's a very tight seal, as long
as everyone keeps their mouth shut.

186
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:27,728
They will.

187
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:31,808
I think we've set a very good example.

188
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,807
So, why LA? New York didn't have
enough psychopaths for you?

189
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,250
I didn't get along with my captain.

190
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,127
Figured it was time for a change.
The ex moved out here with the kids.

191
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:06,009
Yeah. Y'all just go on....

192
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,689
No, thank you, I don't know you that well.

193
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,178
No, that's tea. That's good stuff.

194
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,092
It's deer antler. It's good
for your masculinity.

195
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:19,488
Ain't nothin' wrong with my manhood,
thank you.

196
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:21,490
Let me just have a little sip.

197
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,855
This is my favorite movie.

198
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:32,849
Do you know I'm black?
I have no idea what you're saying.

199
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,096
She says that movie always makes her cry.

200
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,295
Yeah, that's a real tearjerker.

201
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:40,616
Not that I cry at movies
or anything like that.

202
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,296
It takes more than a sad scene
to break me, you know what I mean?

203
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,939
Once in a while you should cry
'cause it cleanses the soul.

204
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,611
You could use a little bit of that.

205
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:52,691
If I need cleansing, I have a bran muffin.
Thank you.

206
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,930
You ain't gonna find one here.

207
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:57,415
Shit.

208
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,615
I think I'm allergic to the incense.

209
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,249
Y'all sell roaches?
Damn, I'm in the wrong business.

210
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,456
I could make money
and never leave my apartment.

211
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:12,737
Just put this underneath your tongue.

212
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:15,777
It's perfect for allergies.
It'll clear you right up.

213
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,487
This is bitter.

214
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,092
Bitter? I don't know why it'd be bitter.

215
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:22,373
What is this?

216
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:26,857
It's just a little bit of powdered deer penis.

217
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,050
That's real funny. That's real fuckin' funny.
Damn, do I feel violated.

218
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:46,975
So tell me, what's up with the beads?

219
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,529
These here? It's called a mahla.
Tibetan prayer beads.

220
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,128
What do you use 'em for?

221
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:55,450
I use them to calm my mind
and to purify my thoughts.

222
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,251
Yeah, I use Jack Daniel's.

223
00:15:58,339 --> 00:15:59,931
We're tryin' to go to the same place.

224
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:02,328
We're just using a different technique.

225
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,330
Except I don't wear the bottle
around my neck.

226
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,979
That's because you'd lose your job
if you did.

227
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:10,017
Roden to 4 King 63.
Just got a call from an informant...

228
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,408
...who claims to have info
on The Family Man.

229
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:14,888
Says he'll only give it to you.
Waitin' on the south dock.

230
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,209
This is 4 King 63. We're on our way.

231
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,291
They're breakin' into a car over there.

232
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:32,257
We're here to meet an informant.
We don't have time for that.

233
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,409
We're police. We gotta get the bad guys
once in a while.

234
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:36,933
Why don't we get you
some red boots and a cape...

235
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:40,216
...and you can fly around the city
and stop all the crime?

236
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,253
Police! Freeze!

237
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:56,730
You know what pisses me off? When I see
some sorry-ass motherfuckers...

238
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:58,411
...like you with more hair than me.

239
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:00,729
Turn around, put your goddamn hands
on the car...

240
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,094
...before I go get my clippers
and go crazy in here.

241
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:04,498
Fuck you, pig.

242
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:07,175
"Fuck you?" Did he say, "Fuck you"?

243
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,296
I'm confused. We got the badges.
We got the guns.

244
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,257
You got a screwdriver.

245
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,138
It's kind of like takin' a screwdriver
to a gunfight.

246
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:17,210
And "pig," that's an old phrase.

247
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:21,451
Y'all must not be from around here.
Y'all must be from another country--

248
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:24,250
Drop the guns. Please.

249
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:27,457
This is a police matter.
It's got nothin' to do with you.

250
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:28,972
Drop the guns.

251
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:34,338
Think we're gonna have to do this
the hard way.

252
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,612
I can't fight, man.

253
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:40,408
What do you mean you can't fight?
It's a fine time to tell me now.

254
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:42,376
Get down on your knees. Now.

255
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:44,935
He likes you, that's the good news.

256
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,814
Sorry. Not without dinner and a movie.

257
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:57,929
Your friend likes to do things the hard way.
Now, how about you?

258
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:01,978
My friend, he's a little bit country,
I'm a little bit rock-n'-roll.

259
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,287
What does that mean?

260
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:05,973
Just an expression. What do you want?

261
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:07,732
You...dead.

262
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:09,729
Why?

263
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:11,651
Because the pay is so good.

264
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,249
How about if I double the pay?

265
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:21,534
You have balls. But I don't think
you have enough money.

266
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:23,254
Well, I do.

267
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,415
I got thousands of dollars in my pocket.

268
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:28,809
I'm gonna reach into my back pocket
slowly to get my wallet.

269
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:30,577
I have a lot of cash...

270
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,735
...or you could take plastic.

271
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,008
"Plastic?"

272
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:35,932
This is rock-n'-roll.

273
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:19,138
For a minute I forgot you said
you can't fight.

274
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,447
It's not that I can't fight.

275
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:22,973
I'm not supposed to.
It's against my religion.

276
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:24,492
-Great.
-I'm a Buddhist.

277
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:26,535
Yeah. You're a Kung Fu priest.

278
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:30,898
Who sent you, man?

279
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:33,178
The Russian Mafia.

280
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,332
-Let me try.
-You speak Russian?

281
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:39,613
A little bit.

282
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:44,533
Answer me, goddamn it, before I beat
the shit out of you, you dumb ass!

283
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,972
-You speak good Russian.
-Yes. Black Russian.

284
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,856
Read him his rights even though
he's a little unconscious.

285
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,648
He knows 'em.

286
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:01,129
I'm tellin' you, Captain, this guy is weird.

287
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:02,572
Yeah, show me a cop who isn't.

288
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,219
Look, I'm not talkin' about a cop
who wears pantyhose.

289
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:08,735
This guy, he speaks Chinese,
he dresses like a monk...

290
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,258
...and the Russians yesterday, he took
those guys out like Bruce Lee, only better.

291
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:16,490
I mean, I saw him use his credit card
like a goddamn Ginsu knife.

292
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:18,012
Where would you learn that?

293
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:19,452
I don't know, maybe the Army.

294
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:22,417
What do you want me to do, Jim,
look at his resume?

295
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:26,169
Don't come to me with this kind of shit.
Just work with the guy.

296
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,778
"Work with the guy."

297
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,412
What does this say to you?

298
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:23,490
Punishment and purification.

299
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:28,648
He believes he's helping these people
by turnin' them into martyrs.

300
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:31,367
Only he can't get any satisfaction.

301
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,575
So he keeps doin' it,
gettin' bolder and bolder...

302
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,934
...until he's either caught or killed.

303
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,211
And he ain't gettin' his orders
from the Devil, either.

304
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,529
He believes he's listenin' to Jesus himself.

305
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:43,450
You learn well, Grasshopper.

306
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:48,778
Task force, Campbell.

307
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:54,854
All right.

308
00:21:58,219 --> 00:21:59,538
Two more bodies.

309
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,094
Hey, slow down.

310
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,613
It's all right, man, we'll be back later.

311
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:42,699
Hey, man, get this virgin
off the crime scene.

312
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,087
We got Andrew Dunleavy, a psychiatrist.

313
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,568
This is his wife Ellen.
There are two children...

314
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,377
...but we haven't been able to locate them.

315
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,415
Roden, squash that, man.

316
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,331
Are you all right, Jack?

317
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,370
-Jim, you got a minute?
-Sure.

318
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,337
Careful, he wants to borrow money.
I know that look.

319
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,456
-Got somethin' for you to look at.
-What is it?

320
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,210
Found a print at the Dunleavy scene,
on the woman's body.

321
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,210
Beautiful. It's about time.

322
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:53,133
-Let's run it right away.
-Already did.

323
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,208
It's Cole's.

324
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:09,292
Your brother still works
for lntelligence, right?

325
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,738
Tell him to find out everything he can
on Cole.

326
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:15,338
Off the record.

327
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:22,492
We'll extend the house-to-house canvas
by four blocks.

328
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:26,254
We're lookin' for any links
between the victims. Where they shop...

329
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:29,132
...get their cars repaired,
pictures developed...

330
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,016
...anything, no matter how small.

331
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:34,455
Do me a favor and get me copies
of these blood paintings on the walls...

332
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,257
...in this stack of crime-scene photos.

333
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:39,411
Send 'em out to every psych ward
and prison throughout the US.

334
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:41,137
Maybe a former patient.

335
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:43,529
I don't know, I just think that...

336
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:47,009
...this work is so unique that any prisoner,
psychiatrist or priest...

337
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:48,578
...would definitely not forget it.

338
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,615
All right, everybody knows what to do.

339
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:51,734
Let's go.

340
00:25:08,979 --> 00:25:10,332
No, I understand.

341
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,770
I'll get there as fast as I can.

342
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:16,774
Thanks.

343
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:18,497
Hey, you're home early.

344
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:21,048
What's up?

345
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:26,091
I have a new patient. They don't think
she has a long time to live, so....

346
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:31,572
What's wrong?

347
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,696
There's been another killing.

348
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:36,614
Same guy?

349
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,455
Yeah.

350
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,898
I'm sorry, Jack.

351
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:45,130
He killed Ellen and her husband.

352
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,448
He did what?

353
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:51,296
I gotta go tell my kids
that their mother is dead.

354
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:54,538
Jesus, Jack!

355
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:58,807
I think he's makin' it personal, you know?

356
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:37,171
Westlake Security.

357
00:26:38,939 --> 00:26:42,693
I'd like you to tell Mr. Smith
that Mr. Jones needs to contact him...

358
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,778
...right away.

359
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,615
I think there may be a problem.

360
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,738
Spit it out, son.

361
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:09,413
Mr. Jones, he's asking to see you.

362
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:11,489
Really?

363
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,215
I wonder what took him so long?

364
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:16,336
What would you like me to do?

365
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:19,452
Ignore him.

366
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:21,851
He's being dealt with.

367
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,374
And we have bigger fish to fry.

368
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,372
Whatever you say.

369
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,488
"Ten Ways To Spend Your Weekend."

370
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:56,529
This is all we could get on Cole.

371
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,128
Let's see.

372
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:04,934
NYPD, Homicide, Task Force Command
on the DeMarco serial killings.

373
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,770
Lots of medals, good cop.

374
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,929
He tracked down the DeMarco killer...

375
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:13,816
...shot him on a rooftop, one-on-one...

376
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:16,777
...and then was busted for actin'
without sanction.

377
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:18,730
Two coffees, Raffi. Extra sugar.

378
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:21,128
-No coffee for me.
-They're both for me.

379
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,893
Anything else?

380
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,610
Nothin' in the military records.

381
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:29,535
Almost nothin' before the NYPD.
Looks like this guy came out of nowhere.

382
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,338
Are you tellin' me we don't know nothin'
about this guy?

383
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,728
Yeah, there's one thing we know for sure.

384
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,333
He used to be married
to the Dunleavy woman.

385
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:40,327
Son of a bitch.

386
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:45,418
"ln my Father's house,
there are many rooms. If it were not so...

387
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:49,448
"...would I have told you that I go
to prepare a place for you?

388
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,615
"Thomas said to him, 'Lord,
we do not know where you are going.'

389
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,168
"Jesus said to him, 'l am the way...

390
00:28:56,499 --> 00:29:00,651
"'...and the truth and the life,
no one comes to the Father, but by me."'

391
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:14,498
Why didn't you tell anybody
it was your ex-wife?

392
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:17,572
You know they would have pulled me
off the case.

393
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:19,775
You should've told me.
We're workin' together.

394
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,087
Well, I didn't.

395
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:25,894
We ID'd the couple at the motel.
Eugene and Sonya Roslov.

396
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:28,010
Russian, just like you said.

397
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,091
Any connection to the others?

398
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,249
No. They weren't even Catholic.

399
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:34,969
There goes that theory. What's next?

400
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:38,978
This is empty.

401
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,449
It's everything we know about you.

402
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:43,769
Your background's nothin' but smoke
and mirrors.

403
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:44,735
Who are you, Jack?

404
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:46,093
I can't get into it right now.

405
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:47,897
Yeah, well maybe you can get into this.

406
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:50,493
We found your print
at your ex-wife's house.

407
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,097
She was my ex-wife.
I pick up my kids there all the time.

408
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:56,817
The print's on the body.

409
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,448
Planted.

410
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:02,008
And there's a puff of smoke
comin' from the grassy knoll.

411
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:04,659
What kind of bullshit
you tryin' to run, man?

412
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:09,055
I ain't always been a cop.
That's all I can tell you right now.

413
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,173
You are one mysterious motherfucker.

414
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,614
Nobody seems to know anything
about your past...

415
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:19,577
...and the only evidence I got
points right at you.

416
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,934
Now, does that worry you, Jack?

417
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:24,618
Do I look worried?

418
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:26,930
Well, it damn sure worries me.

419
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:50,492
Hello, Lento's.

420
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,890
No, I'm sorry, we're closed.

421
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,494
-No. It's a private lunch.
-Excuse me.

422
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:58,337
There is nothing I can do.

423
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,493
I'm telling you we're closed today.
Tomorrow we'll be open.

424
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:04,570
It'll be fine. Come then. It'll be a nice--

425
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,092
Excuse me a minute.

426
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,859
Asshole, what are you blind?
We're closed!

427
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:10,975
You kind of talk too much!

428
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:15,657
Yeah, go ahead, come on over,
we'll give you a table.

429
00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:32,652
You're unbelievable.
What are you doing here?

430
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:36,129
You need to turn around and leave.
That's what you need to do.

431
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:46,009
You don't call, you don't write.
What's worse, you don't take my calls.

432
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:48,852
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir...Senator....

433
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,489
Why don't you and I take your
little sensitive ponytail...

434
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,730
...and your little sissy beads,
and get out of here, okay?

435
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:03,852
As I was saying....

436
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:08,295
Senator, as you can see,
some urgent business has just come up.

437
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,010
Thank you, Senator, so kind.

438
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:19,857
It's been such a long time, Jack.
That's the name you're using now, correct?

439
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,133
At the moment.

440
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:25,017
Can I get you a bite to eat?
The food is truly wonderful...

441
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:27,055
...although the service leaves a little
to be desired.

442
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:30,529
Cut the shit. I need some names,
names of consultants.

443
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,489
Don't tell me there's a problem
you can't take care of yourself?

444
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:37,612
It's about the serial killings.
I know you know about them.

445
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:40,691
Yes, I do. Truly wicked. Sorry about Ellen.

446
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,098
Wonderful woman.

447
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:48,896
You know, the last two murders
were definitely the work of a pro...

448
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:50,810
...not a serial killer.

449
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:54,449
And I just have the feeling
that you might know who this pro is.

450
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:57,137
Well, let me guess.

451
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:00,176
They've discovered your checkered past...

452
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:02,409
...and now they suspect you.

453
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,412
Not exactly.

454
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:08,538
They're still not totally up on my past yet,
but I know you are.

455
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:13,010
Therefore, I'm sure you realize
what I'm capable of doing to you...

456
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:14,498
...if I have to.

457
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,771
Yes, indeed, I do.

458
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:19,895
What kind of consultant you lookin' for?

459
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:23,608
This individual gives me the impression
that he's a freelancer.

460
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:26,777
Hiding his targets in the scenario
of a serial killer.

461
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:29,054
Likes a .22, likes head shots.

462
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:33,249
Seems to be inflicting costume wounds
on the victims after they're dead...

463
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:35,648
...and has excellent cleaning skills.

464
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,619
I'll certainly keep my eyes peeled,
and my ears open.

465
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:41,418
Right now, that's just not
gonna be good enough.

466
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:44,771
Jack, you know there's a problem.
I'm kind of busy right now...

467
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,531
...testifying before Congress.

468
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,771
They're getting kind of cranky
about where we get our core-op funds...

469
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:53,011
...but, as it's you...

470
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:56,609
...l'll certainly do the best I can.

471
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:58,498
For old times' sake.

472
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,977
Good to see you, buddy.

473
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:05,534
Bye, buddy.

474
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:14,616
If you ever pull that shit with me again,
I'll kill you.

475
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,692
All your little Chinese, moo-shoo pork
potions will not save you next time.

476
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:21,409
You shouldn't knock Chinese potions.

477
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:23,410
I have something in my pocket right now...

478
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:26,252
...that'll completely clear up that bruise
on your forehead.

479
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,328
What bruise?

480
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:28,568
That bruise.

481
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:30,897
Do you validate parking?

482
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,327
Hello, Lento's.

483
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:44,091
No, no, no, that' won't work.
We're closed for renovation. I'd say...

484
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,169
...two months. Yeah. Thanks.

485
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:53,891
You're chasing your tail with this one.

486
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:58,018
He probably bought it at a flea market.
No way we're gonna find him there.

487
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:02,532
We're gonna have to go back to basics.
You guys gotta do your canvassing.

488
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:06,092
-Your phone is ringing.
-You're not listening to me.

489
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:08,249
Read my lips...talk to the people!

490
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:13,533
Detective, my name is Melanie Sardes.

491
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:17,218
I think I know who you're looking for.

492
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:23,247
I'm sorry I didn't call you guys sooner,
Detective, but I don't open...

493
00:36:23,419 --> 00:36:27,458
...my mail every day. There's so much,
it kind of gets away from me.

494
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:31,810
I used to teach art two days a week
up at the prison.

495
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:36,213
Do you have a cold?

496
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:38,017
No, I'm allergic to the incense.

497
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,691
Can I get you something?

498
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:43,533
No, thanks. I'm gonna go suck
on some deer penis. I'll be all right.

499
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:46,735
It's a Chinese deer penis.

500
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:48,897
You put it under your....

501
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:50,972
You were saying?

502
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:55,292
Well, I knew the drawings
you sent were familiar.

503
00:36:55,979 --> 00:36:57,776
Especially the halos.

504
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:00,210
Then when I saw the titian crucifixion...

505
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,732
...it just clicked.

506
00:37:02,779 --> 00:37:04,497
He was my favorite student.

507
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,815
See, my whole approach is organic.

508
00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:08,332
I start on the inside influence...

509
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:11,695
...and then I try to draw
on the student's inner life.

510
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:15,568
It's about having them find the moment.
A moment without--

511
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:18,735
I've got to hurry back to the nineties now.

512
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,810
Could you just give me his name?

513
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:23,298
Christopher Maynard.

514
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:26,852
-We're moving fast on this.
-I know.

515
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:28,372
Where's our warrant?

516
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,370
Wait, give me a minute.

517
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:34,771
What's goin' on?

518
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,932
-You didn't hear?
-No, I didn't.

519
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:38,737
We got a make on the killer.
Name and address.

520
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:40,537
We're just waitin' for the warrants.

521
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,132
Thank you so much for tellin' me.

522
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,289
Well, I figured Campbell told you.

523
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:48,772
Yes, get me Research.

524
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:51,375
Would you do me a favor
and check if there's...

525
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:55,691
...a Catholic Church within a nine-block
radius of 929 Barrow Street?

526
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,655
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

527
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:18,973
I had this feeling I was gonna die today!

528
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,327
Christopher.

529
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:25,530
This isn't gonna work, buddy.
Here in a church...

530
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:27,772
...with the priest?

531
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:30,289
I don't want to be hurting people.

532
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,098
I don't like to.

533
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:35,293
Could I please speak with the priest?

534
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:42,087
Could I have your permission
to please speak with the Father a minute?

535
00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:44,535
I know you don't want to hurt him.

536
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:45,654
Father...

537
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:48,372
...come here, please.

538
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,134
Right away.

539
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,458
Get out of here.

540
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:08,931
Are they searching for me?

541
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:10,452
Yes, sir, they are.

542
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:12,696
How did you know I'd be here?

543
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:17,817
Well, I just took a lucky guess.
It's the closest church to your home.

544
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:21,127
You're the new cop they brought in, right?

545
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,449
Yes, sir, I am. How'd you know?

546
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:26,657
I keep track of these things.
It's part of my job.

547
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:32,013
So, you know...

548
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:35,409
...you killed my ex-wife, don't you?

549
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:42,329
I want you to know I didn't hurt her.

550
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:43,775
You didn't?

551
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:46,931
I only kill who I was told to kill,
who I had to kill.

552
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:48,658
The Roslovs?

553
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:50,493
The Dunleavys?

554
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,098
Did you kill them?

555
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:53,898
I was spared them.

556
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,177
Someone else was called.

557
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:58,409
Who was given the call, Christopher?

558
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:02,055
There's too much pain here.
I gotta go now.

559
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:03,174
Listen to me.

560
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:04,248
You, stay!

561
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:05,533
Listen to me.

562
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:09,532
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
My last confession...

563
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:12,338
-...was six months ago.
-Christopher, please....

564
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:14,413
Then you help me.

565
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:16,376
-You help me.
-I can't do that.

566
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:18,689
I am in hell! I am in hell!

567
00:41:19,419 --> 00:41:21,137
Listen to me. Listen to me.

568
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:24,211
Do it now or I will kill you! You believe it?

569
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,689
-One...two....
-This is God's house.

570
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:29,735
-Don't make me do this.
-Please.

571
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:31,338
-Don't!
-Three!

572
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:54,728
This is Maynard's gun. Book it for me.

573
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:59,967
This is bad, Jack. This is real bad, man.

574
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:02,010
I can't win for losin', man.

575
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:06,292
I tried so hard not to let this happen.

576
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:10,732
We tossed his house, we found all kinds
of shit: barbed wire, spikes....

577
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,049
-He was definitely our guy.
-Shit.

578
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:18,136
What the fuck are you doin' here?

579
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:21,052
Well, I just thought
that he wouldn't be home...

580
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,289
...maybe I'd find him at the church.

581
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:24,698
So, you came to blow him away?

582
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:28,135
No sir, he drew on me, tried to kill me.
I had no choice.

583
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,972
No choice? The priest told me
you let him go. Said he was calm.

584
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:36,570
We'll never know, will we?

585
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,295
It's just like DeMarco in New York.

586
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:42,417
You come out alone...the suspect is dead.

587
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:44,775
Captain, we had a positive ID on--

588
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:46,212
Shut the fuck up!

589
00:42:46,659 --> 00:42:49,127
I don't want freelance cops working
for me!

590
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:51,170
I want you...and you...

591
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:54,130
...lnternal Affairs, tomorrow morning.

592
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:55,413
Don't be late.

593
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,453
Not so fast. We're sendin' for the poly.

594
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,977
So, what'd you tell him?

595
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:20,174
Everything. The prints, the bullshit past,
the whole nine.

596
00:43:21,419 --> 00:43:23,614
You didn't leave me any choice, Jack.

597
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:26,088
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

598
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:30,329
I'll start by asking you
a few test questions...

599
00:43:30,419 --> 00:43:34,207
...just to establish a base line.
Please answer yes to both questions.

600
00:43:34,339 --> 00:43:36,409
-Are you Detective Jack Cole?
-Yes.

601
00:43:37,419 --> 00:43:39,808
-Have you ever climbed Mt. Everest?
-Yes.

602
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:47,012
Okay. Let's begin.

603
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:51,889
You've been a police officer
for seven years?

604
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:52,570
Yes.

605
00:43:52,659 --> 00:43:55,651
Do you know how your fingerprints
came to be at the crime scene?

606
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:56,330
No.

607
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:59,058
Are you withholding information
pertinent to this investigation?

608
00:43:59,139 --> 00:43:59,730
No.

609
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:02,208
Did you shoot Christopher Maynard?

610
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:03,288
Yes.

611
00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:05,736
-Was it in self-defense?
-Yes.

612
00:44:05,939 --> 00:44:07,770
Did you kill your ex-wife?

613
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:09,296
No.

614
00:44:09,379 --> 00:44:11,449
-Have you ever killed anyone?
-Yes.

615
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:14,818
Have you ever killed anyone
outside of police duty?

616
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:17,857
I don't think that's pertinent
to this investigation.

617
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:19,338
It's a yes or no answer.

618
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:20,408
Is it?

619
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:23,098
There's my answer.

620
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:26,728
Don't do yourself any favors, Jack.

621
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:33,616
I've never seen anything like this.
Everything reads true.

622
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,737
Can someone learn to beat this thing?

623
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:42,653
It's possible, but you'd have to have
total control over your emotions.

624
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:45,737
I don't know anybody
who could pull that off.

625
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:48,650
What do you want me to do, Jack?

626
00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:51,173
The prints' thing is bad enough,
but jerkin' the poly off...

627
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:54,137
...just leaves us with our dicks
in the air for all your fans.

628
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:57,256
You gotta tell me which fans
you're talkin' about. I have so many.

629
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:59,136
I'm talkin' about Frank Deverell.

630
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:00,891
He's talkin' to people about you.

631
00:45:00,979 --> 00:45:01,889
Like who?

632
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:03,128
Like the DA.

633
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:05,011
You never should've been on the scene
with his kid.

634
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:06,976
About how you put him through a window.

635
00:45:07,059 --> 00:45:09,209
I wonder if that's
the same Frank Deverell...

636
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:10,778
...that came and thanked me...

637
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:13,054
...for not shooting his son
in the goddamn head.

638
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:14,572
Yeah, things change.

639
00:45:15,059 --> 00:45:16,970
Internal Affairs is lookin' at you, Jack...

640
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:19,448
...which means they're lookin' at me, too.

641
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:22,531
I'm gonna suspend you
until we can sort this shit out.

642
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:27,055
You know, I somehow think
that you know I'm gettin' screwed.

643
00:45:27,419 --> 00:45:29,728
Yeah, well, tell it to the worry beads.

644
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:32,294
No one's takin' any chances with you, Jack.

645
00:45:32,379 --> 00:45:35,928
You're officially a suspect in the murder
of your ex-wife and her husband.

646
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:39,170
Give me your ID, your badge
and make sure we know where you are...

647
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:41,215
...'cause IA is comin' for you.

648
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:47,488
Which one of these did you just piss in?

649
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:54,614
Son of a bitch.

650
00:46:06,419 --> 00:46:08,250
Capt., you wanted to see me?

651
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:12,249
Christopher Maynard was with his church
group in New York for two weeks.

652
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:13,852
Keep me posted.

653
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:19,092
Accounted for every minute. There's
no way he could've done the last two.

654
00:46:20,419 --> 00:46:21,295
Cole?

655
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:24,929
You tell me. He was havin'
a custody battle with his ex-wife.

656
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:28,570
She didn't want him spendin'
too much time with the kids.

657
00:46:28,979 --> 00:46:30,856
Listen. When he was in New York...

658
00:46:30,939 --> 00:46:34,409
...the DeMarco killings started two months
after he got assigned to Homicide.

659
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:35,932
He moved here eight months ago.

660
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:39,773
Exactly two months after that
The Family Man killings start.

661
00:46:41,379 --> 00:46:43,335
Maybe we should see what he has to say.

662
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:45,375
What, are you goin' soft on me, Jim?

663
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:47,495
Guy's a weirdo, you said so yourself.

664
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,811
Just let lnternal Affairs handle it.
They're puttin' a case together right now.

665
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:58,407
Stay away from him. He's bad news.

666
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:47,656
I take it something is amiss.

667
00:49:49,459 --> 00:49:50,653
What was he doing there?

668
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,889
Didn't look like he was
after anything specific.

669
00:49:52,979 --> 00:49:54,890
Nothing to worry about.

670
00:49:56,139 --> 00:50:00,132
Got halfway through the place. Nothing
there to connect you to the Roslov woman.

671
00:50:00,219 --> 00:50:02,255
I hope not, for your sake.

672
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:05,175
You should've gone through
that house days ago.

673
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:07,489
I'm not supposed to be doing cleanup.

674
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:19,178
Where is she? Have you seen her?

675
00:50:19,259 --> 00:50:21,898
No, I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

676
00:50:21,979 --> 00:50:24,288
But this note camejust after you left.

677
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:32,815
"l cannot go with you...

678
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:35,331
"...or ever see you again.

679
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:40,409
-"l love you...my darling."
- That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

680
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:42,411
"God bless you."

681
00:50:45,779 --> 00:50:47,656
-What's happenin'?
-What's up?

682
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:51,013
-What the hell you doin' here?
-Gotta talk.

683
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:54,573
-Those aren't tears, are they?
-No, man.

684
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,295
My eyes leak sometimes when I yawn,
that's all.

685
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:00,732
-They leak?
-Yeah.

686
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,337
-They leak.
-What do you want?

687
00:51:03,419 --> 00:51:05,694
-Let me just--
-Wait...l'm fine.

688
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,332
What do you want?

689
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:10,253
-I gotta talk to you.
-All right, come on.

690
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:14,687
What if there's a serial killer out there...

691
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:18,294
...he's killin' families,
we nickname him "The Family Man."

692
00:51:18,859 --> 00:51:21,134
But there's somebody else out there...

693
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:23,691
...who has somethin' more sinister
goin' on.

694
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:26,054
He has to terminate some targets.

695
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:29,575
So, he kills his targets and
their entire families to make himself...

696
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:31,536
...look like The Family Man.

697
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:33,650
While we're lookin' for a serial killer.

698
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:36,856
When, in fact, there's two of 'em
and one of 'em is a pro.

699
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:40,329
-How do you know it's a pro?
-'Cause I know the work of a pro.

700
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,329
I found this in Sonya Roslov's house.

701
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:45,331
It's a round trip to Moscow...

702
00:51:45,419 --> 00:51:47,410
...bought and paid for
by Deverell lndustries.

703
00:51:47,499 --> 00:51:49,729
You think Frank Deverell
had somethin' to do with this?

704
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:50,888
I do, sir.

705
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:54,814
Sonya Roslov, she was a translator.

706
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:56,855
If Deverell did any business in Russia...

707
00:51:56,939 --> 00:51:58,930
...it makes sense he'd hire someone
like that.

708
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:01,692
-What if she was a mule?
-Smuggling what?

709
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,449
Chemical weapons of some kind.

710
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:07,618
Now that the Wall fell...

711
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:09,974
...there's a ton of that stuff floatin' around.

712
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:12,527
That would explain the cancer in her body.

713
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:15,537
If you look at who controls that stuff
on the black market...

714
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:16,847
...it's the Russian Mafia.

715
00:52:16,939 --> 00:52:19,407
-As in the guys who jumped us.
-You got it.

716
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:22,007
So, what connects the Dunleavys
to Deverell?

717
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:24,897
I don't know yet, but I know
we could find out.

718
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:28,969
You know, they will take my badge
if they find out I'm workin' with you.

719
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:31,812
But, my gut tells me you might be right.

720
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:35,615
-I always go with my gut.
-Okay.

721
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:42,054
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna
go see the rest of this movie.

722
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:43,572
Is it a good movie?

723
00:52:45,139 --> 00:52:46,697
You've never seen Casablanca?

724
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:49,771
You're asking me
if I've ever seen Casablanca?

725
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:51,175
Have you?

726
00:52:51,259 --> 00:52:53,898
You gotta be kidding. Me?
Never seen Casablanca?

727
00:52:53,979 --> 00:52:55,378
Have you ever seen Casablanca?

728
00:52:55,459 --> 00:52:56,255
No.

729
00:52:57,019 --> 00:52:58,247
Come on.

730
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:04,171
And of course, Donald survived
with everything but his pride intact.

731
00:53:05,259 --> 00:53:07,932
I never expected Cole to get this close.

732
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,970
I thought you kept better track
of your ex-employees.

733
00:53:13,459 --> 00:53:16,212
No way to anticipate
he'd become this involved.

734
00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:19,373
Who is he? Obviously not just a cop.

735
00:53:20,499 --> 00:53:23,730
He was a brilliant soldier.
West Point, that kind of thing.

736
00:53:24,459 --> 00:53:28,532
I found him in Vietnam.
Recruited him for a special projects unit.

737
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:31,656
The Program, we called it.

738
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:34,333
He handled a lot of odd jobs for us.

739
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:36,970
-Such as?
-Now, Mr. Deverell...

740
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:39,898
...don't ask about things
you don't really want to know.

741
00:53:39,979 --> 00:53:42,698
Suffice to say, to the people he hunted
for us...

742
00:53:42,779 --> 00:53:45,339
...he was known as "The Glimmer Man."

743
00:53:46,539 --> 00:53:48,575
There'd be nothing but jungle...

744
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,972
...then a glimmer...

745
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:54,417
...then you'd be dead.

746
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:57,169
Why isn't he still with you?

747
00:53:57,419 --> 00:54:01,094
He was booted out of the program in '84.
Went native on us.

748
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:04,770
Made up his own assignments.

749
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:06,850
Disappeared...for months.

750
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:09,130
Ended up in Thailand...

751
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:12,413
...chanting in some temple or other.

752
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:15,653
They say he was saved by a holy man.

753
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:21,138
So many stories about this fella,
I don't know which ones are true anymore.

754
00:54:26,979 --> 00:54:29,095
-What do we do about him?
-Broom him.

755
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,697
Time to lose everybody
who knows anythin'.

756
00:54:34,819 --> 00:54:36,616
And I mean everybody.

757
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:39,892
Johnny's no threat.

758
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:44,489
I beg to differ. He's already spilled
to the shrink.

759
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:49,057
The poor boy knows too much.
Simple as that.

760
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:51,977
Johnny'll do what I say.

761
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:54,209
Let me put this another way.

762
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:57,292
I have four loose links in this operation:

763
00:54:57,579 --> 00:54:59,649
Two cops, you, and the boy.

764
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:02,297
Three of you have to go.

765
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:04,291
You can choose which three.

766
00:55:07,379 --> 00:55:09,529
You'll have to do it yourself.

767
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:11,538
Frank, I'll take care of Johnny.

768
00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:14,087
Who's gonna take care of Cole
and Campbell?

769
00:55:14,259 --> 00:55:16,489
I'll put Donald on the others right away.

770
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,092
That's the spirit.

771
00:55:18,259 --> 00:55:20,727
Now, come on in. The water's fine.

772
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:40,414
Shit!

773
00:58:28,659 --> 00:58:30,570
Take the kids upstairs.

774
00:58:36,899 --> 00:58:38,491
-John Cole?
-Yes.

775
00:58:38,739 --> 00:58:41,014
Miller and Russo from lnternal Affairs.

776
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:43,169
We have a warrant for your arrest.

777
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:46,218
Do you want to take a minute
to gather a few things?

778
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:49,018
No, that's perfectly all right.
I'm ready to go.

779
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,729
Coldest winter I can remember in LA.

780
00:59:41,499 --> 00:59:42,898
Wettest, too.

781
01:01:39,499 --> 01:01:41,012
They got you, too.

782
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:43,613
No, I bought all this shit after the riots.

783
01:01:43,779 --> 01:01:46,134
It means we're close, man, we're close.

784
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:48,017
Do I look like I give a shit?

785
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:52,138
You better give a shit, 'cause they ain't
gonna stop till they get us both.

786
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,210
Does this say, "deer antler"?

787
01:01:59,259 --> 01:02:00,692
Give me that.

788
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:04,936
-It was a free sample.
-There's a whole case over here.

789
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:06,930
Just stay out of my shit.

790
01:02:07,419 --> 01:02:10,968
Can I just take this moment to tell you
how moved I am deeply?

791
01:02:11,139 --> 01:02:13,209
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.

792
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:16,493
I found somethin'
on your ex-wife's phone records.

793
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,809
Someone called the house the night
she was killed.

794
01:02:18,899 --> 01:02:23,051
They called six times, only talked about 1 0
or 1 5 seconds each time.

795
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:25,530
You got a number or somethin'?

796
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:29,888
Could I take those CDs?
They look like I could still use them.

797
01:02:30,819 --> 01:02:32,218
Got it. Come on.

798
01:02:32,379 --> 01:02:35,337
Could I ask you somethin'?
Did you actually live in this shitbox?

799
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:36,977
Man, will you come on?

800
01:02:57,019 --> 01:02:59,374
Now, what if this is really our guy?

801
01:02:59,539 --> 01:03:01,450
-We'll reason with him.
-Right.

802
01:03:05,179 --> 01:03:06,373
-What?
-Police!

803
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:10,817
I'm Detective Cole,
this is Detective Campbell...

804
01:03:10,899 --> 01:03:13,367
...with the Los Angeles Police Department.

805
01:03:13,459 --> 01:03:15,689
We'd like to ask you some questions
about some calls...

806
01:03:15,779 --> 01:03:18,088
...you may have made to a Dr. Dunleavy.

807
01:03:21,499 --> 01:03:23,888
You look like you just came from a riot.

808
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:24,889
Thanks.

809
01:03:24,979 --> 01:03:27,334
He looks like he just came from a riot.

810
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:31,129
Yeah, this number's billed to me,
but it's my daughter's phone.

811
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:36,411
I know you, don't l?

812
01:03:37,379 --> 01:03:40,530
Yeah, you know me. You put my boyfriend
through a window.

813
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:45,013
High school, window. I remember now.

814
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:48,133
You're Johnny Deverell's girlfriend,
aren't you?

815
01:03:48,219 --> 01:03:48,935
So?

816
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:52,932
So, I was just wondering, how long
have you known Dr. Dunleavy?

817
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:56,215
I don't know any Dunleavy.

818
01:03:56,939 --> 01:03:59,612
You called him the night he was killed.

819
01:04:00,299 --> 01:04:03,052
Yeah. Well, it wasn't me.
I don't need a shrink.

820
01:04:03,979 --> 01:04:05,890
We never said he was a shrink.

821
01:04:08,939 --> 01:04:11,612
Okay, I knew him but I didn't call him.

822
01:04:12,459 --> 01:04:13,812
I wonder who did?

823
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:16,414
Johnny did.

824
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:19,857
When he got busted with the coke,
they made him see a shrink.

825
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,895
The shrink was Dunleavy, right?

826
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:23,174
Millie.

827
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:26,889
Let me tell you something, sweetheart,
the games are over.

828
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:29,414
I want you to tell me right now...

829
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:32,731
...why Johnny was making phone calls
from this room.

830
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,891
He was afraid to call from home.

831
01:04:34,979 --> 01:04:35,968
Why?

832
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,654
His stepfather. Johnny knew
some bad things he was doing.

833
01:04:39,979 --> 01:04:42,857
Would you happen to know
where we could find this boy?

834
01:04:42,939 --> 01:04:46,136
His stepfather put him away
at Our Lady Of Angels.

835
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:51,049
You don't think Deverell would kill
his own stepson, do you?

836
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:55,337
Right. Dumb question.
Let's get out of here.

837
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,093
-You all right, Johnny?
-Yeah, never been better.

838
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:55,818
Yeah, we need to ask some questions
about your stepdad.

839
01:05:55,899 --> 01:05:57,218
He's a prick.

840
01:05:58,139 --> 01:05:59,731
Yeah, besides that.

841
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:03,016
Did your dad kill Dunleavy?

842
01:06:04,259 --> 01:06:07,296
Yeah, I tried to call him,
I tried to warn him, I swear to God.

843
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:09,449
We know, we know. It's all right.

844
01:06:10,859 --> 01:06:13,293
All right, everybody just relax. Police.

845
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:14,847
Why'd he do it?

846
01:06:15,019 --> 01:06:17,852
Okay, he had Donald kill his translator...

847
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:23,457
...because she knew that my father was
smugglin' in some bad shit from Russia.

848
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:26,130
And I found out about it.

849
01:06:26,419 --> 01:06:29,775
So, he got all freaked out,
and thought I told Dr. Dunleavy.

850
01:06:30,259 --> 01:06:32,853
So he had Donald kill him and his wife...

851
01:06:32,939 --> 01:06:35,328
...and made it look
like the serial killer did it.

852
01:06:35,419 --> 01:06:36,772
Who was helpin' him?

853
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:38,372
Some little guy.

854
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:41,132
Southern accent....

855
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:44,136
-Smith.
-Yeah, the government guy.

856
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:45,618
Who's Smith?

857
01:06:45,979 --> 01:06:47,935
You're about to find out.

858
01:06:48,019 --> 01:06:50,010
Sister, take this boy
and keep an eye on him.

859
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:52,294
Don't let anything happen to him.
Don't leave him alone.

860
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:55,337
Yes, of course.
I'll take care of you, Johnny. Come.

861
01:07:01,979 --> 01:07:03,412
See you later, Joe.

862
01:07:27,499 --> 01:07:28,693
How you doin'?

863
01:07:30,859 --> 01:07:33,009
Jack, what a pleasant surprise--

864
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:40,532
You know, in most states in this country...

865
01:07:40,739 --> 01:07:44,254
...kidnapping is still a no-no.
Hell, we don't even do it anymore.

866
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:46,728
Do me a favor. Spare me the drama and...

867
01:07:46,899 --> 01:07:49,493
...tell me a story.
What's Deverell smuggling?

868
01:07:50,419 --> 01:07:52,296
I have no idea what you're talking about.

869
01:07:52,379 --> 01:07:53,289
Really?

870
01:07:55,379 --> 01:07:57,768
Goddamn, Jack! What are you doin', man?

871
01:07:58,779 --> 01:08:02,931
Deverell's killed four people to hide
something, and I want to find out what.

872
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,135
You're a fuckin' psycho.

873
01:08:06,219 --> 01:08:08,528
I don't know what the hell
he's talkin' about.

874
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:09,847
Well, you're a cop!

875
01:08:09,939 --> 01:08:11,497
Aren't you gonna help?

876
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:13,254
Okay.

877
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:15,815
But I'm a really bad shot.

878
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:18,447
-Stay out of it.
-I'm just tryin' to help.

879
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:21,375
Kill me if you like, you son of a bitch.

880
01:08:21,459 --> 01:08:24,098
I still have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

881
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:28,616
Jack, I know we've had some harsh words
in the past....

882
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:39,493
-I tell you I do not know--
-Okay....

883
01:08:45,259 --> 01:08:47,727
I need that hand. Jack, I need that hand.

884
01:08:48,139 --> 01:08:50,528
You know I will. Right about....

885
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:53,094
All right! Time! Game over!

886
01:09:07,179 --> 01:09:08,976
God I miss you, Jack.

887
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,930
So many young men today
just won't go that extra mile.

888
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:17,692
I miss you too, Smith. Now, what is it?

889
01:09:18,459 --> 01:09:19,892
Deverell is smugglin'...

890
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:21,731
...chemical weapons in from Russia.

891
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:25,971
I made the contacts for him. The deal's
being brokered by the Russian Mafia.

892
01:09:27,379 --> 01:09:30,530
Would one of you gentlemen mind
callin' me an ambulance?

893
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,769
So, what's he doin' with this stuff?

894
01:09:32,859 --> 01:09:36,169
Deal's bein' done tomorrow.
Some welfare hotel downtown.

895
01:09:36,499 --> 01:09:39,218
He's sellin' it to a bunch
of Serbian freedom fighters.

896
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:40,778
You mean terrorists.

897
01:09:41,099 --> 01:09:43,249
Semantics. You say tomato--

898
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:46,817
No, motherfucker, I didn't say, "tomato."
I said, "terrorists."

899
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:48,048
You work for the government.

900
01:09:48,139 --> 01:09:50,653
Why would you, of all people,
help Deverell?

901
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:55,777
To get rich, son. To get rich, why else?

902
01:09:56,339 --> 01:09:57,567
You got that?

903
01:09:58,219 --> 01:09:59,857
Yeah, I got that.

904
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:05,333
Well, aren't you the grown-up spy?

905
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:09,091
What do you want?

906
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:13,054
I want you and your friends
to leave me alone. Forget that I exist.

907
01:10:13,139 --> 01:10:14,254
I already have.

908
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:15,818
Don't make me come back and kill you.

909
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:17,173
-I won't.
-Good.

910
01:10:23,379 --> 01:10:26,576
Gentlemen, we must not forget
the little matter...

911
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:30,213
-...of the ambulance.
-I only shot you in one foot.

912
01:10:30,299 --> 01:10:32,096
Hobble to a hospital.

913
01:10:44,059 --> 01:10:48,098
Well, safe to assume, folks,
that the rainiest winter in memory is over.

914
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:52,457
Sunny and dry weather for tomorrow
and for the entire five-day period.

915
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:55,969
Everything we could hope for
in this part of the country....

916
01:10:56,939 --> 01:10:59,976
Deverell is smugglin' chemical weapons in
from Russia.

917
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:03,127
The deal's bein' brokered
by the Russian Mafia.

918
01:11:03,219 --> 01:11:05,289
-Who is this?
-So, how's that, asshole?

919
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:08,416
I know you're friends with everyone
from the postman to the President...

920
01:11:08,499 --> 01:11:10,854
...but no one will touch you
with a ten-foot pole...

921
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:12,531
...when this shit gets out. Understand?

922
01:11:12,619 --> 01:11:14,132
Detective Cole.

923
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:17,299
You are persistent, I'll give you that.

924
01:11:17,379 --> 01:11:20,291
Looks like I got somethin' you want,
you got somethin' I want.

925
01:11:20,379 --> 01:11:22,529
-What might that be?
-Donald.

926
01:11:22,899 --> 01:11:24,890
Donald's your triggerman, isn't he?

927
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:25,889
I'm listening.

928
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:27,731
I want him, not you.

929
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:30,538
Deliver him to me with a nice bow
and the murder weapon.

930
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,257
I'll take it from there.

931
01:11:32,339 --> 01:11:36,252
You take the tape...my name
gets clean...your name stays clean.

932
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:38,650
Everybody's happy, how's that?

933
01:11:38,739 --> 01:11:39,854
Done.

934
01:11:40,939 --> 01:11:42,611
Why don't you meet me tomorrow?

935
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:46,135
I'm doing a little business at a place
called the Ovington Arms, downtown.

936
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:49,097
Apartment D-14.
Would 1 0:00 be good for you?

937
01:11:55,699 --> 01:11:57,530
Why does this gotta be so complicated?

938
01:11:57,619 --> 01:11:59,655
This isn't complicated.
It's nothing but a game.

939
01:11:59,739 --> 01:12:01,695
Reminds me of an old Persian tactician...

940
01:12:01,779 --> 01:12:04,612
...trying to teach his young troops strategy.

941
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:06,929
That, later on, came to be known as chess.

942
01:12:07,019 --> 01:12:08,737
So, we're gonna bore 'em to death now?

943
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:11,777
Young warriors used to like
to fight head-on.

944
01:12:12,139 --> 01:12:14,289
Old warriors like to wait...

945
01:12:14,739 --> 01:12:18,618
...let their opponents expose the board,
work themselves into a corner....

946
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:21,088
Time to go. Sun Tzu, The Art of War.

947
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:24,298
Sun Tzu. Just keeps gettin' stranger.

948
01:12:29,339 --> 01:12:30,692
Donald's your triggerman, isn't he?

949
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:31,655
I'm listening.

950
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:33,297
I want him, not you.

951
01:12:33,459 --> 01:12:36,212
Deliver him to me with a nice bow
and the murder weapon.

952
01:12:36,299 --> 01:12:37,652
I'll take it from there.

953
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:40,333
Take the tape...my name gets clean...

954
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:44,329
...your name stays clean.
Everybody's happy, how's that?

955
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:45,975
Done.

956
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:50,811
Guess your ass just got sold
down the river, shithead.

957
01:13:18,939 --> 01:13:21,214
This won't take long. Just a quick pick up.

958
01:13:21,299 --> 01:13:22,698
I'm sure it won't.

959
01:14:27,299 --> 01:14:28,652
Shabby, but chic.

960
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:39,770
Either we're a little early...

961
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:41,975
...or our hosts are a little late.

962
01:14:49,379 --> 01:14:51,449
What the hell is going on, Donald?

963
01:14:52,339 --> 01:14:53,488
You tell me.

964
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:59,972
You think you're gonna hand me over
to Cole. Bad move, fruitcake.

965
01:15:01,259 --> 01:15:03,568
I don't know what you're talking about.

966
01:15:07,339 --> 01:15:08,772
You'll never get out of here.

967
01:15:08,859 --> 01:15:10,850
No, this is my show from now on.

968
01:15:18,379 --> 01:15:20,370
Positively Shakespearean.

969
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:22,568
"To be...

970
01:15:23,339 --> 01:15:24,055
"...or not to be! "

971
01:15:24,459 --> 01:15:25,335
Time to go.

972
01:15:25,419 --> 01:15:28,172
Wait. We don't know how many guys are
in there.

973
01:15:28,259 --> 01:15:31,410
What do you want me to do?
Wait till they all kill each other?

974
01:15:31,499 --> 01:15:33,296
If the old warriors are patient and...

975
01:15:33,379 --> 01:15:35,574
...all the young warriors,
they kill each other and...

976
01:15:35,659 --> 01:15:37,012
...that's how we get to be old.

977
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:38,737
I like that plan too. You listened well.

978
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:40,491
That's what I told you in the bar.

979
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:42,854
I don't know why I don't listen to myself.
I'm stupid.

980
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:44,258
Let's just wait.

981
01:15:45,339 --> 01:15:46,977
Drop the guns! Police!

982
01:15:48,499 --> 01:15:49,329
Put your guns down!

983
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:50,647
Drop that fuckin' gun!

984
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:51,808
Drop the gun now!

985
01:15:51,899 --> 01:15:53,298
Drop the gun, boy.

986
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:19,894
Freeze!

987
01:17:23,859 --> 01:17:25,258
Just drop it!

988
01:17:25,459 --> 01:17:26,733
You, too!

989
01:17:27,579 --> 01:17:28,455
Where do you live?

990
01:17:28,539 --> 01:17:31,656
-Around the corner.
-Well, get your ass around the corner!

991
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:34,173
And take little Whoopi Goldberg with you.

992
01:17:34,939 --> 01:17:36,133
Jesus Christ.

993
01:17:36,619 --> 01:17:38,337
Showdown on Sesame Street.

994
01:17:39,019 --> 01:17:41,772
Big Bird will pop out of one
of these doors next.

995
01:18:31,179 --> 01:18:31,975
Hi!

996
01:18:43,179 --> 01:18:44,214
Out here!

997
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:49,817
Hurry, man! I can't hold on much longer!

998
01:18:52,299 --> 01:18:54,733
Oh, God, don't look down.
Don't look down.

999
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:57,698
Oh, don't look up.

1000
01:19:09,099 --> 01:19:10,612
All right, hang on.

1001
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,610
Yeah. That's a good idea, man.

1002
01:19:12,699 --> 01:19:14,690
I wouldn't have thought of that.

1003
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:19,415
-All right, are you ready?
-Ready for what?

1004
01:19:19,499 --> 01:19:20,534
For this.

1005
01:19:21,259 --> 01:19:23,648
There's a window, Jack!
There's a window!

1006
01:19:26,059 --> 01:19:28,527
Is that your gun
or are you gettin' excited, man?

1007
01:19:28,619 --> 01:19:30,098
Get off me. Get off.

1008
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:33,779
Police business. We're right on
out of here.

1009
01:19:36,419 --> 01:19:40,094
-Can you make it down to the lobby?
-Yeah, I'll be all right.

1010
01:19:41,099 --> 01:19:42,896
The elevator was broken.

1011
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:23,292
Has anybody ever told you
you're a real pain in the ass?

1012
01:20:23,379 --> 01:20:24,573
All the time.

1013
01:20:28,139 --> 01:20:30,573
You're not gonna have to hear it anymore.

1014
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:35,209
I'm gonna take care of you
like I took care of your ex-wife.

1015
01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:01,852
Here we are.

1016
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:06,298
When you wake up in the morning
and look in the mirror...

1017
01:21:06,379 --> 01:21:08,688
...l think you're probably happy...

1018
01:21:08,859 --> 01:21:12,010
...pleased at what you see.
And that disturbs me.

1019
01:21:13,659 --> 01:21:16,219
So, I'm gonna take it on
as my responsibility...

1020
01:21:16,299 --> 01:21:19,735
...to make sure that you never get to look
in the mirror again.

1021
01:21:19,899 --> 01:21:23,687
I woke up happy, I'm going to bed happy
'cause you're gonna be dead.

1022
01:22:05,059 --> 01:22:06,538
Take your best shot.

1023
01:22:08,979 --> 01:22:10,617
No, I said, "Best shot."

1024
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:13,449
Boring.

1025
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:26,730
Is that the best you got, boy?

1026
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:32,209
If that's the best you got,
I'm just gonna have to kill you.

1027
01:22:35,819 --> 01:22:37,298
Is that all you got?

1028
01:22:55,299 --> 01:22:58,371
You don't look like you're gonna be
wakin' up happy now.

1029
01:23:38,019 --> 01:23:39,054
Hey, Capt.

1030
01:23:39,299 --> 01:23:41,130
You're looking a little rough there,
Campbell.

1031
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:43,528
Yeah, well, they say I'm gonna make it.

1032
01:23:44,099 --> 01:23:45,771
Guess I owe you an apology, Jack.

1033
01:23:45,859 --> 01:23:47,577
God, wouldn't that be nice?

1034
01:23:48,419 --> 01:23:50,330
Well, you're not gonna get it.

1035
01:23:51,499 --> 01:23:53,217
But I do owe it to you.

1036
01:23:54,339 --> 01:23:56,614
Do me a favor,
tell my wife I'm alive and well.

1037
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,018
You got it.

1038
01:23:58,259 --> 01:23:59,214
Feel better, kid.

1039
01:23:59,299 --> 01:24:00,175
Yeah.

1040
01:24:02,339 --> 01:24:05,809
Say, Jack. How about we not talk
for a couple of days?

1041
01:24:06,699 --> 01:24:08,052
Somethin' I said?

1042
01:24:08,179 --> 01:24:11,455
It's just that ever since
you started bein' my partner...

1043
01:24:12,059 --> 01:24:14,448
...l've been beat up, blown up...

1044
01:24:15,819 --> 01:24:17,855
...shot, kicked out a window...

1045
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:21,772
...all my worldly possessions
burnt to a crisp.

1046
01:24:22,219 --> 01:24:24,096
Basically, I'm homeless.

1047
01:24:25,179 --> 01:24:27,329
Not one good thing has happened
since I met you.

1048
01:24:27,419 --> 01:24:28,932
You got to try powdered deer penis.

1049
01:24:29,019 --> 01:24:30,372
That should count for something.

1050
01:24:30,459 --> 01:24:33,292
Don't call me, Jack.
Don't leave me a message.

1051
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:37,372
Don't fax me. If I see a bird on my window
with a message on its foot...

1052
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,370
...l'm throwin' him back out.

1053
01:24:39,459 --> 01:24:40,209
Don't send flowers.

1054
01:24:41,859 --> 01:24:43,531
Forget you know me, Jack!

1055
01:25:40,139 --> 01:25:42,528
