Did she do that

Not very often.
Mmm-hmm.

Is she still wearing
flannel to bed?

Silly me.

326
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:12,662
I thought, until I met

that it was
only little children...

with the feet sewn
on the bottom.

You could have warned me
about that.

And I'm actually
being kind of serious here.

I tried to, Pete.
I really did.

Yeah, bullshit. I was the end
of your alimony problem.

That's what I was.

have a quiet word.

Would you be good enough
to deliver a message
from me to Mr. Guerrard?

That may well be.
But my point is,
some time ago...

371
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:07,772
in a moment of weakness,
I did a very foolish thing.

372
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,239
And that foolish thing
was photographed.

373
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:14,080
I believe that photo
is in the possession
of a Mr. Vic Cavanaugh...

374

an associate of yours,
who refuses to surrender it...

Mr. Guerrard would be able

Five, Mr. Arglist.
Low five.

385
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:50,112

the photo in question...

might be closer
than you can possibly
imagine.

Merry Christmas, Charlie.

469
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,904
On the whole,
I thought that went well.

470
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:35,906
Yeah, it's good
to see the family.

471
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:39,034
What do you say,
one more drink?
The night is young.

472
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:42,603
All right, one more,
that's it.
Okay. One more.

473
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:57,252
Melissa really misses you.

474
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:00,060
Not Spencer. He hates me.

475
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,593
You just gotta give him time.
He'll come around.

476
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:08,734
Your leaving came
at an awkward age for him.

477
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:10,741
A clean break is best.

478
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:14,644
No, a clean break is easiest.
On you.

479
00:27:16,415 --> 00:27:17,404
Oh.

480
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,949
Are you saying
you have no regrets?

481
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:23,151
Don't believe in them.

482
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:26,656
Bullshit.
Everybody has regrets.

483
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:30,587
Guys our age,
what else is there?

484
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:38,730
I ever tell you
my father was a twin?

485
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,469
Identical?
Fraternal.

486
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:44,134
Looked a lot alike, though,
him and my uncle.

487
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:46,767
Different temperaments
completely.

488
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,411
My father, he's a cop.

489
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:52,276
By-the-book guy.

490
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:56,246
Believed in the law.
Wanted his only son
to be a lawyer.

491
00:27:56,321 --> 00:27:58,846
Drank in moderation,
didn't smoke.

492
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,585
Kept up his
life insurance premiums.

493
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,658
Voted in every election,
not just for president.

494
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:07,823
Let me guess.
Uncle didn't vote.

495
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:11,164
He said he didn't want
to encourage the bastards.

496
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:14,336
In and out of jail
from the time he was 16...

497
00:28:14,406 --> 00:28:17,136
drunk all the time,
fucked everything that walked.

498
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:20,645
Won a fortune playing poker,
lost it all the same way.

499
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:22,873
Lost an eye in a fight.
Half his life...

500
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:26,145
So what
you're trying to say is,
you take after your uncle.

501
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:27,242
[Laughing]

502
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,048
I wasn't finished.

503
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,186
My father was 54...

504
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:35,590
when he died of
a massive embolism,
right here in Wichita.

505
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:40,195
My uncle
died the very next day...

506
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:43,828
in a car wreck in California.

507
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:48,134
So the point is...

508
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:51,172
it is futile to regret.

509
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:56,075
You do one thing,
you do another...

510
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:58,516
I mean, so what?

511
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:01,815
What's the difference?
Same result.

512
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:11,554
How many of these lights
you gonna sit through?

513

another fucking story.

Sorry, guys, we're closed.

516

We just want one drink.
Each.

517
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:26,872
My friend's a mobster.
You might know that,
you might not.

518
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:30,745
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you one,
on the house...

519
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,281
if you drink it up and leave.

520
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,977
But I'm not opening
my register back up.

521
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,883
Thank you, gorgeous.

522
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:40,281
Do you know
where this last drink
is going to take me?

523
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:43,019
To that perfect stage
of drunkenness.

524
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:45,563
And then, do you know
what I'm going to do?

525
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,964
I'm going to go straight home,
go to bed, and dream of you.

526
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,235
I don't think
I'd pursue that
particular line.

527
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:57,965
You with him?
Yeah.

528
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:00,476
Makes no difference.
It's okay.

529
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,576
It's a free country.

530
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:05,707
And any man can dream
anything he wants to dream.

531
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:07,149
And tonight
I'm gonna dream of you.

532

All right,
I gotta make a phone call.
I'll be right back.

the black eye.

I don't have the answer
to that question, Sidney.

back in, just tell her...

You got a present for her.

she's gonna fuck you,

where the money was...

and you get clear of Wichita
with all that money.

1096

At some point...

1097
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:47,642
you're gonna have
to get rid of at least
one of the peckerwoods.

1098
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:49,412
And then what do you got?

1099
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:53,146
A dick with no brain?

1100
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:55,848
Or a brain with no dick?

You know what, Bill?

1102
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:07,225
You seem awfully tense.

1103
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:12,497
And I have this idea
of what might help you relax.

1104
01:12:15,311 --> 01:12:16,369
You do, huh?

1105
01:12:16,445 --> 01:12:17,434

1107

(Charlie)
Drop the gun.

1108
01:12:36,532 --> 01:12:39,433
Step away from the desk
and put your hands up.

1109
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:42,436
Charlie,
don't be a fucking idiot.

1110
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:45,940
You've been watching
too many stupid old movies.

1111
01:12:46,509 --> 01:12:47,908
Why would I drop my gun?

1112
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:49,773
I don't know, Bill.

1113
01:12:50,012 --> 01:12:51,445
Because I got
a big fucking shotgun...

1114
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:52,707
and I'll blow your head off?

1115
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:55,080
Well, if you could do that,
you'd be me...

1116
01:12:55,184 --> 01:12:57,675
and I'd be a pissant lawyer
with a case of the shakes.

Jesus, Charlie,
just shoot him!

If he was gonna
pull the trigger...

1119
01:13:05,528 --> 01:13:08,019
he'd have done it when he came
through the door, girlie.

1120
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:10,395
It's something they don't
teach you in law school.

1121
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:12,297
Which is a shame,
because...

1122
01:13:23,012 --> 01:13:24,570
Get his gun, Charlie.

1123
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:28,105

1124
01:13:29,051 --> 01:13:30,211
He's dead, Renata.

I don't know why
I even bother with Kansas.

1139

Do I hear an "amen"?

1140
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,317
My old man tried
to tell me...

1141
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,191
that I'd be better off
starting a church...

1142
01:14:46,262 --> 01:14:49,026
and letting Jesus pay
for the mortgage...

1143

in this sorry-ass
backwards state.

1144

I wouldn't listen.

1145

Instead...

1146
01:14:57,173 --> 01:15:01,633
I put my faith
in naked women and hand jobs.

1147

Which have a proven track
record everywhere but here.

1148
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:14,779
And now I've been disfigured
by a whisky-dick lawyer...

1149

with a shotgun loaded
for snake.

I have to give you credit,

You took your own sweet time
rising to the occasion...

you did the deed.

asking questions, Charlie?

with anything?
