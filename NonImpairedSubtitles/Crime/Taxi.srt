305
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:35,986
I got it Got that
I'm with you

306
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,223
What? Mm-hmm

307
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:41,664
Okay Thank you
I'll be right there

308
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,601
The FBI's here

309
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm gonna do something
to you later

310
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,168
Mm-hmm

311
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,850
Washburn

312
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,189
So, did you pay by the mile, or is there a flat rate
for chasing bank robbers?

313
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,298
Quiet.

314
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,129
Quiet.

315
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:18,363
Quiet
Please give your attention to Agent Mullins

316
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:22,305
FBI Armed Robbery Unit

317
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:26,208
Thank you It's tape of this morning's robbery
Watch close

318
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:30,112
It goes by pretty fast

319
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,852
Four cameras
Four perfect shots

320
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:39,891
In and out in 35 seconds.
Lieutenant, you have the witnesses'statements.

321
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,223
Miss Williams,
I'm Lieutenant Robbins

322
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,765
This is Agent Mullins with the FBI
We want to ask you a few questions

323
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:50,427
- Am I under arrest?
- Well, no

324
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:53,004
Then I ain't answering no questions
until somebody tells me

325
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,938
who is paying for the damage on my cab
and when do I get it back?

326
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,670
Miss Williams, I'm afraid your vehicle's
physical evidence now

327
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:02,771
- We have to run ballistics tests...
- Ballistics tests? On what?

328
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:04,816
We already know
who shot my cab

329
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,385
It was that stupid idiot right there
with that dumb look on his face

330
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:10,353
That's not fair
Agent Mullins wasn't even on the scene

331
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:12,720
- I was talkin' about you
- Me?

332
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,225
You shot my back window out
You could've shot me

333
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:18,229
- You don't talk to me like that
- I'll talk however I want

334
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:20,458
- Get him out.
- Take his stinkin' ass out of here

335
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:24,024
- All right, all right I'm sorry
- Are you kidding me?

336
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:27,765
- I'm sorry
- That is the FBI in there You need to calm down

337
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,704
Somebody better talk to him.

338
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,438
Sorry 'bout that, dude, um, sir
The adrenaline's still pumping

339
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,411
You know what I'm saying?
Had a crazy morning

340
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,812
I'm a little out of line,
and I apologize

341
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,909
Detective Washburn,
you were the first one on the scene, correct?

342
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,147
Yes, I was
I was the first one on the scene

343
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:48,056
My first instinct is to give you a shot
at leading this investigation

344
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,119
- However, I spoke with your lieutenant
You're off the case

345
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:56,296
- Permanently
- What?

346
00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:00,304
Nice meeting you

347
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,840
I know

348
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,580
Y... Marta, you can't...
Lieutenant

349
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:15,153
- You can't...
- Enough

350
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,621
Now, go clock in
You're late for your shift

351
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:25,522
I already told you everything I know

352
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:30,967
You can't hold me.
Now, I want my cab.

353
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,767
- Says here you did a year in juvenile hall
- That's supposed to be sealed

354
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:38,640
Joyriding Graduated to reckless driving,
fleeing the scene of an accident...

355
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:41,679
look at this... moving violation,
moving violation, moving violation

356
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:45,877
- Come on Everybody got a few tickets
- Not 75

357
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:49,318
And not on a bicycle,
Miss Williams

358
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:52,550
Officers at the front desk will give you
the forms you need to fill out.

359
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,855
As far as your car's concerned, you'll get that back
when we're done Two weeks, maybe longer

360
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,488
Two weeks? Come on, man
This is bullshit

361
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,066
That's notjust my car.
That is myjob.

362
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:05,865
Wh-What am I supposed to do?
Give people piggyback rides to Newark Airport?

363
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,930
One more question

364
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,533
Did you ever get close enough
to see the guy driving the car?

365
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:17,716
No, sir

366
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:21,412
All I saw was their taillights

367
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,552
Can I go now?

368
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:29,219
- Here we go again.
Didn't I say 5.00? Where are you?
- Jesse.

369
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,161
I feel like a damn fool, B,
thinking you'd actually be here on time

370
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:36,928
- I tried
- No, no, no No I'm tired of hearing excuses, okay?

371
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:40,335
I'm sittin' in my cab, right?
All of a sudden out of nowhere, this guy jumps...

372
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:44,398
Hello? Baby?
Jesse?

373
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,207
What the hell
could be so damn important?

374
00:30:56,889 --> 00:31:01,292
- Freakin' day I had
- Hey Miss Williams

375
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,691
- You again
- Hey, hey, hey

376
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,263
- Go ahead Talk
- I just wanna talk

377
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,628
- Talk then
- I can get you your cab back

378
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,932
Come on

379
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,335
Come on

380
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,375
You gotta help me first

381
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,239
Okay? Just hear me out

382
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,481
They got five detectives on this case.
We gotta catch these guys first.

383
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:28,212
All I got to go on is
the MO, modus operandi

384
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,447
- That's police jargon for...
- I know what it means

385
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,992
- It's not police jargon It's Latin
- Right Whatever It's both

386
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:37,722
They were pretty quick though
They were in and out in, like, under a minute

387
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,459
That's real pros Witnesses
said they're either Spanish or Italian

388
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,865
Nah, I think they're Brazilian
They were speaking Portuguese

389
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,437
- You sure?
- Confia em mim.

390
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:50,168
My first job was delivering food at...

391
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:53,575
Brazilian
This is huge

392
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,307
Hey, why are we not
doing this at the station?

393
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,748
Sometimes a good cop's got to bend the rules
so that laws don't get broken

394
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:03,015
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not afraid to live outside the law.

395
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,023
You living outside of your mind
That's where you live

396
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,424
Well, the reports here say
that the man driving was about 5'10"

397
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:14,192
No No, no, no, no
If that was a man, so am I

398
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,430
She looked like a model
Tan, blondish hair

399
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,835
All right As I was saying
It was a woman driving

400
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,674
- and she was driving a Mercedes... an Au...
- No

401
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,909
- Mm-mmm No, no, no
- She was driving... Definitely you saw her driving

402
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:34,508
- a BMW?
- Right

403
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,647
- Yeah, but not just a BMW It was a 760
- Mm-hmm

404
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:43,285
- But the engine sounded lighter
- Light, yeah

405
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:47,354
Now, with that much torque, she had to have
an inboard torsion damper system

406
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:51,334
with a push rod bell crank
and double wishbone arrangement.

407
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:54,531
Wait a minute
You shot her tire out, didn't you?

408
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,666
Yeah Standard OP

409
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,744
- That's police jargon for...
- But she kept on going

410
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,575
'cause she had run flats

411
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:07,812
Yeah, that's what I thought
She had "runs" flats on

412
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,253
Armored tires They seal themselves
with a gel when they're punctured

413
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:14,326
Now, they're good,
but they only go for about 50 miles

414
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:17,725
So, if she wants to drive that car again,
she's gonna have to get a new tire

415
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,733
And there's only one place to get that tire
around here Lou's Garage in Secaucus

416
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:26,327
- What are we waiting for? Let's hit it Take my ride
- All right

417
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:30,374
There's my baby, right there

418
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:32,740
- This is your unmarked car?
- We found her

419
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:37,976
A Daewoo? Man, I know people
I can't be seen in this thing

420
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:42,247
Tsk Open the door
I don't wanna get Daewoo on my hands

421
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:50,417
Buckle up for safety, everybody
Hard to do it with my holster on

422
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,157
Okay, we're good

423
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:56,325
Good, wipers work
10:00 and 2:00

424
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:59,268
Mirrors work
And here we go

425
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,204
Oh, damn

426
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,935
- Whoa! Sheesh, man
- Little ding Little ding

427
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:08,411
- That's why you got bumpers
- Can't you... What the hell?

428
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:11,574
- You trying to kill me?
- I'm not a perfect driving robot

429
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:15,085
- I know Oh! What are you doing?
- Here comes Junior

430
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:18,816
- Here comes Junior
- You can't... Oh, shit! Wait! Stop Stop Stop

431
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:23,054
What the hell are you trying to do,
a 78-point turn?

432
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:26,791
- Can you get us out of this spot?
- Yes

433
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,434
Everyone just chill out
Be real cool about it

434
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,334
Everyone just chill out
Be real cool about it

435
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,131
God... damn!

436
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,434
Now, I'm turning the wheel
Turning the wheel

437
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:38,601
- Oh, my God! Wait Wait
- Shh Everyone be cool

438
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:40,838
No Stop

439
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:47,642
What? What? What do you...
What do you want?

440
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,184
- What's the problem here?
- Get over there

441
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,748
- I got... I got shotgun
- Get your ass over there

442
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,488
You got insurance?
'Cause that's what I'm gonna need

443
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:01,555
Daggone whiplash
You got a driver's license?

444
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,658
Let me get my belt on

445
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:08,206
Who the hell gave you a driver's license?
That's what I wanna know

446
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:13,371
Okay, after I show you this place,
I'm gonna get my cab back?

447
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,379
- Deal.
- 'Cause I don't really trust you.

448
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:20,282
Soon as I know this is the place,
we'll go back to the station, I'll get your cab back.

449
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,057
- This is it?
- Yep

450
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:29,127
If they gettin' that car fixed,
they-they gotta come here

451
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,798
- So, what now?
- We wait

452
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:58,982
You can open your eyes now
I'm done

453
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:02,549
You didn't see my nads, did you?

454
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:09,932
Man

455
00:36:10,035 --> 00:36:14,233
So, you got guy problems, huh?
Overheard you and your man on the phone

456
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,467
Want a little bit
of wisdom from the man side?

457
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:20,739
I'll give it to you

458
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:24,145
Men are like cats, you know?

459
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,376
Sure, we'll play with
the ball of yarn

460
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,943
unless you want us
to play with the ball of yarn

461
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,388
Trick is,
hide the ball of yarn

462
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:41,591
Don't hide it where you can't find it,
you know?

463
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,498
"Hey, what's the ball of yarn
doin' in the fridge?"

464
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:46,594
Whatever
You know what I'm saying?

465
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:54,772
You know, cops are supposed
to talk to each other on stakeouts

466
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,575
It helps the mission
go by faster

467
00:36:56,682 --> 00:37:00,140
- Would you please shut up?
- Okay That's cool

468
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:04,382
You wanna be quiet? That's cool
No room for chitchat That's fine

469
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,617
I don't care I don't need...
I don't need to talk

470
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,626
We'll just sit here
in silence

471
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:18,467
So, are you into cars, or...
I mean, what got you into cars?

472
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,405
I mean, were you always into them?
Did you just, like, stumble upon them?

473
00:37:23,508 --> 00:37:25,635
Damn My grandpa

474
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,679
- Okay?
- Yeah

475
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,509
W-What?
He loved driving, or...

476
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:35,747
Yeah He was a mechanic
Taught me everything I know

477
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,618
We used to live
next to a track

478
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,851
You used to go to the track all day?
That's fun

479
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:45,157
No We didn't really go that much
I mean, we went to a couple races

480
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:48,461
But mostly, we would just listen
to the races together

481
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:51,593
I could hear those cars.
Hear those engines.

482
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,831
I got good
l-I got to the point where

483
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,000
I could tell who won the race
without even seeing it

484
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,739
- Yeah. Driving NASCAR. That's my dream.
- Wow

485
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:06,648
Wait. Let me ask you something.
Why would you take a taxi to a bank robbery?

486
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,879
I mean,
I've never seen that

487
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,114
I got in a wreck in my last gig

488
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:14,124
Bad guys got away
My lieutenant flipped out

489
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:17,389
Put me back on the beat
No vehicle

490
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,657
Aw, man

491
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:23,496
What makes it worse,
me and my lieutenant used to date

492
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:26,571
- Yeah We went to Academy together
- Okay

493
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:30,130
She got promoted
I didn't

494
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:32,710
You can cut the sexual tension
with a knife

495
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,246
Shh! Look

496
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:43,186
There they are.

497
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:46,416
Oh, man Yep
That's her

498
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,425
That's her.

499
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:54,321
- Party time
- Hey So-So, what we gonna do now?

500
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,560
- I mean, we gonna call it in, right?
- Call it in?

501
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,933
By the time we get backup, that soup will be cold
We go in now, baby Now

502
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:15,510
Shoot Oh, my God

503
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,351
Daewoo, please. I'm sorry.
I take back everything I said. Start for me.

504
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,567
Hi Um, I'm not actually with him
He's...

505
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:46,714
- You okay?
- Yeah

506
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:50,219
Damn

507
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:10,805
- What are they saying?
- The redhead is saying
she doesn't wanna kill a cop

508
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,537
If we just play it cool,
then they'll leave us here tied up

509
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:16,637
Okay Okay I'll play it cool
Play it real cool

510
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,740
Okay Hey,
what was that wink for?

511
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:23,947
- Shh Hey, trust me
- No, no, no, no, no, man What was that about?

512
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:25,580
- Shh Trust me Trust me
- Trust you?

513
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,352
- Yeah
- Trust you? Hell no Uh-uh No way

514
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,758
No, no, no Uh-uh
Hey Excuse me

515
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,353
- Excuse me

516
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:37,196
Excuse me Hey Excuse me
Don't mean to interrupt

517
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:39,395
He's gonna do something
He just winked at me

518
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:41,472
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

519
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:44,542
- Yeah
- I got a problem gettin' shot Did you frisk him?

520
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:48,545
- Come on.
- Frisk his ass again
He got at least one more gun on him

521
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,877
- Cavity-search him
- I do not I swear

522
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,975
He got a gun, and he's gonna use it
He's crazy

523
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:56,782
- Whose side are you on?
- Mine

524
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:04,058
Okay You wanna strip search? Huh?
Is that what you want? Nothing up my sleeve here

525
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:06,687
You wanna check my shoes there?
Ha!

526
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,288
Go!

527
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,241
All right,
you're all under...

528
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:22,708
Man, you're more dangerous
than they are

529
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,175
Hey What are you doing, man?

530
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,322
I'm evening
the playing field

531
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,254
I'm evening
the playing field

532
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:35,486
That's flammable gas They won't be able to shoot
This whole place will blow

533
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:39,496
Man, we still
in this place, you jackass

534
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,429
Turn that off,
and let's wait for the cops to come

535
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,764
The real cops

536
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,771
Oh, my G...

537
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:50,501
- Oh
- Aw, man.

538
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:55,706
You smell that, ladies?
That's nitrous One shot and boom!

539
00:41:55,814 --> 00:42:01,343
Now, you wanna handle this
hand to hand, man to... chick?

540
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:04,718
Then we'll go home.

541
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,950
Hello. Hello?

542
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,049
Ace Dumbtura, they're gone

543
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,592
They're gone

544
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,325
Stay down. Stay down.
They're not there.

545
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,971
- Come on We gotta go
- Oh, damn

546
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,405
This thing's jammed

547
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,302
- Oh, man
- Ohh

548
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,814
Dumb ass

549
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:40,924
You can't... You can't die
from nitrous oxide can you?

550
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:43,460
It's laughing gas, stupid

551
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:47,191
I hate you, man

552
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,995
- What's that?
- I hate your freakin' guts

553
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:54,561
- Ow
- You got to be the dumbest cop I've met

554
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:01,642
- We gotta go We gotta get out
- Okay.

555
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,714
- We gotta get out
- All right Okay Open the door

556
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,511
Open the door, man
Move

557
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:14,022
You're stupid All you had to do
was turn the freakin' knob

558
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:18,323
Your car is on fire

559
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,330
- No Come on
- Daewoo can't take a little heat?

560
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,663
Drop the weapon!

561
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,861
- Freeze!
- Oh

562
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:27,768
Okay. This does not look good.

563
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:30,807
Here's the plan, all right?
Okay, when he comes by...

564
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:39,340
Or that Hey! Hey!
Wait for me! Belle! Belle, wait up!

565
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:43,387
They've gone around the back side
of this building. We need to go.

566
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:50,126
I tell you what we do.
We go back to the station and search the files...

567
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:53,686
No, no... No Hell no
We ain't goin' nowhere

568
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,598
You're comin' back to my house
with me to tell my boyfriend where I was

569
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:00,000
'Cause I had a man
when I went to work today

570
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:02,733
Okay That's the least
I can do

571
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:07,141
Damn straight The most you could do
would be to get my cab back

572
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:11,204
You'll get your cab back
when I catch these guys... girls, women

573
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,784
Not before

574
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,114
I'm getting a little seasick

575
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,728
Swallowed it

576
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,288
I don't know if this is gonna work,
so just hurry up and show him your badge, okay?

577
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,392
Because he's sensitive,
and he is pissed off

578
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,971
All right. I got your back right here.
I owe you one.

579
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:37,439
What the hell?

580
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,669
Jesse Baby, you home?

581
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,281
- Wait I can explain I was with this guy all night
- Oh, really?

582
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:48,216
Then go home with him, Belle
I'm tired of hearing your apologies

583
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,221
First of all, don't take that tone with me
I ain't apologizing

584
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:53,848
Don't you be taking that tone
I've been waiting here all night

585
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,927
Hey, hey, hey I got this
I can handle this All right?

586
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:01,328
I can totally handle this

587
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,367

589
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,573

pretty good-looking white dude

590
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,540

593
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:22,543
He's gonna give it back, right?

594
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:28,625
What's that sound?

595
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:32,595
Blowtorch

596
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:36,997

Man

601
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:51,415
- Always wanted a money clip
- What the hell was that?

602
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:54,974
- It was my badge
- You know what? Fine

603
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,247
Forget it
I'm just gonna let him cool off

604
00:45:57,355 --> 00:46:00,518
- Hey, wait up
- I don't know you for seven hours, I lose my cab

605
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,093
my boyfriend
and my apartment

606
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:05,094
- You battin' a thousand, you know?
- Yeah

607
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:08,324
I mean, it's not enough you screw up
your own life, huh? This your place?

608
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,934
No I figured we'd stop here,
get something to eat

609
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:10,832
No I figured we'd stop here,
get something to eat

610
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:14,132
You actually have a girlfriend?

611
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,198
Ma!

612
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:19,503
- Ma
- Sweetheart

613
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:23,377
I love you I love you I love you

614
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:25,711
Ma, I brought company

615
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:27,216
- Oh.
- Hi

616
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,446
Nice catch
Jungle fever

617
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:34,286
- You know me
- Excuse me.

618
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,987
I'm not his girlfriend
I ain't even his friend

619
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:43,667
Mom, uh, Belle here
is a cabdriver

620
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:45,702
and she witnessed a bank robbery...

621
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:49,638
- She needs a place to stay
- Get in here! Come in

622
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:52,835
Come in

623
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:59,176
Oh, you must be starving

624
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:04,916
I have got the number of a joint

625
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,924
that makes
a General Tso's chicken...

626
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:12,725
It'll knock you
on your goddamn ass.

627
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,629
- Whoo!
- Your mom's drunk, huh?

628
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:18,497
Always

629
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:26,880
Where's my Daewoo?

630
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:29,982
Andy...

631
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:31,517
- did you do something to my car?
- Don't

632
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:35,076
- You busted
- Andy

633
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:39,250
Look at me, darling You didn't drive through
another bodega, did you?

634
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,157
- That was you?
- What? What?

635
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:45,925
That was you
on the cover of the post.

636
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,331
- You killed that parrot
- No

637
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:50,960
Mom, what'd I tell you about
talking official police business, all right?

638
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:55,508
- Sorry
- He had the mustache
I didn't recognize you at first

639
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:59,545
See...
They took his license away

640
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:02,046
There was the third car that he totaled
He even wrecked

641
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:04,982
one of those big armored machines,
you know, with the battering ram?

642
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:07,451
Who the hell gave him
one of those?

643
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:12,457
He just mowed down three mailboxes like that
That's a federal offense

644
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:18,361
- Mom
- Well, Andy is not a really strong driver

645
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:20,990
See, he had a really bad
experience when, uh...

646
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:22,830
he had his first
driving lesson

647
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:24,836
Driving lesson?
You call that a driving lesson?

648
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:28,066
- Mmm Yes
- Dad let go of the wheel and said

649
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:30,040
"You better steer or else
you're going to kill the whole family"

650
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:32,135
Yeah It was good for you

651
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:34,214
- We were going 90 I was six
- That's right

652
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:37,374
- And that's the way he taught you to swim
- I can't swim either

653
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:41,011
- Well...
- Can we drop it?

654
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:44,818
- Okay Sure
- Okay, Mom Lock it

655
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:47,553
Down your...
Down your brassiere it goes

656
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:56,193
Oh Mommy's getting
the spins

657
00:48:56,303 --> 00:48:59,670
Whoo. That's it for me.

658
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:02,003
- That's it
- That's it for the kid.

659
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:05,772
Why don't you...
Take good care of this little girl

660
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:08,177
- Daddy will be so proud of you
- Mommy Thank you Come on

661
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:10,273
- Good night, sweetheart
- Good night, Mom

662
00:49:10,384 --> 00:49:12,284
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, nice to meet you too

663
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:15,685
- Yes Yes
- Oh, she'll be back

664
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,053
- Where's my-my drink?
- There it is

665
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:21,525
Don't forget that.
Mom, the bedroom's that way.

666
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:26,292
- Okay, sweetheart
- Or are you just getting the blender?

667
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,030
- Oh, yeah
- That's a... That's a 38-ounce blender

668
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:34,606
You know, it is
getting late

669
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,903
Do you wanna just crash at my place
until your dude cools off?

670
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,102
Like I have a choice

671
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:51,465
Tsk Stop playing
You live next door to your moms?

672
00:49:51,568 --> 00:49:54,264
Makes her feel safe

673
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:57,374
She must not've
seen you in action, huh?

674
00:49:57,374 --> 00:49:59,342
She must not've
seen you in action, huh?

675
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:05,438
Oh, God, it feels good to lay down.

676
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,558
Good night

677
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:15,855
Good night

678
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:20,396
What kind of grown-ass man
lives 10 feet away from his mama?

679
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:23,466
I wouldn't talk so much

680
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,536
Isabelle "Precious" Williams

681
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:30,095
- Who told you about my name?
- It's in your record

682
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:32,732
Precious
My Precious

683
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:37,041
Go ahead Say it again
Say it again, see what happens I dare you

684
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:49,859
Precious

685
00:50:59,736 --> 00:51:02,296
Hey, you know, I was just thinking
I remembered something

686
00:51:02,406 --> 00:51:07,366
The girls kept saying over and over again
to each other, "Nice 'dua rateeraros."

687
00:51:10,113 --> 00:51:12,138
Mais duas retiradas?

688
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:14,149
Yeah That's what they said

689
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:17,709
That means,
"Two more withdrawals"

690
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:20,847
I want five cars on 14th and Broadway waitin',
and I want 'em now

691
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,383
- Hey, I've made a major break...
- Get out

692
00:51:25,489 --> 00:51:27,616
- I made a major break in the case
- Oh, really?

693
00:51:27,725 --> 00:51:30,694
Does that explain why they found a car
registered to your mom

694
00:51:30,794 --> 00:51:32,887
- on fire in front of a shot-up...
- That's not important right now

695
00:51:32,996 --> 00:51:35,294
- What's important is
they're gonna rob another bank
- First Financial

696
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:39,426
at Leonard and Church and they hit
two minutes ago and they're still inside

697
00:51:39,536 --> 00:51:41,527
So, I am busy
Now, sit down and shut up

698
00:51:43,173 --> 00:51:46,142
Damn, man

699
00:51:46,243 --> 00:51:49,770
Car 10-70. Suspects are still in the bank.

700
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,316
- How would you like me to proceed? Over.
- Backup units are on their way

701
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:57,080
- Do not let them leave.
- I don't think that's sexual tension
between you two

702
00:51:57,187 --> 00:52:01,089
I think that is genuine tension
Like, she-gonna-fire-your-ass tension

703
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:03,489
I can't stand this
You know what's gonna happen?

704
00:52:03,594 --> 00:52:06,324
They're gonna catch them,
and we're gonna miss the whole thing

705
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:10,958
- Please Ain't no cop gonna catch that woman
- Oh, yeah, and you can, right?

706
00:52:11,068 --> 00:52:14,629
If I had my taxi

707
00:52:14,738 --> 00:52:16,729
Right away.

708
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,900
And keep me informed.

709
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:23,275

- Oh Wow

Shots fired Shots fired!
Officer needs assistance

729
00:53:35,919 --> 00:53:39,821
Suspects are headed north on Third Avenue
towards the Queensboro Bridge.

730
00:53:39,923 --> 00:53:41,891
What?

Come on Run lights

732
00:53:44,528 --> 00:53:46,519
- What are you doin'?
- Why would you take the East Side?

733
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:48,996
The Queensboro would be
a parking lot

734
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,930
Oh, you bein' slick
You headin' west

- We're not gonna catch...
- Oh, you think you slick, don't you?

737
00:53:57,674 --> 00:54:01,337
You know 68th'll be gridlocked
'cause Hunter College's semesterjust started.

738
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:04,570

00:54:06,116 --> 00:54:09,745
Of course She gonna take Fifth
Hell, yeah

740
00:54:09,853 --> 00:54:12,413
There's plenty of room to maneuver
down the Museum Mile...

741
00:54:12,523 --> 00:54:16,459
and I know your crazy ass ain't scared
to get up on that sidewalk

742
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,791
That's what I would do

743
00:54:19,897 --> 00:54:21,865

751
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:08,973
Watch this

752

905
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,747
Um, baby, what are you doin' here?

906
01:07:40,853 --> 01:07:46,189
You left your phone here. He called,
and I explained everything to him. And...

907
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:49,090
Belle, he's a dream

908
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:52,187
- So, you're not mad at me no more?
- How could I be mad at you?

909
01:07:52,298 --> 01:07:54,198
- You was mad at me
- I wasn't that mad

910
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,633
- Come here
- Ohhh
- l... mmm

911
01:07:57,736 --> 01:07:59,761
- Well, I missed you Mmm
- I missed you too, baby

912
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:03,137
- Oh.
- Oh, my

913
01:08:04,944 --> 01:08:07,845
- This is like watching pay-per-view
- Mother!

914
01:08:07,947 --> 01:08:10,711
Ooh

915
01:08:10,816 --> 01:08:13,046
Mom, clear your throat

916
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,518
- Uh, hi.
- Hi

917
01:08:16,622 --> 01:08:19,614
- Come on Let's go home
- Oh, no, no, no You're not going anywhere

918
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:21,693
- I made dinner
- No, you didn't

919
01:08:21,794 --> 01:08:25,628
No, I didn't But, I made margaritas

920
01:08:25,998 --> 01:08:28,660
We can order
Oh, boy, can we order

921
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:32,669
All right, look, let's be logical about this.
Let's go through the story one more time.

922
01:08:32,771 --> 01:08:34,966
- Yeah
- Okeydoke.
B.M. W. Pulls out in front, right?

923
01:08:35,074 --> 01:08:38,566
Well, see, that's the amazing thing right there...
getting a parking space in Manhattan.

924
01:08:39,712 --> 01:08:41,577
YeahJesse's totally right
Wait a sec

925
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,413
How do you get a parkin' space in front
of a bank two days in a row? In Manhattan?

926
01:08:46,519 --> 01:08:49,511
Yeah, 'cause the only places I ever find
are no-parkin' zones:

927
01:08:49,622 --> 01:08:52,989
Loadin' zones, hospitals
or streets that are "no parking" for, uh...

928
01:08:59,498 --> 01:09:00,499
- Garbage day
- Yeah

929
01:09:00,499 --> 01:09:01,397
- Garbage day
- Yeah

930
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,334
- The whole side of the street is a no-parkin' zone
- Course!

931
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:09,601
So, they rob the bank early in the morning,
then they put the cash in the garbage can.

932
01:09:09,708 --> 01:09:12,609
We chase the Beemer The garbage truck

933
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:15,236
picks up the cash,
and they meet up later on

934
01:09:15,347 --> 01:09:18,043
So even if you do catch 'em,
that's why they ain't got the money on 'em

935
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,846
The only thing they need to pull it off
is a garbage man

936
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,421
- We gotta find that garbage man
- Okay

937
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:25,456
- Bye, Mom
- Hold on. Where you goin'?

938
01:09:25,558 --> 01:09:27,617
Bye, baby

939
01:09:27,726 --> 01:09:30,524
Wait, wait! Yo, whoa!
Yo, what do you want me to do with this?

940
01:09:32,565 --> 01:09:36,433
We can't wait till the morning
The FBI may have already caught them by then

941
01:09:36,535 --> 01:09:39,595
I mean... You know what I mean
Just keep a lookout

942
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:44,208
Hurry up

943
01:09:47,446 --> 01:09:49,937
Voilà!

944
01:09:50,049 --> 01:09:54,076
Wait, wait, wait
You don't think they have an alarm?

945
01:09:54,186 --> 01:09:57,087
Come on It's not Fort Knox
It's the Department of Sanitation

946
01:09:57,189 --> 01:10:00,352
Ooh Shh! Quiet down

947
01:10:00,459 --> 01:10:02,893
Plan "B" Plan "B"

948
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:09,459

951
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:20,308
Hello, what do we have here? Uh-oh,

952
01:10:20,412 --> 01:10:23,142
- Way to stay cool, dude Way to stay cool
- Yeah Look!

953
01:10:23,249 --> 01:10:25,740
They even left
their lock picks

954
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:29,082
Surely they got
prints on these

955
01:10:29,188 --> 01:10:32,749
- Gotta... Gotta tag these What's your name, sir?

01:11:25,425 --> 01:11:27,120

976
01:12:01,127 --> 01:12:03,027
Damn

977
01:12:03,129 --> 01:12:03,823
Hello?

978
01:12:09,936 --> 01:12:12,370
Shh

979
01:12:12,472 --> 01:12:15,600
One last pickup,
then you are free

980
01:12:15,708 --> 01:12:18,973
You bring us
the cash again

981
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:21,342
then, hey...
we let you go

982
01:12:21,447 --> 01:12:24,314
We... We let your wife go

983
01:12:24,417 --> 01:12:27,250
After I bring you the money,
how do I know what will happen then?

984
01:12:27,353 --> 01:12:30,254
You don't

985
01:12:30,356 --> 01:12:34,554
But if you go to the police,
you do know what will happen

986
01:12:34,661 --> 01:12:36,561
Huh?

987
01:12:47,407 --> 01:12:49,637
- So, that's the best way, over here
- Mm-hmm

988
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:52,210
We get in from here, and, uh

989
01:12:52,311 --> 01:12:55,644
I think the best way out is coming from here
so we can make it faster

990
01:13:02,155 --> 01:13:05,215
Your car, sir

to get the money out, okay?

1000
01:13:41,728 --> 01:13:43,628
Both robberies were on
the same garbage man's route

1001
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:47,393
We went to his house

somewhere between 23rd and 34th,
east of Fifth

1005
01:14:05,218 --> 01:14:08,984
Down! Down!

So?
So, what we gonna do?

1013
01:15:04,777 --> 01:15:06,677

- Hey, grab somebody

1017
01:15:43,683 --> 01:15:48,711
Now, I'm going to drive away.

1278
01:41:37,969 --> 01:41:41,097

1279
01:41:41,205 --> 01:41:44,265
I don't want no excuses later

1280
01:42:01,837 --> 01:42:05,671
Tsk Stop playing
You live next door to your moms?

1281
01:42:05,774 --> 01:42:08,470
Makes her feel safe

1282
01:42:08,577 --> 01:42:13,537
She must not've
seen you in action, huh?

1283
01:42:18,187 --> 01:42:20,178
Uhh...

1284
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:23,688
Uh, it's a little messy, but, you know

1285
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:26,761
I've been working late so I haven't
had time to fix up the place

1286
01:42:26,862 --> 01:42:29,831
I got some good artwork
on the way on eBay

1287
01:42:29,932 --> 01:42:32,332
It's on the...
You know, I'm still bidding

1288
01:42:32,434 --> 01:42:37,030
So make yourself at home, okay?
Enjoy yourself

1289
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:40,233
Okay Ooh

1290
01:42:40,342 --> 01:42:43,311
Nice My hair

1291
01:42:45,014 --> 01:42:46,914
Hey

1292
01:42:49,618 --> 01:42:52,212
Okay, you're in luck.
I have two options.

1293
01:42:52,321 --> 01:42:55,654
You got the sleeping bag times
or the love capsule

1294
01:43:00,462 --> 01:43:02,896
The love capsule.

1295
01:43:04,566 --> 01:43:07,228
"Dan"? Who is Dan?

1296
01:43:07,336 --> 01:43:10,362
It's supposed to say "danger"

1297
01:43:10,506 --> 01:43:12,736
You know how it is

1298
01:43:12,841 --> 01:43:14,934
Nah, I don't know how it is

1299
01:43:16,712 --> 01:43:18,612
Tattoos hurt

1300
01:43:18,714 --> 01:43:21,478
You know, they stick needles in.

1301
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:25,019
You know how tattoos happen?
They put needles in

1302
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:29,056
I think you better get that tattoo finished

1303
01:43:29,158 --> 01:43:31,456
as a warning to the rest of us

1304
01:43:35,397 --> 01:43:39,424
Oh, God, it feels good to lay down.

1305
01:43:46,775 --> 01:43:48,402
Good night

1306
01:43:49,912 --> 01:43:54,372
What kind of grown-ass man
lives 10 feet away from his mama?

1307
01:43:54,483 --> 01:43:57,452
I wouldn't talk so much

1308
01:43:57,553 --> 01:44:00,522
Isabelle "Precious" Williams

1309
01:44:00,622 --> 01:44:04,080
- Who told you about my name?
- It's in your record

1310
01:44:04,193 --> 01:44:06,718
Precious
My Precious

1311
01:44:06,829 --> 01:44:11,027
Go ahead Say it again
Say it again, see what happens I dare you

1312
01:44:21,376 --> 01:44:23,844
Precious

1313
01:44:49,138 --> 01:44:51,436
What the hell?
Get your ass off of me!

1314
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,337
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- What you doin' down here?

1315
01:44:53,442 --> 01:44:57,344
- What's wrong with you?
- I should have warned you I'm sorry

1316
01:44:57,446 --> 01:44:59,710
I roll when I sleep sometimes
I move

1317
01:44:59,815 --> 01:45:02,613
- I'm a restless sleeper.
- Yeah, you restless, all right

1318
01:45:02,718 --> 01:45:06,779
I didn't know what was happening there,
but we... we spooned, okay?

1319
01:45:06,889 --> 01:45:10,450
We spooned a little bit.
At least we didn't fork.

1320
01:45:10,559 --> 01:45:13,790
We didn't... please, be nice.

1321
01:45:13,896 --> 01:45:16,160
Wait Wait

1322
01:45:16,265 --> 01:45:19,962
I just remembered something the girls
kept saying over and over to each other

1323
01:45:20,135 --> 01:45:22,069
"Nice 'dua rateeraros."

1324
01:45:24,907 --> 01:45:26,932
Mais duas retiradas?

1325
01:45:27,042 --> 01:45:28,942
Yeah That's what they said

1326
01:45:29,044 --> 01:45:31,012
That means,
"Two more withdrawals"

1327
01:45:31,146 --> 01:45:33,580
Two more withdrawals?
Let's go! Let's go!

1328
01:45:33,682 --> 01:45:36,207
You might want to change
your clothes, freak

1329
01:45:36,318 --> 01:45:39,378
I want five cars on 14th and Broadway
waitin', and I want 'em now

1330
01:45:41,998 --> 01:45:44,398
- Did she have an accent?
- Jersey

1331
01:45:44,501 --> 01:45:47,061
Mmm

1332
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:50,105
- What size was her bust?
- What?

1333
01:45:50,206 --> 01:45:52,071
Her bosom

1334
01:45:52,175 --> 01:45:54,735
Her hooters Her headlights
Her flesh pillows Her fun bags

1335
01:45:54,844 --> 01:45:57,074
Her knockers. Her rack. Her boobs.

1336
01:45:57,180 --> 01:46:00,149
Oh
They were about like, uh...

1337
01:46:01,484 --> 01:46:03,315

1338
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:05,888
Yeah About like that, yeah

1339
01:46:05,989 --> 01:46:08,150
34-C

1340
01:46:09,426 --> 01:46:13,089
All right, finish up, Officer.

1341
01:46:13,229 --> 01:46:16,460
- Four women, and there was no
money in the car. I searched it.
- It's definitely possible

1342
01:46:16,566 --> 01:46:18,659
- There's all kinds of paint...
- What are you two talking about?

1343
01:46:18,768 --> 01:46:24,570
Of course It's a red BMW You might
as well drive a ice cream truck

1344
01:46:24,674 --> 01:46:27,234
The girls drove a BMW, so that's what
we look for Then they change it

1345
01:46:27,343 --> 01:46:30,779
Wait a minute You're saying
that all four robbers are women?

1346
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,074
- Yeah
- And you saw them?

1347
01:46:33,815 --> 01:46:36,079
