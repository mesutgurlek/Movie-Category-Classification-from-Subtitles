1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,311
SHOOT THE PIANIST

2
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,915
Thanks so much.

3
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,709
I ran into the lamp post.

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,634
I must go. My wife's waiting.

5
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,192
Been married long?

6
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,190
11 years.

7
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,036
I'd like to be married.

8
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,948
You think so?

9
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,678
Yes, I really do.

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,553
Has its advantages.

11
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,597
At the beginning...

12
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,910
I sometimes wondered...

13
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,116
how I could get rid of her.

14
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,830
Then I wondered why I thought that.

15
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,237
A matter of liberty?

16
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,558
Yes... I first met her at a dance.

17
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,313
She wasn't easy to get to know.

18
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,398
Hadn't been out much.

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,357
You know how it is in Paris.

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,716
There are more virgins...

21
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,474
than in any other town...

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,998
proportionally, anyhow.

23
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,277
But that wasn't why I married her.

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,919
Why then?

25
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,193
We just had good times together.

26
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,632
I don't know who you are.

27
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,718
I may never see you again...

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,199
so I can speak freely.

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,555
Iùs good to speak...

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,392
to a stranger sometimes.

31
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,118
Yes, quite.

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,355
I began to like her.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,070
We've been going out together for...

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,275
a year.

35
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,908
So I bought a ring.

36
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,276
Thaùs how it is.

37
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,993
Not always.

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,915
It was later
I fell in love with her.

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,835
She was in hospital
having her first baby.

40
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,994
I looked at her...

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,991
and at the baby.

42
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,713
And thaùs when it really began.

43
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,757
How many kids?

44
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,636
Three.

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,199
A good number.

46
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,749
Yes, they are fine.

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,673
I turn off here. So long.

48
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,518
Look after yourself.

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,477
I will... thanks.

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,993
Good luck!

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,276
Hello, Ted.

52
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,159
Call me Charlie. Hang on.

53
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,356
You're an odd fellow.

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,755
I haven't seen you for four years.

55
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,276
And thaùs all you say.

56
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,678
See? I hit myself.

57
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,035
I ran into a lamp post.

58
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,428
Being chased?

59
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,909
Not by the cops, anyhow.

60
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,158
Thaùs why you came?

61
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,674
Nothing doing.

62
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,713
How's Fido? All right?

63
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,953
Is business good?

64
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,314
I manage...

65
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,469
but don't count on me.

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,956
I don't want to get involved.

67
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,993
The family?

68
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,152
Everyone's all right.

69
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,957
Richard?

70
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,157
Oh, Richard manages.

71
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,516
But we miss you and Fido.

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,869
So I thought...

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,871
While you ran, eh?

74
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,035
I'm in the soup, Charlie.

75
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,156
You must help me.

76
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,073
Why think of me?
Who was after you?

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,674
Two fellows.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,719
I pulled a job with them...

79
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,279
and Richard.

80
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,473
They tried to do us
out of our share.

81
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,437
So we dropped them...

82
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,556
Richard and I.

83
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,153
Good show!

84
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,234
Who are they?

85
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,392
One wears a cap and one a hat.

86
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,475
They look like brothers...

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,596
and they both smoke pipes.

88
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,234
Hello, Charlie. How goes it?

89
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,793
What are you doing here?

90
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,508
You're wasting your time.

91
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,271
Thaùll do.

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,590
No, it won't do.

93
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,478
Take a look at yourself.

94
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,029
You should be playing
a grand piano...

95
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,713
in a cram-full concert hall.

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,391
So what are you doing here?

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,879
I can't do both.

98
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,678
You make me laugh.

99
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,638
An international virtuoso
who can't afford a car.

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,994
Thaùs crazy!

101
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,831
Thaùs enough.

102
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,239
Look at him.

103
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,868
He's a concert pianist.

104
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,270
For heaven's sake give him...

105
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,589
a grand piano...

106
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,796
With candles on it.

107
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,916
Where are the candles?

108
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,633
Pipe down!

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,677
I want to be heard.

110
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,353
People are dancing.

111
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,909
Thaùs the whole trouble.

112
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,310
Let him be. He's ill.

113
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,675
You know him?

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,398
Careful how...

115
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,879
you address me.

116
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,519
Be polite.

117
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,240
I asked who he is?

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,788
He is ashamed of me.

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,393
He is my little brother.

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,913
But he's an artist.

121
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,435
And his name's not Charlie.
Iùs Ted.

122
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,916
Shut up!

123
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,559
He has a brother?

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,917
There are four of us in the family.

125
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,116
Whaùs he paid for?

126
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,036
For playing.

127
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,235
Yes, and not...

128
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,834
to tell his life story.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,833
If you want information, pay for it.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,319
The more you want,
the more you pay.

131
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,155
Same as when you dig a well:
the deeper, the dearer.

132
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,072
Sometimes iùs so dear...

133
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,913
you drop it.

134
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,516
You're desirable.

135
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,591
Thaùs why I desire you.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,639
I've decided to get married.

137
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,152
So I'm asking you.

138
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,276
I may not be free.

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,474
The abominable snow man!
He's yours?

140
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,672
Well, he was.

141
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,958
Anyhow, I don't know who you are.

142
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,314
Charlie's brother.

143
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,833
No, really!

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,839
I like Charlie.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,638
How Ôyou like me?

146
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,916
I don't know yet.

147
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,550
Excuse me... customers.

148
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,110
My breast interests you?

149
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,077
Yes, I'm a doctor.

150
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,633
No good tonight.

151
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,199
Last night...

152
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,552
it was first class.

153
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,512
Look at my finger.

154
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,396
Interesting or curious?

155
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,558
So long, Charlie.

156
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,590
There they are!

157
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,318
- So what?
- I'm done for.

158
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,950
Go that way!

159
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,078
<i>They went that way. </i>

160
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,471
<i>They looked as if they wanted</i>
<i>to talk about business. </i>

161
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,358
<i>What kind of business? </i>

162
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,308
<i>Always the same</i>
<i>with that idiot of Chico. </i>

163
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,040
<i>Get off while the going's good. </i>

164
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,553
Good luck!

165
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,275
She's after you.

166
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,355
Who?

167
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,352
Lena. Thought I'd tell you...

168
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,111
Thanks.

169
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,759
Pity you're not keen.

170
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,958
I wish it were me.

171
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,192
I can always go.

172
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,318
Don't worry. I'm not her type.

173
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,959
In fact I'm not...

174
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,075
anyone's type.

175
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,593
Till tomorrow.

176
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,315
Come now...

177
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,078
I'm just a mess...

178
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,435
and I can't make women forget it.

179
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,630
Iùs your glands.

180
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,474
Not glands... iùs my ugly mug.

181
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,034
No need to be afraid of women.

182
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,714
You don't believe a word
of what you're saying.

183
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,472
You've had a rough time.
It shows.

184
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,470
So what?

185
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,076
I bet I know what worries you.

186
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,670
You're timid.

187
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,314
You're afraid.

188
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,071
Thaùs it.

189
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,153
Afraid...

190
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,912
I'm afraid.

191
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,957
Hell, I'm afraid!

192
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,230
Whaùs up, old man?

193
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,439
I'm afraid.

194
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,956
Those two guys...

195
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,389
Who were they?

196
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,390
I don't know.

197
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,950
Well, I'm off to bed.

198
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,157
Can't just sit around.

199
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,519
Mr Charlie!

200
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,396
I wanted to ask you to...

201
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,993
lend me some money.

202
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,309
Sure.

203
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,317
Thanks, will you take me home?

204
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,634
I don't like
walking alone at night.

205
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,311
Call me Charlie.

206
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,913
Yes, but call me Lena.

207
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,399
Why Lena?

208
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,791
Helen, Helena, Lena.

209
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,193
<i>My silence must seem odd. </i>

210
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,718
<i>She'll think I'm embarrassed. </i>

211
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,634
<i>No, silence is amorous complicity. </i>

212
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,314
<i>She is not a chatterbox. </i>

213
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,879
<i>She is dignified. </i>

214
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,031
<i>She is not one for joking. </i>

215
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,270
<i>She is a serious girl. </i>

216
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,719
Whaùs the joke?

217
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,108
Your face.

218
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,599
Listen!

219
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,193
You know those men?

220
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,315
No, why?

221
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,072
They're following.

222
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,239
Look there.

223
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,915
- Where've they gone?
- Down there.

224
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,838
What bad luck!

225
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,513
I'm off home.

226
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,553
<i>If she didn't like it... </i>

227
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,836
<i>she'd have moved away. </i>

228
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,150
<i>So she agrees then? </i>

229
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,752
<i>Offer a drink first. </i>

230
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,239
<i>Don't mess it up. </i>

231
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,709
<i>I order you to have a drink. </i>

232
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,552
<i>No, nicer. </i>

233
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,995
<i>Aren't you thirsty, Lena? </i>

234
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,793
A drink?

235
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,874
<i>Better that way. </i>

236
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,508
<i>Something else: </i>
<i>Is Art Tatum talented? </i>

237
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,669
<i>And Erroll Garner? </i>

238
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,592
<i>Yes, he is talented. </i>

239
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,638
<i>And Junior Mance? </i>
<i>You don't know him. </i>

240
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,233
Charlie, iùs Clarissa.

241
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,038
Still no pyjamas?

242
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,959
Iùs healthier.

243
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,631
Reminds me of my skeleton number.

244
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,390
Thaùs how I started.

245
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,877
I was in a coffin almost naked.

246
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,270
They could see my skeleton.

247
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,396
Even doctors were taken in.

248
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,269
[Skipped item nr. 248]

249
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,919
The artisùs life...

250
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,910
Want me...

251
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,231
No, thanks.

252
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,312
Well, I don't insist.

253
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,313
I'll go.

254
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,273
Don't be mad.

255
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,313
Get undressed...

256
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,829
and shut the door.

257
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,797
Like my dress?

258
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,269
It brings me business.

259
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,750
I don't have to pose.

260
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,388
"How much? 3,000" Yes or no.

261
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,118
Take it or leave it.

262
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,278
I don't make a fuss.

263
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,278
Might give me ideas.

264
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,472
And I don't like sexy skirts.

265
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,676
I wear nice things, eh?

266
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,870
Very pretty.

267
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,673
Thaùs what I said.

268
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,356
The others always ask me
where I get my clothes.

269
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,398
They're pretty.
And I don't pay much.

270
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,318
What do I care?

271
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,113
Are you mad?

272
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,714
No, I'm puritan.

273
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,276
A puritan!

274
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,634
So thaùs what you are!

275
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,958
Thaùs a good one!

276
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,591
Angry, pussy?

277
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,796
Are you angry?

278
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,588
Pussy's not angry. He's tired.

279
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,718
They said so on television.

280
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,229
I'm sleepy. Thaùs what I am.

281
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,509
Television is a cinema...

282
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,433
that you can see at home.

283
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,953
Move over.

284
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,639
Thaùs how it is
in the cinema.

285
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,072
I saw a film this afternoon.

286
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,150
Any good?

287
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,357
John Wayne saying
the Yanks want peace.

288
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,199
Then they are like me.

289
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,429
Making fun of me?

290
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,795
Not at all, darling.

291
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,712
Give me a drag.

292
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,192
No, not like that...
you dirty bastard.

293
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,032
Aren't you supposed to be shy?

294
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,555
But the shy can be daring.

295
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,910
Go back to your room... hurry up!

296
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,840
All I do is cook the dinner.

297
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,275
Now then! My trousers!

298
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,514
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing...

299
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,031
Do up my zip!

300
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,914
Go to your room! So long.

301
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,396
Fido!

302
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,716
Time to get up.

303
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,876
Hurry! You'll be late.

304
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,995
Till tonight, Charlie.

305
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,314
Do I know you?

306
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,357
I'm Ernest. He's Momo.

307
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,428
Get in!

308
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,589
I'm walking.

309
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,829
He doesn't need it.

310
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,911
- I'll show him.
- He knows.

311
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,674
- He may not.
- Show him then.

312
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,195
Now will you get in?

313
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,634
All right.

314
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,273
What Ôyou think?

315
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,759
He's tough.

316
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,434
Yes. We think you're tough.

317
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,279
50,000 OK?

318
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,158
Not enough? How much?

319
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,595
I don't need it.

320
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,875
We have the dough.

321
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,076
Yes... show him.

322
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,796
Why carry it about?

323
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,751
Now, where were we?

324
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,388
He doesn't want any money.

325
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,711
You see, we want to talk to him.

326
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,517
Who?

327
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,318
Now, leùs be open.

328
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,755
We want your brother.

329
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,831
So you take us...

330
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,672
to the farm.

331
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,274
- I can't.
- Yes you can.

332
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,318
Get behind with him.
Here's the girl.

333
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,914
Sort of Madame Charlie.

334
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,949
You know her?

335
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,117
- Whaùs this?
- Ask him.

336
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,474
Why should I?

337
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,312
We're going to his brother.

338
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,318
The one with the black eye?

339
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,438
They must have found out about him.

340
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,192
They've got my address too.

341
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,237
Who from?

342
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,913
I'm not sure.

343
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,149
I'll tell you.

344
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,598
<i>We've had a drink with your boss. </i>

345
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,911
<i>He gave us all the dope. </i>

346
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,992
<i>25,000 each. Not bad for... </i>

347
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,594
<i>Charlie's address. </i>

348
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,273
<i>The bastard... </i>

349
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,589
<i>counted the money. </i>

350
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,149
<i>The ugly bastard. </i>

351
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,394
The fat pig!

352
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,676
Look out!

353
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,836
Who's driving?

354
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,673
You are. But look out.

355
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,069
You're right.

356
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,232
We must be careful
with our hostages.

357
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,038
You had time to go.

358
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,673
Get a move on.

359
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,989
Leave me alone.

360
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,110
If I were...

361
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,389
Keep calm.

362
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,590
I am calm.

363
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,959
But if there's one thing I can do...

364
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,599
iùs drive a car.

365
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,520
I can do what I like with a car.

366
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,630
Except overtake.

367
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,119
Want to annoy me?

368
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,874
Instead of looking at the girls...

369
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,553
watch the road.

370
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,153
You'll hit someone!

371
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,673
If I do...

372
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,274
I'll avenge my dad. He was...

373
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,078
knocked down while...

374
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,356
Iooking at the girls.

375
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,916
He looked at them and was run over.

376
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,310
Dirty old man!

377
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,868
I'm proud of him.

378
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,554
I always manage to look when...

379
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,199
the wind blows...

380
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,793
and skirts lift.

381
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,236
I shock you?

382
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,710
Not at all.

383
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,199
You're not the first dirty man
I've met.

384
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,432
I'll tell you what.

385
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,319
All women want it.

386
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,515
Want what?

387
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,194
I agree... they all want it.

388
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,715
And so they'll have it.

389
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,879
I'm not against women.

390
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,155
Quite so.

391
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,548
I love them...

392
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,193
for what they are.

393
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,835
Trouble is you must talk before...

394
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,069
and afterwards...

395
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,994
when you want to get away.

396
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,837
If I may be allowed...

397
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,510
to quote my father...

398
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,478
When you've seen one,
you've seen the lot.

399
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,834
When I see one first...

400
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,513
I love her.

401
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,193
I want to marry her.

402
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,396
But once she's open her mouth...

403
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,198
all I want is to roger her.

404
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,550
Nice manners!

405
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,233
Thaùs how it is.

406
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,799
You must admit...

407
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,872
You do everything to excite us.

408
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,837
Lipstick and nail varnish.

409
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,752
Short skirts and...

410
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,593
high heels. Why wear stockings?

411
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,239
Why not socks like us?

412
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,755
A girl with socks is horrible.

413
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,399
One day when
all my shorts were dirty...

414
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,632
I took my sister's.

415
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,837
I understood
why they always want it.

416
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,956
We wear trousers.

417
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,839
But their legs are always touching.

418
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,194
What about priests?

419
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,670
How must they feel?

420
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,196
They wear long pants.

421
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,151
Look out! Red lights!

422
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,709
Thaùs torn it!

423
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,598
We'll have it out later.

424
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,279
Open up!

425
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,468
The door? Help me.

426
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,477
What is it, officer?

427
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,911
Stop the engine. Get out!

428
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,194
Papers?

429
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,673
He's an awful driver, officer.

430
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,913
He gets nervous.

431
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,350
Coming, darling?

432
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,873
Thaùs enough.

433
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,758
We'll take the bus.

434
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,755
So long!

435
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,909
Be seeing you.

436
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,798
Yes, come and see us.

437
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,712
Right! So long.

438
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,113
"So long"?

439
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,908
We'll see soon enough.

440
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,832
Yes, leùs not worry.

441
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,714
Their guns have silencers?

442
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,159
<i>She took your arm herself. </i>
<i>Just like that. </i>

443
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,358
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>she's taking you home. </i>

444
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,833
Iùs this way.

445
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,918
I'll go first.

446
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,597
<i>Don't look at her legs. </i>

447
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,591
<i>Look at the stairs... </i>

448
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,909
<i>or the walls. </i>

449
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,513
<i>They're pretty dirty. </i>

450
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,595
Now Charlie plays in a bar.

451
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,398
Once upon a time it was different,

452
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,439
eh, Edward?

453
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,039
Once upon a time...

454
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,435
Have you any creme caramel?

455
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,749
No, iùs off.

456
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,591
I see.

457
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,670
Menu, please.

458
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,193
Pity.

459
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,998
At your service.

460
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,232
Till when?

461
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,433
Please...

462
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,469
Coffee, sir?

463
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,628
Yes. Take this for your trouble.

464
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,152
Iùs too much.

465
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,751
<i>Too little... </i>

466
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,275
<i>for two years happiness. </i>

467
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,319
We don't accept tips.

468
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,839
Been here often?

469
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,319
Several days.

470
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,914
I've seen him somewhere.

471
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,111
I don't want you to...

472
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,391
work here any more.

473
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,955
Iùs not your piano lessons that...

474
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,517
Don't make fun of my piano lessons.

475
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,908
You were happy.

476
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,593
Yes, remember?

477
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,228
I may succeed in learning something.

478
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,515
I'm a fool but...

479
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,035
"You're not at all foolish...

480
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,519
but the piano..."

481
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,831
"But I love my lessons
every afternoon".

482
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,353
"You like the piano?"

483
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,272
"Yes, Mr Edward".

484
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,796
True you want me with you always?

485
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,793
Iùs more than that.

486
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,518
I know. Me too.

487
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,558
More every day.

488
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,909
What can I get you?

489
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,155
My name is...

490
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,639
Schmeel, impresario.

491
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,397
- Edward Saroyan.
- I remember.

492
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,479
You came to see me a year ago.

493
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,871
Thaùs right.

494
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,396
I was very busy at the time.

495
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,675
Please excuse me.

496
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,750
I understand.

497
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,670
What a life!

498
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,672
You're having lunch?

499
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,273
This... is my wife.

500
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,513
We play at customer and waitress.

501
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,596
Marvellous! There are two winners.

502
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,590
You're lucky.

503
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,671
Nice of you.

504
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,274
I want to make good.

505
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,193
Will you come to my office tomorrow?

506
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,959
Who taught you?

507
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,519
Old Zeleny.

508
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,276
- Why the face?
- Nothing.

509
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,556
You were gay in the car.

510
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,110
And then you suddenly shut up.

511
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,829
I knew you weren't listening.

512
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,276
You pretend to.

513
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,113
But all the time
you're thinking of the household.

514
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,635
I was trying to explain
what pleased me about the concert.

515
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,633
But you look so bored
when I'm talking to you...

516
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,994
I didn't finish.

517
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,878
I'm fed up!

518
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,473
This is no life for an artist.

519
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,392
I may not be a great artist...

520
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,470
but I need...

521
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,155
people to think so.
Is it asking too much?

522
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,231
I have to be very patient
to live with you.

523
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,550
And your conversation!

524
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,153
Hemingway...

525
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,390
collects your records.

526
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,198
So and so didn't like
your last recital.

527
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,874
Whaùs-his-name
thinks I'm the greatest pianist.

528
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,076
Should I accept this?

529
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,437
Did so and so see me on television?

530
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,876
And everything ten times over.

531
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,474
I pretend to listen...

532
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,753
What a life!

533
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,228
Don't you think I'm fed up, too?

534
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,673
If only you were conceited,

535
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,237
more self-confident,
you'd stop bugging me.

536
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,914
You can't stand criticism.

537
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,390
I'm talking nonsense
because I'm jealous.

538
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,233
No, what you say is true.

539
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,038
I know it.

540
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,633
What to do?

541
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,354
I'm not your type.

542
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,353
Don't say that. It hurts me!

543
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,673
What a success!

544
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,910
Your wife must be happy.

545
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,559
But I must say...

546
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,950
your press conference was a flop.

547
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,078
The journalists
come to see the genius...

548
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,754
and can't get a word out of him.

549
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,388
Shyness is a curable disease.

550
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,635
I did the job.

551
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,076
Look what this columnist says...

552
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,198
"Edward Saroyan's impresario
told us...

553
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,636
I love the beautiful,
no matter what sex."

554
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,957
<i>How to Overcome Shyness</i>

555
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,513
<i>Shyness</i>

556
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,196
<i>How to Overcome Stage Fright</i>

557
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,108
Now you won't
escape from me anymore...

558
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,073
thanks to this masterpiece.

559
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,388
How is Theresa?

560
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,879
She's tired.

561
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,798
She's always tired!

562
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,598
Tired of travelling?

563
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,079
No, tired of me.

564
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,468
You quarrel?

565
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,232
We did at first.

566
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,797
Now iùs much worse.

567
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,678
You can tell me.

568
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,755
She's fed up.

569
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,592
You don't believe me?

570
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,115
I couldn't believe it at first.

571
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,508
She's trying to fight
against something.

572
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,958
Now iùs obvious.

573
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,872
We're having a talk...

574
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,634
and suddenly she runs away.

575
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,191
If I go after her...

576
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,430
she locks herself in.

577
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,352
Thaùs the situation.

578
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,710
Iùs the end.

579
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,838
- She says so?
- No, iùs obvious.

580
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,356
I think she despises me since...

581
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,274
I've been successful.

582
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,476
This is a misunderstanding.

583
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,517
Bring her to the cocktail-party.

584
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,193
I'll talk to her.

585
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,753
I'll try.

586
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,159
Thanks.

587
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,476
I've come to take you
to the cocktail-party.

588
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,278
Leave me alone, please.

589
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,998
I'm fed up!

590
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,309
Why shout?

591
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,869
You've never shouted at me.

592
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,075
I didn't want to.

593
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,988
It doesn't matter.

594
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,878
Why shouldn't you shout?

595
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,832
I make you unhappy?

596
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,352
I know, but I can't help it.

597
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,280
You can't stop the night.

598
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,399
Iùs dark, and getting darker.

599
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,840
You can't stop it or do anything.

600
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,318
There's only one thing
for me to do.

601
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,959
Say goodbye.

602
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,235
I must tell you.

603
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,272
You must know.

604
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,909
One must always confess.

605
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,794
Confess?

606
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,438
I've done something wrong...

607
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,229
something really nasty.

608
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,709
Now you are a famous pianist...

609
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,389
and I'm glad of it.

610
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,316
I gave you your chance.

611
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,110
Lars Schmeel.

612
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,671
The week you signed with him.

613
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,310
A few days before
he came to the cafÈ...

614
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,149
Not for coffee...

615
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,113
and not for lunch...

616
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,556
but to offer me a deal...

617
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,551
I didn't understand at first.

618
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,278
Iùs like a charade!

619
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,677
I asked him what.

620
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,034
He looked at me,
as if to say...

621
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,272
"You don't know?
Think a bit."

622
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,032
I thought about it all night.

623
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,438
Next day he came back.

624
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,032
You know how a spider works.

625
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,996
He cut me in two...

626
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,995
as if the heart were one thing...

627
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,878
and the body another.

628
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,755
It wasn't Theresa
who went to bed with him.

629
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,551
It was my body.

630
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,471
As if I wasn't there.

631
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,273
I was with you.

632
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,512
That day,
he took a room near the cafÈ...

633
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,795
and came and told me...

634
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,952
about the contract.

635
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,034
Now when he comes to the cafÈ...

636
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,111
he's just a customer.

637
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,118
He orders a meal.

638
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,950
I think iùs all over.

639
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,997
You can be Theresa.

640
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,910
But you know,
iùs an odd thing...

641
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,710
what you've done
remains with you.

642
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,271
When I look at my face...

643
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,831
do I see Theresa?

644
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,513
Your Theresa?

645
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,068
No...

646
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,759
Not Theresa.

647
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,399
Nowhere.

648
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,196
I'm just a dirty rag...

649
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,835
Thaùs why
I don't want you to touch me.

650
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,189
I'm too dirty to be touched.

651
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,394
<i>Go on your knees to her... </i>

652
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,835
<i>while there's still time. </i>

653
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,992
<i>If you go out, she'll be alone. </i>

654
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,230
SUICIDE OF
EDWARD SAROYAN'S WIFE

655
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,597
THE GREAT ARTIST DISAPPEARS
RECITAL CANCELLED

656
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,117
<i>So you disappeared. </i>
<i>You started from scratch... </i>

657
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,396
<i>You became Charlie Kohler. </i>

658
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,677
<i>You asked your brothers... </i>

659
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,796
<i>to let you have Fido. </i>

660
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,279
<i>You came to the cafÈ... </i>

661
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,110
<i>to sweep the floor. </i>

662
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,798
<i>There was an old piano there. </i>

663
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,918
<i>You looked at it... </i>

664
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,913
<i>again and again. </i>

665
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,072
<i>One day, you asked... </i>

666
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,037
Can I play a little?

667
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,391
You!

668
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,118
I think I can.

669
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,478
All right, but make it music!

670
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,998
<i>Who is Charlie Koller? </i>

671
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,918
<i>We know little. </i>

672
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,308
<i>He's a pianist. </i>

673
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,950
<i>He looks after his little brother. </i>
<i>He stays out of trouble. </i>

674
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,908
<i>Because of you, </i>
<i>people come here. </i>

675
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,150
<i>The boss has taken on... </i>

676
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,039
<i>a drummer and... </i>

677
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,909
<i>a double bass with hairy hands. </i>

678
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,356
<i>And there was I, </i>
<i>looking at you all the time. </i>

679
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,112
On my birthday...

680
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,750
I kissed everyone,
so as to kiss you.

681
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,517
I saw you look at me.

682
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,397
And I looked at you.

683
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,911
What was on your mind, last night?

684
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,957
Did you like me?

685
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,029
Remember that night when...

686
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,033
I took your arm?

687
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,909
I was afraid to look
too daring, you know...

688
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,709
I wanted you so much
to take my hand.

689
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,038
I think the boss
is in love with you.

690
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,554
Don't be stupid!

691
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,439
He told me so, anyhow.

692
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,475
After all,
he's a man like anyone else.

693
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,915
You're not like the others.

694
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,953
You don't act the tough guy.

695
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,474
You're shy...

696
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,073
and you respect women.

697
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,832
Don't think that.

698
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,071
I'm like the others.

699
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,434
When I had money...

700
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,511
women looked at me in the street.

701
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,873
I looked back...
and undressed them.

702
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,636
Most of them liked that.

703
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,279
It gave them pleasure.

704
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,271
I looked harder.

705
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,477
When I hit on a decent girl...

706
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,033
I was ashamed.

707
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,432
It made me think of my mother.

708
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,391
We'll go to the cafÈ
to give notice.

709
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,790
We'll make a team together.

710
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,195
I'll wake you up.

711
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,157
You'll be Edward again!

712
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:46,871
Why?

713
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,634
Not why... for whom?

714
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,395
For me... and you too.

715
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,910
I'll struggle to help you.

716
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,750
You must give auditions.

717
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,512
And concerts!

718
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,157
Charlie is dead!

719
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,794
Buy me some stockings...

720
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,514
and then we'll go and give notice.

721
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,518
"Scandal number 2"

722
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,436
Mandarine shade.

723
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,351
I just want you
to tell me when iùs over.

724
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,991
I never got that from any guy.

725
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,719
When you don't love me anymore...

726
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,154
just tell me.

727
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,275
Don't you want bread?

728
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,954
I only like the yolk.

729
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,991
A customer for you.

730
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,879
Here? Outside working hours?

731
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,792
Tell him to take a run.

732
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,080
Plenty of girls on the street!

733
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,879
He wants you particularly.

734
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,349
Handsome, too...

735
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,033
and well-dressed.

736
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,395
There's sugar and fruit here,
and yoghurt.

737
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,959
But I'll be back.

738
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,158
Here's the gentleman.

739
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,799
I'll be back.

740
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,795
Hello! Which way?

741
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,710
This way.

742
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,519
But I know you.
You've been with me.

743
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,999
Oh no, Miss.

744
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,957
- Any dough?
- A little.

745
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,308
Whaùs the game?

746
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,312
Kidnappers!

747
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,994
My carriage!

748
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,592
We give notice?

749
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,988
I should hope so.

750
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,673
Let me do the job.

751
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,514
Here they are!

752
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,951
What a time to come!

753
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,109
I got up late.

754
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,395
Yes, very late.

755
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,438
- Then we went for a drive.
- Together?

756
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,470
Yes, want further details?

757
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,631
Yes, I'm interested.

758
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,792
- He's usually alone.
- Even when he's not alone.

759
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,438
We've come for our pay...

760
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,113
and to give notice.

761
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,515
Thaùs it!

762
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,797
Make a nuisance of yourself!

763
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,631
Hear that?

764
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,879
Where've you been hiding?

765
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,838
I was worried.

766
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,151
They had his address.

767
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,150
Mine too.

768
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,355
I know nothing.

769
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,911
Ask him. You live with him.

770
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,834
Live with him!

771
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,956
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

772
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,151
They came here today!

773
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,356
You sold them our addresses.

774
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,190
You did that?

775
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,476
Yes... the informer!

776
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,879
<i>He's a dirty dog! </i>
<i>But what a life! </i>

777
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,873
<i>He wants her</i>
<i>but he can't have her. </i>

778
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,077
<i>Even now, </i>
<i>he can't take his eyes off her. </i>

779
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,958
<i>So what? </i>

780
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,718
<i>The boss's not bad... </i>

781
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,599
<i>but he's just a failure. </i>

782
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,951
<i>Don't tell him so. </i>

783
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,953
<i>Any how, iùs not your business. </i>

784
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,714
<i>Just sit in front of the piano. </i>

785
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,235
<i>There's nothing you can do for him. </i>

786
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,674
<i>You're no one. </i>

787
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,717
<i>And nothing matters. </i>

788
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,595
- Listen!
- Go to hell!

789
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,320
Look at my biceps. I am someone.

790
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,436
- Feel!
- Shit!

791
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,793
Thaùs right... shit!

792
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,595
Go to hell, all of you!

793
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,273
What nasty words
in such a mouth!

794
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,159
Shut yours, pig!

795
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,879
I'll kill you, Lena.

796
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,836
I can't see you.

797
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,831
You dirty bitch!

798
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,991
Dreaming, Charlie?

799
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,878
Leave her alone.

800
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,317
I'm more interested in you.

801
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,631
You had her, eh?

802
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,155
I'll smash your face in.

803
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,316
What the hell!

804
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,549
Forgive me?

805
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,755
Forget it.

806
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,033
Someone must win.

807
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:03,996
I give in.

808
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,276
No, they saw me go.

809
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,918
I must have my revenge.

810
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,998
I don't love Lena anymore...

811
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,469
after that language.

812
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,155
If she had a soul,
she wouldn't be so vulgar.

813
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,833
She's a bitch!

814
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,194
She's not a girl,
not a woman...

815
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,353
pure, delicate or fragile.

816
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,478
A woman is pure... and magical.

817
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,513
Woman was always a goddess
for me.

818
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,478
Let me call you Charlie, now.

819
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,995
Charlie, you're going to die.

820
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,154
Go home. Iùs an accident.

821
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,834
Someone's there.

822
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,399
I forgot the light.

823
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,079
I hear the police.

824
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,873
His eyes are open.

825
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,514
Why push me?

826
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,433
Well, get a move on.

827
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,514
The knife?

828
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,148
I threw it away.

829
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,598
I was stifling.

830
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,472
I just wanted
to prick him in the arm...

831
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,348
but he moved...

832
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,999
and took it in the back.

833
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,388
Want to bet?

834
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,632
- Iùll work.
- No, it won't.

835
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,271
They'll know I did it.

836
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,635
Explain.

837
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,791
Yes, by letter.

838
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,155
Get Fido in case the cops go there.

839
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,671
- What is it?
- I was frightened.

840
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,793
I want little Fido Saroyan.

841
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,394
He's disappeared.

842
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,152
Kidnapped!

843
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,070
You're drunk.

844
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,635
What fool these cats.

845
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,712
Fido, dog's name.

846
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,074
It means faithful.

847
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,556
We've won the second round.

848
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,836
I wouldn't have left the door open.

849
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,399
My old man used to tell me:

850
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,029
"When the door bell rings,
imagine iùs a murderer...

851
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,872
You'll be glad
if iùs only a thief."

852
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,234
How's school?

853
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,316
Like it?

854
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,835
Yes, science.

855
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,399
I was no good.

856
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,232
Study make me ill.

857
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,995
I pay for all my ancestors...

858
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,912
of the past generations.

859
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,273
I take snuff.

860
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,032
Disgusting habit!

861
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,031
Iùs very good.

862
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,715
The first is the best.

863
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,351
Whaùs that?

864
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,034
Musical lighter.

865
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:34,951
Super!

866
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,235
Your watch.

867
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,990
I've also a parking alarm clock.

868
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,949
Is that all?

869
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,476
I've an American snorkel pen...

870
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,392
with automatic refill...

871
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,276
a fibre belt...

872
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,072
a tropical hat...

873
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,635
and a suit from London...

874
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,631
made of Australian wool.

875
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,553
My shoes are Egyptian leather.

876
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,234
So I need nothing more.

877
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,074
I'm fed up.

878
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,075
My scarf is like silk...

879
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,356
but iùs metal...

880
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,513
Japanese invention.

881
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,159
No, iùs cloth.

882
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,673
No, Japanese.

883
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,513
Iùs not even Japanese.

884
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,079
I swear iùs true.

885
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,999
Don't overdo it!

886
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,116
If I lie, let my mum die.

887
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,635
I believe you then.

888
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,199
I told you so.

889
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,439
Iùs me, Lena.

890
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,593
Come quietly.

891
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,039
God! I feel awful.

892
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,559
Wait!

893
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,992
Cops still there.

894
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,834
And Fido?

895
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,558
Tell you later.

896
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,754
The way's clear.

897
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,353
I've borrowed a car.

898
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,392
- From whom?
- My landlady.

899
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,834
Well now!

900
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,558
I found the key.

901
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,279
Manage?

902
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,390
Hold on.

903
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,357
Everything I've told you is true.

904
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,431
You know how it is...

905
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,238
and then...

906
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,596
The cops?

907
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,513
They asked a lot of questions.

908
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,432
Take that with you.

909
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,119
I'll call you.

910
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,110
And Fido?

911
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,679
Tell you later.

912
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,913
Got the bottle?

913
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,157
Drink.

914
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,799
I'm still thirsty.

915
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,755
I should have thought of that.

916
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,349
Chico... then me... then Fido.

917
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,354
The Saroyan brothers are all in it.

918
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,511
Broken down again.

919
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,954
The third time.

920
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,350
What a wreck!

921
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,589
Whaùs up?

922
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,591
How should I know?

923
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,313
We'll have to push.

924
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,869
Come along then, OK?

925
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,110
Look ahead.

926
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,556
Keep her straight.

927
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,918
Push then!

928
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,998
Look where you're going.

929
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,593
- The radio works?
- We can try.

930
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,954
<i>Far in the distance... </i>

931
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,712
<i>Violins... </i>

932
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,754
<i>And shepherds... </i>

933
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,194
<i>Dressed as knights... </i>

934
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,515
<i>And King's jesters... </i>

935
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,273
<i>All made up... </i>

936
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,918
<i>Like angels... </i>

937
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,276
<i>Watching us... </i>

938
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,998
<i>From the horizon. </i>

939
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,233
<i>When I hate you... </i>

940
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,358
<i>So as to let you know... </i>

941
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,590
<i>When I hate you... </i>

942
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,070
<i>I'll put on my hat. </i>

943
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,559
<i>When you don't love me... </i>

944
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,951
<i>So as to let you know... </i>

945
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,588
<i>When you don't love me... </i>

946
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,917
<i>I'll wear plaits. </i>

947
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,514
<i>Ever since she's worn a chignon... </i>

948
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,593
<i>And he goes... </i>

949
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,876
<i>Bareheaded. </i>

950
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,599
- Stop!
- Not yet.

951
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,510
I said stop!

952
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,669
What is it?

953
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,114
I'm leaving you.

954
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,271
Go and take the car back.

955
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,350
Look at me!

956
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,478
<i>I should have drunk it all. </i>

957
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,759
First to the left.

958
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,990
I know the road.

959
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,636
Well, what is it?

960
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,551
<i>You want her to stay. </i>
<i>She knows it. </i>

961
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,073
Thanks for the lift.

962
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,077
Alone? I heard a car.

963
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,071
A friend drove me.

964
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,076
We are on the defensive.

965
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,310
There are guys after Chico.

966
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,833
He must have told you.

967
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,195
Has Chico arrived?

968
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,793
Yes, half dead...

969
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,916
Not used to walking.

970
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,798
He's having a nap.

971
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,871
He ate like a horse.

972
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,031
Mum and dad aren't here?

973
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,629
In the village.

974
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,552
You put 'em out?

975
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,473
We didn't want to. I love 'em.

976
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,438
We've nice parents...

977
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,750
but they're not bullet proof.

978
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,633
Had any visitors?

979
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,478
We're the first?

980
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,237
What a mug... Chico.

981
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,837
He always makes a mess of things.

982
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,877
The king of fools.

983
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,029
Awful situation!

984
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,111
Still is.

985
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,759
And you know why?

986
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,395
He is a fool.

987
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,596
Not his fault I killed a guy.

988
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,715
What!

989
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,313
Yes, thaùs right...

990
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,792
What a mess!

991
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,712
The two guys with Fido...

992
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,077
and the police looking for you.

993
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,158
Tell you what...

994
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,833
I'm glad to see you.

995
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,989
Me too.

996
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,395
Coffee's burning.

997
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,596
Iùll be spoilt!

998
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,638
I'll tell you...

999
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,395
Iùs hell having to stay put.

1000
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,469
You're a prisoner in the house.

1001
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,910
At first, Chico and I...

1002
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,952
had a good time.

1003
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,552
I'll go tell him you're here.

1004
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,239
So iùs you?

1005
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,875
How's your bump?

1006
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,553
All right now.

1007
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,359
Whaùs that?

1008
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,190
I went to get them in Paris.

1009
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,716
The others were all new.

1010
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,236
Getting rid of them isn't easy.

1011
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,953
Richard and I...

1012
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,951
had found an honest guy...

1013
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,111
in a transfer house.

1014
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,198
We did a transfer.
Two guys were there.

1015
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,918
We laughed.
They thought they were smart.

1016
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,077
They suggested...

1017
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,037
splitting four ways.

1018
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,151
Richard looked at me.

1019
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,676
So we agreed, and left with them.

1020
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,319
We thought we'd come here.

1021
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,034
I don't know why...

1022
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,077
but they complained...

1023
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:13,230
It was too far and snowing.

1024
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,512
So we got rid of them...

1025
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,636
and decided not to split.

1026
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,592
But the guys are after us now.

1027
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,398
Why didn't we kill 'em?

1028
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,117
By the way,
Charlie's killed someone.

1029
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,718
Oh hell!

1030
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,469
It can't be true! Hell!

1031
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,117
Iùs funny, but I'm glad.
Now...

1032
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,834
you're like us.

1033
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,558
Remember the catapults?

1034
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,233
What catapults?

1035
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,597
And the car?
The people who came for you?

1036
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,235
The 14-year-old virtuoso!

1037
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,470
To the Academy of Music.

1038
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,479
Yes, to Zeleny...

1039
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:03,038
And as we left,
you stoned the car.

1040
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,795
The two men didn't know you...

1041
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,952
but the woman with blue hair
and spectacles inlaid with shells...

1042
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,917
asked me: "Who's that?"

1043
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,878
I said: "Those boys?".

1044
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,678
She said: "They're savages".

1045
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,039
And you said?

1046
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,318
"They are my brothers."

1047
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,357
She changed the subject.

1048
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,112
She spoke about...

1049
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,317
the wonderful teacher I'd have.

1050
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,157
And the stones
continued to rain on the car.

1051
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,629
It was like you speaking.

1052
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,950
You were saying I couldn't go...

1053
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,712
and that I'd come back...

1054
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,157
Back to the savages.

1055
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,515
You had to.
We are all the same...

1056
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,831
You, me, Richard and Fido.

1057
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,836
Leùs have a nap.
Your turn to watch, Chico.

1058
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,510
No, I'm not tired. Go off.

1059
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,712
Well, I leave you this.

1060
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,632
Man's best friend.

1061
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,916
<i>A murderer in a family of thieves. </i>

1062
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,319
<i>But why this madness? </i>

1063
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,675
<i>Where does it come from? </i>

1064
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,594
<i>Not from dad or mum. </i>

1065
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,035
<i>It must have skipped</i>
<i>one or two generations. </i>

1066
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,475
<i>And now it comes back. </i>

1067
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,871
<i>Among your ancestors, </i>
<i>there must have been criminals... </i>

1068
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,315
<i>who hid in caves. </i>

1069
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,993
<i>Iùd make a poem. </i>

1070
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,718
<i>A comic one too. </i>

1071
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,112
<i>And that useless revolver? </i>

1072
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,476
<i>"I leave you this. </i>
<i>Man's best friend."</i>

1073
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,753
<i>You know... </i>

1074
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,877
<i>you hate firearms. </i>

1075
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,594
Fido?

1076
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,672
I think I made a mistake.

1077
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,353
I'll take you back.

1078
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,915
- The police?
- Don't worry.

1079
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,274
Self-defence.

1080
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,112
The neighbours said the truth.

1081
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,238
That the boss
was trying to strangle you.

1082
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,992
And you killed him...

1083
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,115
by accident.

1084
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,679
Hell, what Ôyou know?

1085
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,590
The car?

1086
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,637
Iùs there. Come on!

1087
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,916
I must tell them. Wait.

1088
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,548
Coming back?

1089
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,713
You know.

1090
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:30,595
When I hate you,
I'll put on a cap.

1091
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,550
Hell, snowing.

1092
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,915
Not like that, they'll break.

1093
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,117
Do it like that, carefully.

1094
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,755
Charlie, the new waitress.

1095
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,319
Charlie, pianist.

1096
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,314
