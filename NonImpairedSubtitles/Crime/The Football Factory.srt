1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,397

2
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,674
<i>These were the scenes everyone feared.</i>

3
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,797
<i>Running battles</i>
<i>between English and Turkish fans...</i>

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,916

5
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,028
<i>...some here have been<i>
<i>seriously injured.<i>

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,796
<i>...it's very violent indeed.</i>

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,392

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,195
<i>Earlier, there was mayhem</i>
<i>on the main square...</i>

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,910
<i>Getting beaten up by football hooligans is like</i>
<i>having VD: the fuckin' pain goes on forever.</i>

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,718
<i>But that's what makes it so exciting.</i>

11
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,790
<i>So this is me, Tommy Johnson</i>
<i>three weeks from now, nearly dead.</i>

12
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,270
<i>And do you know what the funniest thing is?</i>
<i>I could see it coming.</i>

13
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,918
<i>Anyway, it's almost over now</i>
<i>and all that matters is this: was it worth it?</i>

14
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,156

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,672
<i>There's nothing different about me.</i>

16
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,958
<i>I'm just ahother bored male approaching 30,</i>
<i>in a dead-end job who lives for the weekend.</i>

17
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,032
<i>Casual sex, watered-down lager,</i>
<i>heavily cut drugs.</i>

18
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,270
<i>And occasionally kicking</i>
<i>fuck out of someone.</i>

19
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,517

20
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,070

21
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,592

22
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,559

23
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,958
Zeberdee, it's Bill.

24
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,951
What? How am I?
What do you mean, "how am I"?

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,554
I'm fuckin' buzzin'!
We've gone right through the slit.

26
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,278
Keep your fuckin' nut down.

27
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,157
He's a right fuckin' stringer, this kid.

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,798
- What's he say?
- Nothing.

29
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,030
- What do you mean, "nothing"?
- He fuckin' hung up.

30
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,758
Raff, call Tommy.
Find out where he is.

31
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,310
There's a pub on the corner called
the Ship and Billet. Head for that.

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,039
I'll have to bell you back,
Harris is trying to get through.

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,998
Just spotted their little firm
going to a pub in Denbigh Street.

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,116
They won't know what's fuckin' hit 'em.

35
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,439
There you are.

36
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,033
Here, come here!

37
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,114
- Sweet, Bill?
- Yeah.

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,838
- Where's the others?
- On their way.

39
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,959
- Harris said there's about 25 of the others.
- There won't be when we've finished with 'em.

40
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,758
Wait round the corner!

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,193
What for?

42
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,511
Cos it's all going to be on top,
us all standin' here, you si.

43
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,238
- Jog on.
- Jog on!

44
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,719
Bill, it's Harris.

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,596
Hello, son. Yeah?

46
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,068
All right. See you there.

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,996

48
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,479

49
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,391

50
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,111

51
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,636

52
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,155
What happened to you last night?
Thought you was coming out for a drink?

53
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,390
Johnson had me on some nutty skunk.

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,358
Ended up down the petrol garage
at two o'clock in the morning.

55
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,193
What you driving for?
You're on a ban, you lunatic.

56
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,918
Ban? What am I gonna do, walk?

57
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,516
Here he is.

58
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,790
Right, there's someone
outside the pub.

59
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,791
- How old is he?
- He's only a kid.

60
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,518
Go on, crack him.
Keep the noise down.

61
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,556
<i>Keep the noise down.</i>

62
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,238
- Excuse me, mate, you got a light?
- Don't fuck about, ping him.

63
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,998
Let's go!

64
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,790
It's going good anyway.
Let's settle it.

65
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,550
- Come on, let's...
- Keep it down, keep it down.

66
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,029
- Keep it down.
- Fuckin' hell, come on, boys.

67
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,076
Keep it down, keep it down.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,230
- Come on. Fuckin' hell.
- Keep it down.

69
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,754
Don't fuck this up.

70
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,789
Fuckin' clowns won't stop us.

71
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,758
You're fuckin' animals!

72
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,434
You give this fuckin' country
a bad fuckin' name!

73
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,515
You ain't no football supporters!
You're fuckin' muggy little cunts!

74
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,031
<i>What else are you gonna</i>
<i>do on a Saturday?</i>

75
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,839
<i>Sit in your fuckin' armchair wankin' off</i>
<i>to Pop Idols?</i>

76
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,512
<i>Then try and avoid your wife's gaze</i>

77
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,273
<i>as you struggle to come to terms</i>
<i>with your sexless marriage?</i>

78
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,670
<i>Then go and spunk your wages on kebabs</i>
<i>fruit machines and brasses?</i>

79
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,079
<i>Fuck that for a laugh!</i>

80
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,673
<i>I know what I'd rather do.</i>

81
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,512
<i>Tottenham away.</i>
<i>Love it!</i>

82
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,350
How fuckin' perfect was that?

83
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,116
Soppy bollocks here even managed to get
the canister inside the fuckin' pub this time.

84
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,838
Do you remember that time at Upton...

85
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,388
That time at Upton Park,
he let it off on the tube!

86
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,189
Mind you, premature ejaculation,
that's right up your fuckin' street!

87
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,636
Anyway, he's virtually throwing 'em
out of the fuckin' pub at me, right?

88
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,156
He's throwing 'em out of the fuckin' pub at me.
Crunch! Crunch!

89
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,119
I hit this geezer so fuckin' hard,
his legs went like a fuckin' baby giraffe.

90
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,914
State of that. I done me knuckles.

91
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,833
So hit people in the mouth,
not the back of the fuckin' head.

92
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,195
Just as well I did or you'd be in hospital,
you cunt.

93
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,591
<i>No-one loved Chelsea</i>
<i>more than me and Rod.</i>

94
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,309
<i>We grew up on football terraces together</i>
<i>with my old man. He knew the score.</i>

95
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,994
<i>The first bit of advice he give me was:</i>

96
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,674
You know what to do
if someone tries to clump you?

97
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,159
Kick him in the fuckin' bollocks.

98
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,312
<i>Me and Rod did everything together.</i>

99
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,231
Hurry up, Tom, I'm starving.

100
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,517
<i>It took me an hour just to find it.</i>
<i>Still Rod didn't need to know that.</i>

101
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,238
She ain't walkin' for a week.

102
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,390
<i>My grandad old Bill Farrell,</i>
<i>drove us to drink</i>

103
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,995
<i>with his stories about the war</i>
<i>and how he fought to put the Great into Britain.</i>

104
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,152
<i>He said fighting at football was nothing</i>
<i>compared to the Germans.</i>

105
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,038
"We'll fight them on the beaches,
we'll fight them on the..."

106
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,669
<i>Although he went on, he was right.</i>
<i>We're an island race. It's what we do best.</i>

107
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,275
<i>It's not about colour or race,</i>
<i>it's just the buzz of being in the front line.</i>

108
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,237
<i>Truth is,</i>
<i>I just love to fight.</i>

109
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,958
<i>There's nothing wrong with me...</i>

110
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,874
<i>unlike Billy Bright, whose dad had a funny way</i>
<i>of setting a good example for his son.</i>

111
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,269
Right, that's it.
I'll fight every one of you

112
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,954
before you move on next door to us.
Come on, son!

113
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,952
<i>With parents like that,</i>
<i>he was never gonna end up in Greenpeace.</i>

114
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,349
<i>Still he was one of
the first football thugs</i>

115
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,637
<i>to see there was a fortune to be made</i>
<i>from England's love for ecstasy.</i>

116
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,631
Oi, three bottles of Bud, please, mate.

117
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,952
<i>Problem was he'd taken so many beatings on</i>
<i>the terraces that he weren't scared of anyone.</i>

118
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,430
<i>And the correct medical term for that is</i>
<i>a "total fuckin' psycho".</i>

119
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,593
Bill, let's get out of here.
There's about ten Stoke fans staring at us.

120
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,150
- How many of 'em did you say there was?
- About ten. Please don't start, Bill.

121
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,279
- Right, which one of them's staring at me.
<i>- The big geezer with the Hackett cap on.</i>

122
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,432
See you, you cunt. I'll cut you first.

123
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,192
<i>And that was his idea of a good day out.</i>

124
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,350

125
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,431
You fuckin' mugs!

126
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,072
<i>But underneath the fun and games</i>
<i>and Range Rovers, Blliy was bitter,</i>

127
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,151
<i>cos he hever got to run our firm.</i>

128
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,912
<i>Harris was top boy and that was that.</i>

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,072
<i>He was smarter than Billy</i>
<i>and ran things like an army unit.</i>

130
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,358
<i>Deep down Billy knew he'd never be leader</i>
<i>and because of that he hated Zeberdee.</i>

131
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,510
<i>Why? Simple...</i>

132
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,830
<i>Zeberdee looked up to Harris and not him.</i>

133
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,959
<i>And the more Zeberdee looked up to Harris,</i>
<i>the more Billy bullied him.</i>

134
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,190
<i>And what chance did Zeberdee have as a kid,</i>

135
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,192
<i>brought up in a concrete jungle</i>
<i>on glue and hate?</i>

136
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,192
<i>I don't envy the young 'uns any more.</i>
<i>It's a nightmare.</i>

137
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,512
<i>Warfare from the playground upwards and you</i>
<i>know what you have to do to survive in combat.</i>

138
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,990
Aargh!

139
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,595

140
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,194
<i>Just like me and Rod,</i>
<i>him and Raff are best mates,</i>

141
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,158
<i>only difference being</i>
<i>they're thieving little cunts.</i>

142
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,710
<i>In case you're wondering, we call him Zeberdee</i>
<i>cos he loves sniffin' powder.</i>

143
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,360
<i>And one dayn it'll be his downfall.</i>

144
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,110
Hold your hand out, Raff.

145
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,350
- What?
- Hold your hand out.

146
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,156
<i>You're just a fuckin' kid, ain't you?</i>

147
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,273
Hold your hand out, Bill.

148
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,629
Do what?

149
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,234
Hold it out like Raff
and we'll see how old you are.

150
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,436
Oooh.

151
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,673
<i>No, let's have it right.</i>

152
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,391
You trying to mug me off?

153
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,597
Oh, shut up. 
I'm only fuckin' about an' that.

154
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,148
- What d'you mean, "fuckin' about"?
<i>- What?</i>

155
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,514
What d'you mean, "what"?

156
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,511
You know, just...

157
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,477
Well, don't fuckin' just.

158
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,869
Leave it out.
You trying to wind me up?

159
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,155
<i>Ain't trying to wind anyone up.</i>

160
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,753
I'm fuckin' serious.

161
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,071
What I want to know is, what makes you think
you can come in here

162
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,718
<i>and mug me off in front of my pals?</i>

163
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,195
I... I didn't mean nothing by it, Bill.

164
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,072
It was only a bubble, that's all.

165
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,639
Just a bubble?

166
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,832
What you talking to me
in that fuckin' muggy rhyming slang for?

167
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,990
I never fuckin' liked you, you little cunt.

168
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,275
<i>You're a wrong 'un,</i>
<i>just like your old man.</i>

169
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,112
<i>He was a degenerate fuckin' drunk.</i>

170
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,633
<i>Do you know what I'm thinking?</i>

171
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,314
<i>I'm thinking I should take you outside</i>
<i>and open you up.</i>

172
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,550
- Leave it out, Bill.
- Leave what fuckin' out?

173
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,756
What, d'you wanna get
involved an' all, do you?

174
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,149
Don't be stupid.
I'm just saying, he's only a kid.

175
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,912
<i>No, let's have it right, Tom.</i>

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,754
<i>If he's old enough to run round givin' it large,</i>
<i>fuckin' bashing people up with us,</i>

177
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,796
he's old enough to talk for himself.

178
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,790
I'll tell you something, Zeberfuckindee,

179
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,553
<i>I think I should take you outside</i>
<i>and teach you a lesson</i>

180
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,394
for mugging me off and making me look a cunt
in front of my fuckin' pals.

181
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,674
I...

182
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,591
I didn't say nothing.

183
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,194
Come on, outside,
you little fuckin' stumblebum.

184
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,514
Leave it out, eh?

185
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,037
Stop mutterin' and stutterin'
and fuckin' liven yourself up.

186
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,358
I fuckin' had you there!

187
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,156
Fuckin' hell, Zeb,
you should have seen your fuckin' face.

188
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,470
I thought you was gonna burst into tears.

189
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,593
What is it, four, five...
eight lagers, Donna, please, babe.

190
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,035
There'll be none of this in Australia.

191
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,873
As of next week, strictly the amber nectar.

192
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,509
Not to worry, William.
I think I'm more of a cocktail man anyway.

193
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,352
Well, I won't be sitting next to you.

194
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,759
Well, that was the idea.

195
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,070
Bill, Albert, I didn't see you there. Wanna pint?

196
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,032
<i>My grandad didn't like Bright.</i>

197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,155
<i>Knew he was a bully.</i>

198
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,471
<i>Bill and Albert were just kids</i>
<i>when they did their National Service.</i>

199
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,519
<i>They were one of the first off the landing crafts</i>
<i>on June 6th.</i>

200
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,151
<i>Bill aways told me the only thing that kept him</i>
<i>going was Albert's determination and will to live.</i>

201
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,037
<i>They came home proud war heroes</i>

202
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,395
<i>and married their childhood sweethearts.</i>

203
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,436
<i>And buried 'em together as well.</i>

204
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,515
<i>The council moved Albert to the flat above Bill</i>
<i>and they swapped door keys,</i>

205
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,750
<i>always vowing to keep an eye on each other.</i>

206
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,070
Very funny. Very, very funny!

207
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,752
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

208
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,276
Now a little one. Now a little one.
That's it, now let me get the door.

209
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,954
Let me get the door. I'll be right in there.

210
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,515
Comfy? Do you want any help with that?

211
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,592
<i>Bet you've seen some changes,</i>
<i>eh, you two? Yeah.</i>

212
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,399
Bit different nowadays, though, innit, eh? Gone.

213
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,792
It's the Pakis coming over in the '70s, see.
Taking over everything. Spoilt it.

214
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,713
And what you got now, eh? What you got now?

215
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,597
Fuckin' asylum seekers.

216
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,389
Bloody Tony fuckin' Blair.
He's gotta be a poof, ain't he? New Labour?

217
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,596
<i>I mean, and this game's gone.</i>

218
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,912
There was a time I used to be able to clear
seven and a half, eight hundred shots a week.

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,353
Not any more. Nah.

220
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,911
Now what you got is your fuckin' spades
up in Soho moonlighting!

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,069
Moonlighting!

222
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,152
Fuck's sake, that's a joke!
You need a full moon just to see 'em!

223
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,028
This country was built on
good people like yourselves.

224
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,190
Not enough of you about, that's what I say.

225
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,157
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

226
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,471
Swing your old arse round in there, look.
That's it, lovely.

227
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,076
And I just want to say, it's been a privilege
to drive two gentlemen like you.

228
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,798
And the fare's on me.

229
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,553
Don't be silly.
You're letting the wheelchair fool you.

230
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,312
No, I insist.

231
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,038
<i>It's been an honour.</i>

232
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,038
Don't forget, you watch
out for them darkies, eh?

233
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,029

234
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,797
What a wanker.

235
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,438
Let's go dancing.

236
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,835

237
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,431
<i>Although he talked a lot of bollocks,</i>
<i>in some ways the cabbie was right.</i>

238
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,557
<i>Bill was what put the Great into Britain.</i>
<i>He was an old war hero.</i>

239
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,837
<i>But he'd moved on.</i>
<i>It was Australia for him and Albert now.</i>

240
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,390
<i>Somewhere they could live out</i>
<i>the rest of their days in the sun.</i>

241
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,236
Hello, Mavis, my little darling.

242
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,758
How are you?

243
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,799
I shall be sad to see you both gone, Bill.
Are you packed up yet?

244
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,475
Course we have. Ain't you gonna say goodbye?

245
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,039
Can't you do better than that.?

246
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,792
What are you talking about, Bill?

247
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,313
Don't you know?

248
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,228
You fucking disgusting old man!

249
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,117
<i>That's what I loved about Bill.</i>

250
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,838
<i>He was still game.</i>

251
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,196
<i>He'd dreamed about. Living abroad for years</i>
<i>and how his time had come.</i>

252
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,352
<i>I even give him and Albert a little treat</i>
<i>for going away.</i>

253
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,398
My grandson gave me a going-away present.

254
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,272
A joint of his very best home-grown.

255
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,430
You mean drugs?

256
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,592
Yeah, well, you light up old, son.
I'll make do with this.

257
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,115
<i>It's amazing to think in a couple of weeks</i>

258
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,351
we'll be watching the sun go down
on the other side of the world.

259
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,315
And it won't be surrounded by tower blocks.

260
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,669
Miles of golden sand and bronze tits.

261
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,998
You packed yet?

262
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,395
Haven't given it a thought.

263
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,189
My case has been packed
and sitting inside the front door for three days.

264
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,116
You want to get your skates on, Farrell.

265
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,919
Oh, stop nagging, you old woman.

266
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,553
<i>- You know what Bert?</i>
- What's that?

267
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,149
I'm feeling dizzy.

268
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,470
<i>You always were, you dozy bastard!</i>

269
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,312

270
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,556

271
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,910
<i>The next best thing to violence is sex,</i>

272
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,753
<i>and seeing as there's</i>
<i>nearly 500,000 single women in London,</i>

273
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,512
<i>I must be in with half a chance.</i>

274
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,433
<i>Especially as I'd fuck</i>
<i>anything that's breathing.</i>

275
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,312
I tell you, I'm fuckin' mullered, me.
I am fuckin' mullered.

276
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,910
Look at the fuckin' boat on it.
Imagine that round your fuckin' helmet.

277
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,549
No, no, no, Tom. Proper fuckin' slosh pots.

278
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,551
Shut up, you... What's the matter with you?

279
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,871
All right, sweetheart? You all right, girl, yeah?

280
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,598
- All right?
- Do you want a drink?

281
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,149
<i>A few tequilas?</i>

282
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,071
A couple of little
cheeky tequilas, yeah?

283
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,151
<i>Shall we get on it?</i>

284
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,879
- A little cheeky tequila...?
- Tequilas.

285
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,155
<i>Get these two birds here</i>
<i>a couple of tequilas.</i>

286
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,232
I'm gonna smash the fuckin'
granny out of that.

287
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,835

288
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,992

289
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,513

290
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,955

291
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,477

292
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,671
<i>London's changed for the worse.</i>

293
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,672
All the good people, right,
all the good people...

294
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,753
are being forced into the suburbs,
due to the influx of illegal immigrants

295
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,308
forcing their way into this country.

296
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,038
- <i>I mean...</i>
- Hey, mate.

297
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,315
Mate, will you shut your fuckin' noise?

298
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,392

299
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,199

303
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,238

304
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,392

305
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,277

306
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,157

307
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,074

308
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,192
Here you are, sloppy bollocks.
You fuckin' cunt.

309
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,236
Get up there, girl. Get up there.

310
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,510
I cannot wait to fuckin' see your fanny.

311
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,115
I'm gonna fuckin' ruin you...
- Let's have a butcher's here. Rod, look.

312
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,872
- Smash you in the...
- Look at that.

313
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,951
Beautiful, beautiful.

314
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,996

315
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,395
He's only fallen asleep, Tameka.

316
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,436
Same here, Shian. Little fuckers.

317
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,956
Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.

318
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,554
Good for you. I've got a stickleback in here.

319
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,996
You fuckin' little mug!

320
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,554
How dare you come into my fuckin' gaff,

321
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,632
and try and get hold of my little sister
against her will?

322
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,234
You're in bandit country now, boy,

323
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,436
no-one will even know you were fuckin' here.

324
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,035
There's holes dug all over South London
for people like you.

325
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,352
<i>Jesus.</i>
<i>I was expecting cornflakes and a quick wank.</i>

326
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,115
<i>But instead, I get some nutter</i>
<i>in a Stone Island jumper and a blade in my face.</i>

327
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,351
<i>And worst of all,</i>
<i>that was where all the trouble started.</i>

328
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,274
Oi, silly bollocks. What are these?

329
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,429
What?

330
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,431
- What are they?
- Flowers.

331
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,990
- What sort of flowers, dinlow?
- Lilies.

332
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,116
Then what are they doing
with the chrysanths?

333
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,475
All right. Sorry.

334
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,312

335
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,834
- What?
- Er... there's someone here to see you, Bill.

336
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,717
Who?

337
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,950
<i>...the back door.</i>
<i>Left her watching Blind Date.</i>

338
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,918
<i>Marched on up to The Venus</i>
<i>and bumped into Sonny.</i>

339
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,319
<i>He's given me a couple of Es.</i>

340
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,958
<i>I've had them with a bit more thingy,</i>

341
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,759
and wound up copping for two slosh pots
out of Chigwell.

342
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,879
Smashed the granny out of the pair of 'em
in the Tower Hotel till eleven, Sunday morning.

343
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,953
Yeah, I was back home in time for a Sunday
roast, but I was completely fuckin' anninilated.

344
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,395
Look, I've got to go, mate. My man's here.
Ta-da.

345
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,198
Good to see you, son.

346
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,872
- How are you? All right?
<i>- Not bad.</i>

347
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,191
Heard you Chelsea boys had a little turnout
at Tottenham at the weekend.

348
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,068
You ain't wrong. Heard you Millwall boys
had a little turnout down in Pompey.

349
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,754
We did. We should have had a meet.
Would have been fun.

350
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,831
You know where to find us.
Any time you like.

351
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,911
Your time'll come. What have you got for me?

352
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,116
<i>One thing I never understood about Bright was,</i>

353
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,954
<i>although he was in the Chelsea firm,</i>
<i>he did business with the head of their rivals.</i>

354
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,950
<i>Millwall.</i>

355
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,871
<i>Get that. Two men that work together,</i>

356
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,758
<i>then kick fuck out of each other</i>
<i>if ever they get the chance.</i>

357
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,478
It's bang on. What you got round you?

358
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,357
Four K.

359
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,670
- Go on, then. I'll take the lot.
- Cash.

360
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,432

361
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,272
Hang on.

362
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,674
<i>Hang on.</i>

363
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,432
Slow down.

364
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,359
What? You're fuckin' joking!

365
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,196
All right.
I'll go straight up the hospital.

366
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,872
<i>Yeah ' see you there.</i>

367
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,996
- Problem, Fred?
<i>- It's my brother, Terry.</i>

368
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,356
Someone's just done him round the canister
with a cricket bat.

369
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,192
You're fuckin' joking?
Is he all right?

370
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,599
They don't know yet.

371
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,749
Look, I gotta go.

372
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,394
- I'll keep this lot on ice for you.
- I'll call you later.

373
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,948
Oi! What are you fuckin' doing?
You're three hours late.

374
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,837
Don't start, mate. I've had a bit of ag.

375
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,999
What you got a sheet on for?

376
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,308
You don't wanna know.

377
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,119
You're right, I don't.
Get in and sort them dinlows out.

378
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,316
They're putting lilies
in with the chrysanths.

379
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,872
You got anything on under there?

380
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,039
<i>What am I fuckin'paying for?</i>
<i>Just get on with it</i>

381
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,636

382
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,513
- What do you reckon, fat boy?
- You look like a vicar, mate.

383
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,116
Are you fuckin' mad?
This is Prada, you cunt.

384
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,031
It's iron's gear.

385
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,953
Get your fuckin' skates on.
We gotta get there for the draw.

386
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,519
Horrible cunt.

387
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,077
What about the draw?
How are we gonna find a telly to watch it?

388
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,230
Oh, there'll be tellies where we're going.

389
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,472
<i>Oi, Zeb, try and make sure we've got</i>
<i>a decent house to rob this time, will you?</i>

390
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,312
<i>I don't want to watch some piece of shit.</i>

391
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,313
Slow down, will you, Davis, eh? What's
the matter with you? Are you a fuckin' Hoover?

392
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,039
<i>Whether we were thieving,</i>
<i>fucking or fighting tonight,</i>

393
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,237
<i>we'd a be glued to a TV set</i>
<i>to see who Chelsea drew in the Cup.</i>

394
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,914
<i>See, the beauty of the Cup draw is,</i>
<i>it's a lucky dip,</i>

395
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,151
<i>a chance to meet one of the old rivals,</i>
<i>like Cardiff or West Ham,</i>

396
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,037
<i>or if you're really lucky, Millwall.</i>

397
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,872
<i>And cos the draw meant so much to Billy,</i>

398
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,795
<i>he decided to take his long-suffering wife</i>
<i>Barbara out for a quiet, romantic meal.</i>

399
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,836
<i>However, they got their wires crossed,</i>

400
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,957
<i>cos Barbara thought he was taking her</i>
<i>up the West End for some tapas.</i>

401
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,473
Let's see what's on the menu.

402
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,278

403
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,430
<i>Oi, it's my sister!</i>

404
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,348

405
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,433
<i>Oh, what, your girfriend?</i>

406
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,999

407
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,195
Oi.

408
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,273
Either turn that TV up, or tell that lot down there
to hold their noise down.

409
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,713
Calm down, Bill.

410
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,751
We don't want to cause a scene.

411
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,193
No. No, you're right.

412
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,236

413
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,879

414
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,079
<i>- The old rubber glove!</i>
<i>- The old rubber glove, mate.</i>

415
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,434

416
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,750
Oi!

417
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,674
Oi. Will you shut up?
I'm trying to watch the fuckin' telly!

418
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,954

419
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,198
<i>...against 52.</i>

<i>Portsmouth.</i>

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,231
<i>Will pay number 38.</i>

<i>Middlesbrough.</i>

<i>Chelsea.</i>

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,194
Yes! Fuckin' yes!

430
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,430
<i>Another battle then.</i>

431
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,876
Eh? Can't fuckin' hear you.

432
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,916
Who is it, for fuck's sake?

433
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,717
Eh?

434
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,279
Yes!

435
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,715
- Who, who, who?
- It's fuckin' Millwall!

436
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,634
<i>Millwall-Chelsea.</i>
<i>Old enemies that always ends up in murders.</i>

437
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,914
<i>Literally in my case,</i>

438
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,753
<i>cos like a mug</i>
<i>I thought I'd get lucky in the same bar again.</i>

439
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,912
<i>And I see my new mate again</i>
<i>who, of course, turns out to be Millwall.</i>

440
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,629
<i>Maybe I should ask him if I fucked his sister,</i>
<i>seeing as I can't remember.</i>

441
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,711
<i>If I'd listened to my instincts and laid low, none</i>
<i>of this mess would have happened but I didn't,</i>

442
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,233
<i>and I only had myself to blame.</i>

443
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,189
<i>And occasionally, and I do mean occasionally,</i>
<i>it would be nice to have Bright out with us.</i>

444
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,272
<i>It's typicla that tonight</i>

<i>See? He does have a gentle side.</i>

446

Aaaarghh!

447
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,916
<i>Zeb and Raff missed the draw</i>

448
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,470
<i>robbing houses,</i>
<i>something they'd later come to regret.</i>

449

Drive, mate! Fuckin' drive.
I'm being chased!

<i>Bollocks.</i>

Hard to have a nice night out in London, eh?

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,756

457
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,674
<i>Now, anyone who's listened to the Breakfast</i>

458
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,311
<i>about his great excitement about the prospects</i>
<i>of Millwall and Chelsea here in London.</i>

<i>Our reporter, as always, is Pete Stevens.</i>

460
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,676
<i>That's right, Danny. I'm sure</i>
<i>there's going to be a vast police presence</i>

461
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,275
<i>to keep the we-known hooligan elements apart</i>
<i>from these two teams.</i>

462
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,670

Well, come on, Albert, you old bastard!
We'll miss our flight.

465
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,912
All right, Bill? You look pissed off.

466
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,357
No, I'm not fuckin' all right.
Some cunt burgled my house last night.

467
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,237
Hold that.

468

<i>Suddenly,</i>
<i>going to Millwall weren't so appealing,</i>

469

<i>now I knew my enemies were part of their firm</i>

470

<i>- Your mobile?</i>
- Yeah.

You know what to do?
Ring your number and see if they've still got it.

493

That'll freak 'em out.
Tell them you know where they live and that.

Good call, Rods.
I've got that Ride Of The Valkyries ring tone.

Where are you from, mate?

504
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,431
Just around.

505

Come here.
You didn't fuckin' shine there, did you, son?

519
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,709
What?

520
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,315
I've got to go to work on him now,
stop him opening you up.

You silly bollocks.

522

What was all that about?

523
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,313
But we did 'em, didn't we, H?

524
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,755
<i>Billy had a real punishmeht lined up</i>

525
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,719
<i>He weren't the forgiving type, but as long</i>
<i>as Harris was around, he couldn't touch him.</i>

526
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,031
<i>And Harris and Billy</i>

529
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,996
Right. No thieving.
No bringing attention to yourselves.

530
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,354
Just keep your nuts down.

531
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,398
I want you to be outside and back on the road
in five minutes.

532
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,755
Oh, yeah, and whatever you do, no fighting.

533
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,278
Bit rich, coming from him, innit?

534
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,514
Zeb, what did Billy say to you?

535
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,068
He said we've got to get his gear back to him
by tomorrow.

536
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,594
And we've got to apologise to his wife and kids.

537
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,990
You've had a result there.
You're lucky. He could have battered you.

538
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,559
Blinding result, eh?

539
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,111
This complete nutter will never talk to us again,
and everyone think s we're thieving little cunts.

540
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,352
You <i>are</i> thieving little cunts.
But you know what you've got to do, don't you?

541
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,874
Prove yourself at Millwall.
That'll sort it out.

542
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,509
Yeah, do the business down there,
and you'll be an hero in his eyes.

543
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,150
Will you stop moaning about beer?
All you do is complain about beer.

544
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,199
I'll be opening bottles with my fuckin' teeth
all the way up there, Bill.

545
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,032
Could have done with a couple of cans.

546
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,076
Shouldn't have had that chicken burger.

547
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,594
Stone me, it's them Stoke fans that done us.

548
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,870

- Over there. Look. It's them.

551
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,191
Listen. We'll get the beers safe.
Then we'll outflank 'em, yeah?

552
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,271
I ain't saying a word.

553
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,998
What the fuck are you doing?

554
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,991
There's two of them Stoke fans that done us.

555
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,389
Drop 'em now. We'll be late for the meet.

556
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,596
Fuck 'em. They kicked the shit out of us.

<i>Billy's extensive vocabulary</i>

Yeah, let's go and have a beer.

Yeah, good idea. We'll jog on.
What about you, Tom?

All right, boys. I'll see you in a bit.

610
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,559
<i>Shame. He's hung like a pike in here.</i>

611
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,359
<i>And it's tricky</i>
<i>cos he's been known to get serious.</i>

612
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,113

613
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,158

614
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,513
How are the tulips selling?
They flew out at the market.

615
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,999
What's happening, Tom?

616
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,029
Here. I got nicked with Bright the other day,
kicking off with the OB. You'd have loved it.

617
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,908
Nice one, Tom. Sounds really clever.
It's not my scene any more.

618
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,560
Yeah, well, I'm just saying.

619
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,599
Well, go and say it somewhere else, and don't
come down my stall giving it the big 'un.

620
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,829
All right. Slow down, Ad.

621
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,992
Slow down?
I'll tell you about fuckin' "slow down".

622
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,119
What's the matter with you, clumping people?
Ain't it about time you started growing up?

623
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,193
You're nearly 30. You wanna get hold
of yourself. It's all a lot of bollocks, anyway.

624
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,636
- What?
- You're a bright kid. Work it out.

625
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,154
- Here you are.
- No, they're from both of us.

626
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,835
Tommy... think about it.

627
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,394
<i>Nearly 30? What's he on about?</i>

628
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,314
<i>Jesus! I only wanted a bunch of fuckin' flowers,</i>
<i>and he tells me to think about my life.</i>

629
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,476
See you, Albert.

630
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,673
What's Harris and Bright doing there?

631
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,676
I could hardly stop them, Bill.

632
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,558
They're foolish men, Tom.

633
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,916
Harris think s we're connected
cos I fought in the war.

634
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,994
What he doesn't understand is, I fought to stop
people like him with their Fascist opinions.

635
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,916
Billy is a fuckin' idiot.

636
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,232
Are you still going to Australia?

637
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,233
I don't know. There's a spare ticket
going begging, if you're interested.

638
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,996
Your cousins would love to see you.

639
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,078
Do yourself a favour.

640
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,839
Put a bit of distance between you
and all that stuff you're mixed up in.

641
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,151
I'm all right, Bill.

642
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,719
I'm just having a laugh.

643
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,756
Well, just be careful.

644
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,638
Next time you visit the boneyard,
it could be in a box.

645
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,838
What are you fuckin' doing here,
you little cunt?

646
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,115
I've cme to pay my respects.

647
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,509
Well, you're not wanted.

648
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,832
Let's have it right. You didn't even
fuckin' know him, did you? Did you?

649
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,558
Well, put your soppy cap on,
then, and fuck off.

650
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,678
Go on, jog on.

651
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,676
Don't forget our appointment.

652
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,478

653
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,395
All right, boys? What's happening?

654
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,835
Why have you got a dartboard
drawn on your shirt, Zeb?

655
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,229
Well, what's it got to do with you, you mug?

656
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,110
All right, boys. First one to a hundred.

657
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,795
Aaaarghh!

658
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,038
Aaaarghh!

659
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,315
Stand up straight.

660
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,474

661
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,235
He wants to know
which one stole the PlayStation.

662
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,469
Me.

663
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,878
Good call. Crack on.

664
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,589
Aaaarghh!

665
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,671
Oi, shithead, hold your hand out.

666
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,797
- What, Zeb?
- I said, hold your hand out.

667
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,672
Just a kid, ain't you?

668
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,116
<i>You</i> hold your hand out, Zeb.
Let's see how old <i>you</i> are.

669
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,031
Are you trying to fuckin' mug me off?

670
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,397
<i>With Millwall round the corner,</i>
<i>it was time for the juniors to play</i>

671
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,472
<i>Nice to see Billy and Fred</i>
<i>could put their differences aside</i>

672
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,630
<i>when it come to their kids.</i>

673
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,077
Bit of a coincidence, eh? Our kids play against
each other just before we meet in the Cup.

674
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,470
Somehow, I don't think this game's
gonna get quite as messy. Do you?

675
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,471
Fancy yourselves in bandit country, then?

676
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,870
Well, let's have it right.
If history's anything to go by,

677
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,428
last time we met you lot,
we ran you all over London.

678
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,351
You couldn't run 100 yards, mate!

679
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,955
- Won't fuckin' need to, either!
- Don't get lemon, Bill. It don't suit you.

680
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,314
Spell it, you cunt.

681
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,152
C-U-N-T. Cunt.

682
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,231
I meant "lemon", soppy bollocks.

683
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,996
We'll see about lemon when you're lost
in deep south, you fat fuckin' prick.

684
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,311
Whoa! Now we're getting personal.
Now, what's your problem?

685
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,949
That you have to open your kebab shop soon
or that you buy Charlie off a white man?

686
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,319
Well, how does it feel doing business with
a Turk, when you're supposed to be right wing?

687
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,118
Scooby-Do's less confused than you.

688
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,430
You'll be confused when I open your canister up.

689
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,590
You wanna wait till the game or make one now?

690
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,831
Don't punch above your weight,
you long streak of piss.

691
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,639
Well, stop punching your old woman about,
then, wanker.

692
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,278
What did you fuckin' say, you mug?

693
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,828
You fuckin' heard, you fat fuckin' Johnson cunt.

694
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,753
Fuckin' mug! Look at you, you cunt!

695
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,479
Get off me, you... Get off me, you cunt!

696
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,433

697
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,715
Fuck this. If they can't be grown up, let's go.

698
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,472
I'll fuckin' do you!

699
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,192
<i>Just as I thought.</i>
<i>Rod's been plating the court clerk's Gary,</i>

700
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,589
<i>and now she wants to meet his mates.</i>

701
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,196
<i>I told him I already met her in the dock,</i>
<i>but he insisted on a social one.</i>

702
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,751
<i>And why is it that when your best mate meets</i>
<i>a girl, he quickly changes into a fuckin' melt,</i>
703
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,912
<i>and acts like</i>
<i>he's only known you for ten minutes?</i>

704
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,754
So... what do you do, then, Thomas?

705
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,877
<i>Thomas?</i>
<i>Kick people's fuckin' heads in for a laugh.</i>

706
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,269
<i>And you shoud know, div.</i>
<i>You read the charges out.</i>

707
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,112
Me?

708
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,031
I work long and hard.

709
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,357
Sounds like Rod!

710
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,309
<i>- Yeah?</i>

711
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,070
Cor...

712
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,197
<i>Jesus, he's really picked one here.</i>
<i>The worst sort of all.</i>

713
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,637
<i>Wannabe middle-class scum.</i>
<i>I'd like to kick the cunt back to Penge.</i>

714
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,073
Seems nice.

715
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,355
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's a top bloke.

716
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,273
Bill, it's Tom. Fancy a quiet drink?
I'm bored out of my skull.

717
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,238
Meet me at work around seven in the morning.

718
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,276
Don't worry. I'll bring my tools.

719
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,479
- Fancy a sauna?
- Good call, Bill.

720
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,118

721
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,914
Johnson!

722
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,914
Johnson!

723
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,278
All right, Billy. What's it gonna be today?
A little lavender head massage?

724
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,432
No, forget that and just crack straight on
with the blow job, eh?

725
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,636
Stone me, she won't be working for a week.
What was that screaming about?

726
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,153
- What do you think?
- Good boy.

727
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,710
<i>What do you think the screaming was about?</i>
<i>I'm having a fuckin' breakdown.</i>

728
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,555
<i>With my back against the wall there was</i>
<i>only one thing for it - seek counsle from Bright.</i>

729
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,471
Bill, can I talk to you for a minute?

730
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,596
Yeah, yeah, course you can, son.

731
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,830
It's just er... I keep...

732
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,308
I dunno. I just keep... You know?

733
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,152
Yeah, yeah, I know.

734
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,554
- Really?
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

735
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,755

736
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,796
Fuck! Fuck it.
I thought it was just me.

737
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,480
No, listen.
It happens to me all the time.

738
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,755
No, don't worry about it. It's sweet.

739
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,432
Don't worry. I'm gonna sort you out.

740
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,511
Thank s, Bill. 
You're a fuckin' good man.

741
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,033
Listen. Don't mention it.

742
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,192
<i>- Here you are.</i>
- What?

743
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,838
<i>Go on son. Crack on. Go on.</i>

744
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,438

745
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,759
Enjoy!

746
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,751
<i>Should have seen that one coming.</i>

747
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,912
<i>The last person on earth you want to talk to</i>
<i>when you're paranoid</i>

748
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,753
<i>Ask Bright for advice, and</i>
<i>you get fuckin' Viagra.</i>

749
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,115

750
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,955
<i>And what a good mate</i> he <i>was</i>
<i>in my time of need.</i>

751
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,430
<i>Fuckin' fat little cunt</i>
<i>lazing about with his Penge minge.</i>

752
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,589
Wake up, sleepy.

753
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,830
That was my parents on the phone.

754
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,718
They're coming to London at the weekend
and want to take us out.

755
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,439
Well, as long as it ain't Saturday.
We got Millwall.

756
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,192
It is Saturday, Rod.

757
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,992
What about Sunday?

758
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,471
They're going to my brother's in Reading.
Don't tell me you'd rather go to football.

759
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,788
Well, I am male.

760
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,950
It's one game.

761
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,473
I am male.

762
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,949
But my parents only come round
once every few months.

763
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,679
Yeah, Millwall comes round
less than the eclipse, babe.

764
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,193
Well, don't just run out.

765
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,511
- I'm going to work.
<i>- Let's talk about it, eh?</i>

766
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,999
There's nothing to talk about.

767
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,390
<i>You either meet my parents on Saturday</i>
<i>or you never meet them.</i>

768
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,073
All right, boys?

769
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,549
Yeah. Sweet. Speak to you later.

770
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,516
Fuck off.

771
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,233
- Are you serving?
- Yeah, what do you need? Whites or browns?

772
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,396
Hit him, hit him! Hit the cunt.

773
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,112
Come here.

774
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,911
Cunt! Cunt! Cunt!

775
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,356
Grab the fuckin' rock.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

776
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,989
Cunt!

777
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,638
Come on!

778
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,398
- Fuckin' hell!
- Shit, that must have been Zeberdee.

779
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,038
Come, let's go.

780
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,958
<i>My grandad's life</i>
<i>was disappearing in front of his eyes.</i>

781
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,636
<i>With Albert dead, he had no-one, apart from me,</i>
<i>so it was time to give him some family support,</i>

782
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,109
<i>and maybe even some friendly advice.</i>

783
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,875
You should come to Millwall at the weekend.
That'll liven you up a bit.

784
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,593
You all right for money, Bill?

785
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,875
<i>Cos you know you've only got to ask.</i>

786
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,349
<i>I'm earning a few quid down the market now.</i>

787
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,112
It ain't as if I got a bird to spend it on.

788
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,349
Unlike Rod.

789
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,591
You sound over the moon about that.

790
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,238
Yeah, well...

791
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,152
Your chance'll come.

792
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,676
Don't you ever get the itch?

793
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,558
Yeah.

794
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,069
I can see myself on a sun lounger
in my back garden,

795
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,515
a couple of kids running about...

796
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,556
sipping my Pimm's quietly.

797
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,795
Kids, eh?

798
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,233
Yeah. Why not?

799
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,553
What's their names?

800
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,712
Dorian, after my mate.

801
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,233
Dorian?

802
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,197
<i>Both of them?</i>

803
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,269
Yeah, probably.

804
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,873
What if they're girls?

805
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,955
Dorian.

806
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,472
You're a good boy, Tom.

807
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,153
Keep your eye on my wallet, Bill.

808
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,992
I'm going to the toilet.

809
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,109
I tell you what, Fred.

810
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,998
<i>This area beats South London hands down.</i>

811
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,396
Bollocks, does it.
I'll have Bermondsey any day.

812
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,960
It's full of spivs and skint hoorays round here.

813
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,032
I just wanna find this fuckin' Tommy Johnson
and get out of here.

814
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,714
Let's just cut him and fuck off back over south.

815
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,438
<i>You're not wrong.</i>

816
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,109
Oi, you, skint boat, come here.

817
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,080
- Me?
- Yes, fuckin' you. Come here.

818
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,192
Come on.

819
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,994
Ever heard of a geezer
called Tommy Johnson?

820
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,838
Johnson...

821
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,438
Johnson...

822
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,152
No, I've never heard of him, mate.

823
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,468
Yeah?

824
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,913
Yeah.

825
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,399
So, what's <i>your</i> name?

826
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,990
- What?
- I said, what's your fuckin' name?

827
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,515
Dorian.

828
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,155
Poof!

829
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,789
Dorian? Sounds like a fuckin' poof.

830
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,711
Yeah, I know.

831
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,233
Just a name, though, innit?

832
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,639
Prove it.

833
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,515
Prevve wmnat?

834
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,909
Stop fuckin' stuttering,
and fuckin' prove it.

835
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,991
Just show him some fuckin' brief.

836
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,478
Er...

837
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,796
I ain't got my wallet on me, mate.

838
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,993
Go on, then. Fuck off, you mug. Go on.

839
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,229

840
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,833
Hang on.

841
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,391
<i>We'll see who the fuck you really are.</i>
<i>Give us your phone.</i>

842
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,637

843
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,439
<i>Who's this?</i>

844
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,670
<i>Hello. It's Rod. Is Dorian there?</i>

845
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,434
You've had a fuckin' touch. Little mug.

846
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,272
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

847
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,153

848
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,390
Do you reckon he's somewhere else?

849
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,199
We'll try the other gaff.
He's got to be here somewhere.

850
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,671
<i>Fuckin' hell! Did your arse drop, son?</i>

851
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,433
You'd fuckin' think so! I tell you.

852
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,479
The moment I seen them follow you in,
I knew you'd give them a dodgy name.

853
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,710
It's a little trick we picked up in the army.

854
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,792
I'm definitely calling my kids Dorian now. 
Dorian.

855
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,393
- Dorian.
<i>- Dorian.</i>

856
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,433
See you, Rodder,
I fuckin' love you sometimes. Do you know that?

857
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,829
You ain't too bad yourself, Johnson.

858
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,957
I'm well up for it now.
The omens are good. Millwall who?

859
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,395
<i>I'm gonna have a right</i>
<i>fuckin' buzz down there.</i>

860
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,395
Yeah.

861
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,993
<i>Don't say it, Rod.</i>

862
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,672
What?

863
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,239
You fuckin' know.

864
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,676
Look, Tom, fuckin'...
Her mum and dad are coming down.

865
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,511
Tom, you'll need these
where you're going.

866
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,433

867
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,118

868
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,993
How you doing, mister?

869
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,594
Nah. Not good. You?

870
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,238
Still dead.

871
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,039
Sorry about that. Am I?

872
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,270
No, you're still alive.

873
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,272
- Who are you, mate?
<i>- Don't know mate.</i>

874
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,715
Can't tell till I
take these bandages off.

875
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,676

876
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,353
What?

877
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,396
What do you mean, "what"?

878
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,117
What are you looking at me like that for?

879
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,872
You don't know?

880
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,275
What, Rod?

881
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,635
You don't remember what
you done last night?

882
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,312
I was fuckin' lashed, wasn't I?

883
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:42,029
Last thing I remember was being in the boozer
with you and my grandad.

884
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,678
Jesus, Tom...

885
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,070
For fuck's sake, Rod, what's so bad?

886
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,639
You don't remember Barbara?

887
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,474
Barbara who?

888
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,755
You tried to get off
with Billy's wife.

889
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,593
Fuck off.

890
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,671
And when she blanked you, you beat her up.

891
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,956
- What?
- You broke her fuckin' jaw, Tom.

892
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,916
I know you're winding me up, Rod.

893
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,356
Please tell me you're winding me up, Rod.

894
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,112
I ain't, mate.

895
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,751
Fuck off, King. I tell you what.
I'll ring Zeb. He'll fuckin' know.

896
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,999
All right, Zeb?

897
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,152
Fuckin' hell, Tom. I don't know what to say.

898
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,953
<i>You went berserk mate.</i>

899
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,192
<i>I've got to wash my hands of this one.</i>
<i>The cunt's been playing darts with me.</i>

900
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,872
What am I gonna do, Rod?

901
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,798
You're gonna have to go round there.

902
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,518
What?

903
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,716
Just go round there and fuckin' beg.

904
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,395
Well, that's a good idea. I might as well
break her fuckin' nose while I'm at it.

905
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,755
I don't know what else to say to you, Tom.

906
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,558
No, you're right. I'II...

907
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,033
I'll fling myself on my knees
and let him kick the fuck out of me.

908
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,554
Hopefully,
he'll have mercy on me if I'm on the floor.

909
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,113
You know him better than me, mate.

910
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,474
That's the problem. I know what he'll do.

911
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,110

912
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,595
Johnson.

913
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,919
Listen, Bill, listen.
On my life, I don't remember nothing.

914
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,753
I was obviously smashed out of my tree.
I've woke up...

915
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,990
I'm none the wiser, Bill. Please, Bill.

916
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,470
<i>I don't know what's gone on, mate</i>
<i>swear to you. Please Bill. Please.</i>

917
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,913
My life.

918
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:13,274
You soppy, muggy streak of piss.
I can't fuckin' believe you fell for that!

919
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,078

920
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,029
If you'd touched my woman,
you'd already be dead!

921
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,758
Fuckin' arseholes.

922
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,239
<i>Fuckin' funny, that, innit?</i>

923
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,592
Go on. Have a fuckin' laugh, will you?
Go on. Really fuckin'...

924
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,750
I really fuckin' need this at the moment,

925
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,992
what with my dreams,
fuckin' florists, fuckin' billboards...

926
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,035
Bollocks!

927
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,113
Cunts.

928
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,679
On his fuckin' knees!

929
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,632
<i>With mates like mine</i>
<i>you certainly don't need enemies. Jesus.</i>

930
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,711
<i>Three weeks ago, I was getting on with my life.</i>

931
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,713
<i>But now, with Millwall round the corner,</i>
<i>I'm half the man I was, which ain't saying much.</i>

932
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,756
<i>And the worst is yet to come.</i>

933
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,393
<i>Here's Mark with the sport.</i>

934
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,630
<i>Well, the third round takes place this Saturday,</i>

935
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,996
<i>and of course the pick of the ties</i>
<i>has got to be Chelsea against Millwall.</i>

936
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,356
<i>I know police leave</i>
<i>is cancelled, but this goes beyond that.</i>

937
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,998
<i>This is that ancient rivalry...</i>

938
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,274
Hello, Bill.

939
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,828
Donna, give him a pint, love.
Put 'em on the tab.

940
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,119
- How's your luck?
- Not bad, Billy. How are you?

941
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,239
<i>Right. Same as before.</i>

942
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,834
I'll take some of you lot
down through South Bermondsey,

943
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,388
and Tommy will take the
rest from Surrey Quays.

944
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,753
Where's the meet?

945
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,273
It can't be too far away.

946
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,430
They'll have spotters out all over the place.

947
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,478
- And it's on top of the Old Bill before we start.
<i>- What about Billy?</i>

948
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,754
What about Billy?

949
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,717
He knows Millwall like the back of his hand.

950
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,837
Fuck Billy.
He don't know what he's doing any more.

951
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,230
Now, let's have it right.
We all know he's become a liability.

952
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,788
<i>Granted, yeah he can have a row.</i>

953
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,996
But he can't run a turnout
down in South London.

954
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,117
<i>He's a fuckin' lunatic.</i>
<i>Look what happened in Liverpool.</i>

955
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,519
Bollocksed the day up.

956
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,916
His problem is,
he's taken too much of that shit up his nose.

957
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,993
Just forget him.

958
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,718
Slow down. He's one of your own.

959
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,791
<i>Hang on. You've got to make Harris right here.</i>

960
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,917
It's like having a big kid around.
He's a fuckin' dope, mate.

961
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,231
<i>Just let him take Zeberdee</i>
<i>and those chavvies. That'll do him.</i>

962
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,197
<i>You just wipe your mouth of him.</i>

963
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,952
He's a spent force.

964
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,358
<i>Bill...</i>

965
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,398
<i>Bill!</i>

966
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,988
What's the matter, babe?

967
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,469
You think I'm all right, don't you?

968
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,709
What?

969
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,198
I'm all right, aren't I?

970
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,236
Yeah, course you are, you silly sod.

971
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,318
Come here.

972
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,118
Eat your dinner.

973
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,835
Bright!

974
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,953
Don't fuckin' creep up 
on me like that, you si!

975
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,439
Bill. Take it easy.

976
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,636
How comes you weren't down the pub
last night?

977
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,278
Fell asleep, didn't I?

978
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,590
How comes <i>you</i> know I weren't there?

979
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,557
Harris belled me and asked where you were.

980
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,279
<i>Well, he didn't fuckin' bell me.</i>
Maybe he forgot, eh?

981
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,798
<i>- Got it?</i>
- Fuck me! What's that for?

982
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,154
Millwall.

983
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,993
Don't be stupid.
You can't take a gun down there.

984
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,516
- It's only a flare gun.
- What are you on about? You'll kill someone.

985
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,591
<i>Meant to be having a laugh aren't we?</i>

986
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,394
Fuckin' hell, Bill.

987
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,879
You're on the turn, ain't you?

988
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,394
<i>- You ain't got nothing to prove.</i>
- Ain't I?

989
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,596

990
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,551
You look as handsome
as you did on our wedding day.

991
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,915
<i>Where are your medals?</i>

992
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,230
You can't go to Whitehall without them, dear.

993
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,272
<i>You're a hero William.</i>
<i>Go and put them on dear.</i>

994
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,038
Make me the proudest woman alive.

995
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,673
Don't look at me.

996
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,633

997
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,517
Yeah, go on. Fuck off, you Pakis.

998
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,589
Fuck off!

999
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,638
Got the little chavvy?
Corned beefs all over the gaff.

1000
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,119
I know, I know, I know.

1001
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,839
Did you see the state of his boat?
Did you see it?

1002
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,309
You don't even know you're fuckin' born!

1003
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,038
Oh, fuck off.

1004
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,158

1005
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,156
Go on, fuck off, you old mug!

1006
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,838

1007
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,558

1008
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,319
I know who I am now.

1009
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,038
Show me, then.

1010
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,910

1011
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,191

1012
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,875

1013
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,076
All right, for fuck's sake.

1014
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,320
Hurry up, lazy bollocks.
It's Millwall today.

1015
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,875
You all right?

1016
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,758
I'm sweet, mate. I'm fuckin' buzzing.
This is it.

1017
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,550
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1018
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,710
Listen, Zeb. Listen, listen.

1019
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,392
You... You'd better just...

1020
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,870
What, Tom?
Fucking hell, Tom, what had I better do?

1021
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,876
Just look after yourself. It might turn ugly.

1022
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,952
Don't worry about me.
I'm gonna be a fuckin' hero.

1023
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,235
Liven up, we've got to meet the others.

1024
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,472
I tell you, it's a fuckin' buzz! Come on!

1025
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,516

1026
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,234
Here, Tom, where's Rod?

1027
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,709
Fuck knows. You all right?

1028
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,473
Yeah. Couldn't sleep, could I? Fuckin' buzzing.

1029
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:23,199
<i>The wretch from Penge had got her claws in,</i>
<i>and only a miracle could bring him back.</i>

1030
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,317
<i>But I couldn't see it happening.</i>
<i>I'd lost him when I needed him most.</i>

1031
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,279
<i>And not even someone of Rod's calibre</i>
<i>woud have the bottle to say...</i>

1032
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,715
That espresso's really kicked in.

1033
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,677
<i>Darling you don't drink espresso.</i>

1034
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,595
Tell me more about the air conditioning,
Rodney. I'm fascinated.

1035
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,675
Air conditioning?

1036
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,558
You told me you run an
air-conditioning firm.

1037
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,076
Well, we have a few vans out on jobs at once
most of the time.

1038
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,037
Well, it's always busier in the summer.

1039
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,475
Nothing like a soaring temperature
to help the work.

1040
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,269
Anyway, most of the time I just sit
around the office, waiting for the weekend.

1041
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,272
Don't get me wrong.
I love the money the job pays.

1042
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,751
But my real passion lies
in kicking people's fucking heads in at football.

1043
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,435
See, I've got to channel it somewhere,
and as you can tell by my bulging stomach,

1044
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,193
I don't participate in too
many sporting activities.

1045
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,350
And I don't do drugs.

1046
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,476
Well, that's not entirely true, but not a lot.

1047
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,314
So, I need my release, and a good fuckin' fight
seems the best way. Wouldn't you agree?

1048
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,953
<i>Maybe no.t</i>

1049
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,716
At least I wouldn't be walking around like you -
fuckin' horrible cunts with stick s up your arses,

1050
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,712
trying to pretend
your little suburban nightmare's all right.

1051
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,268
<i>Then again,</i>
<i>it just depe,ds which way you look at it.</i>

1052
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,510
Mate, can we have the...

1053
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,678
No, I'll...

1054
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,192
Rod! I fuckin' knew you'd make it!

1055
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,157
Wouldn't miss it for the world, mate.

1056
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,390
There's a fuckin' shot, man.

1057
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,636

1058
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,638

1059
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,915
You lot fuckin' ready for us, or what?

1060
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,195
Well, let's see how game you really are.

1061
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,273
So, come and find us, then, shithead.

1062
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,750
Oh, and be careful.
Remember you're gonna be in deep south.

1063
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,559
Away from all the crowds and the ready eye.

1064
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:47,153
So, watch your fuckin' backs.

1065
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,913
<i>- Fuckin' hell!</i>
- Let's have it!

1066
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,956

1067
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,150

1068
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,151

1069
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,673

1070
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,830

1071
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,399

1072
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,157

1073
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,309
Hello, Tom.

1074
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,594
What's happening, Joe boy?

1075
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,113
Everything's sweet round here.

1076
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,475
- Where's Harris?
- On his way from South Bermondsey.

1077
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,437
Get yourself up on the bridge lively.

1078
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,669
Later on. Bye.

1079
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,476

1080
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:27,239
- Hello, Joe, son. Where are you?
- On the bridge. It's all quiet down here.

1081
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,390
Keep your eyes peeled.
Well be there soon.

1082
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,038
<i>Give you a bell if I see anything.</i>

1083
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,998
<i>- Crack on.</i>
- Speak to you later.

1084
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,548

1085
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,475

1086
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,352

1087
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,037

1088
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,519

1089
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,395

1090
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,151

1091
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,879

1092
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,799

1093
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,190
- Right. Here you are. It's sweet.
- Other end of the bridge, lively.

1094
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,111

1095
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,918

1096
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,070

1097
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,479

1098
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,032

1099
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,314

1100
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,638

1101
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,118

1102
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,395.

1103
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,789
Sweet, Bill?
Get down here all right?

1104
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,996
30 years I've stood
toe to toe with you.

1105
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,911
You fuckin' mug me off like that?

1106
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,955
Forget it.

1107
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,156

1108
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,276

1109
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,112

1110
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,316

1111
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,197

1112
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,952

1113
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,076

1114
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,037

1115
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,519

1116
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,429

1117
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,077

1118
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,436

1119
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,996
Anyone who runs is gonna get
properly served up when we get home.

1120
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,672
You got it?

1121
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,835
Are you all right, son, yeah?

1122
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,478
Yeah. Are you?

1123
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,470
I've got to tell you now.
I've got a really bad fuckin' feeling about this.

1124
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,993

1125
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,391

1126
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:28,799

1127

1130
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,469

1131
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:38,675

1132
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,514

1133
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,952

1134
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,952

<i>Come on! For fuck's sake.</i>

1140
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,198

1141
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,032

1142
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,269

1143

1147
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,034
Oi. Oi. Hold it here.
Hold it. Hold it.

1148
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,076

1149
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,359
Hold it.
Oi. Keep your fuckin' voices down.

1150
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,112
Keep your fuckin' voices down.

1151
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,758
Keep it quiet. Keep it quiet.

1152
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,592

1153
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,272
Fuckin' wankers!

1154
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,038
Fuck.

1156
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,308
Cunts!

1157
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,594
You and your f...

1158
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,670
<i>Clear the area.</i>

<i>Disperse, immediately.</i>

1162
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,315
<i>I repeat: disperse now.</i>

1163
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,236
<i>Clear the area.</i>

1164
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,398
Get him!

Step on the cunt!

01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,195
Get the cunt on the floor.
Get into him!

Johnson! Johnson!
Leave my fuckin' brother in Casualty, you cunt?

Get the fuck back!

1170
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,598
Get out of the way!

1171
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,638
Leave it.

1172
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,675
You nearly wound up in
the boneyard, my son.

1173
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,393
How come you're here?

1174
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,436
They call it grieving.

1175
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,988
I call it falling fuckin' over.

1176
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,360
Rod and the others was up.
Brought you some grapes.

1177
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,036
Was er... Zeberdee there?

1178
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,680
Erm... young fella with black hair?

1179
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,751
What, that little prick?
Yes, he was.

1180
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,831

1181
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,672
Thank fuck for that.

1182
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,834
What about Australia, Bill?

1183
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,876
I'll fly next Tuesday.

1184
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,798
What about you?

1185
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,198
What about me?

1186
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,918
Huh!

1187
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,672
Was it worth it?

1188
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:03,276
<i>Kicked half to death,</i>
<i>florists, cabbies, nightmares and visions.</i>

1189
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,157
<i>One of the old soldiers gone for ever.</i>

1190
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,673
<i>Bright gone for a seven,</i>

1191
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:11,390
<i>and bollocks so ruptured that the only thing</i>
<i>I'll be pulling for months is a chain.</i>

1192
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,359
<i>After all that you really do</i>
<i>have to ask yourself if it was a worth it.</i>

1193
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,192
<i>Course it fuckin' was.</i>

1194
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,236

1195
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,196

1196
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,434
Yeah, just get a pint over here.

1197
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,151
They reckon, as soon as he got sentenced,
he started crying his eyes out.

1198
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,198
I'll do it standing on my head, you mug.
Fuck off.

1199
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:52,229
You corrupt cunt. It's people like you
that are ruining this fuckin' country, you nonce.

1200
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,390
- <i>Take him down.</i>
- <i>Fuckin' mug.</i>

1201
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,038
Here you are.

1202
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,397
- Where are you going, you slippery cunt?
- Khazi. He gave me a livener.

1203
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,517
Zeb, leave me some,
or you're fuckin' dead.

1204
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,277
What's happenin', Zeberfuckindee?
