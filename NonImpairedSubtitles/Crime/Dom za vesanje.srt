00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:38,684
Dom za vesanje [Time of the Gypsies]
a love movie

2
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:50,246
Script

3
00:00:50,247 --> 00:00:53,366
You've ruined my life.
Look, what you've done to me.

4
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:59,367
I'll take of my shoe
and crush your bonce!

5
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:13,006
They want to mess up my life,

6
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,766
prick my brain with injections.

7
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:18,446
I'm not mad to accept that.

8
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:22,366
They order me to eat powders,
to swallow electric bulbs.

9
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:27,566
They've bind my soul
and lead it like a bear.

10
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,766
I am not Bozana the she-bear.

11
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:33,846
They want my wings.

12
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:38,566
What will my spirit do without wings?
My spirit flies.

13
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:42,926
She cries, sings or laughs,
when she wants to.

14
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:45,286
When God lived down here,

15
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:48,046
he couldn't get along with us Gypsies,

16
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:53,766
so he had to go up there.
It's not my fault.

17
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:59,767
Playing

18
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:44,207
Propagate, procreate.

19
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:46,686
God help me.

20
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:50,086
You would beat me even if you threw
them the wrong way.

21
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,646
Everything I earned has gone.

22
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:55,286
If only i had a person
in front of me, i wouldn't be sorry about it.

23
00:02:55,287 --> 00:03:01,287
But no,
he's a swine.

24
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:15,046
He takes and he smiles.

25
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:17,926
God, what have I done to you?

26
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:22,046
I'll give it all. I'll even sell
my house if i need to.

27
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:25,286
Just as long as I beat him.

28
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:29,926
I'll work for 20 years,
if that's my destiny.

29
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:31,846
My fate will change,

30
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:36,206
and I'll have more luck.

31
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:42,207
If you would help me
once more, God.

32
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:10,006
Did you get drunk?
Do you want to ruin my wedding?

33
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:16,007
Speak!
What should I do now?

34
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:31,127
Music

35
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:46,367
Directed by

36
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:57,646
God, for once, help me.

37
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:01,486
The house will be white like milk.

38
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:04,206
I must tidy up my house,

39
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:08,126
so my leg sees a 
white God.

40
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:14,127
Here, take the money.

41
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,566
Thank you for healing my husband.

42
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,966
Take the turkey for luck.

43
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:49,967
I don't charge for healing.

44
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:58,847
A little more, a little more.

45
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:07,966
Eat.

46
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:12,926
Don't cry Daca, I beg you.

47
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:17,366
Perhan, look what i've
brought you.

48
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:19,486
Is it mine? - Only yours.

49
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:25,286
You obey me.
You're grandma's sweetheart.

50
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,606
Mine alone? -Yours!

51
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:31,526
You're a good person, you work,
you take care of your sister.

52
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:37,527
Danira, look. -I'll give you my soul
if you're a good boy.

53
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:43,846
Whose bird is this?
- Perhan's. He works.

54
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:48,606
You give everything you get
to Perhan.

55
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:53,326
He's a good boy. -You give Perhan everything,
but nothing to me.

56
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:58,046
I'm not a war criminal!
Don't you see?

57
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,486
Don't act stupid.
- I'll lose my mind.

58
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:07,487
Perhanu this, Perhanu that!
Eveything only to Perhan!

59
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:11,846
You and your Perhan can live in
Yugoslavia,

60
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:18,002
i'm going to Germany.
I'm leaving! Get it?

61
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:46,446
Go away! What have you done to me?

62
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:52,447
You've disgraced me!
- Why are you beating me?

63
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,086
Don't curse me, mother!

64
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,566
Woman,
where is that actor of yours?

65
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:03,086
Look, what he did to my
daughter.

66
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:06,606
Do you have any problems, old woman?

67
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:11,006
I'll put out his eyes!
I'll kill him!

68
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:17,007
Don't push me away, old woman.

69
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:21,646
Where is your son?
Call him immediately.

70
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:24,126
Call him!
- Sit, calm down.

71
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:27,086
I won't sit.
I want you to call your son.

72
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:31,526
Find him at once.
- You chat a lot.

73
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:35,326
He pumped up my daughter,
and she's not even 11 years old.

74
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,366
Find him at once!
He disgraced her.

75
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,806
Why did you come to me?
- I'll pull out your eyes!

76
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:45,046
Call your son at once!
He ruined my daughter.

77
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:50,726
I'll kill you. -Me?

78
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:54,766
Look at you, what a disgrace!
Stop it. - And you?

79
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,806
You felt nice,
when you lied under him.

80
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:02,046
I know your tricks.
You want money.

81
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:07,366
You have to pay
because your son fucks anything that moves.

82
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:10,646
My brothers will castrate him. -Sit down.

83
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:13,446
Ok, I'll sit down.

84
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:16,046
There. I sit.

85
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:18,966
Call your son. Let him say,
if he'll marry her.

86
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:22,166
If he wants her,
you can do nothing about it.

87
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:26,566
When she sees my son
her eyes are like blinkers.

88
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,806
Don't tell me!
- She just winks, gives herself to others.

89
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:35,807
Blinkers?
Shame on you, old woman.

90
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:46,567
Winged, sunny bird.

91
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:09,966
What trouble brought you here,
child?

92
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,886
Worse then trouble.

93
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:14,446
Ruza turned the house upside down.

94
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:20,447
She wants everything to glare on holiday.

95
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:25,966
Perhan, give the girl some 
special lime!

96
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:31,967
Do you hear me?

97
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:44,927
I've come to buy soome lime.

98
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,406
Go, run!

99
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:53,966
Sit down.

100
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:56,366
Who'll carry such a sack?

101
00:10:56,367 --> 00:11:01,326
I will, if you'll help me.

102
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,046
Do you know how to make lime?
Listen.

103
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,566
The most important thing is 
temperature.

104
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,766
Without constant fire you cannot
burn lime.

105
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,246
Fire is the basis of everything.

106
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:16,966
Wood burns, smoke goes
through the oven,

107
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,366
the air warms up,
iron plate gets white-hot.

108
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,406
Limetone burns and then goes out.

109
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:26,926
In the end everything turns to white dust .

110
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:32,927
Only God knows, how much is heat is needed for it.

111
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,126
Do you know how to kiss?

112
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,806
No house would be white without lime,

113
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:40,326
plum jam would be sour.

114
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,686
Do you know how to kiss?
- Grandma thinks,

115
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:46,086
that lime was the breast of the
rocky mother.

116
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:49,606
Mother of the forest and mother of the rock
had a quarrel.

117
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:53,126
The forest mother tore her breast off with 
her teeth.

118
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:57,326
That's why lime is white as milk.

119
00:11:57,327 --> 00:12:03,327
The earth gave it birth,
the water baptised it, the fire breast-fed it .

120
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:06,046
You don't know how to kiss.

121
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:12,047
I know, in a film way.
Like Richard Gere.

122
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:17,006
At dawn we'll be in Mexico.
- At dawn?

123
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:23,007
Is it hot in Mexico?
- It's hot.

124
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:38,007
It'll be wonderful.
You, me, muchachos.

125
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:53,927
Calm down.

126
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:10,886
How long can you kiss without
breathing in?

127
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:16,887
Fifteen
or twenty minutes.

128
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:49,726
No!

129
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,526
My God!

130
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:58,527
You've got magnet on your lips.

131
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:03,086
Shall I show you something?

132
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:09,087
Look at the can.

133
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:42,367
Fata morgana!

134
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:52,926
Stop, the can!

135
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:58,927
Stop!

136
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:09,326
You've come to propose her ?

137
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:10,966
Me.

138
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,126
What? You're proposing?

139
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:16,686
This brat has come
to spoil our Vasilica!

140
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:22,126
Look at him!

141
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:24,846
Inside! -Azra, stay here.

142
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:28,326
What? I said inside the house!

143
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,366
Azra, stay here!

144
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,486
Inside, if I tell you!
Are you deaf?

145
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:35,966
You've ruined my life.

146
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:41,967
What's up with you?
You've swallowed up my soul.

147
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,966
And you! You army bastard!

148
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,966
One doesn't know what faith you belong to!
Neither Gypsy nor non-Gypsy.

149
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:51,886
You haven't got a single penny in your
pocket !

150
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:54,006
You army bastard!
What are you waiting for, get lost!

151
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:56,206
And you? You're silent as a grave!

152
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:59,566
You don't even open your mouth, you asshole!
You've turned into a grave!

153
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:04,246
My God!
Has anybody seen anything like it?

154
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:07,766
Help me neighbours!
He wants to kill me!

155
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,846
Help! He'll kill me!

156
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,406
I'll pull out your eyes!

157
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,686
Help! Is anybody there?
Hurry, neighbours!

158
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:22,687
He wants to slaughter me!

159
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,006
Dear grandma!
161
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,526

160
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,526
In a world,
that does not understand me,

161
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,926
there is no place for me.

162
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:42,646
When I finish writing this lettes,
I'll swallow it.

163
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:45,206
I don't want anybody to find it,

164
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,966
because I would be later ashamed,

165
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:51,206
of killing myself because for a woman.

166
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:55,406
I cannot live a second more without Azra.

167
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:58,166
Her mother,
the three-headed snake,

168
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,126
does not allow me to see her.

169
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:04,886
Yours, Perhan.

170
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:09,406
My name is not Zabit,
if I don't jump over the shadow!

171
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:14,966
One, two, three, now!

172
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,286
Damned shadow!

173
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,646
The moonlight smiles.

174
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:26,647
Azra!

175
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:35,406
Around fire we snivel,

176
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:40,926
cry rises, my shadow
shivers, laughter lowers.

177
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:45,206
What is this pet doing 
at this hour?

178
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:49,886
Azra!

179
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:55,887
I love you!
- I'm going!

180
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:05,286
Who are you, politician,
to hang yourself?

181
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:11,287
Come down immediately!
Down, I said!

182
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:23,686
Damn you,
you stupid fool!

183
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:29,687
You'll hang here?
Come down.

184
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,286
Neighbour!

185
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:10,286
Open! It's me,
Zabit Mehmedovski.

186
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:13,886
Come in.
Welcome.

187
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:19,887
Happy Vasilica!
- May God be with you. Good luck.

188
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,766
I've brought you this donkey.

189
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:29,646
I rather not tell where I found it.

190
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:33,726
What are you doing? -I'm crying.

191
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:39,727
Does he cry too?
-He cries.

192
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,406
You see she's sorry too.

193
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:47,046
I'll bring the accordion,
so you'll play for grandma.

194
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:53,047
Fool! If you were my son,
I would kill you this moment!.

195
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:56,806
Here, the accordion. Play.

196
00:19:56,807 --> 00:20:01,886
Play the one that grandma likes.

197
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:04,686
It's absolutely romantic outside.

198
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:10,406
Too bad we're not young,
so we could dance in the park.

199
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:16,407
Why wouldn't you dance with 
such a handsome man?

200
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:31,646
How do you like it?

201
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:37,647
Absolutely romantic!

202
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:35,727
You'll burn me!

203
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:48,566
Grandma, are you sleeping?

204
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:53,646
I'm sleeping. You sleep as well.

205
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,766
Grandma,

206
00:21:55,767 --> 00:22:01,767
sit down by my side.

207
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:07,006
Was my mother beautiful?

208
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:12,446
Like a mountain fairy.

209
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:16,806
When she gave birth to Daca,
her belly stretched.

210
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:19,606
I went to a witch.

211
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:23,606
She said, that she came upon a 
a water devil.

212
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:26,966
She gave her some spells,
but nothing helped.

213
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:32,766
I took her to a hodja.

214
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:36,326
Germany is my homeland.

215
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:42,327
Merdzan,
why didn't your return there?

216
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,686
He said she betrayed the path of the
ancestors.

217
00:22:46,687 --> 00:22:50,166
He read to her from the Koran on his head.

218
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,806
To no purpose.

219
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:54,406
The doctor gave her the medicines
and injections,

220
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,846
but to no avail.

221
00:22:56,847 --> 00:23:00,206
She died in my hands.
She was young.

222
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:05,646
God gave, God took.
What can I do.

223
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:09,446
Daca's father is not my father?

224
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:11,246
No.

225
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:14,046
Your father is a Slovenian.

226
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:17,686
He was here in the army. He promised your mother
heaven on earth,

227
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,486
but then he left.

228
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:22,926
Then I'm an army bastard.
Ruza told the truth.

229
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:28,686
Let her eat shit!
You are grandmas child.

230
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:34,687
Sleep now.

231
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:33,966
Go back, we're not going together today.

232
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:39,967
Sit there and take care of Daca.

233
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:48,047
Are you deaf?

234
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:10,606
Everbody here! Let them see who came!

235
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:15,086
Ahmed Dida, champion.

236
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:18,246
Ahmed, you rich man,
what a car have you got!

237
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:20,966
From distant Italy,
everything shines on it!

238
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:26,967
Hi, Ahmed.
How are you?

239
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:41,527
What a nice dress!
White feather!

240
00:28:44,207 --> 00:28:48,566
Care for a game? -At twelve at the old place.

241
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:53,046
Deal, no problem.

242
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:59,047
I've ran away from a madhouse.
Give me some money.

243
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:21,727
I've come as a man,
to propose your daughter.

244
00:29:23,607 --> 00:29:27,886
Go out. Out.

245
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:31,406
Why do you drag along like a cat?
Get lost at once.

246
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:35,726
I beg you. Even my grandma agreed.

247
00:29:35,727 --> 00:29:38,726
You've come to propose her?

248
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:41,766
I said, I will not give her away.
You have no job.

249
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:44,086
You have no working skills.

250
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:47,886
You should learn to transfer money into banks rather the cans.

251
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,526
Slowly.

252
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:53,326
My daughter is a beauty.
You're not worth her.

253
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:55,726
Get lost!

254
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,486
Do I have to tell you a hundred times?
Get lost!

255
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:01,046
Calm down.
- I won't calm down!

256
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:03,766
Grandma, help.

257
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:05,766
A lot of people are proposing her!

258
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,406
Do you want to tear off my grandson's
head?

259
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,726
What madness has gone into you? -Sit, aunty.

260
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,726
I will.
I want my grandson to ger married.

261
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:17,646
I'll bring the money.
I'll give it to you.

262
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:23,647
Here, look.

263
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:29,046
What can your grandson do?

264
00:30:29,047 --> 00:30:32,086
He can move cans back and forth.

265
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,766
Why can't he transfer money into banks?

266
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,806
And your money doesn't mean
a thing to him.

267
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:44,126
What would he do with it?
My daughter is worth billions.

268
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:47,486
I didn't give her to anyone.

269
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:52,566
Come, Azra. Look at her.
Beauty! All white.

270
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:57,166
You're very proud of her.

271
00:30:57,167 --> 00:31:01,206
Why not?
Look at her.

272
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,966
Take your grandsons hand
and leave.

273
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:09,846
I'll be back. You'll be kissing my
feet. Bitch!

274
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:13,206
Get lost.
This treasure is not for you.

275
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:17,646
I'm a great she-devil.
I'll bring you trouble.

276
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:20,326
You'll be kissing my feet!

277
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:26,327
Get lost!

278
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:34,446
Head up!

279
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:39,046
It's never later for jumping into water
and marrying.

280
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:45,047
So use your head,
grandma's sweetheart.

281
00:31:57,927 --> 00:32:01,406
Did you sell the lime?
- No. It's not going well.

282
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:04,366
When do you intend to return your depth? -Tomorrow.

283
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:10,367
We're leaving tomorrow. Come here.
- Where are we going?

284
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:15,286
Where are we going? -Into the circle.

285
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:21,287
So police doesn't take us by surprise.

286
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:30,567
You can repay everything.
Maybe even earn something.

287
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:41,447
Two cards.

288
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:28,206
Uncle, come home at once!

289
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:34,207
Robert is choking.
He'll die.

290
00:33:54,687 --> 00:34:00,687
Mother, save me!

291
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:06,766
They've fleeced me.
- You've got the receipts there.

292
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:10,046
They're not pregnant women.
I owe money to dangerous people.

293
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:12,766
Do you hear me? I've got into bad company.

294
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,686
Don't chase my dreams away.

295
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:17,686
Give me the money.
They'll scatter my brains all over.

296
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:23,687
I'll show you!

297
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:46,206
Give me the money,

298
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:49,126
for fucks sake!

299
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:52,606
I'll kill you all!
Give me the money, now!

300
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:58,486
For the last time:
money or life!

301
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:04,366
Where should I get it?
Do you want my soul?

302
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,606
You've got the money!
- I don't have it.

303
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:09,726
You're keeping it in your pants.
You keep it for the wedding.

304
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:12,126
I don't have it.
Leave me, you fool!

305
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:14,846
Leave my brother and grandma alone!

306
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,566
Give me the money! I'll kill you all!
Find it!

307
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,166
You've ruined us, you dicer!

308
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:25,167
So you won't give me the money?
Now you'll see.

309
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,766
Damn all you dead and living! Give me the money!

310
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:17,686
I don't have it, fool! From where would i have it?
Don't you see it's raining?

311
00:36:17,687 --> 00:36:20,566
The child won't stop crying.

312
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:26,567
Where should I get the money from?
- I'll show you!

313
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:40,446
I've been born without a father,

314
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:43,686
my mother took care of me.

315
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:49,687
I'll never forget my grandmother.

316
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:56,127
Don't cry, grandma.

317
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:37,286
Will you give me the money?

318
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:42,846
When you find the money,
I'll return the house.

319
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:48,246
Don't cry, mother.

320
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:51,606
You fool, fool.

321
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:57,607
God have mercy on you.

322
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:25,166
Once there was the sky
and earth husband and wife.

323
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:28,566
They had five children:

324
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:32,246
sun, moon,

325
00:38:32,247 --> 00:38:36,606
fire, fog and wing.

326
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:42,607
They built a wonderful city
and settled them there .

327
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:46,806
The bantering sun wanted to separate
the earth from the sky,

328
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:49,446
but it didn't succeed.

329
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:53,926
Others have tried as well,
but with no avail.

330
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:57,566
When wind rushed at them with all its power,

331
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:03,567
the earth separated from the sky.

332
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:08,486
Hatidza! It's a matter of life!

333
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:14,487
Save my child at once!
No matter the price!

334
00:39:56,247 --> 00:40:02,247
Blood is the biggest secret.
Blood and power.

335
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:13,207
Listen. The child's spirit has not
yet been woken.

336
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:27,246
Merdzan, my son! My eyes!
Who did this to you?

337
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:30,246
His brothers.

338
00:40:30,247 --> 00:40:32,326
What did you do, you scoundrels?

339
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:35,606
I treat your child,
and this is how you repay me.

340
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:39,566
Your disgusting!
Get lost, you scoundrel!

341
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:43,886
My sweetheart, mother's sunshine.
They've disgraced us.

342
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:47,086
Is this your gratitude?

343
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:50,126
I haven't the slightest idea,
I swear by my son.

344
00:40:50,127 --> 00:40:52,486
May they all die on me,
if I know anything about it.

345
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:56,766
I'll show them, to the very last one.

346
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:59,206
Here, take as much as you want.

347
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,526
Get lost, you scoundrel.
What will the money do me any good?

348
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,766
Nobody lifted a hand upon Ahmeda Dzida.

349
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:10,767
God proteced you,
for saving my son.

350
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:28,446
My sweetheart,
my life.

351
00:41:28,447 --> 00:41:30,126
Come handsome,
we'll take care of everything..

352
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:32,446
You've slaughtered my turkey.
Now I'll slaughter you.

353
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:35,086
You fools! You're sucking my blood.

354
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:38,086
You'll bury me alive in the grave.
What are you doing?

355
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:41,326
Where should i run from these fools?

356
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:45,766
Go in your bed.
Fuck the turkey!

357
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:51,767
I'll buy you three hundred others.
- This one was mine.

358
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:04,726
I'll buy you three hundred turkeys.

359
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:08,926
Sit down. Calm down.
You're driving my nuts.

360
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,166
Stop it. What are you doing you bastard?

361
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:13,886
You're beating your uncle.
Poor fellow.

362
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,646
When I get you,
i'll brake your neck.

363
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:20,046
I'll brake it like this.

364
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:23,486
I'll kill you, you miserable soul.

365
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:26,886
You'll lose all your teeth!

366
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:31,206
I'll break you into pieces like a pumpkin!

367
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:35,326
If you hit me one more time you bastard,
I'll crush you!

368
00:42:35,327 --> 00:42:41,046
You should be kissing my feet.

369
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:47,047
Where are you going? Sit.

370
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:53,207
I've remembered.

371
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:57,046
Would you like to pay for Robert?

372
00:42:57,047 --> 00:42:59,726
You've said yourself that doctors
couldn't help him.

373
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:03,046
Speak.
- Do you see that girl?

374
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,286
Did you see her leg?

375
00:43:05,287 --> 00:43:08,926
There's a hospital in Ljubljana,
where they extend the bones.

376
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:13,246
You pay for that and we're
even.

377
00:43:13,247 --> 00:43:17,126
When I go to Italy,
I'll leave her in Ljubljana.

378
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,326
I won't leave her alone.
I will go with her.

379
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:22,726
Please do, it's the right thing to do.

380
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:27,926
Relatives help each other.
I'll drive both.

381
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:31,646
Don't cry, Daca.
I'll go with you.

382
00:43:31,647 --> 00:43:34,326
I can't go to a hospital.

383
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:39,006
I am afraid I'll die there.

384
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:41,326
Don't be afraid.

385
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:47,327
Merdzan!
What have you done, you fool?

386
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:52,166
Leave him alone, he's crazy.
Devils have possesed him.

387
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:57,966
Look,
what he's done to the house.

388
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,966
Why are you looking at them?

389
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:05,967
They're good as angels.
They won't present trouble for you.

390
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:11,486
Listen, is this hereditary ?
- The leg? -You're skills.

391
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:14,486
Can anyone from them do something like that?

392
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:17,206
Perhan knows a little bit.
Nothing useful.

393
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:21,366
What's not useful?
- Nothing, doesn't matter. -What?

394
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:25,246
Perhan, show him what you can do.

395
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:29,406
He wants to drive your sister to the hospital so she
will recover.

396
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:35,366
Show him for your sister's sake.
- I can't.

397
00:44:35,367 --> 00:44:39,326
Show him, do you hear me?!
- I can't.

398
00:44:39,327 --> 00:44:45,327
He'll heal your sister.
Show him what you can do.

399
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:33,646
Elvis, Jaser, Rambo!

400
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:37,286
Bring the "documents" instruments.

401
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:39,606
Take care of them
like the pupil of the eye.

402
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:41,326
They're everything I have.

403
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:43,486
Don't worry.
This taxi driver is the best.

404
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,846
He came especially from Brcko.

405
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:49,966
You'll have a leg like
Marilyn Monroe.

406
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:55,967
Neighbours, good luck.
Come back in good health!

407
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:23,286
You should go as well. I'll open you an ambulance
in my van.

408
00:46:23,287 --> 00:46:28,126
I can't, I'm sick.

409
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:34,127
Don't cry, grandma.
She'll come back.

410
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:42,246
If it was fine, I wouldn't cry.

411
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:45,846
I forgot to give you the food for your trip.

412
00:46:45,847 --> 00:46:50,606
Don't cry, Daca.

413
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,926
Everything played out like in dreams.

414
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:58,686
I'm leaving, wait for me.

415
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:02,766
Comply with everything that I inform you through grandma.

416
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:08,686
Love me like your eyes.

417
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:14,687
When I return, you'll live like a minister.

418
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:19,446
My sister and grandma
will live with us. Ok?

419
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:22,966
When you see your uncle,
run to the other side of the quart.

420
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:26,646
Deal? -Yes.

421
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:28,806
Don't cry, Hatiza.

422
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:32,286
From today you need your eyes to take
care of my bride.

423
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:35,606
Make sure, that her feet wont be wondering
more in the sky,

424
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:38,526
then stepping on earth.

425
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:44,527
How can I not cry,
if my soul hurts?

426
00:47:56,567 --> 00:48:01,486
Take care of your sister like the pupil
of the eye.

427
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:07,487
Don't cry.

428
00:49:19,407 --> 00:49:25,407
Irfan!

429
00:50:49,927 --> 00:50:53,206
When the king of wind
fell upon mother,

430
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:56,046
the sky separated from the earth.

431
00:50:56,047 --> 00:50:59,526
The the suns...

432
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:02,846
Don't cry, Daca.

433
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:06,206
I ask you like God.

434
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:10,966
Promise me, that you won't leave
me with them.

435
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:16,967
I'll do everything,
just don't cry. -I've stopped.

436
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:49,767
I see mother.

437
00:52:19,367 --> 00:52:24,046
You see?

438
00:52:24,047 --> 00:52:27,486
Is she beautiful? -Very much.

439
00:52:27,487 --> 00:52:29,766
What does she look like?

440
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:33,646
She's got hair, eyes, nose,

441
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:39,647
lips, everything.

442
00:52:57,287 --> 00:53:03,287
Good day, doctor.
We've talked on the phone.

443
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:09,126
Don't leave me alone,
I beg you.

444
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:11,686
She is afraid. I told her,

445
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:14,126
that she'll have a leg like Marilyn Monroe,

446
00:53:14,127 --> 00:53:16,966
when she's in your hands.

447
00:53:16,967 --> 00:53:22,326
What's your name, little beauty?
- Denira Feric. -Good girl.

448
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:26,286
Don't be afraid, Daca. Comrad Tito
was treated here himself.

449
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,486
Let me look at you.

450
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:31,366
Doctor, I'll stay with her.

451
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:34,886
How can you demand that,
if you're healthy?

452
00:53:34,887 --> 00:53:39,206
You can't do that, Ahmed.

453
00:53:39,207 --> 00:53:42,326
Do you have any documents?
- I'm sorry, you can't go here.

454
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:45,846
Health insurance?

455
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:51,847
You just admit her.
In two days you'll get everything.

456
00:53:55,407 --> 00:53:58,326
How can you demand to stay with
the child?

457
00:53:58,327 --> 00:54:01,446
Who will feed you,
where will you sleep?

458
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:05,846
Aren't you ashamed of taking a
place of a patient?

459
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:07,966
I've promised grandma.

460
00:54:07,967 --> 00:54:13,967
We promised that we'll cure her
leg..

461
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:17,686
Go with me to Italy..

462
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:23,687
You'll work,
you'll be able to build a house.

463
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:28,646
She's got osteomielitis.
She has to be operated.

464
00:54:28,647 --> 00:54:31,966
What is it?
- The operation is expensive.

465
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:37,967
Perhan! Don't leave me
alone, please!

466
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:46,047
Please, don't leave me!

467
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:02,767
Don't leave me alone.

468
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,926
Now you aren't doing well.

469
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:23,927
When you'll earn millions, you'll 
be grateful to me.

470
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:35,966
Where are these babies from?
- I bought them on the way.

471
00:55:35,967 --> 00:55:40,326
Why? So Robert would have
company.

472
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:43,166
It suck nicer, if it's not alone.

473
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:47,126
Grownups prefer breasts for themselves,
children don't.

474
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:50,366
Who sells them in such small size?

475
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:52,566
Those who have to.

476
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:55,846
He has 11 of them.
He found himself a mistress,

477
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:58,806
who gave him these two as a present.

478
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:01,086
She's married too.

479
00:56:01,087 --> 00:56:06,966
To hide her shame,
she gave them to me.

480
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:12,967
Look at him!
He's gifted as his father!

481
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:57,846
Zef, the cowboy film 
has just begun.

482
00:57:57,847 --> 00:58:03,847
Feebles, damn you!

483
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:22,287
Take off your clothes! To the bone!

484
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:58,767
Come in.

485
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:11,687
You're next.
- Go fuck yourself!

486
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:18,967
I'll hit you right in the forehead!

487
01:00:46,047 --> 01:00:50,326
When he comes to you,
say "ottanta".

488
01:00:50,327 --> 01:00:56,327
If he says "cinquanta",
say yes.

489
01:00:57,207 --> 01:01:03,207
Now get lost.

490
01:01:43,727 --> 01:01:46,966
Read! They've imposed on my taxes
for the last six years..

491
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:50,446
Two penalties, three offences
and one sentence.

492
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:54,326
I have to give everything,
or they will evict me.

493
01:01:54,327 --> 01:01:57,486
What do I have to do with this?

494
01:01:57,487 --> 01:02:01,126
Where should I get money from
for your sister? How?

495
01:02:01,127 --> 01:02:04,686
Read it,
if you don't believe me.

496
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:08,526
I'm poor as a church mouse.
Ruined.

497
01:02:08,527 --> 01:02:11,966
They've fried me.

498
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,286
Not to mention the bill
for Roberta and the hospital!

499
01:02:15,287 --> 01:02:19,126
That is yet to come.
Help me a bit!

500
01:02:19,127 --> 01:02:21,366
I'll help,
but in a fair way.

501
01:02:21,367 --> 01:02:27,367
And what fair thing can you do?

502
01:02:39,447 --> 01:02:45,366
One after another,
God may give you luck.

503
01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:51,367
That's it, only fair.

504
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:20,846
Bosnian, come back.

505
01:03:20,847 --> 01:03:26,847
Stand on the chair.

506
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:02,566
Who told you to do this?

507
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:05,406
Shut up!

508
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:09,166
If he doesn't want to work,
he just doesn't have to!

509
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:11,446
He won't heal his sister,

510
01:05:11,447 --> 01:05:14,366
he won't build a house,
he won't get married.

511
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:19,806
Give him the money,
let him be damned.

512
01:05:19,807 --> 01:05:24,926
When you return to Ljubljana,
take your sister.

513
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:27,886
Do you understand?

514
01:05:27,887 --> 01:05:32,126
I feel pity for her.
You live like a dog!

515
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:37,526
In dust nibble the bones.

516
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:43,527
Give him the money for the trip.
Let him pack and go to the station.

517
01:05:53,927 --> 01:05:59,927
Perhan, look.

518
01:08:30,007 --> 01:08:31,846
Dear grandma!

519
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:35,486
I'm alive and healthy. Don't you
worry about me.

520
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,606
I'm in Milano.

521
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:41,246
The beauty and wealth
is breathtaking.

522
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,486
One can cross himself from the astonishment.

523
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:48,526
If you were here, you could not get a wink
from the happiness.

524
01:08:48,527 --> 01:08:51,206
Unlce Ahmed
used to nicely tell you:

525
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:53,646
We could have a 
sack of money.

526
01:08:53,647 --> 01:08:55,566
This isn't important now.

527
01:08:55,567 --> 01:08:58,766
Take care of my Azra,
so she doesn't end like the neighbour,

528
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,966
whose feet wondered 
more in the sky,

529
01:09:00,967 --> 01:09:06,967
then stepped on the earth.

530
01:09:10,807 --> 01:09:12,606
My Hatidza!

531
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:16,166
I have realised here that God,
is not a blind cat.

532
01:09:16,167 --> 01:09:19,046
Ahmed is like a father to me.

533
01:09:19,047 --> 01:09:21,686
He speaks Italian,
barks at the stars.

534
01:09:21,687 --> 01:09:23,486
He has his people everywhere,

535
01:09:23,487 --> 01:09:28,246
lawyers, judges,
priests and cops.

536
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,286
He takes care of me like I was his son.

537
01:09:31,287 --> 01:09:35,326
I will earn a lof of money. I'll 
build a house, just like Ahmed's.

538
01:09:35,327 --> 01:09:37,966
Only I'll build according to
an italian plan.

539
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:41,726
A painter will paint this
picture on the frontage.

540
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:43,846
Don't worry about Danira.

541
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:47,806
I've seen with my own eyes
that the doctor is Ahmed's man.

542
01:09:47,807 --> 01:09:51,286
What should I buy you?
I've bought uncle a TV.

543
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,566
He can put it in his pocket,
let the whole world stand openmouthed.

544
01:09:54,567 --> 01:10:00,567
Latest technological advancement.

545
01:10:03,127 --> 01:10:06,126
I won't spare with the money
for the wedding.

546
01:10:06,127 --> 01:10:10,646
Let the old and the young remember
Perhan's wedding.

547
01:10:10,647 --> 01:10:16,647
Yours, Perhan.

548
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:35,926
Where is Irfan?

549
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:41,927
Where is Irfan, you nitwit?
- I don't know.

550
01:10:50,487 --> 01:10:54,726
Irfan's not here. -What do you mean?

551
01:10:54,727 --> 01:10:58,126
Why didn't you pay attention?

552
01:10:58,127 --> 01:11:01,886
Don't appear before my eyes
without him!

553
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:05,766
Out! Don't come
without him.

554
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:11,767
Where should I look for him?
- Be off with you! Your problem!

555
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:50,606
That's nothing.

556
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:56,607
Tears? Oh my, mommy,
that's not good.

557
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,966
What's missing in 
your full house?

558
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:05,967
Tell me please,
what!

559
01:12:09,087 --> 01:12:14,726
Take the white coffee,
white bread, white cheese.

560
01:12:14,727 --> 01:12:20,727
Take the marmelade,
bird's milk. Everything that I have.

561
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:28,527
You want a leave, to go on sick leave?
What do you want first?

562
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:33,686
Shame on you, son. /

563
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:36,446
Is this thank you? /

564
01:12:36,447 --> 01:12:41,166
I'm crazy and naive because I
trust people.

565
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:47,167
Remember -
without work there is no happiness.

566
01:12:55,207 --> 01:12:58,406
What did you do? You've turned
my life into manure!

567
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,766
Who's the boss here?

568
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:03,806
Who gives the orders here?

569
01:13:03,807 --> 01:13:09,807
Damn your spoilt blood!
Who's the boss?!

570
01:14:19,967 --> 01:14:24,806
What is up with you, Ahmed?

571
01:14:24,807 --> 01:14:28,446
Give me the tablets for pressure.

572
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:32,486
Give me the tablets!

573
01:14:32,487 --> 01:14:38,487
Who is your husband - him
or me, you Gypsy bitch?!

574
01:17:30,407 --> 01:17:32,926
Come, come.

575
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:36,806
I've come to tell you,
what your grandma is telling you .

576
01:17:36,807 --> 01:17:42,086
If you don't come immediately,
the silverteeth will eat you .

577
01:17:42,087 --> 01:17:46,486
Woman with the silver teeth is the
wolf's victim.

578
01:17:46,487 --> 01:17:52,487
Woman with the silver teeth is the
wolf's victim...

579
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:49,246
Quick, get up! Go!

580
01:18:49,247 --> 01:18:53,486
Why are you hesitating?

581
01:18:53,487 --> 01:18:56,886
Everybody out!
Everybody to the police!

582
01:18:56,887 --> 01:19:02,887
Let's go!

583
01:19:34,487 --> 01:19:37,006
All to the police!

584
01:19:37,007 --> 01:19:43,007
They will take your passport.
He says not to move from here.

585
01:20:06,687 --> 01:20:10,566
That is good, it cures.

586
01:20:10,567 --> 01:20:16,567
You are my brother.

587
01:20:37,687 --> 01:20:40,846
Are you sending money
for my sister's health treatment?

588
01:20:40,847 --> 01:20:44,446
Every first in the month.

589
01:20:44,447 --> 01:20:47,646
For the house too.
The foundation has already been laid.

590
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:51,486
Now they're building walls.

591
01:20:51,487 --> 01:20:57,487
I only have you and Robert left.

592
01:21:13,807 --> 01:21:19,807
Dzamila.

593
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:35,927
Everyone come here!

594
01:21:37,327 --> 01:21:40,286
From today on Perhan is
the parade commander.

595
01:21:40,287 --> 01:21:46,287
Obey him more then Zef
or Sadama. Is that clear?

596
01:24:05,327 --> 01:24:09,966
Young man!

597
01:24:09,967 --> 01:24:14,326
Are you looking for someone?

598
01:24:14,327 --> 01:24:17,326
They are now mine.
Do you know that?

599
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:23,327
Look.

600
01:24:27,807 --> 01:24:34,280
Tell the big boss,
that Sadam is not crazy,

601
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:40,487
to rot in jail because
of him.

602
01:24:40,767 --> 01:24:44,606
You know, I put the guilt
on Zef. And he,

603
01:24:44,607 --> 01:24:47,726
as it befits for the younger
brother,

604
01:24:47,727 --> 01:24:53,727
took all the blame on himself.

605
01:24:54,527 --> 01:25:00,527
Ciao, handsoome.

606
01:25:11,927 --> 01:25:17,646
Fuck that luck.

607
01:25:17,647 --> 01:25:22,126
Buy ones like these.
For the business.

608
01:25:22,127 --> 01:25:24,686
Some baby.

609
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:29,686
And some pregnant woman.
It's easier to get across the border.

610
01:25:29,687 --> 01:25:32,526
My God, look.
An entirely different person.

611
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:36,846
Something of each if it's possible.
That's the best.

612
01:25:36,847 --> 01:25:39,206
May God bless you,
I'm counting on you.

613
01:25:39,207 --> 01:25:42,286
Where is that house of mine,
that is being built?

614
01:25:42,287 --> 01:25:44,526
I would like to see the construction.

615
01:25:44,527 --> 01:25:47,486
House? Next to mine.

616
01:25:47,487 --> 01:25:50,526
Where else would it be?
Are we brothers or not?

617
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:54,326
But you musn't go to our place.
- Why not?

618
01:25:54,327 --> 01:26:00,327
That's what the lawyer said,
that acuired the passport for you.

619
01:26:02,087 --> 01:26:04,246
There's a big confusion.

620
01:26:04,247 --> 01:26:07,046
It's being reported in newspapers,
on radio, TV.

621
01:26:07,047 --> 01:26:11,086
They've made a movie about people,
that sell children abroad.

622
01:26:11,087 --> 01:26:13,686
Don't go there, please.

623
01:26:13,687 --> 01:26:17,486
Go to the ferryboat Bari-Bar,
and then to Monte Negro and Bosnia.

624
01:26:17,487 --> 01:26:20,526
I wanted to see grandma
and Azra,

625
01:26:20,527 --> 01:26:22,446
to visit my sister in Ljubljana.

626
01:26:22,447 --> 01:26:25,006
No, by no means, please.

627
01:26:25,007 --> 01:26:31,007
Only to the south. He're the address of
a man from Tuzla.

628
01:26:35,327 --> 01:26:38,286
Find a wife for me.

629
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:42,326
I'll sen Dzamila away.
Rate her as you would rate her for yourself.

630
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:48,327
Go, good luck.

631
01:28:22,847 --> 01:28:25,086
Come here!

632
01:28:25,087 --> 01:28:27,326
I'm not guilty,
I don't know anything.

633
01:28:27,327 --> 01:28:31,166
May I get blind if i know anything.
I don't know anything.

634
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:34,246
I've come as it befits.

635
01:28:34,247 --> 01:28:37,606
Oh my. Billions!

636
01:28:37,607 --> 01:28:42,046
I don't have to kiss hands.
- Is this for me?

637
01:28:42,047 --> 01:28:44,926
Look at him the big businessman.

638
01:28:44,927 --> 01:28:48,846
How did you earn that much money?

639
01:28:48,847 --> 01:28:54,847
He came so he would trick my daughter
with the money.

640
01:28:54,847 --> 01:28:57,766
Look!

641
01:28:57,767 --> 01:29:03,767
Did she get married? -No.

642
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:10,726
What can I do.
Woman like woman.

643
01:29:10,727 --> 01:29:13,286
She did what she decided.

644
01:29:13,287 --> 01:29:16,766
I don't know how to deal with her.

645
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:20,446
I wonder myself.
What should I do with her?

646
01:29:20,447 --> 01:29:24,086
I don't know myself!

647
01:29:24,087 --> 01:29:26,286
And the child she bears?

648
01:29:26,287 --> 01:29:32,287
It's supposably yours.

649
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:41,287
What do you think?
- Ask your uncle.

650
01:29:44,487 --> 01:29:50,487
God, what are you doing to me?

651
01:29:56,127 --> 01:30:00,406
A black train has come mother.

652
01:30:00,407 --> 01:30:04,326
It has come, mother,

653
01:30:04,327 --> 01:30:10,327
a black morning.

654
01:30:40,407 --> 01:30:42,726
Neighbour, there is no sense
in drinking that much.

655
01:30:42,727 --> 01:30:46,286
I also drank brandy,
but it doesn't help.

656
01:30:46,287 --> 01:30:52,287
Look, the drink has changed you
into a woman.

657
01:32:05,207 --> 01:32:08,886
Like you aren't happy,
to see me.

658
01:32:08,887 --> 01:32:11,366
Grandma loves you.

659
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:17,367
What are you doing to your head?

660
01:32:24,287 --> 01:32:30,287
Come, don't be afraid.
You've come with me.

661
01:32:35,127 --> 01:32:37,646
What lays on your heart, grandma?

662
01:32:37,647 --> 01:32:41,046
Mine is fine.
What's with yours?

663
01:32:41,047 --> 01:32:43,806
Where did you leave your sister?

664
01:32:43,807 --> 01:32:47,966
In Ljubljana. She should
return back soon.

665
01:32:47,967 --> 01:32:52,086
Bring me a glass of brandy.

666
01:32:52,087 --> 01:32:58,087
You take the chair and sit down.

667
01:33:04,327 --> 01:33:07,326
Why does your wife cry?

668
01:33:07,327 --> 01:33:11,246
The bitch has to let out water,
and she releases it through her eyes.

669
01:33:11,247 --> 01:33:14,446
Why do you trust your mother-in-law
more then your wife?

670
01:33:14,447 --> 01:33:16,926
Since I've got myself lying,

671
01:33:16,927 --> 01:33:19,926
I don't trust noone anymore.

672
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:23,406
If you don't trust at all,
God will abandon you.

673
01:33:23,407 --> 01:33:29,407
Where did you get this?
Where did you get these clothes?

674
01:33:31,527 --> 01:33:34,886
I've earned it with these
ten fingers.

675
01:33:34,887 --> 01:33:37,206
I will build a house
with them as well.

676
01:33:37,207 --> 01:33:40,886
Who will live in this house?

677
01:33:40,887 --> 01:33:46,887
You and me, grandma.

678
01:33:46,967 --> 01:33:51,206
I will not live in this house.
My spirit doesn't want to.

679
01:33:51,207 --> 01:33:54,046
God forbid,
that you would live in this house.

680
01:33:54,047 --> 01:33:56,566
Don't speak like that.

681
01:33:56,567 --> 01:33:58,886
What have you become.

682
01:33:58,887 --> 01:34:02,886
You were honest once.
Now you changed for the worse.

683
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:06,526
What am I like, grandma?

684
01:34:06,527 --> 01:34:09,126
You've broken my heart.

685
01:34:09,127 --> 01:34:15,127
You've spoilt entirely.

686
01:34:21,647 --> 01:34:25,606
Let me tell you something son.
All this is a fata morgana.

687
01:34:25,607 --> 01:34:27,766
You gave me money.

688
01:34:27,767 --> 01:34:31,326
I may die tomorrow.
Who will return you?

689
01:34:31,327 --> 01:34:37,327
Take the money back.

690
01:34:45,447 --> 01:34:48,886
You've burnt your hand!
You know how that hurts.

691
01:34:48,887 --> 01:34:54,887
You're doing yourself evil things.

692
01:35:07,967 --> 01:35:11,166
Stop playing!
You're playing madness.

693
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:14,366
You'll kill a man.
Back!

694
01:35:14,367 --> 01:35:20,367
Perhan, wait for me.

695
01:35:21,687 --> 01:35:26,046
Neighbour, you're blind drunk!

696
01:35:26,047 --> 01:35:29,086
What are you looking at?
Get in!

697
01:35:29,087 --> 01:35:35,087
My neighbour is my concern.

698
01:36:23,647 --> 01:36:29,647
Chandelier!

699
01:36:30,007 --> 01:36:36,007
Scales!

700
01:36:36,407 --> 01:36:41,766
Cooker!

701
01:36:41,767 --> 01:36:47,767
This present is from a wedding witness.
Let's see what's inside.

702
01:36:48,327 --> 01:36:54,327
A bit of silence, please.

703
01:36:57,967 --> 01:37:03,967
Bread!
Money! Gold!

704
01:37:05,247 --> 01:37:09,606
A limuosine is coming.

705
01:37:09,607 --> 01:37:12,766
The chauffeur
is opening the door.

706
01:37:12,767 --> 01:37:17,686
The bride is stepping out.

707
01:37:17,687 --> 01:37:21,726
The groom is carrying her in his arms.

708
01:37:21,727 --> 01:37:26,206
Mother-in-law is offering the daughter-in-law
bread and sugar,

709
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:30,566
so she would have a sweet life.

710
01:37:30,567 --> 01:37:32,966
Be happy.

711
01:37:32,967 --> 01:37:36,886
The groom kisses the bride.

712
01:37:36,887 --> 01:37:41,286
Mother-in-law leads daughter-in-law into the house.

713
01:37:41,287 --> 01:37:44,966
The groom is being beaten to obtain 
power.

714
01:37:44,967 --> 01:37:50,967
He'll need it.

715
01:38:40,807 --> 01:38:45,686
Grandma and her grandson will 
now dance.

716
01:38:45,687 --> 01:38:48,126
How beautiful he is,
how elegant,

717
01:38:48,127 --> 01:38:54,127
wise, civilized and
pedantic!

718
01:38:54,287 --> 01:39:00,287
Grandma's grandson.
My living monument.

719
01:39:08,087 --> 01:39:14,087
Get up, come with me.

720
01:39:15,047 --> 01:39:18,406
You and Ruza
must help me.

721
01:39:18,407 --> 01:39:21,406
Find some cripples to go
begging

722
01:39:21,407 --> 01:39:25,046
and a pregnant woman with the same fate,
as mine has.

723
01:39:25,047 --> 01:39:29,646
Here's your advance.

724
01:39:29,647 --> 01:39:32,326
We'll find some cripples.

725
01:39:32,327 --> 01:39:36,846
And how do you intend to sell your own
child?

726
01:39:36,847 --> 01:39:39,646
You will meet with a terrible accident.

727
01:39:39,647 --> 01:39:42,326
First, the child is not mine.

728
01:39:42,327 --> 01:39:46,086
I will bring up no bastard.
And second, I won't repeat.

729
01:39:46,087 --> 01:39:50,766
Only under these conditions
will I marry her.

730
01:39:50,767 --> 01:39:56,767
Go out so they won't see us.

731
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:30,366
Are you building another house
here?

732
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:36,367
If we built it you would see it.
A house is not a needle.

733
01:41:12,207 --> 01:41:16,046
If there is a God,
the kids will go into the world,

734
01:41:16,047 --> 01:41:21,046
to work and earn money.
They just musn't disgrace themselves.

735
01:41:21,047 --> 01:41:24,486
Let them build a house
like other people,

736
01:41:24,487 --> 01:41:27,646
with their own labor
by the sweat of their face.

737
01:41:27,647 --> 01:41:29,806
I am already old.
I can't work anymore.

738
01:41:29,807 --> 01:41:35,807
Why not?
They're still young.

739
01:41:38,087 --> 01:41:40,686
You know we burn lime.

740
01:41:40,687 --> 01:41:45,086
Merdzan doesn't want to work.

741
01:41:45,087 --> 01:41:48,846
May I come to you?

742
01:41:48,847 --> 01:41:52,926
Not even dead.

743
01:41:52,927 --> 01:41:56,646
Did you understand?

744
01:41:56,647 --> 01:42:01,726
I can hardly wait that Perhan, my 
sweetheart, returns.

745
01:42:01,727 --> 01:42:04,206
I can hardly wait that he gets
a child.

746
01:42:04,207 --> 01:42:06,686
So that this wish of mine
turns true as well.

747
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:09,206
Do with me whatever you want.
But why?

748
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:11,206
You know well why.

749
01:42:11,207 --> 01:42:16,686
Don't foist me a magpie instead of
a gosling.

750
01:42:16,687 --> 01:42:21,286
This child is diligent,
obedient, qualified.

751
01:42:21,287 --> 01:42:23,886
I'm sorry for speaking about this.

752
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:29,846
Something is pressing me in my soul,
so words are like a cure.

753
01:42:29,847 --> 01:42:32,366
My son comes at midnight,
the house is for him like an inn.

754
01:42:32,367 --> 01:42:35,166
He eats and goes to the whores.

755
01:42:35,167 --> 01:42:38,046
I don't know what's wrong with him.

756
01:42:38,047 --> 01:42:41,766
My golden one, Perhan,
is the best person in this world.

757
01:42:41,767 --> 01:42:45,646
He's not like my son, bastard.

758
01:42:45,647 --> 01:42:49,246
If you knew what kind of daughter I 
had.

759
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:52,966
His mother was a beauty.

760
01:42:52,967 --> 01:42:57,326
He looks just like her.

761
01:42:57,327 --> 01:43:01,406
She died young.
I fell ill because of her.

762
01:43:01,407 --> 01:43:07,407
What should I tell you?

763
01:45:45,647 --> 01:45:48,326
Are you alive? -I'm alive.

764
01:45:48,327 --> 01:45:54,327
Here, eat.

765
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:42,206
Perhan, you must believe me.

766
01:46:42,207 --> 01:46:44,606
The child is ours.

767
01:46:44,607 --> 01:46:47,806
Merdzan assaulted me
when I was three months pregnant.

768
01:46:47,807 --> 01:46:50,326
Don't lie.
Shut up, don't lie.

769
01:46:50,327 --> 01:46:53,046
I'm not lying. -I don't want to 
bring up a bastard!

770
01:46:53,047 --> 01:46:59,047
I will sell him. Then will make our
own child.

771
01:47:14,207 --> 01:47:19,486
Give me your hand.

772
01:47:19,487 --> 01:47:25,487
This one is ours too. Believe yourself,
if you don't believe me.

773
01:47:25,887 --> 01:47:29,726
I concieved when we slept together on
St. George's Day.

774
01:47:29,727 --> 01:47:31,806
I've calculated everything.

775
01:47:31,807 --> 01:47:35,286
I swear by my life.
I know he's a bastard.

776
01:47:35,287 --> 01:47:38,566
We'll make our own.
I said what I said.

777
01:47:38,567 --> 01:47:41,486
Why? This one is ours too.

778
01:47:41,487 --> 01:47:47,487
Wait.

779
01:47:59,207 --> 01:48:04,566
Something in me has
turned upside down.

780
01:48:04,567 --> 01:48:08,006
I dreamt that you gave birth to
a white bird.

781
01:48:08,007 --> 01:48:12,766
When I came near.

782
01:48:12,767 --> 01:48:18,767
Wait.

783
01:48:26,567 --> 01:48:29,326
What do you want?

784
01:48:29,327 --> 01:48:31,366
You've done everything well.

785
01:48:31,367 --> 01:48:37,367
But where is a wife for me?

786
01:48:37,527 --> 01:48:40,126
Couldn't you find her?

787
01:48:40,127 --> 01:48:42,526
Where is my house?

788
01:48:42,527 --> 01:48:45,806
Why did you lie about building
a house for me?

789
01:48:45,807 --> 01:48:48,566
Were you at home?

790
01:48:48,567 --> 01:48:52,886
From where would I bring my wife 
then?

791
01:48:52,887 --> 01:48:56,406
I thought.
- What did you think?

792
01:48:56,407 --> 01:48:59,766
That you picked up one on the way.
What do i know.

793
01:48:59,767 --> 01:49:04,726
You know, Ahmed.
You know everything.

794
01:49:04,727 --> 01:49:10,727
Why did you lie to me?
- Sadam lied to me!

795
01:49:12,327 --> 01:49:15,206
I gave him the money for
your house.

796
01:49:15,207 --> 01:49:18,006
He put it into his own pocket.

797
01:49:18,007 --> 01:49:22,326
He came yesterday to laugh in
my face.

798
01:49:22,327 --> 01:49:25,606
I'm sorry, I'm not responsible for
your house.

799
01:49:25,607 --> 01:49:30,566
I swear by my child.

800
01:49:30,567 --> 01:49:34,046
Believe me. If you don't want to,
go. Leave me alone.

801
01:49:34,047 --> 01:49:40,047
May I die.

802
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:10,406
I will give you half of
my house.

803
01:50:10,407 --> 01:50:12,926
Here are the papers.

804
01:50:12,927 --> 01:50:17,966
I will call the lawyer tomorrow
so they will certify it in court.

805
01:50:17,967 --> 01:50:22,486
I may not be much long.

806
01:50:22,487 --> 01:50:27,646
And Robert?

807
01:50:27,647 --> 01:50:32,646
I loved him more then life. And now?

808
01:50:32,647 --> 01:50:34,406
I don't know.

809
01:50:34,407 --> 01:50:38,126
I obsere him every day and 
everything seems suspicious to me.

810
01:50:38,127 --> 01:50:42,526
The eyes, the nose, hands.

811
01:50:42,527 --> 01:50:48,527
He doesn't look like me in any way.

812
01:50:56,487 --> 01:51:02,487
We're brothers in that way as well -
the wives cheated on us both.

813
01:53:29,007 --> 01:53:35,007
Boy!

814
01:53:44,167 --> 01:53:47,726
Look, Perhan!
A boy!

815
01:53:47,727 --> 01:53:53,727
Let us not bewitch him.

816
01:54:08,647 --> 01:54:14,647
Azra!

817
01:54:29,927 --> 01:54:36,400
No, Azra. I ask you like God,
don't leave me!

818
01:54:37,967 --> 01:54:43,967
I love you! Azra!

819
01:55:14,327 --> 01:55:18,766
God is nevertheless
a blind cat.

820
01:55:18,767 --> 01:55:22,006
He looked at me while I was hiding 
treasure in the canal.

821
01:55:22,007 --> 01:55:24,406
He tied my sould with a rope
and let

822
01:55:24,407 --> 01:55:27,606
the flood wash away
the gold and money.

823
01:55:27,607 --> 01:55:29,806
First he gave me
wealth,

824
01:55:29,807 --> 01:55:34,046
in the end with the treasure
he took my soul as well.

825
01:55:34,047 --> 01:55:36,686
I had so much gold,
dear Hatidza,

826
01:55:36,687 --> 01:55:39,326
that I could build a house out
of gold coins.

827
01:55:39,327 --> 01:55:42,406
and cover the roof with them.

828
01:55:42,407 --> 01:55:45,846
We could build a big house,

829
01:55:45,847 --> 01:55:50,126
we could touch the moon from
its roof.

830
01:55:50,127 --> 01:55:54,286
A cruel fate has come upon me.

831
01:55:54,287 --> 01:55:57,846
The more I rack my brain about
where it came from,

832
01:55:57,847 --> 01:56:00,926
the bigger is the earthquake
in my head

833
01:56:00,927 --> 01:56:04,366
and the more I go away from
the truth.

834
01:56:04,367 --> 01:56:07,246
Maybe you have also put a spell
on me, grandma Tidza

835
01:56:07,247 --> 01:56:09,926
when I told you that I don't
trust anyone anymore,

836
01:56:09,927 --> 01:56:12,646
when I caught myself lying.

837
01:56:12,647 --> 01:56:15,566
You told me then:

838
01:56:15,567 --> 01:56:18,566
If you don't trust at all,
God will abandon you.

839
01:56:18,567 --> 01:56:22,406
You won't be good nor to God
nor to people.

840
01:56:22,407 --> 01:56:25,086
You know, I am not like that
good to people,

841
01:56:25,087 --> 01:56:27,926
but i was deceived by a man,

842
01:56:27,927 --> 01:56:32,486
whom I trusted more then God.

843
01:56:32,487 --> 01:56:36,446
Ahmed was both God and father
for me.

844
01:56:36,447 --> 01:56:40,526
I wrote to you that Daca
stayed at the hospital.

845
01:56:40,527 --> 01:56:44,046
Even your own eyes
can decieve yourself.

846
01:56:44,047 --> 01:56:48,326
If I could, I would
put out my eyes and get blind.

847
01:56:48,327 --> 01:56:50,766
Only later I have realised,

848
01:56:50,767 --> 01:56:56,767
what a trap Ahmed set me up.

849
01:57:00,887 --> 01:57:03,486
Where is he?
- He ran away. -Where?

850
01:57:03,487 --> 01:57:06,326
Who knows. He drove me away
and found himself another woman.

851
01:57:06,327 --> 01:57:08,606
Dzamila, talk, if you know.

852
01:57:08,607 --> 01:57:14,607
He has reconciled with his brothers.
They united the slaves and disappeared.

853
01:57:15,607 --> 01:57:19,046
Did you take my sister from
Ljubljana?

854
01:57:19,047 --> 01:57:21,486
Where? Speak, I'll kill you!

855
01:57:21,487 --> 01:57:27,246
Leave him alone, you fool!

856
01:57:27,247 --> 01:57:31,126
To Rome.

857
01:57:31,127 --> 01:57:37,127
May God give you luck.
Help the poor girl.

858
01:57:53,327 --> 01:57:57,806
Did you see this girl?
- No, I don't know her.

859
01:57:57,807 --> 01:57:59,486
Fuck you!

860
01:57:59,487 --> 01:58:02,406
Fuck you, asshole!

861
01:58:02,407 --> 01:58:05,566
You said I shouldn't return
home without Danira.

862
01:58:05,567 --> 01:58:07,766
I travelled the whole world from end
to end.

863
01:58:07,767 --> 01:58:10,046
Ahmed as though as he would turn
into a mole,

864
01:58:10,047 --> 01:58:12,286
and Danira is nowhere to be seen.

865
01:58:12,287 --> 01:58:14,726
I've been looking for Ahmed for 
three years.

866
01:58:14,727 --> 01:58:17,966
I'd like to live 300 years,
just to find him

867
01:58:17,967 --> 01:58:20,326
and pull out his heart.

868
01:58:20,327 --> 01:58:22,206
I've been searching for her for
days.

869
01:58:22,207 --> 01:58:24,326
This has made me turn into wind,

870
01:58:24,327 --> 01:58:26,566
my dreams have evaporated like dust.

871
01:58:26,567 --> 01:58:28,806
I can't dream anymore.

872
01:58:28,807 --> 01:58:31,046
A gypsy without dreams is like
a church without a roof,

873
01:58:31,047 --> 01:58:37,047
like a textbook without letters.
Yours, Perhan.

874
01:59:42,207 --> 01:59:48,207
Danira!

875
01:59:58,047 --> 02:00:04,047
Perhan!

876
02:00:19,047 --> 02:00:23,046
Brother!

877
02:00:23,047 --> 02:00:24,966
God!

878
02:00:24,967 --> 02:00:30,967
As long as I have found you!

879
02:00:42,807 --> 02:00:46,046
And your leg? Does it hurt?

880
02:00:46,047 --> 02:00:52,047
Same.

881
02:00:52,047 --> 02:00:58,047
Oh my.

882
02:01:01,167 --> 02:01:04,566
You know what happened? -What?

883
02:01:04,567 --> 02:01:07,926
He said that the hospitals in Italy
are better.

884
02:01:07,927 --> 02:01:10,526
That they will admit us here .

885
02:01:10,527 --> 02:01:13,046
That you and I will be together.

886
02:01:13,047 --> 02:01:18,126
Since then I have been begging.
He have travlled over 101 cities.

887
02:01:18,127 --> 02:01:22,086
Today he's getting married.
- Ahmed? -Yes.

888
02:01:22,087 --> 02:01:28,087
And you have a son.

889
02:01:28,927 --> 02:01:31,846
He's just like you.

890
02:01:31,847 --> 02:01:37,847
They're waiting that he grows up,
so they can sell him.

891
02:01:49,847 --> 02:01:55,847
Perhan!

892
02:02:10,247 --> 02:02:16,247
What is it?

893
02:02:46,927 --> 02:02:50,286
What's your name?
- Perhan. And yours?

894
02:02:50,287 --> 02:02:52,046
Perhan.

895
02:02:52,047 --> 02:02:58,047
Don't lie! Why are you lying?

896
02:02:58,207 --> 02:03:04,207
Hurry up, please.
Go, they will see us..

897
02:03:15,207 --> 02:03:21,207
This is your father.
Give him your hand.

898
02:03:25,487 --> 02:03:27,886
Wait for me here.
I'll be right back.

899
02:03:27,887 --> 02:03:30,006
Don't go anywhere,
please.

900
02:03:30,007 --> 02:03:33,046
I must buy a gift for
grandma.

901
02:03:33,047 --> 02:03:36,486
Come back soon. Buy her a dishwashing
sponge.

902
02:03:36,487 --> 02:03:39,246
Don't forget about my accordion.
- Don't worry.

903
02:03:39,247 --> 02:03:42,006
If I'm late, I will catch up
with you on the next stattion.

904
02:03:42,007 --> 02:03:48,007
Take it.

905
02:03:50,327 --> 02:03:55,126
What's wrong?
- I'm sad.

906
02:03:55,127 --> 02:04:01,127
Don't be. Let' wave to him.

907
02:04:02,447 --> 02:04:06,766
Daddy!

908
02:04:06,767 --> 02:04:12,767
Perhan, stop!

909
02:04:14,007 --> 02:04:18,206
I am angry with you. -Why?

910
02:04:18,207 --> 02:04:23,166
You won't return,
you won't buy me an accordion

911
02:04:23,167 --> 02:04:28,566
Let me be damned,
If I don't return.

912
02:04:28,567 --> 02:04:33,326
Go now.

913
02:04:33,327 --> 02:04:39,327
Go.

914
02:05:29,487 --> 02:05:32,686
Irfan!

915
02:05:32,687 --> 02:05:38,687
Is it you, Perhan?

916
02:05:40,287 --> 02:05:44,006
Help me. -Don't worry.

917
02:05:44,007 --> 02:05:49,526
What cigarettes do you smoke?

918
02:05:49,527 --> 02:05:55,527
Good cigarettes!

919
02:05:55,767 --> 02:06:01,767
Cover my back.
- Don't' you worry.

920
02:06:37,407 --> 02:06:42,526
Ahmed, good luck!

921
02:06:42,527 --> 02:06:48,527
Dance, Ahmed!

922
02:07:32,847 --> 02:07:38,006
Where are you, birdie?
Look at him, Ahmed.

923
02:07:38,007 --> 02:07:41,406
Where are you, Perhan,
my child?

924
02:07:41,407 --> 02:07:44,446
I've come to you.
I'll serve you till I die.

925
02:07:44,447 --> 02:07:47,006
You are my father.
You and God.

926
02:07:47,007 --> 02:07:49,686
Accept me or kill me.

927
02:07:49,687 --> 02:07:52,006
Why would I kill you, you poor fellow?

928
02:07:52,007 --> 02:07:55,446
Kill me, sinful thoughts have come
to my mind.

929
02:07:55,447 --> 02:07:58,926
Give him food to eat.
Look how thin he is.

930
02:07:58,927 --> 02:08:04,927
Who is this?
- Some fool, a poor man.

931
02:09:01,727 --> 02:09:07,727
Eat the cake!

932
02:09:24,327 --> 02:09:30,327
Die in shit!

933
02:10:40,287 --> 02:10:43,126
Hurry up.

934
02:10:43,127 --> 02:10:49,127
Quick, to the bridge.

935
02:10:52,927 --> 02:10:58,927
I will kill you
for preventing my marriage!

936
02:11:32,927 --> 02:11:38,927
Run.

937
02:11:44,687 --> 02:11:48,446
You've ruined my youth,
and I'll destroy your head.

938
02:11:48,447 --> 02:11:51,886
Let it be, what shall be.

939
02:11:51,887 --> 02:11:57,887
I will catch up with you,
even if you were a bird.

940
02:12:02,167 --> 02:12:08,167
For fuck sake!

941
02:15:45,487 --> 02:15:49,766
Oh, God!

942
02:15:49,767 --> 02:15:55,767
God, what have you done?

943
02:16:02,247 --> 02:16:08,247
You have turned as though
the whole world has turned.

944
02:16:09,247 --> 02:16:15,247
Merdzan will lift you up again,
but you must help me.

945
02:16:16,127 --> 02:16:22,127
If you can't,
I'll lift you up myself.

946
02:16:28,407 --> 02:16:31,886
Did you see Perhan?
Why?

947
02:16:31,887 --> 02:16:35,806
He left you without a father
and mother,

948
02:16:35,807 --> 02:16:41,126
but he washed your feet.

02:16:41,127 --> 02:16:47,127
He didn't know how to call you.
You let him among the wolves.

950
02:16:48,047 --> 02:16:54,236
Lead him where you think 
is the best place in that world.

951
02:17:02,927 --> 02:17:05,726
Do you see these two dices?

952
02:17:05,727 --> 02:17:08,326
Let them fall,

953
02:17:08,327 --> 02:17:12,366
for once let them fall,
as I wish.

954
02:17:12,367 --> 02:17:16,206
My wish would come true.

955
02:17:16,207 --> 02:17:21,486
And may I not be Merdzan anymore,
if I don't fulfill your wish.

956
02:17:21,487 --> 02:17:27,487
And throw the dices like they should be.

957
02:17:31,487 --> 02:17:36,046
