00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,400
Resynched by ShooCat

2
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Shit!

3
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,200
Come on.

4
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
Hey, Marvin,
what are you doin'?

5
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,800
He's mine, Jack. Get lost.
- Fuck you.

6
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
He's mine. Eddie assigned him to me.
What are you doing?

7
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,600
Straighten it out with Eddie.
I'll collect the money.

8
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,400
I almost got killed. He shot at me.
- Back off!

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm taking him.
This guy's worth 1.200.

10
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,200
What the hell we fightin' for?
We're friends.

11
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,000
Nothing personal, but fuck off.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,100
Take it easy. Jesus!
Marvin, watch out!

13
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
What the fuck's goin' on?
You guys ain't cops.

14
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,600
No, we're ballet dancers.

15
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,400
Your mother teach you how to react
to strangers?

16
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,600
Not shoot at 'em?

17
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Hey, Marvin, thanks for the car.

18
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,800
You sleep, and I'll bring it back
a little later.

19
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,600
Got a delivery for you, Gooch.

20
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,400
Good. The soda machine's been out
for a week and a half.

21
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,400
Check that for me.

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,500
What've we got here?

23
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,200
All right.
Give you any trouble?

24
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Did you give me any trouble?

25
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,000
Fuck you, man!
- He didn't give me trouble.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you want your arms, walk.
- Fuck you, too!

27
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
Slap it.

28
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,800
Mascone's Bail Bonds.

29
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,300
No, it's cash only.
No checks, no cards.

30
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,300
I'm sorry, ma'am.
That's the policy.

31
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,300
I wish I could help you out.
Sorry.

32
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,900
Just dropped off Bouchet.
Is Eddie in?

33
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
So you finally
caught someone, Jack.

34
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,800
Jerry, is he in?

35
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
That's terrific.

36
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,500
Been tryin' to reach you.
What do you got for me?

37
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
You were tryin' to reach me?
Bouchet.

38
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,300
Bouchet. Good score, Jack.
Nine-hundred, right?

39
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,300
No, it's 1.200.
- No, nine.

40
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,200
That's 1.200. Come on.

41
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
No. Yeah, you're right.

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,900
My stomach's killin' me.
I'm goin' to Chin Loo's for breakfast.

43
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,800
I wanna talk to you.
- About what?

44
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,600
I'll talk to you over there.
- Could I have my money first?

45
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,500
Of course.
You think I'm gonna try to stiff you?

46
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,400
You? Never! He would never
try and stiff me.

47
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,300
Do I detect sarcasm?
- Never.

48
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,200
Where have I inherited
this reputation?

49
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,100
I have never done business
with anybody...

50
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,000
and Jerry is my witness,
that I have ever, ever, ever

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Has that phone ever rang
with a complaint about me?

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,700
Never. So let's go.
I'll buy you some breakfast.

53
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,800
I don't eat breakfast.
- Then have an early lunch. Let's go.

54
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,400
You ever hear of Jonathan Mardukas?

55
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,300
The Duke. Yeah, I know who he is.
- What do you know?

56
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,200
He's that accountant that embezzled
millions from some Vegas wise guy.

57
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,100
He gave it to charity.
- Very good.

58
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,900
Only thing is, it wasn't a couple
of million. It was $15 million.

59
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,000
It wasn't some Vegas wise guy.
It was Jimmy Serrano.

60
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,700
I know.
I can read the papers.

61
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,500
Look, I don't wanna bring up
the past, but...

62
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,400
isn't it Serrano who ran you out of
Chicago when he was runnin' things then?

63
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
He didn't run me out.
- You gave up bein' a cop to do this?

64
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,000
All right, what's the point?
- The point, Jack?

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I bailed out the accountant.
I didn't know who he was at the time.

66
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,800
Had I known, there was no way
I would've put up the bond.

67
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,600
It's only time before Serrano
vanishes this guy from the planet...

68
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
and I'm out $450.000.

69
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
You're out $450.000 on this guy?

70
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,200
No, because I got you. You're the best.
You'll find him and bring him back.

71
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Yeah, right.

72
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,100
How do you know he's still alive?

73
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,000
Because this guy is crazy.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He sends postcards to Serrano...

75
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,800
tellin' him what a great time
he's havin' with his money.

76
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,600
How much time do you got left?
- Friday midnight I default.

77
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I eat the $450.000.
- This Friday?

78
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,400
That's five days. Forget it.
You go find him. Give me my money.

79
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Listen to me.

80
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
I'll give you $50 grand.

81
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,100
$50 grand? I gotta chase you down
for $1.200. Forget it.

82
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,000
No, Jack, please...
- Forget about it. What else you got?

83
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,100
This is it. If you don't find this guy,
I'm outta business.

84
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,600
Eddie, I'll do it for $100.000.

85
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,600
$100.000!
Are you outta your mind?

86
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,500
This is an easy gig.
It's a midnight run, for Chris sakes!

87
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm tired of gettin' shot at.

88
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,200
I'm tired of this miserable fuckin'
business, every lowlife that I run into.

89
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,100
If you're gonna pay me,
you gotta pay me what's right.

90
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
You want me for this job,
give me what's right.

91
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,900
The guy is an accountant.
He's not gonna shoot you.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,800
All you have to do is find him...

93
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,900
put him in a bag, hit him
with a rubber hose, bring him home.

94
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,900
That's easy for you to say.
Listen to me.

95
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,500
It's $100.000. No more, no less.
And I want a contract.

96
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Contract?
- Right, and I want it in writing.

97
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,300
$100.000 and I'll have the Duke here
for you by Friday night.

98
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Now, can I have my $1.200, please?

99
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,100
You do worse than any crook
I ever put a bond up for.

100
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Stanley? Stan!

101
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Hey, Big Dog. How are you?
What are you doin' here?

102
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
I need a favor.

103
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,900
I need to see the booking slip
of Jonathan Mardukas.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,800
M-A-R-D-U-K-A-S.

105
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Here you go.

106
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
Yes, sir.

107
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,300
What's that?

108
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,400
The number he called
right after he was arrested.

109
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,200
212 area code.
Looks like I'm goin' to New York.

110
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,900
Are you Jack Walsh?

111
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,500
Excuse me.
- Are you Jack Walsh?

112
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,400
Do I know you?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBl.

113
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
That's a nice badge.
How can I get one of those?

114
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,200
I wanna talk.

115
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
Call my social secretary.
- Very funny.

116
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,100
I wanna talk to you.
- Take your hands off me!

117
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Geez! Take it easy!

118
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,400
It's a $10 fine for jaywalking in L.A.
- Oh, shut up!

119
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,500
I want to know if you're working on
anything to do with Jonathan Mardukas?

120
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Never heard of him.
- I believe you have heard of him.

121
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,000
We've been working on this
Jimmy Serrano thing for six years.

122
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,700
Mardukas is my shot.

123
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm gonna bring him in
to federal court.

124
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,500
I don't want any third-rate rent-a-thug
who couldn't cut it as a Chicago cop...

125
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
bringing him to L.A.
on some bullshit local charge.

126
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,000
Do I make myself understood?

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Can I ask you something?

128
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,700
These sunglasses, they're really nice.
Are they government issue...

129
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,800
or do all you guys
go get 'em at the same store?

130
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Do I make myself understood?
- Can't you take a joke?

131
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,300
Get him outta here.

132
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's talk some more.
- Get the fuck outta here.

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,900
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

134
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,000
Have a nice day.

135
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,700
Thank you.

136
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Could I have my sunglasses back?
- Here's your sunglasses.

137
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Thanks. Thanks for this too.

138
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,200
"Alonzo Mosely".

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Alonzo.

140
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How's that?

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,800
Looks fine to me.

142
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,900
Harold Longman, please.

143
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,600
Harry? Jack Walsh.
How ya doin'?

144
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
You got that address check
on that phone number for me?

145
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,200
Okay. Thanks a lot, Harry.
Say hello to Julie for me.

146
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,300
Okay, bye.

147
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Thank you.

148
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
You Jack Walsh?

149
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,600
Who wants to know?
- Answer "yes".

150
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,500
We'd like to have a word with you.
- Yeah? What about?

151
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,400
It involves big cash, lotta prizes.

152
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,200
I'll make it short. The people
I work for are interested in your visit.

153
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Yeah? Who do you work for?
- Your old friend from the Chicago days.

154
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,900
You're here for the Duke. You think he's
in New York, and we think you're right.

155
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,800
That's a nice jacket.
What is it, goat skin?

156
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,600
Come on, Joey, please, will ya?
Never mind him.

157
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,400
I hear you didn't cooperate
with my boss a few years back.

158
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,300
Is that what you heard?
- Yeah, but I got a news flash.

159
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
He'd pay a lot more for the Duke
than that bail bondsman in L.A.

160
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
How much more?
- How about a one with six zeroes?

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,900
Are you gonna propose?
- Propose?

162
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,700
'Cause if you're not,
quit starin' at me, okay?

163
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
You're staring at me.
- Joey, back off, will you, please?

164
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,500
Mr. Walsh, your car's located
in space number 206.

165
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,400
You can catch our shuttle bus
just through these doors.

166
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,300
Thank you.
- Here's my number, Jack.

167
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,100
Ask for Tony Darvo. That's me. They'll
put you through to wherever I am.

168
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
And be good to yourself
this time, okay?

169
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Tell Jimmy I said hello.

170
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,300
Hello?
- Hello? Mrs. Nelson?

171
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Alonzo Mosely,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,100
How are you this afternoon?
- I'm fine.

173
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,900
Let me get to the point, if I may.

174
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,900
An agent in our Los Angeles office
discovered a detail...

175
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,700
that was somehow overlooked.

176
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,600
When Jonathan Mardukas was arrested,
you were the first person he called.

177
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,800
Is that correct, Mrs. Nelson?

178
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,400
Are you there, Mrs. Nelson?
- Yes.

179
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,300
This is a matter
of great concern to us.

180
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,200
If it's not too much trouble...

181
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,000
could you come down tomorrow morning
to 26 Federal Plaza?

182
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I suppose so.

183
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,900
About 9:00 a.m.?
- Yes.

184
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,700
Just ask for Agent Alonzo Mosely.

185
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

186
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,700
Hello?
- Dana? It's Helen.

187
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,500
The FBl just called.
They want to speak to me about Jonathan.

188
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Oh, my God! Helen.
- Helen, what's going on?

189
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,400
Jonathan, the FBl called. They know
we spoke the night you were arrested.

190
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Hang up the phone, Helen,
right now.

191
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Ah, sweet music.

192
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
Did you check this one?

193
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,800
What is it, Jon?
- I don't know.

194
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,400
Alonzo Mosely, FBl!
You're under arrest!

195
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,200
Get this fuckin' dog out of here!
Get this dog out of here, ma'am.

196
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,000
Not you. You stay there. Get the dog.
- Do it.

197
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Heidi, come on, girl.
That's a good girl.

198
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't move or I'll shoot you
through the glass.

199
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,500
Get over here.
Put your hands up against the wall.

200
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Spread your feet.

201
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Relax, there won't be a problem.

202
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,000
Put your left hand
behind your head.

203
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,100
That's it.

204
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
You're taking me to the airport,
aren't you?

205
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
You don't look like
an FBl agent to me.

206
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,000
Yeah? Well, you don't look
like a duke to me.

207
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,900
If you're an FBl agent, why not
just take me to the FBl office?

208
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,900
If you don't be quiet, this is going
to be the worst trip of your life.

209
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,500
You work for Jimmy Serrano, don't you?
- I don't work for that piece of shit.

210
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,400
Your bail bondsmen hired me to bring
you to L.A., and that's what I'm doin'.

211
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,300
I got money.
- I'm sure you do.

212
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,200
I'll give you whatever you want.
- Start by shutting up.

213
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I know you two minutes,
and already I don't like you.

214
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
That's too bad.
I really like you.

215
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,700
I can't cuff you on a commercial flight,
and I've gotta check my gun in luggage.

216
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,600
But you fuck with me once,
and I'm gonna break your neck.

217
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,500
I can't fly.
- What?

218
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,300
You heard me. I can't fly.
- You'll have to do better than that.

219
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,200
It's the truth. I can't fly.
I suffer from aviophobia.

220
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,100
What does that mean?
- It means I can't fly.

221
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,000
I also suffer from acrophobia
and claustrophobia.

222
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If you don't cooperate, you're
gonna suffer from "fistophobia".

223
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,500
Mascone's Bail Bonds.
- Jerry, put Eddie on the phone.

224
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,400
What's the progress?

225
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,300
I got him.
- You got who?

226
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,200
The Duke. He's standin' right here.
- You got him? Already?

227
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,000
Sure do. Wanna say hello? Say hello
to your bailbondsman, Eddie Mascone

228
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Hello.

229
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,900
Jonathan Mardukas in the flesh.
- Jack, I love ya!

230
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,800
How did this happen?
Where'd you find him?

231
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,600
I found him in New York.
We're at the airport.

232
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,500
Holy Christ! This is wonderful!
This is wonderful news!

233
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,400
I'll be in your office by midnight
tonight, and I'm tellin' you.

234
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,300
I don't wanna hear any bullshit.
I want the money tonight.

235
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,400
So empty out one of
your Swiss bank accounts.

236
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,100
You don't have to worry about nothin'.
This is the best money I ever spent.

237
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,100
See you in a few hours.
- I'll see ya later. 'Night.

238
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
What's that all about?
- Jerry Walsh got the Duke!

239
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Walsh got the Duke?
- He got him! He got the Duke!

240
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,500
No kiddin'? This calls for
a celebration. I'll get some donuts.

241
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
How do you think Walsh
found him so fast?

242
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Tony, this is Jerry.
- Jerry who?

243
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,300
Jerry Geisler. What are you doing?
- Eatin' dinner. What do you want?

244
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,100
I hate to bother you,
but I thought you'd like to know...

245
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
that Walsh found the Duke in New York.

246
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,800
They're flyin' in tonight.
They should arrive around midnight.

247
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,700
Don't forget me, babe.
- Yeah, kid, yeah.

248
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,900
Thanks. Good night.

249
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,800
Looks like your old friend
found the accountant.

250
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,000
They'll be flying into L.A.
around midnight.

251
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,600
Have them met at the airport.

252
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
You understand?
- Done.

253
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,300
Can I take your coat?
- No, that's fine. Thanks.

254
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,100
May I take your coat?
- No.

255
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,000
First class is nice.
I could make a habit out of this.

256
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,900
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening to you.

257
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,800
Would you like a drink
before we take off?

258
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,700
Yes, we would like
one of your finest champagnes.

259
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,900
Certainly.

260
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Let's see.
Look at this.

261
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,600
Only in America.
What a country. Huh?

262
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,100
Unbelievable.
I think I'm gonna have the steak.

263
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,000
How about you?
- I'm not hungry.

264
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,800
Why don't you get lobster? Then I can
get some surf and turf action goin'.

265
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,700
I got a problem.

266
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,600
I can't fly.
You're not takin' me seriously.

267
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm takin' you very seriously.
- I can't be on this plane.

268
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,400
You think I haven't heard
your story before?

269
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,200
You think you're traveling with
a novice? Know what I'm talkin' about?

270
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,000
That's it. Settle in.
If you wanna get up and talk...

271
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,000
mingle with the rest of the passengers,
be my guest.

272
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,800
You ain't goin' nowhere. There's
a couple of nice-lookin' people here.

273
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,600
Better class of people.
Your class.

274
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,800
Probably all embezzlers, too.

275
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,500
Come fly with me
Come fly away

276
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,100
Just try and relax.

277
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,600
Look, I...

278
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Just calm down.
Just relax and calm down.

279
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Why are you gettin' so excited?
- It's not...

280
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,100
No! I can't!

281
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,000
No! No! No! I can't.

282
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Just relax. Just relax.

283
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,800
What did I tell ya?
Don't pull that shit on me.

284
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,700
No! I'm tellin' you.
I can't do it.

285
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,600
Get over there.
- These things go down!

286
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
It's too big! It can't go up!

287
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,100
All right, everyone, just calm down.
What's the problem?

288
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,000
It's nothing, sir. Alonzo Mosely, FBl.
This man is in my custody.

289
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,900
I'm takin' him back to Los Angeles.
There won't be any more problems.

290
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,800
I don't wanna fly.
I can't fly.

291
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,600
You know you can't take a prisoner on
an airplane if he doesn't want to fly.

292
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,500
I do. I'm sorry.
I thought he was bluffing.

293
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,400
I suggest you find
some other mode of transportation.

294
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,000
What the fuck are you smilin' about?
- I love to travel by train.

295
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,800
Oh, yeah? What do you think
this is, a class trip?

296
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,600
Are you always this angry?
- Right now I'm in a great fuckin' mood.

297
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,500
When I'm cooped up on that for a while,
you won't be smilin'.

298
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,600
You'll be runnin'
for that fuckin' jail cell.

299
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,300
Still gonna make your schedule?

300
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,300
I'll make it,
with 14 hours to spare.

301
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, nice. It's a double.
There'll be a lot of room.

302
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Glad you like it.
- Good. Very nice.

303
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,600
Thanks, 'cause it's starting
to cut into my wrists. Thank you.

304
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
It gets the skin after a while.

305
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
Get in there.
- What do you want? What?

306
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,300
Oh, come on. Come on.

307
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,200
No, you don't...
Why would you do that?

308
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
You enjoy yourself. This is my room,
and that's your room. Good night.

309
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,300
Hey, can I help you guys?
- Special Agent Mosely, FBl.

310
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,300
Are all you guys named Mosely?
- What the hell are you talking about?

311
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,000
You're here to pick up a prisoner.
- How did you know that?

312
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,900
He was afraid to fly,
so he got off the plane.

313
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,800
He left with an Agent Mosely.

314
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Sir, that must mean Walsh
has your identification.

315
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,200
Is this moron number one?
Put moron number two on the phone.

316
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,100
Yeah, Jimmy.
He's right here. Hold on.

317
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
He's pissed.

318
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,800
You told me this guy
would be on the plane.

319
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,700
That's the information we got.
- "That's the information we got".

320
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,600
I'm gonna tell you something.
I want this guy taken out fast.

321
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,400
You and that other dummy start getting
more personally involved in your work...

322
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,300
or I'm gonna stab you through the heart
with a fuckin' pencil.

323
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Do you understand me?
- You got it, Jimmy.

324
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Tony, he ain't mad at me, is he?

325
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Jack?

326
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,400
Jack, I think this is illegal.

327
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,300
I don't think you can keep
a person in a bathroom like this.

328
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
It's very claustrophobic in here...

329
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,000
It is? Well, I'll tell you what.
When we get to L.A....

330
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,900
you can tell the prison psychiatrist
all about it.

331
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,800
There's no air.
There's no ventilation in here.

332
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,700
I told you I was claustrophobic.
Come on.

333
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,800
What do you think I'm gonna do? Jump off
a train moving 90 miles an hour?

334
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Jack?

335
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Good. Thanks. Thanks.

336
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,000
Thanks a lot.

337
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,600
Sit down.
- Yeah, that's great.

338
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Very kind of you.

339
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,400
It's much better.
Thank you. Good.

340
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,900
What are you doing?

341
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
What am I doin'? Arithmetic.

342
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Arithmetic? Maybe I can help you.
I am an accountant.

343
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,400
I was thinkin', after I turn your ass in
and collect my money...

344
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
I'm gonna open up a coffee shop.

345
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,200
How much are you getting for me?

346
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,200
That's not any of your concern.
But I'll tell you just to tell you.

347
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,900
A hundred thousand.
- A hundred thousand?

348
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,800
Would you take a $100.000
to let me go?

349
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,600
Not by a long shot.
- Two-hundred thousand?

350
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,500
I never took a payoff in my life, and
I'm won't start with someone like you.

351
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Why not?
- Because you're a fuckin' criminal.

352
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,300
You deserve to go where you're goin',
and I'm gonna take you there.

353
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,100
If I hear any more shit out of you,
I'm gonna bust your head...

354
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,100
put you back
in that fuckin' hole...

355
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,000
and I'm gonna stick your head in
the toilet bowl and make it stay there.

356
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,600
I have to tell you, a restaurant
is a very tricky investment.

357
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,400
More than half of them go under
within the first six months.

358
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
If I were your accountant,
I'd strongly advise you against it.

359
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
You would?
You're not my accountant.

360
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,200
No, if I were your accountant...
- I told you, I took you out here...

361
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,000
No, I'm just saying that
it's a very tricky business...

362
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,800
and if I were your accountant, I would
strongly advise you against it...

363
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,800
as an accountant.

364
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
You're not my accountant.
- I realize I'm not your accountant.

365
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I'm saying,
if I were your accountant.

366
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,200
Jerry, how the hell could he miss
the goddamn plane?

367
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,000
He called from the airport!

368
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,800
All right. It's time to bring in Marvin.
Call him. He's in Pittsburgh.

369
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,800
Marvin Dorfler?
- Yeah, Dorfler.

370
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,900
Under "D" in the Rolodex for "jerk".

371
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Can I at least
have some french fries?

372
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,600
I said no, pecker breath.
Now shut up.

373
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,000
Dorfler.

374
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,000
Marvin?
Sweetheart, am I glad I got you.

375
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Boy, do I have a job for you!
- I'm listening.

376
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,600
First of all, I gotta apologize,
because we were trying to find you.

377
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,400
It's an important job, but I couldn't
find you, so I gave it to Walsh.

378
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,400
But now he's fucking it up, so...
- I don't know why you hire that guy.

379
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,200
I know. I apologize. You are the best
at what you do. You know that?

380
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Do you know Jonathan Mardukas?

381
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,000
No.
- Jonathan Mardukas, the Duke?

382
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,000
I never heard of him.
- All right. That's not important.

383
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,800
What's important is that you find him
and that you bring him back, okay?

384
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,600
Last I heard, he had him in New York.
Now I don't know where they are.

385
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
If you find him, I'll give you
what I'm givin' Walsh.

386
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,700
What's that?

387
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,400
Twenty-five thousand.

388
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,200
But you gotta have him back by Friday
midnight, otherwise the deal is off..

389
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,000
Don't worry. For $25 grand,
I'll bring him in on a silver platter.

390
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,000
Bring him anyway you want,
but bring him, okay?

391
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,100
Bye.

392
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,600
Hey, scumbag.
- My name's Carmine, fucko.

393
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,600
Well, Carmine,
today's your lucky day.

394
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,400
Why is today my lucky day?
- Shut up!

395
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,200
Yeah. My name is Jack Walsh.

396
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,200
Excuse me.
John Wesley Walsh.

397
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,200
I think I lost my credit card.

398
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Can you tell me
the last place I used it?

399
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Yeah, 731-483-9521-13.

400
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,600
The Amtrak office,
Grand Central Station?

401
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,400
Yeah, yeah.
I remember that now.

402
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,400
Okay. Thanks very much.

403
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,200
Hey, maybe we oughta cancel
that card, huh?

404
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,300
Yeah. Thank you.

405
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Familiar with the word
"arteriosclerosis"?

406
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,400
Cholesterol?

407
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,100
If you want, I'll outline
a complete balanced diet for you.

408
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
Mail it to me from "C" block.

409
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,800
Why would you eat that?
- Why? 'Cause it tastes good.

410
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,700
But it's not good for you.
- I'm aware of that.

411
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,600
Why would you do something
you know is not good for you?

412
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,400
Because I don't think about it.
- That's living in denial.

413
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,500
Living in denial?
- Yeah.

414
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,200
I'm aware of that.
- So you're aware of all your behavior.

415
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,000
Yet you do things not good for you.
Don't you think that sounds foolish?

416
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,900
No. Stealing $15 million
from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.

417
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,600
I didn't think I'd get caught.
- Now, that's livin' in denial.

418
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,400
I'm aware of that.
- So you're aware of your behavior.

419
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,300
Yet you continue to do things
that aren't good for you.

420
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,200
Sounds foolish to me. Don't you think?
- It was foolish.

421
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,100
But taking $15 million in mob money...

422
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
and giving it to charity
was good for a lot of people.

423
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,800
So you pissed off a mafiioso killer
just to be loved by fuckin' strangers.

424
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,900
That makes a lot of sense.
- Don't you want to be loved?

425
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,600
Lots of people love me.
- Really?

426
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,500
Who?

427
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,300
I got an ex-wife,
and a daughter in Chicago.

428
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,900
How do they put up
with all your sarcasm?

429
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,800
Beautifully. I haven't seen
either of them in nine years.

430
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,700
Think we should go see them?
- No, I don't think we should see them.

431
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,500
Thanks for the interest, though.
- The job must have been tough on 'em.

432
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,400
I didn't do this then.
- What did you do?

433
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,200
I was a cop.
- You were a cop in Chicago?

434
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
Then you know
about Jimmy Serrano.

435
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,900
Do you have a right to ask questions?
- I think I do.

436
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
No, you don't.
- I think I do.

437
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,800
No, you don't.
- Why not?

438
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Dinner's over. Let's go.

439
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,400
I can see this is gonna be
some fuckin' trip, boy.

440
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,300
I wouldn't worry.
I won't be with you much longer.

441
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,200
What do you mean?

442
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,100
Knowing about Serrano, if I go to jail,
I'll be dead within 24 hours.

443
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,100
So sooner or later,
I'll have to give you the slip.

444
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,800
Sure.

445
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,900
Glad you find it humorous.

446
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,500
Let's go.
- All you're leaving is $2?

447
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,500
That's 15 percent.
- That's 13 percent.

448
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,600
These people depend on tips
for a living.

449
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Can I help you, sir?

450
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,100
Yeah, I'm looking for my buddy,
Jack Walsh.

451
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,700
He told me he'd meet me
on this train.

452
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,600
Yeah, Mr. Walsh.

453
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,500
He's in Bedroom "D", next car.

454
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,400
That next car?
- Yes, sir, that way.

455
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Thanks.
- Sure thing. Have a good night.

456
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,800
One word and you're dead, asshole.

457
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Holy shit! Son of a...

458
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,100
How the fuck you find out where I am?
- I ain't tellin' you shit!

459
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Don't force me to do something!
- What's goin' on in here?

460
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,800
All right. Everything's under control.
Take it easy. Alonzo Mosely, FBl.

461
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,700
Radio ahead. I want the local police
at the next stop to arrest this man.

462
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,600
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- That's enough out of you!

463
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Get on the horn
and call the cops.

464
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,000
Is this good or bad news?

465
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,800
Mardukas and Walsh are on the Amtrak
headed to Los Angeles.

466
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,700
Another bounty hunter was arrested
after he tried to take Mardukas away.

467
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
I want the jet ready in 20 minutes.

468
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,500
Where's Jack Walsh?

469
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,300
He got off with the other guy
two or three stops ago.

470
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,300
His real name's Mosely.
- I'm Mosely!

471
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I wanna make a collect call
to Eddie Mascone from Jack Walsh.

472
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,600
Mascone. Bail bonds.
- Jerry, it's Jack. Put Eddie on.

473
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,400
Jesus, Jack! Where the hell you been?
- I wanna talk to him. Where are you?

474
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,300
Where am I?
I wanna ask you somethin'.

475
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,200
How come Dorfler is on my ass? Did you
put him on this, you son of a bitch?

476
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,100
Wait a minute. Dorfler...

477
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,000
How could I put Dorfler on you?
I don't know where you are.

478
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,900
You had nothin' to do with it?
- Where are you? You got the Duke?

479
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,800
You're damn right I got him.
- Where are you?

480
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,600
Where am I? I'm somewhere between...
I don't know... Toledo and Cleveland.

481
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
We're gettin' on a bus.
- Bingo.

482
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,500
Bus? Don't get on a...
Are you outta your mind?

483
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,400
Shut up and listen.
We're gettin' on a bus.

484
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,200
I wanted to let you know
we're on our way. Bye.

485
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Don't hang up!

486
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,000
Shit! What the hell
is this guy doin'?

487
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,100
I don't know.

488
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,800
Listen, maybe I oughta get
some donuts or somethin', huh?

489
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Two one-way tickets to Los Angeles.

490
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,900
Still gonna make our schedule.
- I'll get you there on time.

491
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,800
Don't have any illusions.

492
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,600
lllusions?
- Illusions. Illusions.

493
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,500
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's been cancelled.

494
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,400
Huh? Has it been cancelled?

495
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,300
I'm sorry. That's a mistake.
Would you please try it again?

496
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,200
I checked it twice, sir.
- Please try it again.

497
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,100
Did you pay the bill?
- Shut up.

498
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm sorry, sir.
It's been cancelled.

499
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,900
Ma'am, that is impossible.
I pay my bills.

500
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,800
There is no way
that could be cancelled. Shut up.

501
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,700
Please.
- It's cancelled, sir.

502
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,600
Would you like to try
another credit card or cash?

503
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,500
I don't have any other credit cards.
Please, just try that again.

504
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,400
All right.

505
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,200
Alonzo...Jack Walsh,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

506
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,100
This is official business.
This man's in my custody.

507
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,100
I'm taking him to Los Angeles, okay?
Please try again.

508
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,000
Jack Walsh is not the name
on that badge, sir.

509
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Would you like me to call the FBl?

510
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Or would you like to pay cash?

511
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,400
How much is it?
- $264 for two tickets.

512
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Here's a hundred.

513
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Got any money on ya?
- A lot.

514
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,600
You call that a lot? Enough
to get you where I'm gonna get you.

515
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,100
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

516
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Got the whole fuckin' force
after me, huh?

517
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,100
Who the fuck are you?
- Special Agent Mosely, FBl.

518
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Oh, goddamn it!
I didn't do anything.

519
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,900
Relax. Just wanna ask you
a few questions.

520
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah. Fuckin' "A". Help yourself.

521
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
What do you know
about Jack Walsh?

522
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,900
No. Come on. Come on.
Cigarettes are killers.

523
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,800
So are women.
- Not the right woman.

524
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,600
My wife stuck it out
with me through all of this.

525
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Yeah, stuck it out with you
and all your millions. What a trooper.

526
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,400
I don't have millions, Jack.
I gave it all to charity, remember?

527
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,300
You didn't keep a little
for yourself?

528
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,100
I kept enough to get away and hide.
- Yeah, right.

529
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,100
When we change buses in Chicago,
you're gonna have a couple hours.

530
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,900
Be a better man. Use that time
to look up your ex-wife and daughter.

531
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's a perfect opportunity.
- Why don't you mind your own business?

532
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,500
Why is it you haven't seen them
in nine years?

533
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,400
Why?

534
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,300
Just to get you off my back, I'll tell
you. She married a police lieutenant.

535
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
And I'm not very popular
with the Chicago Police Department.

536
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,000
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?

537
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,900
What, do we know each other?
Get... What a... Take...

538
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,900
Why?

539
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,700
What did you do? Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?

540
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,500
That really doesn't concern you.
- Did she hurt you, Jack?

541
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,400
Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

542
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,300
What are you sorry about?
- I'm sorry you're hurt.

543
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,100
I'm not hurt.
- You just said you were hurt.

544
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,000
I didn't say I was hurt.
You said I was hurt.

545
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,000
I asked if you were hurt,
and you said, "Yeah, I'm hurt".

546
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,800
You made me say it.
You put words in my mouth.

547
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,800
You're a grown man.
You have control over your own words.

548
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Goddamn right I do. So, here come
two words for you. Shut the fuck up.

549
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:48,200
Excuse me. Walsh called Mascone about
a half an hour ago from outside Toledo.

550
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,200
He's on an interstate Coach Lines bus
headed for Chicago.

551
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Come on.

552
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,600
Sir, what do we do with this guy?

553
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,800
Let him go.

554
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Son of a bitch stole my cigarettes.

555
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,400
When's the last time
you had a chest X ray?

556
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,000
You know about secondary smoke?
You could give people lung cancer...

557
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,800
who are innocent
and tryin' to live healthy lives.

558
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,600
Why don't you just go back to sleep?
Leave me alone.

559
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,600
Do whatever you have to do.
- Put the cigarette out.

560
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,400
Why don't you shut up
and leave me alone?

561
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Put the cigarette out, Jack.

562
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,200
Put the cigarette out.

563
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,000
A pain in the ass this guy is.

564
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,000
Thank you.
I thought you were putting it out.

565
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,800
No, I'm not putting it out.

566
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?

567
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,800
Sid's downstairs.

568
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,200
What's up?
- I think you and I should talk.

569
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,200
What are you hangin' around for?
Take a walk.

570
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,000
Somebody picked up Mardukas.
- It's old news. I'm on it.

571
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,000
I don't have to tell you what'll happen
if he becomes a government witness.

572
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,800
That won't be the case.

573
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,800
I assumed you were taking that position,
but I advise you against such action.

574
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,700
Relax. Have a cream soda. Everything
will be all over within a few minutes.

575
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,000
Who are these guys?

576
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,900
Hands on the bus!

577
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
All right, spread 'em.

578
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,300
It's the Feds.

579
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,200
Remember me?

580
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,000
Agent Foster Grant.

581
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
Alonzo, won't you thank me
for doin' your job?

582
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,800
Thank you, Walsh.

583
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,300
Let's get the fuck outta here!

584
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,400
What the hell are you doing?
- Keep moving.

585
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,300
Relax.
- No! Come on!

586
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,300
Hurry it up.
- What are you doin'? Are you there?

587
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,900
Wait a minute. Jesus Christ!
All right, I'm comin'!

588
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,900
Come on!
- I'm coming! Wait a minute!

589
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,700
Walsh, you son of a bitch!

590
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,100
God! My God!
- Shut up.

591
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,000
What the hell was that?
Why were they shooting?

592
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,900
Those are Serrano's people. They're not
waiting for you to get to jail.

593
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,800
You're turnin' me in.
Why are we runnin' away from the FBl?

594
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,700
I gotta bring you back myself,
otherwise I won't get my money.

595
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,700
I won't give you to the Feds.

596
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,400
"Alonzo Mosely".
Isn't that the name you've been using?

597
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,500
Let me see that.

598
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,200
Look at this wealth of information.
They got a tap on Mascone's line.

599
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Son of a bitch!

600
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,900
What are ya doin'?

601
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,700
How far do you think we'll get
in a stolen FBl car?

602
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:13,300
What's that for?
- An inside joke between me and Alonzo.

603
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,100
Tony Darvo, line one.
- Yeah?

604
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,200
Sorry. It didn't happen.

605
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,900
It didn't happen? Say that again.
- It didn't happen.

606
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,800
There were cops all over the place.
A million fuckin' Feds.

607
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,700
It was a mess.

608
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,600
It was a real mess.
- Get off the line.

609
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,500
If they've got a tap...

610
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,400
Sidney, shut your fuckin' mouth!

611
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,300
Now listen to me, dummy.
Do they have Mardukas in custody or not?

612
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,100
I don't know. The cops
are swarming all over the place.

613
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,900
We couldn't see anything.
- Let me tell you something.

614
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,800
I don't wanna get another phone call
like this, because if I do...

615
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,700
I'm gonna get on a fuckin' plane,
and blow torch the both of you.

616
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,700
Understand?

617
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,500
Are you gonna stop?
I'm on the phone! What are you doin'?

618
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,400
I should've killed Walsh
in Chicago a long time ago.

619
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,300
Don't say a fuckin' word to me, Sidney.

620
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,400
I'll bury this telephone in your head.

621
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,300
I can't believe this. I haven't seen
either of them in nine years...

622
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,900
and the first thing out of my mouth is,
"Can I borrow a few hundred bucks?"

623
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,900
I have a feeling this is gonna be
very good for you.

624
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,400
You look fine.

625
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,100
Who are you guys?
- I'm your mother's ex-husband.

626
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Mom!
- Nice kid.

627
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,100
Hi, Gail.
- Hello.

628
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,200
How're ya doin'?
- I'm doin' good.

629
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,600
They mentioned you and him
on the news this morning.

630
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,500
They did?
- Yeah.

631
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,700
What'd they say?
Anything good?

632
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,200
No. Are you all right?

633
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,400
Yeah.

634
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,200
You're in a lot of trouble, Jack.

635
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Can I come in
for a few minutes?

636
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,900
Can I come in for a few minutes?

637
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,800
Yeah.

638
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,300
I won't stay long. I just need
to borrow some money to get to L.A.

639
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,200
You know I'm good for it.

640
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,100
I don't have that kind of cash
in the house.

641
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,100
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm just in a jam, Gail.

642
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,700
You look beautiful.

643
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,600
You don't look like a criminal.
- I'm a white-collar criminal.

644
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,700
Jason, go upstairs now.

645
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,300
You shouldn't be here. If Ted comes
home, he's gonna arrest you and him.

646
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,200
Arrest us?
- Yeah.

647
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,000
Then we'd be in a lot of trouble, 'cause
I'm a little short of bribe money.

648
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,900
All right, Jack, don't start.
Please, don't.

649
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,800
How is Lieutenant whatever-his-name-is?

650
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,700
It's captain now.
- Oh, captain? Royalty.

651
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,600
I don't want any trouble.
Do you understand? Please.

652
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,600
It is not a good day for this.
I mean it.

653
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,300
I'm sorry my fugitive timetable doesn't
coincide with your social calendar.

654
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,300
I don't think she was saying that.
- Stay out of this, Jon.

655
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,100
Same Jack. You get your feelings hurt,
and then you just hurt everybody else.

656
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't need one of your lectures.
- I'm not lecturing you.

657
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,900
I'm trying to protect you!
Ted is going to be home any minute.

658
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,800
We're all going out.
It's an important night for us.

659
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,700
What's so important about tonight?
Let me guess. Is it payoff night?

660
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,500
That's it! Get out!
- Let's not fight.

661
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,400
I'm in a big fuckin' jam!
I need to borrow some money...

662
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,300
to get this guy to L.A., and I'm out of
this miserable fuckin' business forever!

663
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,300
Can't you understand that?

664
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,400
Denise?

665
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,100
You got so big.

666
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,400
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go now.
- No, hold on.

667
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I'm sorry, honey.
We're havin' a...

668
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,400
What grade are you in now?
- Eighth.

669
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,400
Are you in the eighth grade?

670
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,300
Here's $40. That's all I've got,
but these are the keys to my car.

671
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,200
It's the station wagon
in the driveway.

672
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,100
I'll tell Ted
that it's in the shop.

673
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,000
And we'll worry about it
when you get back to L.A.

674
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So, does he take good care of you?

675
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,600
Yeah?
That's all I wanted to know.

676
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,500
So what's he gonna say about this?

677
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,300
He'll understand.
- Uh-huh. That's love, you know?

678
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Bye, honey.

679
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,600
Wait. It isn't much.

680
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,400
About $180 baby-sitting money.
- Oh, sweetheart, I can't.

681
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,400
Take it. Please.

682
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,400
I can't, sweetheart.

683
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,800
Hello. I'd like to make a collect call
to Eddie Mascone from Jack Walsh.

684
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,400
Mascone Bail Bonds.
- Jerry, Jack. Put Eddie on the phone.

685
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,600
It's Jack.
- Stop fuckin' around. Where are you?

686
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,400
Where am I? I'm in Boise, Idaho.

687
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,000
No, wait a minute.
I'm in Anchorage, Alaska.

688
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,900
No, wait.
I'm in Casper, Wyoming.

689
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,800
I'm in the lobby of the Howard Johnson's
and I'm wearing a pink carnation.

690
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,700
What are you talkin' about?

691
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,600
I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to the other guys.

692
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,500
What other guys?
- Let me describe the scene to you.

693
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,400
There's these guys, see?
They've probably been up for two days.

694
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,200
They stink of B.O.
They have coffee breath.

695
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,100
They're constipated from
sittin' on their asses for so long.

696
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,000
They're in a van, probably parked
right up the street from your office.

697
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,800
But you guys are gonna have
to pack up your shit and go home...

698
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,000
because I'm onto you,
you dumb fucks.

699
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,600
Your phone is tapped. I'm not gonna use
this line anymore. Go to Chin Loo's.

700
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,700
I'll call you there in five minutes.
They can't run a tap that fast.

701
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,600
So long, everybody.

702
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,200
Excuse me, buddy. I got it!
I think it's for me. Jack, that you?

703
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,000
Listen. Wire me $500 to the Western
Union in Amarillo, Texas right away.

704
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,800
What do you need with $500 on a bus?
And why the fuck aren't you on a plane?

705
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,600
Did it ever occur to you that I am
a professional and have my reasons?

706
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,600
We are driving now, and I only have
enough cash to get to Amarillo.

707
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,400
We scrapped the bus.

708
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,500
Fuck the bus! I wanna know
what happened to the goddamn plane!

709
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,200
He doesn't like to fly.
- He doesn't like to fly?!

710
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,000
What the fuck does that mean?
Listen to me, Jack!

711
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,000
You gotta be back here in less
than two and a half fuckin' days.

712
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,800
A half million dollars of my money!
What the fuck is goin' on there?

713
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,600
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,
I swear to God, don't start with me...

714
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,700
or I will shoot him and I will dump him
in a fuckin' swamp!

715
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,400
I am in no fuckin' mood for this.

716
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
Just send me the money, and
I'll have him back by the deadline.

717
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,400
You hear me?
- Yes.

718
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,300
Let's go.

719
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,800
Jerry, wire $500 to Jack Walsh
in Amarillo, Texas right away.

720
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,800
Amarillo, Texas.

721
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:45,600
Also, get Dorfler down there!
Find him and get him down there too.

722
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,700
You got it, Eddie.
- Shit!

723
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,500
One of those bottles of beer
should fall

724
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,300
Ninety-six bottles
of beer on the wall

725
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,000
Nine...

726
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,700
Ninety-three bottles
of beer on the wall

727
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,400
Why were you so unpopular
with the Chicago Police Department?

728
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,300
'Cause of your personality?

729
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,100
What happened at your house?
What was that all about?

730
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Your wife married
a corrupt police officer?

731
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,800
What was it all about?

732
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,400
That whole fuckin' department
was corrupt.

733
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,400
There's good and bad everywhere,
don't you think?

734
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,300
I'd say there's bad everywhere.
Good I don't know about.

735
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,200
What happened to you?

736
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,900
I wouldn't go on the payroll.

737
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,800
What payroll?

738
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,600
I was workin' undercover.
I was...

739
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,200
posted to this big heroin dealer
in Chicago.

740
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,300
Think he supplied the whole city.

741
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,000
Took me a year
just to get his confidence.

742
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,900
Just when I was about to nail the son
of a bitch, my fellow officers...

743
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,700
mysteriously discovered
seven pounds of heroin in my house.

744
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,600
So this big-time drug dealer
gave me a choice:

745
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,500
Get on the payroll like everybody else,
get out of town...

746
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,300
or go to jail for 30 years.

747
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,200
Well, I didn't get on the payroll.

748
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,100
And that's why I do this.

749
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,000
So when I find a criminal like you,
I bring him in.

750
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I don't worry about anybody takin' a
payoff. There is no anybody, just me.

751
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,300
Why don't you get a new watch?
- I'll tell you when I know you better.

752
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,300
When are you gonna get to know me
better? I'll get to know you better.

753
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,100
You're not gonna know me better.
- Will you shut up?

754
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,100
That's what I mean.

755
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
How much money do we have left?

756
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,000
That's it?
- That's it.

757
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,700
We're starvin',
and you're buying cigarettes?

758
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,800
I need these cigarettes.

759
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,500
You have your whatever you're
gonna have. I'll have this.

760
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,500
What can I do for you boys?
- Coffee, please.

761
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,100
How much is the coffee?
- It's 53 cents.

762
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,200
How much is tea?
- Fifty-three cents.

763
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,900
I'll have tea.

764
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,700
Okay, and our breakfast special today
is chorizo and eggs.

765
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,600
Chorizo and eggs?
- Chorizo and eggs. Yes.

766
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,500
What is that?
- It's a Mexican sausage...

767
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,400
mixed in with scrambled eggs, and
it comes with hash browns and toast.

768
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,500
Won't be havin' that. Thank you.

769
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:16,900
What time you got?
- It's ten to 9:00.

770
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,700
In ten minutes, we'll be at the Western
Union office, we'll have 500 bucks.

771
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,800
I'll buy ya a juicy steak
or what ever you want, okay?

772
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,500
Chorizo and eggs?

773
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,500
Chorizo and eggs?
- I'll get you whatever you want.

774
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,100
You know, Jon, you're in this mess
because you're in this mess.

775
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,100
I didn't put you in this mess.
Do you understand?

776
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,900
If you had left Jimmy Serrano alone,
this wouldn't be happening.

777
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,800
Thank you.

778
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,300
I had a way out of this.

779
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,500
Oh, yeah?

780
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,800
What's the thing Serrano's
most afraid of?

781
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,200
Goin' cross-country with you.

782
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,900
Gettin' knocked off
by his own people.

783
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,500
What I know
his financial transactions...

784
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,400
would not only put him away, but every
mob guy he ever did business with.

785
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,300
That's why he wants to kill me.

786
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,200
I was gonna put all his records
on computer disks.

787
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,100
I figured if things got too rough,
I could always trade them for my life.

788
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,000
What happened?

789
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,900
What happened was I got arrested
before I had a chance to do it.

790
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,700
Why didn't you just leave him alone?

791
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,600
You don't look like the kind of guy
who would be involved in that situation.

792
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,700
Why didn't you leave
that heroin dealer alone?

793
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,300
I was a mob accountant.

794
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,200
I thought I worked
in a legitimate firm.

795
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:49,100
When I found out I was managing
accounts who were friends for Serrano...

796
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,000
I couldn't just sit back
and do nothing.

797
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,900
But you still took
what didn't belong to you.

798
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,700
How can you be on a mobster's side?
- I'm not on a mobster's side?

799
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,700
You're on his if you're not on mine
- I'm not on anybody's side.

800
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,500
I got nothin' to do with it.
- You've got everything to do with it.

801
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,500
You're takin' me to jail
where you know I'll be killed.

802
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,300
That's not my problem.
- It's not your problem?

803
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,500
It's not your problem?

804
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,100
Did you read about me in the papers?
- Yeah, I did.

805
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,000
Were you on my side then?
- Yeah, I was.

806
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,900
Then why aren't you now?
- Because now you're in my way.

807
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,100
I'm in your way?

808
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,700
You want the money for turning me
in because that's all you're about.

809
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,900
You're just about the fuckin' money.

810
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,300
Hey, Jon, you think
whatever you wanna think.

811
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,400
Doesn't matter to me cause I'm gettin'
my $100.000 any which way you want it.

812
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,000
Let's go.

813
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:53,400
Hey, Tony. Hop-Along... Che si dice.
Got your camera. Take a picture.

814
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,300
Should I get one of these
at the airport?

815
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,400
Put that away.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

816
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
Tony, there they are.

817
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,700
How you doing, Jack?
Jimmy sends his regards.

818
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,400
Don't worry. We're not here for you.
We're here for him.

819
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,300
What are you staring at?
Are you gonna propose?

820
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Drop 'em!
I said, drop 'em, assholes!

821
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,700
Who the fuck are you guys?
- Who the fuck are you?

822
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,000
You're dead.
You know who you're fuckin' with?

823
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:55,100
No. Why don't you tell me?
Make sure you speak into the microphone.

824
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,600
Very clever.
Give me the keys.

825
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,400
Come on, give me the keys!

826
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,600
The keys.

827
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,200
Looks like a package deal.

828
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,300
Goddamn it! Come on, both of you!

829
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,800
Who were those guys?
- You did it this time.

830
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,700
What are you talking about?
- Those are hired killers.

831
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,600
Hired to kill who?
- Hired to kill this guy.

832
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,500
Me. Can you believe it?

833
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,400
Hired by who?
- Jimmy Serrano, that's who.

834
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,300
Fuck. Why do they
wanna kill this guy?

835
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,200
Don't you read the papers?

836
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,400
I read the fucking papers.

837
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,000
They got away. Gray Dodge.
Get after 'em.

838
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,900
How did you know where we were?
Shut up.

839
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,800
Did Eddie put you on this?
- Of course.

840
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,600
That son of a bitch.
I have a contract with him.

841
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,600
A contract?
- I signed it Monday.

842
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,400
He called me.
Said you were fucking this up.

843
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,300
I'm not fucking anything up.
- You should've been in L.A. 2 days ago.

844
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,200
Don't tell me how to do my job.

845
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,100
I'm thinking not to turn him in
just to watch Eddie go down the toilet.

846
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,000
That's a good thought.
- What? Who's talkin' to you?

847
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,100
Yeah, who's talking to you?
He's not yours to take. He's mine.

848
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,000
Hear that?

849
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,900
Who the fuck is this?

850
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,600
Jesus Christ!

851
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,500
Do something!

852
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:27,200
You guys are the dumbest
bounty hunters I've ever seen!

853
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,000
You couldn't even deliver
a bottle of milk!

854
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,700
Will you shut the fuck up?

855
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,000
Where did he go?
- You think we lost him?

856
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:56,000
I don't see anything.
- I'm sure we're completely safe.

857
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,800
You all right?
- I'm fine. I'm enjoying it.

858
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,900
Marvin, give me a gun.

859
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,800
No fuckin' way.

860
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,300
Give me a gun!
- Give him a gun!

861
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,300
Don't fuck me.

862
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
Yeah, yeah.

863
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,000
Shit.

864
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,700
They're not after me.

865
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,600
Just kidding.

866
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,500
You threw those away.

867
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,600
Always check the evidence.
Those were car keys.

868
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,900
There goes a hundred grand.

869
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,800
Eddie was gonna pay you a hundred?

870
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,700
What was he gonna pay you?

871
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,600
Twenty-five.

872
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,800
Son of a bitch!

873
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
Holy shit!
You got 'em.

874
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,800
What the hell are you doin'?

875
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,700
See you in L.A.

876
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,300
Jon, where the fuck are you?

877
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Give me your hand.
I'm slipping. I can't hold on.

878
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,700
Where are you goin'?

879
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,300
Good.

880
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:31,100
Promise to let me go?
Do you promise to let me go?

881
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,600
Fuck you.
- Promise to let me go!

882
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,700
You're making it very difficult
for me to do the right thing.

883
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,500
I promise I'll let you go.

884
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,400
Oh, Jesus.

885
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,600
You all right?
- Yeah.

886
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,300
Thanks for saving my life.

887
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,200
Thanks for letting me go.

888
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,700
I'll let you go the second
you're in L.A. County Jail.

889
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,900
Come on.

890
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,400
That's right, down here!

891
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:36,400
Are you gonna stand with your thumb
up your ass or get me outta here?

892
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
This just came in.

893
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,600
Is this gonna upset me?

894
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,500
I think it's safe to say that.

895
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,300
Are you familiar with a potato dish,
lyonnaise potato?

896
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,100
It's a kind of fried potato.

897
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:05,000
But it's got an onion in it.
It's quite delicious.

898
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,800
It really goes beautifully
with steak, chops...

899
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,600
hamburger, cheeseburger,
any of your meat dishes.

900
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:17,400
It's just that
I have enough money to buy...

901
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,300
as much lyonnaise potatoes
as you ever...

902
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,200
Shut the fuck up.

903
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:27,300
I think you oughta think about it
a little bit, because it's nothing...

904
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,200
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

905
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,100
Oh, thank you, thank you.

906
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,900
Cover that.

907
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,700
Think you could give us a ride
to the next town?

908
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,600
Sure, jump in the back.
- Thanks a lot.

909
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,400
For every shit,
there's six nice people.

910
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,000
What's that?
- It's "hello".

911
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,900
I can say hello
in a lot of different languages.

912
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Not yours, but a lot of them.

913
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,700
Welcome, sir.

914
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,200
I'm not lookin' forward to this.
- You think I am?

915
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,000
I don't understand your problem.
The guy's an accountant.

916
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,000
It's been bad luck.
Plus Walsh is good.

917
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,800
If he's that good,
maybe I should hire him to hit you.

918
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,800
I hope there's no chance of any of this
coming back to Jimmy.

919
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,600
No chance. Rented the chopper
out of Kansas City.

920
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,500
He's five times removed from you.
You're clear of this.

921
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,400
Clear as shit, you fuckin' moron!
The guy's still out there.

922
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,300
Let me tell you something.
I'm not interested...

923
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,400
in seeing either of you alive again
until you get the accountant, got it?

924
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,400
The end of the ride.
- This is it?

925
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,200
Is there a real town around here?

926
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:00,200
Channing's.

927
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,100
Yeah.

928
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,000
How far is that?
- Thirty miles.

929
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,100
Thirty miles. Jesus Christ.

930
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,700
What the hell kind of town is this?

931
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,900
Is there someone that can give us
a ride to Channing?

932
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,800
Is anyone going in that direction?
- No have a ride.

933
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,800
Excuse me. Is there a bathroom
in there I could use?

934
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,400
Is there a telephone here?
Telephone.

935
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,300
No telephone.

936
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,500
No telephone? Nothing.

937
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,100
Yeah, glad you're having a good time.

938
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,700
Fear of flying, you son of a bitch!

939
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,800
Get back here, you son of a bitch!

940
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,500
Get over here.

941
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,600
Stop!

942
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,200
Fear of flying, my ass!
You son of a bitch, get out!

943
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,800
You're a goddamn pilot,
you son of a bitch?

944
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,700
I didn't feel it was appropriate
to share that with you.

945
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,800
I'm gonna fuckin' appropriate your head!
How do you turn this off?

946
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,300
Turn it off!

947
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,400
Hang in there.
I'm gonna let it down easy.

948
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,900
Oh, shit!

949
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,000
You're a goddamn pilot?

950
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,900
You're a pilot?
I'll show you pilot!

951
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,900
You'll love the coffee shop I'm opening
after I dump you and get my $100 grand.

952
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,400
All right, get back!

953
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,300
Get back! Everybody, back!

954
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,100
Give me the keys to the truck.
- You can't steal their truck.

955
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,300
You were about to steal a plane!
- I'm trying to save my life!

956
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,200
I should give 'em something.

957
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,800
Give me your watch.
- My watch? Shit!

958
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,700
Keep it.
It's worth a lot of money.

959
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,500
Get in. Stand back!

960
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,700
Get in. Get in!

961
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,300
Let's be fair about this.

962
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,100
You lied to me first.
At the river.

963
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,100
Get the...

964
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,000
At the river!

965
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,900
You lied to me first.
You got some fuckin' nerve.

966
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,900
No, you lied to me first.
- You lied to me first.

967
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:29,500
Yes! I lied to you first,
but you had no knowledge I was lying...

968
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,400
about my fear of flying at the river
when you lied to me first.

969
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:37,200
So as far as you knew,
you lied to me first.

970
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,000
I can't argue with you.
I don't know what you're talking about.

971
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,900
You're saying you lied to me first
as far as you knew.

972
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,800
What's the matter?
- I got an ulcer.

973
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,600
Yeah, I've got a fuckin' ulcer.
All your bullshit started it bleeding.

974
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,500
You know why you have an ulcer? Because
you have two forms of expression.

975
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,600
Silence and rage!

976
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,200
Get some milk to coat it.

977
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,000
Don't tell me what I need.
I need something to eat.

978
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,200
What will we buy it with? Dirt?

979
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,100
Drive to the next town.
I'll take care of it.

980
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,700
You'll take care of it?
What do you mean?

981
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,900
Drive to the next town.

982
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,700
But you lied first.

983
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,000
Now what?
- Give me that FBl badge.

984
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,900
The FBl badge?

985
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah, the FBl badge.

986
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,400
Uncuff me.

987
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,200
Uncuff you?
- Uncuff me.

988
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:50,100
Do you want to eat a nice meal?

989
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,000
Want some of that shit you eat?

990
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,200
Come on, uncuff me.

991
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,600
You fuck with me...

992
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,500
You'll hit me on the head
and drop in a thing.

993
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,600
Uncuff me.

994
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,000
Who's in charge here?
- Who wants to know?

995
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:18,000
Me.

996
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,900
The manager.

997
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I'd like to see the manager
as soon as possible.

998
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,000
Yes, sir.

999
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,700
Sorry.

1000
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,300
Yeah?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBl.

1001
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,800
We've been tracking counterfeiters
passing phony $20 bills.

1002
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,700
Have you received any $20 bills
in the last couple of hours?

1003
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
Sure, all the time.

1004
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,500
You get them all the time.
Would you take two steps backwards?

1005
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,400
Would you mind
opening the register?

1006
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,900
Don't touch 'em.

1007
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,800
Excuse me.

1008
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,700
Contract two, Hank.
Check 'em out.

1009
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,800
Give him a pencil, please.

1010
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,500
Do the litmus configuration.

1011
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:29,200
You're doing the litmus configuration?
- Litmus configuration.

1012
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:37,900
You seen any suspicious-looking
characters around here?

1013
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:41,700
Do you live around here?
- Yeah.

1014
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,500
How's it look?
- This one's bad.

1015
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,900
Describe what the last man who passed
a $20 bill looked like.

1016
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,900
Thirty. Tall.

1017
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,800
About six feet tall?
- Six-five.

1018
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,900
Dark brown hair?
- Light colored.

1019
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,600
Sounds like our man.
- That's him.

1020
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,500
We have to take these bills
for evidence. Make 'em a receipt.

1021
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,400
This one's bad, too.

1022
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,300
Notify the other establishments
of the situation.

1023
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,200
What's the name of your establishment?
- Red's Corner Bar.

1024
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,300
Are you Red?

1025
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,900
Do you dye your hair?

1026
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,100
Why do they call you Red?

1027
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,800
It's short for Red Wood.
My last name's Wood.

1028
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,900
What's your first name?
- Bill.

1029
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,500
Thank you for your cooperation, Bill.

1030
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Hank.

1031
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,400
These are all bad.
Those are good.

1032
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,500
We're gonna get this train.
- What?

1033
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,400
We're gonna catch this train.
- I can't catch a train.

1034
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:02,100
You also couldn't fly. Start runnin'.
- Wait! It's a freight train!

1035
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,300
I can't do this!

1036
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,800
I deeply feel I can't do this!

1037
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,600
You like to travel by train.
Get up there!

1038
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,100
What are you doin'?
- You promise to let me go?

1039
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,000
Open the fuckin' door!
- See you in the next life.

1040
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,900
Son of a bitch!

1041
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Open that fuckin' door!

1042
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:53,000
Glad to see me?
I guess we're in the next life.

1043
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,900
Don't overreact now.
- Don't overreact.

1044
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,800
I won't overreact!
Get over here!

1045
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,900
React? You do this again,
I'll throw you off the fuckin' train!

1046
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,600
It's a bad...

1047
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:07,400
Put your hand in there!
- All right. Easy, Jack.

1048
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,600
There!
You son of a bitch!

1049
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:17,300
You shut up! I'm not talking
to you for the rest of this trip!

1050
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,700
Are you guys gonna let me go?
I don't know anything.

1051
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,700
Is that a fact?

1052
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,900
Shit.

1053
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,400
Why don't you quit?
Be cheaper for both of us.

1054
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Where are they?
- You got me.

1055
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,700
Inspector?
- Shut up!

1056
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,500
You listen, you son of a bitch.
I want answers right now!

1057
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,700
What do you want?
I don't know nothin'.

1058
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:06,000
It seems that an Agent Alonzo Mosely
and his partner...

1059
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,100
were seen hopping a westbound
freight train near Channing.

1060
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,900
Come on.

1061
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,100
Jack? What?

1062
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,700
How much further?
None of your fuckin' business!

1063
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,600
Eventually I'll have to go
to the bathroom.

1064
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,700
Shut the fuck up!

1065
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,400
Did you ever have sex with an animal?

1066
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,900
Remember those chickens
around the Indian reservation?

1067
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,800
There's some good-lookin' chickens.
You know, between us.

1068
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,800
There were a couple there
I might have taken a shot at.

1069
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,400
What's with you and that watch?

1070
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,200
You told me about
your feelings for chickens.

1071
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,100
How private could the watch be?

1072
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,300
What's the big secret?

1073
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,900
Gail bought me this watch.
It was the first thing she ever gave me.

1074
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:34,300
She bought it because I was always late
at least a half an hour.

1075
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:39,300
So she bought it and set it ahead a
half an hour so I'd never be late.

1076
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,600
Somewhere in the back of my mind I keep
thinking we'll wind up together again.

1077
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:54,700
I don't know why I'm still hangin' on,
I'm still waitin' around.

1078
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,400
I don't think she's comin' back.

1079
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,200
I don't either.

1080
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Sometimes you just have to let go.

1081
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:17,700
Just get yourself a new watch.

1082
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:26,400
You're okay.

1083
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,200
I think under
different circumstances...

1084
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,800
you and I...

1085
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:37,900
probably still would've
hated each other.

1086
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,600
We probably could've been friends.

1087
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,200
In the next life.

1088
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,300
Yeah, the next life.

1089
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Great.
Accommodations were wonderful.

1090
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,800
You got a smoke?
- Don't smoke.

1091
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:08,400
That Fed took my cigarettes.
- You want your cigarettes back?

1092
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,300
You'll have to go to Flagstaff
to get 'em...

1093
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,400
'cause that's where
your pal Mosely went.

1094
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,200
Just might do that.

1095
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:24,700
Where are we?

1096
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:30,700
My guess is Arizona. We've been going
west all night. I think we're near home.

1097
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,500
I'm almost dead.

1098
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,900
Look, the witness protection program
isn't so bad.

1099
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,800
They'll give you a new name,
a new life.

1100
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:50,700
I won't make it
to any witness protection program.

1101
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,600
You don't know that.
- I know that, and you know that.

1102
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:56,400
Serrano's gonna get to me before I get
to any witness protection program.

1103
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,300
Do me a favor.

1104
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,200
Don't pretend you care about me.
It really insults my intelligence.

1105
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:07,000
Let's face it. The only important thing
about me to you is getting your money.

1106
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,900
I'm tired of you making me out
to be some thug...

1107
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,700
whose only concern
is a big chunk of change.

1108
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,700
Did you know Serrano's people
offered me a million bucks for you?

1109
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,500
Why don't you go for the big money?
You're doing his work for him anyway.

1110
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,400
Working for him... You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

1111
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,400
I do this shit 'cause I wouldn't work
for that low-life asshole.

1112
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:31,200
What does that mean?
- Nothing. It doesn't mean anything.

1113
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:38,900
Serrano is the heroin dealer
you told me about in Chicago?

1114
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,600
Who owned your buddies and destroyed
your life? That's Serrano?

1115
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:50,200
That's the guy
that you're takin' me in...

1116
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,300
That's the guy
that's gonna kill me?

1117
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Hope it's a wonderful coffee shop.

1118
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,900
Come on, we're gettin' off here.
- What?

1119
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,800
We are getting off here,
Mr. Railroad Man. Come on.

1120
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,900
What? No! What are you talking about?
Let's discuss this.

1121
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:40,100
Find anything?
- Not yet.

1122
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:44,200
They could've jumped off the train
anywhere along the line.

1123
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
Trains have regularly scheduled stops.

1124
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,400
The reason is 'cause people plan
to get off the trains when they stop.

1125
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:02,200
That's how, generally, people do it.
They don't throw each other off.

1126
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:06,000
That's the purpose of having stops.

1127
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:10,100
What's this?
What are you gonna do now?

1128
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:14,900
What are you doin'?

1129
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:22,300
Oh, Christ! Christ!
Come on! Are you kidding?

1130
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,200
They're gonna come out and shoot us,
for Chris sake.

1131
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,300
What the hell?

1132
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,200
Jesus. Oh, great!

1133
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:38,700
You get it started,
and I'll run you over.

1134
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,800
That's the best plan
I can think of.

1135
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,600
Congratulations. Another crime.

1136
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,500
Come on.

1137
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:55,200
I don't like anything you do,
to tell you the truth. Nothing.

1138
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,600
Where are we going?
- To the nearest airport.

1139
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:20,200
I'm not the kind of guy that says,
"l told ya so".

1140
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,000
Shit!

1141
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,500
They've been spotted
35 miles south of here near Sedona.

1142
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,400
There are officers in pursuit.

1143
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,600
Take the chopper.

1144
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
This is the kind of situation
where something bad happens.

1145
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,700
Easy!

1146
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,600
Goddamn it!
I don't like this!

1147
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:18,700
Truck!

1148
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:59,100
Where are we going?
- You'll find out when we get there.

1149
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,100
I've come too far.
Too far.

1150
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,200
I'm too close.

1151
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,900
Okay, I'm coming!
All right.

1152
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,700
Come on.
- Right.

1153
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,000
Here we go.

1154
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:32,200
Hello!

1155
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,700
Am I lucky or am I just good?

1156
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,700
Is that Marvin?
- Fuckin' "A", I'm the best.

1157
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,600
Hello, Jack, ya dumb shit.

1158
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:59,100
Come on, you fuckin' pain in the ass!
- Wait a minute!

1159
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,900
If you move,
I'll tear your fuckin' lungs out!

1160
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,600
See you in L.A.

1161
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,600
Shit!

1162
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,800
Afternoon, sir.

1163
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,600
You open?
- We're always open.

1164
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,200
Hard day?

1165
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,100
Hard week.

1166
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,000
I know what you mean.

1167
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,200
I could use a cup of coffee.

1168
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:28,400
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1169
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,200
Keep it.

1170
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:51,400
Gee, I've been lookin' all over
for these. Thanks, Alonzo.

1171
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:00,800
Marvin, I have to tell ya,
I have this very serious fear of flying.

1172
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:04,900
Yeah? Why don't you just relax
and sleep through it?

1173
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,300
Forget your deadline. It's over.
That's the way that one went.

1174
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,300
I know my rights.
You owe me phone calls.

1175
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:17,100
Phone calls are not of paramount
importance to you right now.

1176
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,000
It's that you're gonna spend ten years
for impersonating a federal agent.

1177
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:24,100
Ten years for impersonating a Fed?
How come no one's after you?

1178
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,300
Give this guy his calls.

1179
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,500
Thanks.

1180
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:41,300
Can I have a little privacy, please?

1181
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,600
Mascone Bail Bonds.

1182
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,700
It's Jack Walsh. Put Eddie on.
- It's Jack.

1183
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:02,200
This better be good news
because you got five hours left.

1184
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:06,100
It's not. I'm calling to let you know
that you're a dead motherfucker.

1185
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:07,000
Wait a minute.

1186
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,900
You put Marvin on this case,
you fuckin' piece of shit.

1187
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,800
You fucking deceptive... You vermin!
- Are you fuckin' done yet?

1188
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:16,600
You slime ball in a sea of pus!
What?

1189
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,600
You blew it, all right?

1190
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:21,400
You had the guy four fuckin' days.
Four days!

1191
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:26,200
You could've walked him backwards
and not blown it, but you blew it.

1192
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:30,100
When have I ever let you down,
you fuckin' rat?

1193
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,900
Are you nuts, telling Dorfler
I offered you $100.000...

1194
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,800
when I told him I'd give him $25.000?

1195
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:37,800
Wait a minute.
When did you speak to him?

1196
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,700
What's the difference?
- When did you speak to Marvin?

1197
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:44,500
He called me ten minutes ago
tellin' me to go fuck myself.

1198
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,400
Everybody's tellin' me
to go fuck myself.

1199
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,300
Am I supposed to just sit
on my fuckin' butt?

1200
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,200
Eddie, Eddie,
what are you talkin' about?

1201
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:55,000
You got five hours left. Can you bring
the fuckin' Duke in, yes or no?

1202
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:57,000
I thought he's bringin' him.

1203
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,800
I just talked to fuckin' Dorfler.
He don't have the Duke.

1204
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,700
What?
- Where's the fuckin' Duke?

1205
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,600
Hello?
- I'll talk to you later.

1206
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,800
Jack!

1207
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,100
Hello?
- Tony Darvo, please?

1208
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,200
Who's calling?
- Marvin Dorfler.

1209
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:50,700
Yo?
- Shall I put Marvin Dorfler through?

1210
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,600
Yeah, put him through.

1211
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,500
Marvin, everything's still
on schedule, pal, isn't it?

1212
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,400
So Dorfler's working for you guys.

1213
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,300
Who is this?
- This is Jack Walsh.

1214
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:04,200
Jack, what are you complaining for?
We came to you first, didn't we?

1215
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:07,300
It's Jack Walsh.
Hold on. Somebody wants to say hello.

1216
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,900
Hey, too late for you, scumbag.

1217
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,800
No, too late for you. I didn't come
this far not to collect my money.

1218
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,600
You understand me?
I want the Duke back.

1219
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:21,400
What the fuck you telling me for?
- What am I telling you for?

1220
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,400
I'll tell you what
I'm telling you for.

1221
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:28,200
I got some of the Duke's belongings,
including computer disks telling...

1222
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:32,000
of Serrano's businesses, his
money-laundering operations, everything.

1223
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,900
If I don't get the Duke back
in the next two hours...

1224
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,800
I'm gonna turn those disks over
to the Feds, do you hear me?

1225
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:42,600
I wanna meet Serrano with the Duke
in two hours at McCarran Airport...

1226
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,500
where we'll make the exchange.

1227
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,600
He's the only one who won't try
to take a shot at me in a public place.

1228
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,500
If I see one goon within a mile
of that airport...

1229
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:54,100
Listen to me carefully, the deal is off.
and I'm goin' to the Feds.

1230
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,000
I ain't gonna bother Jimmy
with your bullshit.

1231
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,900
You're not? Fine.

1232
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,800
After he's busted, I'll make sure
to let him know you knew beforehand.

1233
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:04,600
That's two hours from now,
McCarran Airport.

1234
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:07,800
You got that, moron?
Have a nice day.

1235
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,400
Tell Alonzo I wanna make a deal.

1236
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:30,800
You wanna make a deal with me?

1237
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,700
What would you do
if I deliver Serrano?

1238
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:39,200
What do you mean, "deliver"?
- Conspiracy to destroy evidence.

1239
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,100
What government evidence?

1240
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,300
Will you let me take the Duke back
myself and collect my money?

1241
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,600
Tell me more.

1242
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,700
I'll tell you on the way. We have
to be in Las Vegas in two hours.

1243
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:18,800
Marvin!
- No, it's room service.

1244
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:33,900
Here, hold this up
so they know I took this today.

1245
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I amaze myself.
I'm always thinkin'.

1246
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:40,700
Got it all figured out.

1247
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,600
Say "cheese".

1248
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,800
Don't do this.

1249
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,600
Adios.

1250
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,100
There are no real computer disks.
Is that right?

1251
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,100
Right.

1252
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:58,900
If you give him blank disks and
he accepts them, is that an overt act?

1253
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,700
If he just sets foot inside the airport,
he's committed an overt act:

1254
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,700
conspiracy to obstruct justice.

1255
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,600
When he shows up with the Duke,
you add kidnapping.

1256
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,500
Anybody packing a gun:
conspiracy to commit murder.

1257
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:13,300
The fact it's an airport, and Alonzo,
correct me if you think I'm wrong...

1258
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:16,400
you can slap an interstate
transportation racketeering rap on him.

1259
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:21,900
None of that means anything unless
you can get him to take those disks.

1260
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,800
Don't worry.
I'll get him to take the disks.

1261
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:27,000
Get a wire on this man.

1262
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:43,300
No hard feelings about
what happened in Amarillo, huh?

1263
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,700
Just one of those
spur-of-the-moment deals.

1264
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,600
Where is he?
- Where's the money?

1265
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:54,800
In the car.
Where is he?

1266
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:02,300
Change of plans. I want two million.
- What?

1267
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,100
I read the newspapers.
The guy got you for 15 million, right?

1268
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,200
So I figure he's gotta be worth
at least two.

1269
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,100
I'm a businessman.

1270
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,000
How do we know you got him?

1271
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,600
I want one million now...

1272
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,300
then I'll call ya in 20 minutes...

1273
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,100
tell you where to drop off
the second million.

1274
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:34,200
Once I know it's there,
then I'll tell ya where he is, okay?

1275
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Not okay.
- Why not?

1276
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,400
Are you nuts? What's Jimmy gonna say?
How are we gonna get the Duke now?

1277
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,500
You got the answer in your hand.
- What are you talkin' about?

1278
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,200
Think. When are you gonna learn
how to pay attention?

1279
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:55,300
Look. See what it says there?

1280
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,700
All right, this is it.
Tonight is the fuckin' night.

1281
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,600
You understand?
I'm sick of all these screw-ups.

1282
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:10,400
As soon as I get the disks from Walsh,
you drop Walsh and the Duke.

1283
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,300
Understand? I get the disks,
you drop them. Okay?

1284
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,200
You shouldn't do this.

1285
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:19,100
Really?
What do you propose I do?

1286
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:22,000
Send somebody with a cash offer,
but don't do this.

1287
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:23,900
I know Walsh.
He won't take any money from me.

1288
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,800
He's a self-righteous guy.
It aggravates me.

1289
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:30,600
In his mind, this is clean. He gets
what he wants, I get what I want.

1290
01:43:30,700 --> 01:43:32,500
The guy's a fuckin' burnout.

1291
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:37,500
Sit down, relax. Have a sandwich,
glass of milk. Do some fuckin' thing.

1292
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,700
He's on his way.

1293
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:11,900
He's heading north
on Las Vegas Boulevard.

1294
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,800
Two miles from the airport.
We're on him.

1295
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:16,700
Why are you smiling?

1296
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,800
I feel like a cop again.

1297
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:11,400
I'm finally in the presence
of greatness, huh?

1298
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:14,300
The Duke.

1299
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,200
The guy that steals money
from the scum of the earth...

1300
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:19,300
and gives it to the unfortunates
of the world.

1301
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,200
I wanted to meet you face-to-face.

1302
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:31,800
Did you actually think you were gonna
steal my money and get away with it?

1303
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,300
I stopped by here
to tell you two things.

1304
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,500
Number one is that
you're gonna die tonight.

1305
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:44,000
Number two, I'm gonna go home...

1306
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:46,000
have a nice hot meal.

1307
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:50,000
I'm gonna find your wife,
and I'm gonna kill her, too.

1308
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:02,500
Joey, wait here for my call.
The rest of you start headin' in.

1309
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:19,800
Here he comes.

1310
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:34,900
Jack, long time, no see.
- Long time, no see.

1311
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,900
You're still spendin'
all your money on clothes.

1312
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,800
You know.

1313
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:40,000
While you're in town...

1314
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:45,500
if you wanna see as how, want
a free meal, let me know, it's on me.

1315
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,400
That's the type of guy I am.
- You're a real sport.

1316
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:51,300
Just give him the disks.

1317
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:55,100
How's your mother?
- She's all right.

1318
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,200
Daughter's gettin' big?
Growing up?

1319
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:05,700
I was thinkin' maybe if we would've
done business way back when...

1320
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:08,800
you wouldn't look like a guy
with a fuckin' cup in your hand.

1321
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,400
I'm trying to make a living.

1322
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,600
Jack, you got those disks...

1323
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:16,400
or did you lose them
like you lost your job?

1324
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,200
Give him the disks, Walsh.

1325
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,900
I see you, but I don't see the Duke.

1326
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
We'll worry about him in a minute.
- We'll worry about him now.

1327
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:33,500
Let me tell you something, Jimmy,
this isn't a reunion.

1328
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,600
If I don't see the Duke
in about five seconds, I'm walkin'.

1329
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,200
You know,
you're still way too serious.

1330
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:44,100
Really. Listen, why don't you
hand over the tapes?

1331
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,900
We'll go get the guy together.
- I'll see you at the arraignment.

1332
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,800
Hey Jack.

1333
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:51,000
Where is he going?

1334
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,700
You win. All right?
- I what?

1335
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,800
You won. You want me to yell it
over this airport?

1336
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,600
Where is he?

1337
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:06,100
He's on his way.
- I said no goons.

1338
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:09,000
Never mind him. You'll get what
you want. Didn't I just tell you that?

1339
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:13,100
This is gonna give me a heart attack.
I know I'm gonna have a heart attack.

1340
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:28,400
Since we have this moment,
there's something I've meant to ask you.

1341
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:37,100
Doesn't it bother you that
another copper is fuckin' your wife?

1342
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:41,900
Do you know they made
this guy a captain?

1343
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:46,700
Can you imagine that? Go figure.
Made him a captain.

1344
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:57,000
May I help you, sir?
- Give me a one-way ticket to L.A.

1345
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:59,200
One-way ticket to Los Angeles.

1346
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,800
Will that be smoking or non-smoking?

1347
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:05,700
Take a wild guess.

1348
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,800
Smoking.

1349
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:20,300
How will you be paying for this, sir?

1350
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,900
Shit. Look.
- What is it?

1351
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,300
What the hell is he doing here?

1352
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:43,100
A male Caucasian carrying a green
duffel bag, approaching the subjects.

1353
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:46,000
Get him out of there as quickly
and quietly as possible.

1354
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:49,100
Shoot him if you have to,
but get him out of here.

1355
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:51,700
You okay?

1356
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,700
Stand behind me.

1357
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:56,500
It's all right.

1358
01:49:56,600 --> 01:49:58,700
All right, come on.

1359
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,400
How's everybody doin'?
- Will you get outta here?

1360
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,300
Back off!.

1361
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:06,200
Who the fuck are you?
- Writing a book? Who the fuck are you?

1362
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:08,100
Who is this guy?
- Jesus.

1363
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:11,200
Marvin, you're missin'
the bigger picture here. Get out.

1364
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,800
Wire's dead.

1365
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:16,900
I didn't come all this way
for nothing.

1366
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:20,800
Serrano's leaving. I don't know.
- Did he take the disks?

1367
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:25,600
Serrano's got the disks.
- Let him go.

1368
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:29,400
Did he or didn't he take the disks?
- I couldn't tell.

1369
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,200
Serrano's got the disks.
He's got the disks.

1370
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,800
Marvin, look out!

1371
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:42,600
Look out!
- I'm not falling for that shit again!

1372
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:43,600
Marvin, look out!

1373
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:45,500
You stupid fuck, look out!

1374
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:49,600
Serrano's got the disks!
- Move in.

1375
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:01,100
Take it easy! Come on!

1376
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:04,900
Ow! Goddamn it!
Who the fuck are you guys?

1377
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:13,400
Jimmy, there's something I've been
wanting to say to you for ten years.

1378
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,200
What's that?
- You're under arrest.

1379
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:19,100
We'll catch up to each other
one of these days.

1380
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,300
Maybe we will.

1381
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:23,900
We still got our deal?
- We got our deal.

1382
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,800
Wait a minute! What deal? Why the fuck
does he get special treatment?

1383
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:31,800
See you in L.A.
- Watch your cigarettes with this guy.

1384
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,500
What's goin' on?

1385
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,500
Sorry. I got an hour and a half
to get you back to L.A. Thanks, Alonzo.

1386
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,100
Mascone Bail Bonds.

1387
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,000
Hello, Eddie, where's Jerry?

1388
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:25,800
Never mind Jerry. Where are you?
Feds picked him up 20 minutes ago.

1389
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:28,700
Yeah? What for?
- What's the difference?

1390
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,600
I never trusted that guy.
Where the hell are you?

1391
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,500
Where am I? I'm at the airport.

1392
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,500
Guess who I'm with.
I'm with the Duke.

1393
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:39,300
You got him!
You got him, Jack! I love you!

1394
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:42,200
Yeah. You wanna say hello?
- Yeah. Put him on.

1395
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:44,100
Yeah, say hello.
- Hello.

1396
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:47,000
Hello, you son of a bitch!
We got you...

1397
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,900
you son of a bitch!

1398
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,700
Now say good-bye, ya lying piece
of shit, because I'm lettin' him go.

1399
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:53,900
Jack?

1400
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,600
Would've been a nice coffee shop.

1401
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:06,400
Oh, Jesus.

1402
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:10,200
Holy Chri... I don't get it.

1403
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,000
I did what I wanted to do.
I got you to L.A. before midnight.

1404
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,400
I don't know what to say.

1405
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:29,400
Don't say anything. Knowin' you, you'll
make me wanna put those back on you.

1406
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,100
Thanks.
- No, thank you.

1407
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,200
Thank you.

1408
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,900
Something to remember
our adventure by.

1409
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,200
This better be good.

1410
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,100
This is good.

1411
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
This is very good.

1412
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:12,400
When I was making my getaway,
I thought the FBl was closing in on me.

1413
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:15,300
Take it.
I took some traveling money.

1414
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:17,400
Take it.

1415
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:23,200
It's not a payoff. It's a gift.
You already let me go.

1416
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
You son of a bitch.

1417
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:30,700
You son of a bitch.
- I told you I had money.

1418
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:33,800
I know you had money,
but I didn't know you had money.

1419
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:45,300
How much is here?
- Neighborhood of $300.000.

1420
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:53,000
That's a very respectable neighborhood.

1421
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,700
I don't know what to say.

1422
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:02,600
Take care.

1423
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:07,100
Take care.
- See ya in the next life.

1424
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,300
See ya in the next life.

1425
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,800
Do you know what time it is?
- Twenty-five to 12:00.

1426
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:41,700
Twenty-five to 12:00.

1427
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:43,900
I would've made it.

1428
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,000
Would you have change for a thousand?

1429
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:02,100
Are you a comedian?
Get outta here, ya bum!

1430
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:11,700
Looks like I'm walkin'.
