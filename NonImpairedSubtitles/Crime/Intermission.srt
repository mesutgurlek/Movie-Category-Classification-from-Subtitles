1
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,807
Oh, yeah. I've been round the block.

2
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:29,671
Really?
- Believe it.

3
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:33,601
Sowed me oats.
Acted the rip, the rapscallion.

4
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:36,244
Ran wild, ran free.

5
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,341
Of course, this all back in the days of yore.

6
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:41,421
Right. You wouldn't think it to look at you.

7
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:45,590
Yeah, well, time comes, you have to
leave behind the old hell-raising.

8
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:47,723
Take some responsibility for your life.

9
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:49,762
Prepare the groundwork.
- How do you do that?

10
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,560
Well, to begin with, I'd say by nest-building.

11
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:54,862
You have to find an abode
you feel secure in.

12
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:56,562
Then you have to furnish that abode...

13
00:00:56,636 --> 00:00:59,366
procure the necessaries: Furniture, etc.

14
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:01,734
Kitchen utensils, your wok...

15
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:04,543
your juicers.
- What about love?

16
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:09,378
Well, love's not something
you can plan for, is it?

17
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:11,178
Look all you like as long as you like...

18
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:13,218
but it's only when you let your guard down...

19
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,686
When you least expect...
- That you find someone.

20
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:18,020
Take myself for example.
You ever see me before?

21
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:19,217
No.

22
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:23,228
I've just ambled in, right? But who's to say
by tomorrow, you and me couldn't...

23
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:25,161
and I'm not coming on to you or anything...

24
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:28,133
but who's to say
we couldn't be head-over-heels?

25
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:29,293
Dancing in the Green?

26
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,927
Nobody.
- Right.

27
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:41,647
When there's something there...
- Chemistry.

28
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:43,945
Right. Who knows
where the sparks will lead?

29
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,574
A fella like myself, a stranger...

30
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:48,245
could just be a bit of fun in the sack,
no more.

31
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:51,324
Or, and it's not that crazy...

32
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:53,483
your soul mate.

33
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,554
Yeah, you've got a point.

34
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,327
On the other hand,
I could just be a thief or something.

35
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:01,627
What do you mean?

36
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:04,329
Some villain,
just waiting for my chance to...

37
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:09,672
smack your jaw and rob the register
while the place is empty.

38
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:19,943
But this is the thing of it, see?

39
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:23,152
You just never know...

40
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:28,289
what's gonna happen.

41
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:35,958
Come here. Look at your top!

42
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:39,866
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you? It's all over you.

43
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,032
What are you doing?

44
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:44,133
Get back over here
before I fucking slap you...

45
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,802
Get out of the way!

46
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,110
He's heading for the stairs.

47
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,785
Come on, youse humpy cunts.

48
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,589
Get out of my fucking way.

49
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,591
He's running out to the car park.

50
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,857
Come back here with that!

51
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,731
Get out of the car!

52
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:13,898
Get out of the fucking car!

53
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,837
Shouldn't you have been here
last time round?

54
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:45,997
I should have, but fuck it.

55
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:47,232
An hour late.

56
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:49,901
An hour less there, man. Fucking dump.

57
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,206
Don't start. You the same?

58
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:56,306
Fucking bus, fucking city.
Here's this fuck now.

59
00:03:56,683 --> 00:04:00,141
Is it too early to use my pass?
- You know it is.

60
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,221
How much is it to the barn?

61
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:05,723
You know how much.
Come on, there's people here late.

62
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,160
Another 10 cents. Come on.

63
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:13,893
Will youse come on?
- Hold your...

64
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,332
Hurry up.

65
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:16,594
Now.

66
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,497
You robbing bastard, you.

67
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,910
How's Cathy?
- She ordered in a kitchen.

68
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,241
You're joking. New floor not enough?
- Do you believe her?

69
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,650
You wanna see this floor, though.
Oak slats, lovely grain running through it.

70
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:38,521
Trouble is, this shit costs,
and there's only so much overtime going.

71
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:41,152
Fucking shit.
- It's all shit, man.

72
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:42,717
Fucking life.

73
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,132
Mega brand kidney beans,
baked beans, butter beans.

74
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:53,764
Any two for the price of one.
It's a reduction rampage.

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,105
What did you say?
- I say, 'Why not?'

76
00:04:57,344 --> 00:05:01,246
She says, 'Because you're not my type.'
I say, 'Well, what is your type?'

77
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:04,043
You know what she said?
'Everything you're not.'

78
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,174
Jesus.

79
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,721
Didn't score in a single department.
Fucking wank, man.

80
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,120
Next time?
- What?

81
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:15,286
That's easy enough for you to say,
sitting pretty as you are, man.

82
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:17,919
What?
- Sitting pretty. You've Deirdre there...

83
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:20,694
Oscar, me and Deirdre broke up.

84
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,296
What? When?
- Few weeks back.

85
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,803
Weeks? Why didn't you tell me then?

86
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,938
How the hell did it happen?

87
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:37,275
It was felt we should take a bit of a break.

88
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,784
Felt by who? By her, yeah?

89
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:41,747
John.

90
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:43,583
Oscar.

91
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:53,329
Are youse not clocking back on?

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,862
Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,403
Hang on.

94
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:13,016
Youse clocked on 15 minutes ago.

95
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:16,319
Get back on that floor, youse little pups.

96
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,920
That's a strike now against each of you.

97
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:21,920
John.

98
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:28,862
That's your second,
after your lateness this morning.

99
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:33,234
One more, and a certain ass will be kicked.

100
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,809
I shit you not, as they say in the States.

101
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:47,049
So, yeah, that was the only place left.
And it was cheap as well.

102
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,921
But Henry wouldn't take it
because they rape white women there.

103
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,458
Who does?
- I don't know. Everyone.

104
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,254
Henry said some fella he knows
was driving round there...

105
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,763
him and his girlfriend.
They were stopped by the cops.

106
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:02,632
One held a gun on him, the other one
raped her. And then they switched.

107
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,760
They raped him, too?
- No.

108
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:07,203
Oh, the coppers switched.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:11,138
So you know, that's that. No sun this year.

110
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:15,444
Might go down to Wexford or something.
What about you and...

111
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:21,386
Did you ever smell these?
Smell lovely, they do.

112
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:22,944
Me and Deirdre?

113
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,152
Youse broke up, didn't you?
- How did you know?

114
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:30,026
That's all right then. I saw her
with some fella at the Zombie last night.

115
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:31,085
Who?

116
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:34,361
Some middle-aged fella. Kissing.
Some baldy fella.

117
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,432
Kissing a baldy fella?
- Holding hands and all, yeah.

118
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:40,166
Wexford isn't that bad, is it?

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,209
Get a caravan down there,
couple of weeks. What do you think?

120
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:46,074
If the sun comes out, sure we can paddle.

121
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:50,807
John. Come on, man.

122
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:10,297
Where is the baldy cunt? Where is he?

123
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,494
Sorry, Deirdre.

124
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,288
This isn't acceptable, Deirdre.

125
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:38,228
After what, five, six weeks? This is bollocks.

126
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:40,294
You don't fucking...

127
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:47,028
You don't just hook up
with the next fella walks by!

128
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:51,139
The only reason you would do that
is if you never cared the first place.

129
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,441
And that's cold, man.

130
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,240
That is the behavior of...

131
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:58,408
and I have no qualms about saying it,
a whore.

132
00:08:58,518 --> 00:09:02,010
And not with a heart of gold.
No, with a heart of stone.

133
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:05,715
A cold, dark fucking black heart, Deirdre.

134
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,922
That's what you have. And I'm glad
I found out. A dirty, black...

135
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:13,488
Does 'blackguard' come from blackheart?
- Don't know, man. You all right?

136
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:16,660
You blackguard, Deirdre.
That's all you are. Do you hear me?

137
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:19,068
Just a dirty fucking blackguard.

138
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:22,198
The body compensates, son.

139
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:24,970
Instead of mobility,
I've increased perception:

140
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:27,512
Sight and sound, smell, of course.

141
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,640
It's a fair trade, and I wouldn't go back.

142
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,016
Come on. Come on, a sup.

143
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:41,524
Taste, that's another one.

144
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:45,328
Have you ever tasted Guinness?
- Of course.

145
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:46,592
No you haven't.

146
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,965
You think you have.

147
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,662
Listen, I've gotta go, man.

148
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:55,536
Sorry and all, but my arm is fucked.

149
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,206
All right, boys.
- We're not holding your pint.

150
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:06,444
Why not?

151
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:10,318
Because then we've to listen to you.
- Wise to my ploys, aren't youse?

152
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,385
I thought it was her
who wanted to take the break.

153
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,552
How're you, Seamus?
Two brown sauce sambos.

154
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,062
Slap it on thick, no butter,
two pints of Guinness.

155
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,962
Right.
- Know what I mean?

156
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,591
No, it was me.

157
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:24,993
I just thought I'd give her a little test,
you know?

158
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:28,404
I say to her, 'Let's take a break.'
She says, 'Let's not.'

159
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:29,805
Then I know, see?

160
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,241
John.
- What?

161
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,176
What kind of fuckhead are you?

162
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:36,272
That pisses me all the way off.
- Why?

163
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:39,351
Could you not appreciate
what you fucking had?

164
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,954
I'm at a stage, man, I can't even wank.

165
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,818
Two brown sauce sambos.

166
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,824
You know?
- Cheers, Seamus.

167
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:48,258
Pulling away like a madman, man.

168
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:49,693
Two pints.

169
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:53,527
Half an hour, 45 minutes,
nothing fucking happens.

170
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,964
Can't get my fantasies clear in my head.

171
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,830
Couple of occasions,
I don't mind telling you...

172
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:04,967
I wept like a woman, the fucking frustration.

173
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,680
So you setting tests for Deirdre, man...

174
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:09,840
taking for granted
your good fucking fortune...

175
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,144
that disappoints me big style.

176
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:21,191
I'm gonna go home, you mind?
- You're what?

177
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:24,693
What you said there is right, man.
Hundred per cent.

178
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,997
You've just sent me into a state of turmoil.
- Wistful, are you?

179
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:30,965
Among other emotions.

180
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:36,308
Need to go home and reflect on my choices.
- You do what you have to do, man.

181
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:42,875
See you.

182
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:51,180
Fair play, man.

183
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,485
Right. Throw us on the floor.

184
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:57,924
Gently.

185
00:12:02,268 --> 00:12:03,462
Lovely.

186
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:13,871
Come here and I'll tell you. You there!

187
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:17,577
So how goes the fight against crime?
- All right.

188
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:20,585
It's never-fucking-ending, though.

189
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,753
See what I mean?

190
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:34,090
Have you not got a sign that says,
'Toilets for patrons' use only'?

191
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,259
I do.

192
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,467
I'll have to enforce that rule.

193
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,099
Give us another 7-UP there, will you?

194
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:51,644
All right, Lehiff?

195
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:54,486
Staying out of trouble?

196
00:12:55,988 --> 00:13:00,482
Jesus. Doesn't look like it.
Who did that to you?

197
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:05,862
Your old one, man.
She poked me in the eye with her cock.

198
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,594
You cheeky little fuck, you.

199
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,372
I'm watching you, do you hear me?

200
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:17,840
And if I find out
that you've been in any way bold...

201
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,571
I'm gonna nab you.

202
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:22,805
Now don't move.

203
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:27,951
Stay where you are and take your scolding.

204
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:43,831
Now, what do I want you to do?

205
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,868
Stay out of trouble.

206
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:51,469
Stay out of trouble.

207
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,446
That's right.

208
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:59,478
Fucking disrespect my old one.
Now, hang on till I shake.

209
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,323
All right.

210
00:14:09,295 --> 00:14:10,489
Go on.

211
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:29,345
So what's wrong with me? What did I do?

212
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:32,312
Or didn't I do?
- I told you, Noeleen, nothing.

213
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,613
It's just something that...
- Yeah, that happened.

214
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,553
You said that already,
and I don't believe you.

215
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,424
Is it my age?

216
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,225
Is it something I wouldn't do?
Is it my looks?

217
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:47,423
Wait a second. Look, don't you...

218
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,594
Wait! Don't you fancy me anymore?

219
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,695
Look. Listen to me.

220
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,330
It's nothing to do with you.

221
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:59,401
I fancy her, I fell for her.
We clicked, and we wanna be together.

222
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:02,578
You don't come into the equation, so relax.

223
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:08,620
Of course I come into the equation.
I'm your wife, for God's sake!

224
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:12,755
I'm your wife, Sam! 14 years!

225
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:15,653
What the hell did I do?

226
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:23,066
So this fella's moving in with you?
- Yes.

227
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,896
Well, what do you want me to do?
Be like Sally?

228
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,099
Give up on them altogether,
grow myself a 'tache?

229
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,574
Sally doesn't...
- Sally has a 'tache, Ma.

230
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:34,579
Whatever she did before,
bleached or waxed, she's quit.

231
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,339
Anyway, I'm better off.

232
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:42,143
Did you know John and Oscar
broke into Fruitfield a few months back...

233
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:46,919
stole a crate load of Chef Sauce?
And I know that wasn't the only time.

234
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,621
Chef Sauce?
- It was all they could get.

235
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:53,096
I'd be over at his place,
he's making sauce sandwiches.

236
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,531
Putting it in his cornflakes.

237
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,433
Trying to use it all up. In his tea.

238
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:02,764
I mean, he dumps me, Ma, breaks my heart...

239
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:06,400
and then has the gall to come over
and call me a whore and a blackguard...

240
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:09,004
for not taking the fucking vows?
Well, fuck him.

241
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,948
Him and his brown sauce. Sorry, Ma.

242
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:16,379
But I've got a guy who's well-off,
who's attractive...

243
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:18,787
Who's married.
- Well, you can't have it all.

244
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:21,884
Who's not a thief, but a bank manager.

245
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:24,729
And if he wants to move in with me...

246
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:28,096
then I think
I'd be some kind of a fool to say no.

247
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:34,235
Now, I'm gonna have the carrot cake.
What are you having?

248
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:38,938
All right, my friends, do Daddy proud.

249
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:41,203
Show them what you've got.

250
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,107
All right. You lads ready?

251
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:47,651
And action!

252
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:56,760
Come on, guys,
we've been through this before.

253
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:59,457
They'll get it, lads, just give them a second.

254
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,831
Don't fuck up on me here. Go!

255
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:08,539
For fuck's sake, how many times
have we rehearsed this, youse fucks. Go!

256
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,546
Get down. Martin, get back in the box.

257
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,317
Don't fight. Benny, get off him.

258
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:27,522
It is Little Big City, isn't it?
- Yeah.

259
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:28,958
That's what it's called.

260
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:32,088
Which says to me,
yeah, stories, yeah, characters.

261
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:34,359
There's a broad spectrum there.
- Diverse.

262
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:36,424
And that's what we're doing and that's fine.

263
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:39,665
But where that diversity is lacking is tone.

264
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:43,240
What are you saying?
- Tone, Thomas. Texture.

265
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,834
What I'm saying is,
let's go a bit darker now and again.

266
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:48,209
Find a subject
with a little bit more of an edge...

267
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,874
and explore that edge
with the weight it deserves.

268
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:52,610
What do you think?

269
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:55,210
A bit darker?
- Just a bit.

270
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:59,890
Just to spice the thing up.
Give it some depth, some complexity...

271
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,722
I know what you mean.

272
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,330
All right.

273
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,167
Go find a subject, bring it to me.

274
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:14,104
If it's not too much,
then I don't see why not.

275
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,407
Good enough?
- Absolutely.

276
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,055
What about this, Sally?

277
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:34,824
When's the last time you saw me in a dress?

278
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:37,089
Give me a voucher.

279
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,861
A gift voucher, please.

280
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:41,559
How much?
- Sorry?

281
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,799
How much for?
- €100, please.

282
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,169
No hundreds left. Do you want two fifties?
- Please.

283
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:55,711
No fifties. Five twenties do you?
- Fine.

284
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:11,390
Grab it.

285
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,835
It's a sty, my life.

286
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:27,209
The people I deal with are piss. Waste.
Is that what you're interested in?

287
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,009
I'm a fuck, man. I mean...

288
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:34,883
my only really human quality to speak of
is a fondness for Celtic mysticism.

289
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:37,020
What's that?

290
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,014
The music, man.

291
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,259
Artistes like...

292
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:46,765
Fainne Lasta, Raithneach,
Amhann na Ngealach, Clannad.

293
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:52,099
You like them artistes?
Their music? Of course you do.

294
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:57,838
But what I'm saying is,
the kind of justice I'm questing...

295
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:01,271
requires a certain attitude
that people might find...

296
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,679
you know, extreme or unpleasant.

297
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:06,608
It might not be suitable.

298
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,147
Grab it.

299
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:17,355
You ever compete?
- Just as a kid.

300
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,223
I could have turned pro...

301
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:23,735
except for I joined the Guards,
made crime my calling.

302
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:29,865
My da used to say, 'Hate your opponent.'

303
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:32,904
He was my trainer.

304
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:36,878
'Hate him,
and you'll never give less than 100%.'

305
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:41,142
That's a philosophy I still follow.

306
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,912
That's why I'm such an animal, man.

307
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,325
Is that what you want for your show?
- Yes.

308
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,827
Cool.
- It's exactly what I want.

309
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:55,463
I just have to run it by my boss.
Get the go off him and then we can...

310
00:20:55,534 --> 00:21:00,028
Run it by him.
Let him know I'm up for it, big time.

311
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:02,605
Fucking underbelly, you're saying?

312
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:09,142
No better fucking guide, man.

313
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:08,531
You nearly finished?
- Midnight. Yourself?

314
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:10,871
About 10 minutes.
- You lucky prick.

315
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:13,503
Gonna pick up
a chicken black bean, spring roll starter...

316
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:15,547
Will you come on? We've homes to go to.

317
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:17,081
Do you hear this?
- I know.

318
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:19,276
You'd think we were dogs or something.

319
00:22:19,385 --> 00:22:22,718
Are we moving or what?
- Will youse wait a minute?

320
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:24,413
Fuck's sake.

321
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:26,650
Listen, take it easy, yeah?

322
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:31,963
Where are we?

323
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:34,864
I can't see.

324
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,959
We near Springfield yet?

325
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:40,302
I'll give you a shout.

326
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:45,074
I was thinking we'd throw you
a birthday party. What do you think?

327
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:48,944
I don't want one, Ma.
Don't believe in that party fandangle.

328
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,317
Deirdre feels
you're letting yourself go, Sally.

329
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,897
Deirdre wants to hook me up
because she's embarrassed I've no fella.

330
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:10,799
At least I'm not in their thrall like she is.
She escapes one, and another one nets her.

331
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,665
What's the story with that, anyway?

332
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,866
What?

333
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,209
Any chance of them two
getting back together again?

334
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,143
None of your business.

335
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,338
No.

336
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:33,019
And listen, I wasn't going to say it to you,
but since we're having this discussion...

337
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:34,457
would you not...

338
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:40,290
Would you not get yourself
a bit of lmmac or something?

339
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:43,334
Get rid of that old ronnie you're cultivating.

340
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:44,767
I haven't got a ronnie.

341
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:47,829
Well, no, you're hardly
the Burt Reynolds league...

342
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:50,067
but there's such a thing as grooming,
you know?

343
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,736
Whether you're courting or not, love.

344
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:55,438
Springfield coming up, now.

345
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:03,546
Mum?

346
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:08,319
Mustn't be back yet.

347
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,662
Are you nervous?

348
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,604
Not really.

349
00:24:22,307 --> 00:24:24,332
They'll be well impressed.

350
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,106
Take your coat off. I'll make some tea.

351
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:43,823
Deirdre.
- Yeah.

352
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,994
Come here for a sec, will you?

353
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:52,528
I wanna show you something.

354
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,480
Jesus.
- You must be Sam.

355
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:06,845
Christ.

356
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:12,380
There were nine, ten people at the most.
All the windows were smashed.

357
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:15,426
So it was just a matter of
climbing up on to the top.

358
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:19,123
Well, of Sally climbing up on to the top,
and of her helping them out...

359
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:20,631
and me helping them down.

360
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,166
And there was nobody killed?
- No.

361
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:24,725
Despite the blood.
- That's amazing.

362
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:28,834
So the ambulance came and...
- Yep, took them all away and that was that.

363
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:31,398
Made a statement to the police,
but we weren't much use.

364
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:33,637
You don't know how it happened?

365
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:41,618
Have I got a ronnie?
- A what?

366
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:44,884
A ronnie, mustache, like.
- Show?

367
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:52,460
Well, you're no Tom Selleck, but...

368
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:54,291
Go fuck yourself.

369
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,299
Sorry, Ma. Fucking idiot.

370
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,360
Why are you so angry, Sally?

371
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,099
Because she's no business, that's why.

372
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:03,801
I don't go round
talking about her physical...

373
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:16,948
Jesus.

374
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:29,096
You don't know how it happened?

375
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,801
Be a few settlements there, I'd say.

376
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,067
You should've stayed on till the next stop.
- We should've.

377
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,574
Anyway, it's nice to meet you, Sam.

378
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:42,205
Sorry it had to be in, what would you call it,
such dramatic circumstances.

379
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:46,012
So, how are you finding living with Deirdre?
Her place okay?

380
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:49,145
He thinks it's a sty.
- No, I don't.

381
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:51,379
It just needs a bit of a dusting, that's all.

382
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,584
And a hoovering, and a mopping.
- Maybe a paint job.

383
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,423
Ouch. I'm messing.

384
00:26:56,662 --> 00:27:01,156
No, it's great. It's early days,
but we're getting on all right, aren't we?

385
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,330
And how's your wife coping with this?
- Sally.

386
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:07,597
No, I'd like to know.
Is she upset? Depressed?

387
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,499
Let's go, Sam.
- No, wait a sec, Deirdre.

388
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:13,271
If he can't handle this kind of talk...

389
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:15,404
then he shouldn't put himself
in this position.

390
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,244
How long you married?
- Fourteen years.

391
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:22,542
And you can, just like that,
finish with one, start with another?

392
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,389
That kind of shit sickens me,
you know that?

393
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,861
Sorry, Ma.

394
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:36,090
And you stay where you are. I'll go.

395
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:39,598
The stench of fucking adultery in here.

396
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:46,900
When Vincent and I broke up,
I thought the same thing, Noeleen.

397
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:48,207
It's me.

398
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,439
I'm dysfunctional in some way
because I couldn't hold on to him.

399
00:27:52,985 --> 00:27:56,079
So you know what I did?
I proved to myself that it wasn't...

400
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:59,157
by attempting,
by doing things that proved it.

401
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:03,124
By becoming better alone
than I'd ever been with him.

402
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:06,526
Tell me how.
- I will.

403
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:08,523
Will you?

404
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,801
I can't tell the difference.

405
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:12,496
What do you want?
- Anything.

406
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:15,096
Do you have a preference
in terms of content?

407
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:18,700
Like women and women, or men and men?

408
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:21,073
What the fuck are you insinuating?

409
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:24,274
I don't know your preferences.
I'm only trying to help you here.

410
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:27,546
You just want straight, yeah?
- Just people fucking, man.

411
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:29,279
Make sure the chicks are good-looking.

412
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:31,720
I saw one of them before,
they were hound dogs.

413
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,122
There you go.
- Mutts, they were.

414
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:36,984
There's no one taking dumps in this,
is there?

415
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,996
You want that?
- No.

416
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:42,731
Look, Oscar, it's just fucking, all right?

417
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:46,396
Bit of oral, bit of anal.
- All right.

418
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:49,973
Anal men or anal women?

419
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:12,589
Can't keep your paws off her, can you?

420
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,765
So what happened to your sister?

421
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:27,903
She was in love with this guy
and she wanted to marry him.

422
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,614
Guy from London, name was Duane.

423
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:33,009
She was gonna move there with him.

424
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:37,418
Took out her savings for a new start.
A few thousand pounds.

425
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:40,418
Well, you can see where this is going,
can't you?

426
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:43,052
He convinced her to take it out in cash.

427
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:46,393
Then he stole it from her
and went back himself.

428
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,336
Jesus, Deirdre, get away.
You're freezing! Please, I'm serious.

429
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:57,366
Thing is, though, after he took the money...

430
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:01,272
he tied her to her bed,
told her she was a rubbish lay...

431
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:04,577
and then did a poo on her chest.
- A what?

432
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:06,250
Ma found her.

433
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:10,254
It was like two or three days later,
and the stink, she said.

434
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:13,683
Flies crawling over her, and her hysterical.

435
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:18,054
So she moved back home then.
Hasn't trusted a man since.

436
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:20,125
Jesus!

437
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:22,723
Why would you?

438
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:25,930
Are you warm yet?

439
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,632
Yes, you are.

440
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:34,639
Get off!

441
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:34,867
Bastard.

442
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:38,500
Fucking bastard.

443
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:27,648
I'm telling you,
this young fella came out of nowhere.

444
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,487
He threw a stone through the windscreen,
a big one.

445
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:37,898
I panicked, I swerved...
- You lost control.

446
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,329
Anyone would have. The bang, the shock,
Jesus, the windscreen shattering.

447
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,968
And yet no one saw this boy?

448
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,512
None of your passengers?
- Are you joking me?

449
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,015
With the muck on those windows,
how could they?

450
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,551
They can't even see the bus stops.

451
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:59,455
I have not been negligent, man.
No way. I did nothing wrong.

452
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:02,516
Kid ran up in front of me
and hauled that rock.

453
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:06,788
Fucking pegged it, he did.

454
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:14,865
The weather seems to be
pretty much the same...

455
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,873
as it's been for the past couple of days...

456
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,841
with the wind coming up
from the south-east.

457
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,935
We've got squalls, sunshine patches.

458
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:23,173
We've got fairly heavy rain.

459
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:27,710
Dublin's gonna get
a lot of rain this afternoon.

460
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:33,090
Hey, man.
- Hi.

461
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:36,957
What you up to? You not working?
- Not anymore.

462
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:39,556
What?

463
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:42,129
Did you get let go?

464
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:44,698
Fired.
- Fuck.

465
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:47,829
That's mean. You okay?

466
00:33:49,374 --> 00:33:51,171
You want another one?

467
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:55,205
I don't intend stopping any time soon.

468
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:59,809
What happened to you?
- Some fuck, man, don't ask.

469
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:03,786
Some little fucker.
I was driving up by Greenhills.

470
00:34:03,955 --> 00:34:05,980
Stroked jammer? Of course.

471
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:07,358
Comes out of nowhere...

472
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:09,950
fucks a rock through the windscreen.
- What?

473
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:14,021
Into the ditch I went, banjaxed my face.
Do you believe it?

474
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:18,429
Two pints, please.

475
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,005
So tell me about it.
- Fuck it.

476
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:27,374
Fuck nothing.
Time like this, you need to talk.

477
00:34:27,812 --> 00:34:29,575
A shoulder, an ear.

478
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,174
Get it off your chest, man.

479
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,986
Speaking in front of a group.

480
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:38,612
Excellent, in fact, we'll do a list.

481
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:43,222
Do you know what I find fascinating,
an muinteoir?

482
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:46,354
Dreams.
- We'll be doing dreams in a couple of weeks.

483
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:50,595
Fabulous. Will we?
- We will. So, public speaking.

484
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,760
How does that make us feel? Anyone?

485
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,970
Vulnerable?
- Good.

486
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:59,474
Shy.
- Exposed.

487
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,039
Scared.

488
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:07,544
Powerful.
- No, it's just negative things now.

489
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:09,246
Naked.

490
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:13,423
Do you ever dream you're naked,
an muinteoir?

491
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:16,520
It's fascinating. Do you ever do that?

492
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:20,697
Okay, what else?
- In command.

493
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:22,933
Negative things. Come on, now.

494
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:26,063
Weak.
- Weak. Excellent.

495
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,999
Or you're relieving yourself
on O'Connell Street.

496
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:31,200
What does that mean, an muinteoir?

497
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:34,837
Number twos, like,
in a little toilet outside the GPO...

498
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:38,972
and you're afraid to wipe your bum
because everybody will look at you.

499
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,142
It's fascinating and laugh, like.

500
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:45,018
Okay, so. What's that, Maurice?
- Dreams, an muinteoir.

501
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:50,256
We're not talking about dreams, you fool.
Did you not hear him?

502
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:53,790
A couple of weeks' time, he said.
Can you not wait?

503
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:56,600
You stupid old fool, what are you?

504
00:35:57,469 --> 00:35:59,096
What are you? A fool!

505
00:36:01,773 --> 00:36:03,536
What do you want?
- Give us a ten.

506
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:07,042
Don't do tens anymore.
Don't break it up that small anymore.

507
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:20,316
Fuck.

508
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:33,593
Out of the way.

509
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:36,435
Flatfoot, fat fucking faggot.

510
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:39,668
Go on, you prick. Prolong the inevitable.

511
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:43,270
See that? Even in your, what are they?
What have you got?

512
00:36:43,348 --> 00:36:45,942
Even in your Nikes, I'm more nimble.

513
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:50,684
Me in my heavy brogans. What have we got?

514
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:56,553
We've got money. Quit your wriggling!

515
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:00,487
We've got gear.

516
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:05,463
There you are.

517
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,777
Where the fuck is the motor?

518
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:29,058
For fuck's sake. Some fuck's after...

519
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:31,994
Shut the fuck up! You giggling whore, you.

520
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:34,728
When will he be back?

521
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:38,531
No, I can't wait that long!

522
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:42,900
This is bollocks, man, I'm telling you.

523
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:47,903
My rank, I should not have to deal with
this kind of unprofessional and...

524
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:51,243
Fuck it.

525
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,054
Give me the number of a taxi firm, will you?

526
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:04,654
That's not what we want, Ben.
It's indigestible. It's too hard.

527
00:38:04,796 --> 00:38:06,923
But it's real, it's true.
- I know that.

528
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,397
It's out there.

529
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:10,866
I'm talking about a world
people don't see, Thomas.

530
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,962
The humanity within...
- But that's not what I hired you to do.

531
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,337
Now, you wanna use a copper?

532
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:20,935
Find some fella
who helps the homeless in his spare time.

533
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:24,209
Or one who can juggle.
- He likes Celtic mysticism.

534
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:28,150
Yeah? Raithneach, Clannad,
artistes like that?

535
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:32,489
Fainne Lasta?
- All that shit, yeah.

536
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,988
But how's that a quirk, Ben?
Sounds like the guy knows his music.

537
00:38:38,062 --> 00:38:41,623
But him knowing his music
is a far from good enough reason to do him.

538
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:45,135
He's too hard and he's too nasty. Nasty.

539
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,928
Too nasty.
- But...

540
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,233
Softer.

541
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:59,375
Jerry. What's this I hear
you're gonna be on telly?

542
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,386
The truth and nothing but, man.
Not in a supporting role, either.

543
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,947
The subject, I'm gonna be.
- Jammy fuck, you.

544
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,524
Leading man.

545
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:20,198
Has nobody any balls these days?
- That's what I said.

546
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:22,136
Yeah?
- To his face.

547
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:25,901
I agree with you 100%, Jerry.
- The faggot.

548
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:29,041
Is he a faggot? Bet you he is.

549
00:39:29,914 --> 00:39:33,145
One of those fucks that tries
too hard to be one of the ladies.

550
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,582
I read you.

551
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:37,716
Well, fair play to you.

552
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:43,259
Talking to your boss like that, I respect that.
You work your way up, that's what I say.

553
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:47,195
Develop your own show.
Call it Hard As Nails Cunts or something.

554
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:49,199
Then we'll collaborate.

555
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:52,725
Yellow-bellied fucks.

556
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:56,166
Listen, buddy, crime calls.

557
00:39:56,874 --> 00:40:00,332
I'll catch you again, all right?
- Catch you, man.

558
00:40:04,582 --> 00:40:06,516
Motherfuckers.

559
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:20,595
You think people enjoy
that kind of attitude? Because they don't.

560
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,792
Go on, do it again
if it makes you feel so good.

561
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,960
Bloody state of you. What I should do now...

562
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:27,027
is speak to your manager
and have you fired...

563
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:29,903
if I could only be bothered.
Don't know how well off you are.

564
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:32,465
Go on, do it. You know you want to.

565
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:36,208
I've changed my fucking mind!

566
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,347
There's a couple of jars
smashed in that lane.

567
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:42,441
Clear them up, will you?

568
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:44,714
It's not my job, it's Thomas'.
He's on the brush.

569
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:47,757
Your job is to do what I tell you.
Now come on.

570
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,918
It's not Dolce Salsa, is it?

571
00:40:49,994 --> 00:40:52,724
It is, yeah.
- Can't do. Dolce Salsa makes me sick.

572
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,595
All I have to do is smell the stuff.
- Move.

573
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,395
Thomas, wait there.

574
00:40:59,337 --> 00:41:02,932
There you are. Do it.

575
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:04,873
Okay, man.

576
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:11,372
You're okay, Thomas.
I'm just trying to make a point.

577
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:13,541
For God's sake!

578
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:20,952
Told you.

579
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:23,023
You finished?

580
00:41:33,404 --> 00:41:35,201
You finished?
- Yeah.

581
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:38,364
Come with me.

582
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:44,911
Thomas, clear up that sick
before someone slips in it.

583
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:53,281
I want you to get one thing straight.
I'm your boss, you do as I say.

584
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:57,353
Go home, repeat it, maybe it'll lodge.

585
00:41:57,562 --> 00:42:00,690
One more incident like this,
do you hear me? One more incident...

586
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:05,498
and I will TCB, as they say in the States.

587
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:09,934
I will 'take care of business.'

588
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:14,537
You are here to do as you are told.
You are here to work.

589
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,139
So get back out there and do some.

590
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:24,682
Come on, Thomas, move it.
If you move it, you won't have to smell it.

591
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,719
I know that you've been patient, Karen.
- Stop.

592
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:34,595
No, you have. Taking me shopping
and everything, the classes.

593
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:42,829
Maybe it's a different kind of boost
you need.

594
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:46,273
Something to remind yourself
you're attractive, say.

595
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:49,511
Maybe you need to be chatted up
or something.

596
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,539
Flirted with, pursued...
- Wanted, Karen.

597
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:57,444
That's what it is.
- Okay, then.

598
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:01,524
Let's do something about that.

599
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,724
Here's one, Ben.
- What is it?

600
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:06,151
It's good.

601
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,324
Like all the other good stuff I've read so far?

602
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,627
I'm getting a bit tired of your attitude, Ben.

603
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,467
You can't choose one, that's fine.
I've chosen one for you.

604
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:17,632
Read it...

605
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,142
get the lads, and get on it.

606
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:22,938
But it's not up for discussion, Ben.

607
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:41,958
Hello?

608
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,997
They want us to go on...

609
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:55,806
They want us to go on telly.
Because of the accident, the bus.

610
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,610
Some man just rang.
They wanna do an interview.

611
00:43:58,683 --> 00:44:01,982
Said to ring him back if we're interested,
you know.

612
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:08,825
I'm telling you,
Jonesy said it's the best place to go.

613
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:12,453
Maybe not the best, but the easiest.
- Lf you're desperate.

614
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,862
But I am, John. You know I am.

615
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:33,350
Jesus Christ.

616
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:42,016
See, if this is all the competition there is...

617
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,487
And some old ones are cute.

618
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,555
Not too old.
- Where?

619
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:53,103
This is what Jonesy said.
You gotta scout about a bit.

620
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:02,035
I'll meet you in a while.

621
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:09,748
Pint of Guinness, please.

622
00:45:25,669 --> 00:45:27,534
You dirty bastard.

623
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:32,203
Fancy a bit of mature, yeah?
Look, I know why you're here.

624
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:41,510
I've got my own business, you know?
Fish and chip shop.

625
00:45:42,453 --> 00:45:44,785
You like fish?
- Some fish.

626
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:48,247
Not fish-and-chip fish.
- Right.

627
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,528
You like chips, though?
- You know what I like? Onion rings.

628
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:56,260
Right.

629
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:00,126
Not the biggest fan of them myself.

630
00:46:00,704 --> 00:46:04,572
It's about the only part of my produce
that I'm not partial to.

631
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:08,242
Look, I'm not gonna
beat around the bush, ladies.

632
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:12,107
But if we can't be
compatible about business...

633
00:46:21,392 --> 00:46:23,360
Now, him I like.
- Who?

634
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:27,228
That young guy?
- There's two of them.

635
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:30,265
If he asks me to dance,
will you get up with his friend?

636
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,768
Come on. I'd feel silly on my own.

637
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,970
I mean, feck it, a woman my age...

638
00:46:37,308 --> 00:46:40,971
place like this, what's the point in lying?

639
00:46:41,145 --> 00:46:43,807
That's my philosophy. The truth.

640
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:47,910
Life's too short. What was I saying?

641
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,556
The hormones, right.
No, it's not the worst thing...

642
00:46:53,657 --> 00:46:57,889
because since I've been on them,
I have to say...

643
00:46:57,995 --> 00:47:01,453
I've been feeling very erotic.

644
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:05,793
You know what
a younger man like yourself lacks?

645
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:08,404
A bit of mature loving.

646
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:13,036
You lack it because you don't look for it.

647
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:16,208
But let me tell you something.

648
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,443
I'm sporty.

649
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:27,413
I'm actually...
Celia, you're talking about honesty?

650
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:30,794
I'm actually just waiting on a mate. Sorry.

651
00:47:32,229 --> 00:47:33,355
Okay.

652
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:37,624
I won't waste any more of your time.

653
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:48,168
I found one.
- Yeah, what's she like?

654
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:52,272
Will you dance with her mate? She's nice.
- What's her mate like?

655
00:47:58,122 --> 00:48:00,886
Which? The right or the left?
- The left.

656
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,818
All right.
- The left's mine.

657
00:48:08,899 --> 00:48:10,696
All right, fuck it.

658
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:17,739
I hope you know, I've no interest.
- Me, neither.

659
00:48:17,808 --> 00:48:19,537
So nothing's gonna happen.

660
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:24,309
We're just gonna dance, enjoy it,
and we're going to finish when they finish.

661
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:28,644
What's that perfume?
- Hey.

662
00:48:28,752 --> 00:48:30,310
I was just...
- Hey.

663
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:40,359
You come here often?

664
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,359
Yes?

665
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:45,727
No?

666
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:49,601
It's my first time.

667
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:54,338
I didn't know it'd be, you know...

668
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:55,901
Older people?

669
00:48:56,747 --> 00:49:00,239
That's okay.
- Older than me, say.

670
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,521
Are you a little shy, Oscar?

671
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:15,892
I think you are.

672
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,565
I think you're very nice, too.

673
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:28,568
Would you like to come home with me?

674
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:34,115
I know, I can't believe I said it, either.

675
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:39,255
But would you?

676
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:53,735
Blue Enigma.

677
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:56,470
My perfume.

678
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,609
You said...

679
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:06,974
You said you were waiting on a friend.
How dare you?

680
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:11,647
Lf you don't want me, you tell me the truth.
- Who's this?

681
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:13,222
I'm coming here...

682
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,815
Who the hell are you?
- Nice dancing with you.

683
00:50:15,926 --> 00:50:19,885
How dare you? I'm coming here
long enough not to need these lies.

684
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:22,591
I'm finished. I'm going to the toilet.

685
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,158
Did you hear what I said earlier on?

686
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:28,068
I'm coming here long enough
not to need these lies.

687
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:31,699
Do you hear what I'm saying? You big liar!

688
00:50:31,775 --> 00:50:34,369
Oscar, I'm splitting. Do you hear me?

689
00:50:34,445 --> 00:50:37,312
Will you be all right?
- Who'd have you anyway, you pug-ugly?

690
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:38,678
Fuck you.

691
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,283
Fucking liar.

692
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:48,924
So what do you wanna do?
Do you wanna go out?

693
00:50:49,259 --> 00:50:50,920
Wouldn't mind staying in.

694
00:50:50,994 --> 00:50:52,928
Again?
- Why not?

695
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:55,489
I'm gonna take a bath.

696
00:50:55,933 --> 00:50:59,130
Can I help?
- You can bring me in a glass of wine.

697
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:18,180
Hello?

698
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:21,080
Can I speak to Deirdre, please?
- Who's calling?

699
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:22,556
It's John.

700
00:51:24,528 --> 00:51:27,053
John she used to go out with?
- Yeah.

701
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:31,125
I'm sorry, I can't put you on to her.
- Why not?

702
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:33,931
You're the competition, aren't you?
You're the ex.

703
00:51:34,004 --> 00:51:36,996
Sam, who is it?
- It's for me, Deirdre.

704
00:51:39,343 --> 00:51:41,436
What is it you want, anyway?

705
00:51:41,512 --> 00:51:44,106
You wanna win her back?
She's not going back.

706
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:47,947
So what's the problem?
- The problem is it'd make me uncomfortable.

707
00:51:48,051 --> 00:51:49,848
I'm sure you're not the worst, okay?

708
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,387
But as far as Deirdre's concerned,
you're my enemy.

709
00:51:52,456 --> 00:51:54,856
Pal, you don't want me as your enemy.
- No?

710
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:57,758
I can make life hard, man. That's right.

711
00:51:57,828 --> 00:52:01,423
Talk to me like you're talking,
I'll crack your baldy head, man.

712
00:52:01,498 --> 00:52:04,558
And I know you're baldy.
I'll be the worst enemy...

713
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:16,369
You ever fucking had! Do you hear me?

714
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,224
All right, John boy?
Sorry for your troubles, man.

715
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:34,491
What? A pint of Guinness, please, Seamus.

716
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:37,534
Heard about your break-up.
This is Lehiff, by the way.

717
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:39,569
Come here,
why don't you join us over here?

718
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:42,264
We got some business...
- A proposition.

719
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:44,933
We got a proposition we wanna run by you.

720
00:52:45,008 --> 00:52:48,535
Potential of a few quid, man.
- Many a quid's potential.

721
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,571
Follow us over.

722
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:16,705
I need a bit of a lift at the moment, Oscar.

723
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,903
Bit of a pepping up.

724
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:22,238
Can you pep me up?

725
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,124
Good Jesus.

726
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:37,723
Look. Rough, man.

727
00:53:37,794 --> 00:53:40,388
Bit of pain-slash-pleasure, you know?

728
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:45,225
Jesus, my cock's killing me,
my bones, my muscles...

729
00:53:45,702 --> 00:53:47,169
but I'm energized.

730
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:50,468
Good, because I've a proposition for you.
- A what?

731
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:53,101
Some business.
Come on, I'll tell you on the floor.

732
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:54,370
Fuck.

733
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:57,002
It's my cock, John.
- Yeah, so you said.

734
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,380
I'm telling you. Pain-slash-pleasure.
Fucking aching me, it is.

735
00:54:05,155 --> 00:54:07,646
Yeah, don't even ask about my balls.

736
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:17,233
So we hold the girlfriend hostage,
say we'll kill her if he doesn't do as we say.

737
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:20,293
Drive him to the bank, two of us,
the other stays with her...

738
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,895
he gets us the money, we let her go.

739
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:25,236
Wear masks, whatever, disguise our identity.

740
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:29,746
Thing is, though, and this is the sweet,
the poetic part, though, right.

741
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:32,638
The girlfriend is Deirdre.

742
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:35,647
You're joking? And the fella is...

743
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:38,812
Her fella. That's right, the baldy fuck.
Are you on?

744
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:40,890
I don't think so.
- What?

745
00:54:41,158 --> 00:54:44,127
Why don't you just ring her?
Tell her you want her back.

746
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:46,718
Fuck that. That's over now.
This is the new shit.

747
00:54:46,797 --> 00:54:48,059
It's all a bit risky.

748
00:54:48,131 --> 00:54:50,656
But vengeance, man,
it's not about the money.

749
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:53,726
Well, it is, but the satisfaction...
- That's you, John.

750
00:54:53,804 --> 00:54:55,271
That's your reward. I'm sorry.

751
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:57,398
Come on.
- It's too big. No, man.

752
00:54:57,474 --> 00:54:59,772
And I wouldn't recommend
you get involved, either.

753
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,869
I'm getting involved, all right,
I'm not passing this up.

754
00:55:02,946 --> 00:55:05,676
And if you were any kind of fucking mate...
- What?

755
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:07,841
Fuck you!
- No, fuck you, man.

756
00:55:07,918 --> 00:55:10,045
Lf you were any use...
- I am use.

757
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,212
Except for fucking fogeys.
- She's no fogey.

758
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:18,192
She may be older, but she's sporty.
And I'm taking exception to that description.

759
00:55:21,898 --> 00:55:23,422
Granny, she is.

760
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,999
May have to break your face for you,
you keep it up.

761
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:35,636
You big cock, you.
- You're a cock!

762
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:40,445
No, you are. Big hairy prick, you.
Can't even get laid by a bird your own age.

763
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:44,318
Come here, feck me.
I've got you, man. Give up.

764
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:47,713
You got me on the wrassling.
See, when I start using my karate...

765
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:50,816
Wrassling or karate...
- John! Oscar!

766
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,097
I'm sick of this now.

767
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:02,068
Come up to Mrs. Rooney's office.

768
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,231
Put a stop to this claptrap, once and for all.

769
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:12,912
Henderson!

770
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:21,513
Good shot, man.

771
00:56:26,196 --> 00:56:27,720
Nice one, John.

772
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:40,042
Get off my groceries, will you, you knacker?

773
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:49,008
Fucking eejit.

774
00:56:51,421 --> 00:56:53,252
I'm not going to the hospital, I told you.

775
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:56,918
Now Mr. Henderson has decided
he doesn't want to bring the police into this.

776
00:56:57,027 --> 00:57:00,622
But you understand we're going to
have to terminate your employment, John.

777
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:03,199
Have you anything you'd like to say or...

778
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,097
Go fuck yourselves?

779
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:07,562
No, Tony, no, it's about what I expected.

780
00:57:07,637 --> 00:57:09,832
I'm just so sorry it had to come to all of this.

781
00:57:09,906 --> 00:57:12,397
And you go fuck yourself, too.
- Enough of that.

782
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:15,172
No, Tony, if he hasn't even got the grace...

783
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:19,238
or the originality to...
- Fuck youse.

784
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:33,144
Hello.
- How you doing?

785
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:34,383
How are you?

786
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:38,754
Look at your woman's makeup.

787
00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:43,690
Fuck. Take a chisel to get that off.

788
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:48,632
Hey. Youse off the telly?

789
00:58:48,705 --> 00:58:50,297
Yeah.
- Put me on.

790
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:52,603
No.
- Go on, youse pricks. Put me on.

791
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:54,735
I'll do a dance for youse.

792
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:07,680
What do you think? Riverdance.
- Fuck's sake.

793
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:10,089
Okay. You all set?
- Yeah.

794
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:14,956
Let's get the heroic angle. The mythic shot.

795
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:18,023
There's something wrong
with the light here.

796
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:21,127
I don't see why
we can't just shoot this thing straight on.

797
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:25,368
There's some sort of a shadow there
that I can't seem to get rid of.

798
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:29,468
That's not, I don't think, shadow.
That's a moustache, Ben.

799
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:34,440
That's ruining it, isn't it, Charlie?

800
00:59:36,987 --> 00:59:38,318
Sorry, Sally.

801
00:59:38,388 --> 00:59:40,879
You hear this 'mythic shot' shit?

802
00:59:41,157 --> 00:59:44,058
Could you step out of the shot for a minute?

803
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,787
Just for a minute.

804
00:59:50,066 --> 00:59:53,058
Right, Maura.
What happened when the bus went over?

805
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:57,197
It must have been quite a surprise.
Could you tell us exactly how you felt?

806
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,565
Who the hell...

807
01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:04,874
Christ! What the fuck?
- What was that?

808
01:00:10,754 --> 01:00:15,714
Actually, Maura,
can we put Sally in for this one, please?

809
01:00:18,395 --> 01:00:21,796
Do what you can with the moustache.
Lose the low angle if you have to.

810
01:00:21,865 --> 01:00:24,959
I told you, if we shot simply,
we'd be home by now.

811
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:26,832
Fucking mythic shot.

812
01:00:29,806 --> 01:00:32,001
Sally, it'll be great.

813
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:37,337
Okay, let's go.

814
01:00:43,586 --> 01:00:45,349
That's wanton, now.

815
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:49,952
Condolences, man.

816
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:53,260
Seriously.

817
01:00:57,167 --> 01:00:59,567
My stereo there?
- No.

818
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:02,767
My sounds?
- No.

819
01:01:06,343 --> 01:01:08,709
At least they had taste, the cunts.

820
01:01:08,778 --> 01:01:11,474
You gonna put this in your film, Jerry?

821
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,548
Hello?
- Call yourself a maverick?

822
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,476
Yeah.

823
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:51,786
Then be one, Ben. Do me anyway.

824
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:53,715
What?

825
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,959
Do your own film.
You have access, don't you?

826
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,594
Cameras and all that? Sound shit?

827
01:01:59,696 --> 01:02:02,187
Wanna do the underbelly, don't you?
You said you did.

828
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:04,789
I know.
- You said you were a maverick.

829
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:08,392
Well, this is how mavericks create.
Outside the system.

830
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:10,467
Oh, yeah.

831
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,841
But if you're prepared for that, let's do it.

832
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,811
Lf not, well, okay, fine.
- No.

833
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,280
Be a conformist.
- No, I'd like to, it's just...

834
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:21,317
Yea or nay, Ben?

835
01:02:23,353 --> 01:02:25,617
Yea or nay?

836
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:31,059
Tonight on Little Big City...

837
01:02:31,127 --> 01:02:33,357
an accident
could have become a catastrophe...

838
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:37,196
if it weren't for the intervention
of several brave passersby.

839
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:39,531
One of whom we have here with us.

840
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:40,830
We felt that a...

841
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:44,897
well, actually, I felt that there were people...

842
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:47,442
whose lives were in danger.

843
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:50,846
So I jumped on top of the bus.

844
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:52,838
The bus was on its side, actually...

845
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:57,444
so it wasn't that high
to jump on top of the bus.

846
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,488
Oh, my God.
- What?

847
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:02,384
It's horrible, Ma.

848
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:06,155
Not on the bus, but in the bus.
I saw it through the window.

849
01:03:06,763 --> 01:03:09,493
And I was frightened
that there were people dead everywhere.

850
01:03:09,566 --> 01:03:12,535
There weren't,
there was just a few cuts and bruises.

851
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:32,314
Damn.
- You didn't miss much, it's only your sister.

852
01:03:32,856 --> 01:03:35,552
Was she good?
- Not really.

853
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:38,992
She was a bit inarticulate,
to tell you the truth.

854
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:42,158
I was shit.
- No, you weren't.

855
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:44,800
My hair was shit. Yes, I was.

856
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:48,432
My moustache. I am like Burt Reynolds.

857
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,198
Fucking hell.

858
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:57,073
Listen, do you mind if we stay in tonight?
- What?

859
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:59,613
I'm knackered, do you mind?
- Sam!

860
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:02,549
Come on, Deirdre.
We don't have to go out every night, do we?

861
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:03,916
Every night?

862
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:11,026
I pay rent here.
I pay your rent on top of my own.

863
01:04:11,094 --> 01:04:14,325
I give you money. I treat you well.
Is that not enough?

864
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:17,332
It's not what I want, Sam.
- Well, what do you want?

865
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:25,572
Come on, tickles.
- No. Put me down.

866
01:04:33,883 --> 01:04:36,681
Fuck. What the fuck?

867
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:40,518
Listen. Fuck this.

868
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:44,888
Oscar, I'm sorry, I...
- This is too much.

869
01:04:45,261 --> 01:04:47,491
What's wrong with you? Jesus.

870
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:51,800
It was kinky at first, but my fucking jaw.

871
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:55,429
Don't go, Oscar, please stay.
- Fuck that.

872
01:04:56,573 --> 01:05:00,634
Look, you're better off
finding someone into that shit, Noeleen.

873
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:03,474
I won't, I'll stop.
- I'll see you again.

874
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:08,350
Oscar, please. I'll stop.
- I'll see you again.

875
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:11,486
Oscar, I won't, I'll stop.

876
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:16,017
My fucking jaw.

877
01:05:18,628 --> 01:05:22,496
It's like, I knew I had it,
but I didn't care because I didn't see it.

878
01:05:22,565 --> 01:05:24,032
Now I see it.

879
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:28,365
Now I do. I don't understand why I didn't.

880
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:32,473
It's like I kept it as a badge of,
I don't know...

881
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:35,010
maybe of mourning or something.
I don't know.

882
01:05:35,078 --> 01:05:36,204
Or courage.

883
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:38,509
I mean, you've been through the wars, love.

884
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:41,448
That's true. I've distinguished myself.

885
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:50,859
What about you, Ma?
You never thought of getting someone?

886
01:05:50,927 --> 01:05:52,792
Getting married again?

887
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:57,331
I don't think I could, even if I wanted to.

888
01:05:57,934 --> 01:05:59,663
Your father was...

889
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:03,736
I don't know, I'd feel...
- You were betraying him?

890
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:08,566
No, I think he'd have wanted me to.

891
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:14,076
It's just, I still feel close to him, you know?

892
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:20,580
To have had someone like him
in my life that special, I feel it's enough.

893
01:06:21,724 --> 01:06:24,989
And who could ever give me
what he gave me, anyway?

894
01:06:25,828 --> 01:06:28,160
What do you mean?
- I don't know.

895
01:06:28,731 --> 01:06:30,699
His love, for one thing.

896
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:32,529
My home.

897
01:06:34,537 --> 01:06:36,164
The times we had.

898
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,231
We did have times, Sally.

899
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:42,701
A whole load of memories.

900
01:06:43,746 --> 01:06:45,714
The children he gave me.

901
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,281
My beautiful children.

902
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:51,111
With or without moustaches.

903
01:06:52,655 --> 01:06:56,022
I feel blessed by all of that. By you, Sally.

904
01:06:57,093 --> 01:06:59,618
So why would I want for anything more?

905
01:07:00,463 --> 01:07:02,090
I'm serious, love.

906
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,494
I know.

907
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:10,970
I've been so lonely, Ma.

908
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,601
I know you have, baby. I know you have.

909
01:07:19,215 --> 01:07:20,739
It's all right.

910
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,758
Delicious, this.

911
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:32,327
I can feel it doing me good already.

912
01:07:32,395 --> 01:07:35,091
Vitamins and shit. Carbs or whatever.

913
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:37,365
Think they're in the beans.

914
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:39,799
You have any brown sauce?
- Sure.

915
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:42,300
Or is it the pudding?

916
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,869
Anyway, what time is it?

917
01:07:47,076 --> 01:07:49,601
It's 7:30, we don't go till around 8:00.

918
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:51,977
That way a knock on the door
won't be too strange.

919
01:07:52,048 --> 01:07:53,879
Don't forget, I won't be talking.

920
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:57,647
That's right.
You can nod, whatever. Or grunt.

921
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,449
Write shit down.

922
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,191
There we go.

923
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,259
You scummy fucker.
- Want some? It's nice, man.

924
01:08:19,175 --> 01:08:21,040
Go on, give us a shot.

925
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:40,818
It's delicious.

926
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:46,564
Give us some of that.

927
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:49,161
It's gorgeous.

928
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:54,540
You got the gun and all, Lehiff?

929
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:59,341
Give us a look.
- Here? Use your head, man.

930
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:09,516
That's not fucking bad.
- I'm telling you, man.

931
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:12,359
I'll show youse after, all right?

932
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:20,394
That's fucking delish, man.

933
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:26,538
Be careful, you fuck.

934
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:32,275
Stick on some sounds, will you,
to get us in the mood.

935
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:34,009
What have you got?

936
01:09:34,617 --> 01:09:35,845
Clannad.

937
01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:38,746
Fuck that, we'll do without.

938
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:40,716
Here, look at these.

939
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:44,487
I got them in the joke shop,
so as we can drive the bloke to the bank.

940
01:09:44,594 --> 01:09:47,961
Anyone looks, they see real people,
but not the right people.

941
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:50,464
Clever.
- Better fucking believe it.

942
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:53,832
This shite, you've gotta be
Stephen fucking Hawking.

943
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:57,532
Hawkings, which is it?

944
01:09:58,374 --> 01:10:00,103
Hawking.

945
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:35,271
Where's your sis, Cathal?

946
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:38,472
Why? She gonna be on this?
- I don't know.

947
01:10:38,548 --> 01:10:40,675
What would she do to get on?

948
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:43,816
She'd do anything you want, Jerry.
- To the camera.

949
01:10:43,886 --> 01:10:45,786
To the camera, Cathal.

950
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:48,415
Would she give me a riding?
- She might.

951
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:50,651
The whore.
- She's not a whore.

952
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:56,693
This is Wayne, Ben.

953
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,594
Dealer.

954
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:02,135
He isn't doing much at the moment
on account of surveillance.

955
01:11:02,204 --> 01:11:05,298
That's right. Can't even take a shit in peace.

956
01:11:06,309 --> 01:11:09,142
Reckon he's done the odd drive-by as well.

957
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:14,172
That'd be telling, Jerry.

958
01:11:14,317 --> 01:11:16,512
What's this? A film?

959
01:11:18,154 --> 01:11:19,985
Fucking scumbag.

960
01:11:20,856 --> 01:11:22,585
It's a documentary.

961
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,325
About what?

962
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:27,852
About scumbags.

963
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:36,498
So tell the camera
what it's like dealing death for a living.

964
01:11:38,207 --> 01:11:42,610
Go on. Feeding filth to these poor addicts.

965
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:44,175
Fuckhole.

966
01:11:48,918 --> 01:11:51,250
Are you looking for a shot, man?

967
01:11:52,488 --> 01:11:55,082
Dislodge the champion off his podium?

968
01:11:55,825 --> 01:11:57,816
Reckon I can do it, Jerry.

969
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:04,331
You getting this, Ben?
- Reckon I can whup you!

970
01:12:35,831 --> 01:12:38,629
See what I mean? Scum.

971
01:12:45,141 --> 01:12:47,939
It's the only thing they understand, Ben.

972
01:12:51,914 --> 01:12:53,108
Jesus.

973
01:13:01,957 --> 01:13:03,322
How are you?

974
01:13:04,226 --> 01:13:05,887
Who is it, Deirdre?

975
01:13:07,029 --> 01:13:09,429
Okay, so these lads will go with Sam here.

976
01:13:09,498 --> 01:13:14,128
And me, the really dangerous fuck
of the trio, will stay with you. All right?

977
01:13:14,837 --> 01:13:16,771
Good.
- Okay, Sam?

978
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:23,538
Good. All right?

979
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:35,785
I won't.

980
01:13:44,366 --> 01:13:46,561
I will.
- All right, let's go.

981
01:13:58,314 --> 01:14:01,750
What the fuck do you see
in a fogey like that, anyway?

982
01:14:05,488 --> 01:14:08,286
Can't say he'd be too energetic sackwise.

983
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,285
You can answer me.

984
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:15,730
That chick's a bit young for you, isn't she?

985
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:18,863
What would she be, 25, 26?

986
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:21,135
And gorgeous.

987
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:25,106
Suppose it's the old wage, though, isn't it?

988
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:28,275
That would attract them all right.

989
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:33,807
I'll tell you what, though,
despite her material wants...

990
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:37,350
I'm talking about my own wife here now,
she has them.

991
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:40,749
Me and her is based on more than that.

992
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:43,421
Snuggle her at night.

993
01:14:43,993 --> 01:14:46,018
Get the old belly-fluts.

994
01:14:49,131 --> 01:14:52,123
Does your woman give you that? No?

995
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:56,000
Or more to the point, do you give her it?

996
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:00,836
You own this place?
- No.

997
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,169
Rent?

998
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:05,870
I wouldn't mind
owning somewhere like here, now.

999
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:07,676
It's not the best by any means...

1000
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,617
but for a man of my humble wants,
you know?

1001
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:13,383
Is that a wok I see?

1002
01:15:19,628 --> 01:15:21,323
Very nice.

1003
01:15:24,099 --> 01:15:26,761
Are they worth getting?
You find you have much use for it?

1004
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:28,167
I suppose.

1005
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:34,300
Have my eye on a few kitchen appliances.
Woks, blenders.

1006
01:15:34,643 --> 01:15:36,873
Feel it's time I domesticated
myself a little bit.

1007
01:15:36,946 --> 01:15:40,143
Wokked my own grub
instead of always ordering in.

1008
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:43,584
And what kind of oil would you use?
I hear olive's the best.

1009
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:45,620
Well, that's what I use.

1010
01:15:46,589 --> 01:15:47,715
Right.

1011
01:15:47,823 --> 01:15:51,953
And what are the advantages
you find it has above, say...

1012
01:15:52,127 --> 01:15:53,924
chip-pan oil or...

1013
01:16:01,704 --> 01:16:03,535
You fucking idiot.

1014
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:07,401
Right, now get back in there
and make me some tea.

1015
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:10,038
Go on.

1016
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,445
All right. Go on, go.

1017
01:16:37,539 --> 01:16:39,336
You mean that, Mick?

1018
01:16:42,144 --> 01:16:44,442
What you said about the missus?

1019
01:16:44,847 --> 01:16:47,782
About getting the fluts and all.
- Oh, yeah.

1020
01:16:48,517 --> 01:16:50,246
You think I didn't?

1021
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:52,977
True love, man.

1022
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:55,847
You feel it, you feel it.

1023
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:58,453
What do you think?

1024
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:00,753
Yeah.

1025
01:17:02,898 --> 01:17:04,297
You feel it?

1026
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,131
With Deirdre, man.

1027
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:13,133
I do.

1028
01:17:18,147 --> 01:17:19,876
It gets me in here.

1029
01:17:21,317 --> 01:17:22,409
Yeah.

1030
01:17:24,253 --> 01:17:26,744
That's where it gets you, all right.

1031
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:30,187
Try and fuck with me?

1032
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:34,694
Have to watch you like a vulture.

1033
01:17:40,636 --> 01:17:43,833
Don't want sugar. Get me brown sauce.

1034
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:46,606
Brown sauce?

1035
01:17:47,076 --> 01:17:49,977
There's something wrong with that,
is there?

1036
01:17:50,779 --> 01:17:53,304
It's the new fucking business, sure.

1037
01:17:54,516 --> 01:17:56,279
Everyone's doing it.

1038
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:02,421
Not a bad old morning?

1039
01:18:13,736 --> 01:18:15,101
Hey, Sally.

1040
01:18:17,006 --> 01:18:19,804
Should you not be in work?
- I took the day off.

1041
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:22,070
Thinking of leaving altogether, actually.

1042
01:18:22,144 --> 01:18:25,045
Yeah?
- Yeah, it's pissing me off, you know?

1043
01:18:25,314 --> 01:18:26,975
What about yourself?

1044
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:30,280
It's my birthday next week.
- Yeah? Happy birthday.

1045
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:32,080
Thanks.

1046
01:18:32,154 --> 01:18:35,214
And my mother got me
one of those mall vouchers.

1047
01:18:35,624 --> 01:18:38,252
You know, you can use it in any shop.

1048
01:18:39,294 --> 01:18:41,455
So I'm gonna get a makeover.

1049
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:43,459
Nice massage.
- Treat yourself?

1050
01:18:43,532 --> 01:18:45,830
Bit of a facial. Exactly, yeah.

1051
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:49,561
Get my moustache waxed.
- What moustache?

1052
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:51,997
Oscar, come on.

1053
01:18:52,074 --> 01:18:55,373
You've a bit of hair there,
but it's hardly a ronnie, man.

1054
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:58,277
Needs a bit of bleaching's all that needs.

1055
01:18:59,415 --> 01:19:01,212
Do you want a coffee?

1056
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:04,175
Hey, I was just on my way up to you.

1057
01:19:04,853 --> 01:19:07,481
What's up with your phone? Is it broke?

1058
01:19:08,357 --> 01:19:11,292
Or more to the point...
Slow down a second.

1059
01:19:11,693 --> 01:19:13,627
More to the point,
where were you last night?

1060
01:19:13,695 --> 01:19:15,925
Leave me alone, Karen.
- What?

1061
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:20,662
I get you.
This new man in your life, is that it?

1062
01:19:21,236 --> 01:19:24,433
Now that everything's peaches and cream,
it's dump your friends...

1063
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:26,838
leave them hanging, is that it?

1064
01:19:27,209 --> 01:19:30,007
Stop a second, will you, for fuck's sake!

1065
01:19:30,379 --> 01:19:32,347
Is that the explanation?

1066
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:36,675
After all the effort I put into you,
the time I spent, the...

1067
01:19:37,019 --> 01:19:40,284
Stop, I said!
- Get your fucking maulers off me!

1068
01:19:44,426 --> 01:19:46,189
Lookit, look at this.

1069
01:19:49,398 --> 01:19:51,263
Oh, man, it's bulging.

1070
01:19:55,137 --> 01:19:56,866
Prepare to be rich.

1071
01:19:57,873 --> 01:19:59,773
Prepare to fucking...

1072
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:19,818
Where the fuck is he going?

1073
01:20:26,135 --> 01:20:27,227
Sam!

1074
01:20:29,004 --> 01:20:30,528
What the fuck?

1075
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:33,301
Who's that?

1076
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,399
I'm sorry!

1077
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:36,103
Where's the bag?

1078
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,677
What the fuck? Some chick.

1079
01:20:40,082 --> 01:20:41,845
She's vicious, man.

1080
01:20:43,152 --> 01:20:46,383
She's an animal.
Look at her milling into the fucker.

1081
01:20:46,455 --> 01:20:48,286
I'm sorry, Noeleen.
- You okay?

1082
01:20:48,357 --> 01:20:50,587
Yeah. Yes, it's okay.

1083
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:53,990
Retaliate, you dope.

1084
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:57,126
Grab the bag, stand the fuck up and...

1085
01:20:59,935 --> 01:21:01,163
Coppers.

1086
01:21:01,737 --> 01:21:04,672
Sketch, man, skedaddle, will you? Jesus.

1087
01:21:24,693 --> 01:21:27,560
Get off him. Come on.
- Calm down, madam, will you?

1088
01:21:32,668 --> 01:21:36,764
I don't believe it. Who was that?
- Don't fucking know.

1089
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:39,229
That's it now.

1090
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:42,801
All that risk, that work, for nothing.

1091
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:46,403
I promised Cathy a shed out the back.
What the fuck will I tell her now?

1092
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:49,609
You know those sheds?
Store your shovels and shit.

1093
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:51,375
Your lawnmower.

1094
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:54,449
The fuck?

1095
01:21:56,825 --> 01:22:01,319
That's the little fucker who stoned my bus.
- So? We've gotta get back, man.

1096
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,898
Fuck that.
- What the fuck do you mean, 'Fuck that'?

1097
01:22:03,999 --> 01:22:07,332
What about Deirdre?
- You're the one that loves her, you go back.

1098
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:09,460
I've my own mission here.

1099
01:22:10,572 --> 01:22:11,698
Mick!

1100
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:15,706
Right, he's moving.

1101
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:22,675
Looking for love, it's tough.
- It is.

1102
01:22:24,453 --> 01:22:27,149
How did we get on to this?
- Don't know.

1103
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,187
And it's frightening.

1104
01:22:30,892 --> 01:22:34,828
A lot of bad decisions you can make.
- Yeah, a lot of wrong turns, exactly.

1105
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:37,763
Potential for heartbreak, for hurt.

1106
01:22:39,868 --> 01:22:41,529
But you persevere.

1107
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:44,200
You reckon?
- Yeah.

1108
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,741
You've got to, do you not think?
- No, I do.

1109
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:50,911
I mean, what else is there?

1110
01:22:50,979 --> 01:22:52,003
Exactly.

1111
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,241
What the fuck else is there?

1112
01:23:36,058 --> 01:23:37,389
Who is it?

1113
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:50,896
What's going on?

1114
01:23:54,042 --> 01:23:55,942
What the fuck does this mean?

1115
01:23:56,011 --> 01:23:59,105
Where's you-know-who?
Are you fucking around here?

1116
01:23:59,181 --> 01:24:02,173
Take this fucking thing.
What's going on, man?

1117
01:24:08,357 --> 01:24:11,554
She got out of order.
Now who's this crazy old one?

1118
01:24:15,864 --> 01:24:18,526
Fuck that, fuck her. Where is everyone?

1119
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,125
Don't write it, tell me. Are you listening?

1120
01:24:22,304 --> 01:24:24,169
I'm a prick? You're a prick!

1121
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,935
If this is fucked up, I wanna know how.

1122
01:24:27,242 --> 01:24:28,903
I said talk now, man.

1123
01:24:28,977 --> 01:24:31,241
Who's got the money?
- Why did you hit her?

1124
01:24:31,313 --> 01:24:33,440
Because she's a cunt!
- John.

1125
01:24:34,082 --> 01:24:36,676
Now tell me.
You're after blowing your cover, sure.

1126
01:24:36,752 --> 01:24:38,549
Shut the fuck up, or I'll smack you again.

1127
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,181
And don't give me
any more of this mad old shit. Tell me!

1128
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:54,033
Fuck. Look what you're after making me do.

1129
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,169
Fuck this.

1130
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:05,406
Are you all right?

1131
01:25:05,547 --> 01:25:07,378
Fuck, Deirdre, fuck.

1132
01:25:07,716 --> 01:25:09,308
Jesus, I'm late.

1133
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:12,877
They said they'd a cancellation for 10:00,
but if I miss that...

1134
01:25:12,954 --> 01:25:15,980
You better hurry.
- It's great to see you, Oscar.

1135
01:25:16,057 --> 01:25:19,788
And, come here, if you wanna
leave your job, you know what I say?

1136
01:25:19,895 --> 01:25:21,795
Leave your fucking job.

1137
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:24,464
Go somewhere you're treated right.

1138
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,036
Thanks for the coffee.

1139
01:25:38,346 --> 01:25:40,644
Do you wanna go out some night?

1140
01:25:43,952 --> 01:25:45,317
We have a hit, huh?

1141
01:25:46,021 --> 01:25:47,113
Yeah.

1142
01:25:47,456 --> 01:25:51,358
Respect. From one maverick to another?
Professional.

1143
01:25:55,397 --> 01:25:56,591
Get in!

1144
01:25:57,432 --> 01:26:00,128
What?
- We're not finished yet. Come on.

1145
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:07,373
You ever been in a high-speed pursuit?
- No.

1146
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:09,974
Well, buckle up and get filming.

1147
01:26:19,387 --> 01:26:21,082
Of all the cunts.

1148
01:26:27,262 --> 01:26:30,789
This is where we separate
the men from the faggots.

1149
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:33,031
Film me when I talk, man.

1150
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:35,501
Come on, you fuck, you.

1151
01:26:37,305 --> 01:26:39,068
Is that all you got?

1152
01:26:41,476 --> 01:26:43,000
That your best?

1153
01:26:44,412 --> 01:26:45,674
Bollocks.

1154
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:55,556
After costing me my job.

1155
01:27:07,903 --> 01:27:10,633
Fuck, where's he going?
- You filming me?

1156
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,400
He's going to the country.

1157
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:18,841
You're out of your element now, pal.
- So are we, Jerry.

1158
01:27:18,914 --> 01:27:20,541
Shut the fuck up.

1159
01:27:27,722 --> 01:27:30,054
I am gonna nab you directly.

1160
01:27:37,065 --> 01:27:39,693
I'm right behind you, you little fuck.

1161
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,261
I won't hurt you, come here.

1162
01:28:28,016 --> 01:28:30,211
Step on the bumper, will you?

1163
01:28:30,285 --> 01:28:33,186
Put your weight on it, so I can climb back.

1164
01:28:37,525 --> 01:28:38,685
Please.

1165
01:28:48,169 --> 01:28:49,636
Sorry, sheep.

1166
01:28:50,972 --> 01:28:52,963
Got to put you down, man.

1167
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:58,440
Out of your misery.

1168
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:04,384
It was you, you fuck! You stole my motor.

1169
01:29:04,853 --> 01:29:07,617
You shouldn't have pissed on my legs, man.

1170
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:12,317
Fuck's sake, and my sounds, man!
- Shit sounds.

1171
01:29:13,828 --> 01:29:16,422
You were playing them, fuckhole!

1172
01:29:17,966 --> 01:29:20,230
You hear this fucking hypocrite?

1173
01:29:20,301 --> 01:29:23,600
Anyway, the power of certain artistes...

1174
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,164
is beyond the ken of cunts like you.

1175
01:29:28,109 --> 01:29:31,374
You just don't have
the requisite Celtic soul, man.

1176
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:33,111
Yes, I do.

1177
01:29:35,216 --> 01:29:37,912
That's a brave fucking statement, huh?

1178
01:29:38,753 --> 01:29:41,586
Would you like the chance to back that up?

1179
01:29:50,365 --> 01:29:51,730
You and me.

1180
01:29:52,734 --> 01:29:54,201
Hand to hand.

1181
01:29:56,004 --> 01:29:57,335
You win...

1182
01:29:58,206 --> 01:29:59,673
I let you go.

1183
01:30:02,644 --> 01:30:03,736
Okay.

1184
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:07,004
Are you getting this, Ben? Come on!

1185
01:30:07,749 --> 01:30:11,845
This episode will be entitled
'Personal Justice.'

1186
01:30:12,954 --> 01:30:16,617
Come on, you fucking scumbag, you,
come on.

1187
01:30:37,245 --> 01:30:38,542
Good lad.

1188
01:30:48,156 --> 01:30:49,817
Jerry!

1189
01:31:01,236 --> 01:31:03,136
...over 80 miles an hour.

1190
01:31:03,404 --> 01:31:07,067
The chase, which ended here
and resulted in destruction of livestock...

1191
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:10,109
the vicious shoot-out and the loss of a life.

1192
01:31:10,178 --> 01:31:11,907
Detective Jerry Lynch...

1193
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:15,143
a 15-year veteran of the Garda Siochána,
distinguished himself...

1194
01:31:15,216 --> 01:31:17,275
Was it the money?
- No.

1195
01:31:17,585 --> 01:31:19,246
To hurt me?
- Deirdre.

1196
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,720
Him?
- Maybe a little bit, I don't know.

1197
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:25,089
You were an idiot. You know that? Always.
- I know.

1198
01:31:25,627 --> 01:31:28,790
Always the same shit,
or ever since I've known you.

1199
01:31:29,197 --> 01:31:33,691
Taking the long way to get what you want,
and fucking everything up on the way.

1200
01:31:33,802 --> 01:31:36,737
Anything but ask, huh?
- I might be refused.

1201
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:38,705
Anything but say what you need.

1202
01:31:38,773 --> 01:31:41,139
You have to take that chance, John.

1203
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:45,305
And you're right, you might be refused,
but on the other hand...

1204
01:31:45,613 --> 01:31:46,910
You know?

1205
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:50,674
Might's not definite, is it?
- No.

1206
01:31:50,752 --> 01:31:53,186
It's a vague enough term at best.

1207
01:31:56,925 --> 01:31:59,325
Tell me what you need, John.

1208
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:05,263
Hey, fuckhole, look at you. Give us a look.

1209
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:09,069
See you, John.

1210
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,400
Sure, it's only a flesh wound.

1211
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,638
So action-fucking-central, huh?

1212
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:17,073
So tell us about it.

1213
01:32:24,419 --> 01:32:26,114
Come on, man, tell.

1214
01:32:26,187 --> 01:32:27,677
Shit happens you can't change.

1215
01:32:27,755 --> 01:32:30,815
You've no choice but to deal with it,
adapt to it.

1216
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:34,861
Other shit, though, you have the choice,
the means to improve your situation...

1217
01:32:34,929 --> 01:32:37,898
and change things.
That's what you do, don't you?

1218
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:40,264
You do.
- Try to make yourself happy.

1219
01:32:40,335 --> 01:32:43,031
This is philosophy, George.

1220
01:32:43,104 --> 01:32:45,538
This is life. Come on.

1221
01:32:50,144 --> 01:32:51,236
More.

1222
01:32:56,551 --> 01:32:59,543
Succor, you know? Satisfaction.

1223
01:33:00,221 --> 01:33:03,782
I mean, take me for example, my handicap.

1224
01:33:03,892 --> 01:33:06,292
Or what you might call my handicap.

1225
01:33:07,528 --> 01:33:09,962
Snap! Hey, snap!

1226
01:33:15,203 --> 01:33:16,727
What's up, man?

1227
01:33:18,006 --> 01:33:19,064
I'm bricking.

1228
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,041
Relax, they haven't got you yet.
They're not gonna.

1229
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:23,543
What did you say at the hospital?

1230
01:33:23,611 --> 01:33:27,047
Said I was mugged and dumped
in the canal. Filed a report and all.

1231
01:33:27,115 --> 01:33:29,777
So fuck it. Keep the cool, we'll be hunky.

1232
01:33:29,851 --> 01:33:31,580
What about Deirdre?

1233
01:33:31,986 --> 01:33:34,386
She won't say anything, you know?

1234
01:33:34,522 --> 01:33:37,650
No, what about her and you, man?

1235
01:33:38,693 --> 01:33:41,218
Have youse finished
your little intermission?

1236
01:33:44,232 --> 01:33:45,324
What?

1237
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:48,630
I'll race you. Come in here,
think you're the king on wheels?

1238
01:33:48,703 --> 01:33:50,227
I'm the king round here.
- Fine.

1239
01:33:50,305 --> 01:33:51,294
Me.

1240
01:33:51,372 --> 01:33:53,203
Are you chicken, pal?

1241
01:33:54,509 --> 01:33:56,636
You afraid to face the king?

1242
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:00,338
Because you're not, you know.
- Not what?

1243
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:03,316
The king. You may be the prince.

1244
01:34:08,523 --> 01:34:10,184
Jerry!

1245
01:34:53,101 --> 01:34:54,363
Come in.

1246
01:35:10,385 --> 01:35:13,684
Did you see me on the news?
- Yeah.

1247
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:17,583
'Detective hero.'
- Yeah, I know, but come here.

1248
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,020
The way it was told is the way it has to be.

1249
01:35:23,097 --> 01:35:24,257
I know.

1250
01:35:24,632 --> 01:35:27,829
You saved my life. You're the hero, Ben.
- Hey.

1251
01:35:27,902 --> 01:35:29,392
No, I mean it.

1252
01:35:31,406 --> 01:35:35,342
As a token of my respect,
no, fuck that, my admiration...

1253
01:35:37,278 --> 01:35:39,269
I want you to have these.

1254
01:35:43,418 --> 01:35:46,581
Wow, Fainne Lasta.
- You've earned them.

1255
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:50,220
A warrior soul, Ben.

1256
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:52,649
A kindred soul.

1257
01:36:04,906 --> 01:36:07,340
I better go empty my colostomy bag.

1258
01:36:13,147 --> 01:36:16,981
We'll meet again, no doubt.
- Yeah. On the streets, huh?

1259
01:36:18,419 --> 01:36:19,943
On the streets.

1260
01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:32,591
Can I talk to you for a sec?

1261
01:36:32,967 --> 01:36:34,935
Hey, Maura.
- Hello, John.

1262
01:36:35,036 --> 01:36:36,697
Can I talk to you?

1263
01:36:37,271 --> 01:36:38,397
Sure.

1264
01:36:44,312 --> 01:36:47,577
Lf you don't shut up, I will race you.
- I hope so.

1265
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:51,908
I'll show you, you fucker. Come on.

1266
01:36:52,019 --> 01:36:54,783
I just wanna say a couple of things to you,
all right?

1267
01:36:54,856 --> 01:36:58,758
Now, I'm not asking for anything,
so don't feel any pressure.

1268
01:36:59,026 --> 01:37:01,119
Okay.
- Just listen.

1269
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:06,090
This is a list of things that I want...

1270
01:37:06,868 --> 01:37:08,529
and have wanted...

1271
01:37:08,769 --> 01:37:10,361
for a long time.

1272
01:37:10,638 --> 01:37:13,539
Straight from the heart, no fucking around.

1273
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:17,234
To be with you...

1274
01:37:17,879 --> 01:37:20,006
to live with you, and to...

1275
01:37:20,948 --> 01:37:23,815
eventually, you know, marry you.

1276
01:37:25,486 --> 01:37:28,080
To have your child...

1277
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:33,217
For me to have yours?
- Yes. All my children.

1278
01:37:33,394 --> 01:37:36,022
However many, three, four...
- Go on.

1279
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:39,062
To grow old with you.

1280
01:37:40,134 --> 01:37:41,396
To know...

1281
01:37:42,570 --> 01:37:44,595
and that's the main thing...

1282
01:37:45,006 --> 01:37:47,065
to know, all right...

1283
01:37:48,476 --> 01:37:50,376
that you feel the same.

1284
01:37:54,348 --> 01:37:55,679
That's it.

1285
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:03,083
How hard was that?

1286
01:38:05,193 --> 01:38:06,490
Hard enough.

1287
01:38:09,263 --> 01:38:11,231
Well, I do feel the same.

1288
01:38:22,243 --> 01:38:24,939
What's wrong?
- Not in front of your ma.

1289
01:38:26,614 --> 01:38:28,309
You fucking prude!

1290
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:31,142
They don't mind.

1291
01:38:39,126 --> 01:38:41,560
Will you ever cheat on me?
- Never.

1292
01:38:41,862 --> 01:38:44,296
Will you take care of me?
- Always.

1293
01:38:44,665 --> 01:38:46,633
Will you ever neglect me?
- No.

1294
01:38:46,734 --> 01:38:48,702
Raise a hand to me?
- No.

1295
01:38:49,237 --> 01:38:50,898
Take a shit on me?

1296
01:38:52,006 --> 01:38:53,667
Do you want me to?

1297
01:38:53,841 --> 01:38:57,777
I have had enough of you.
Fucking coming in here every night...

1298
01:39:00,014 --> 01:39:04,314
On your marks. Get set. Go!

1299
01:39:06,754 --> 01:39:10,246
Where are you,
you grumbling old piece of shit, youse?

1300
01:39:12,727 --> 01:39:14,695
Come on, you old fucker.

1301
01:39:17,398 --> 01:39:18,763
Oh, my leg.

1302
01:39:21,202 --> 01:39:22,669
Default, man.

1303
01:39:23,237 --> 01:39:24,465
Where is he?

1304
01:39:24,805 --> 01:39:27,433
Default. There was an obstacle.

1305
01:39:29,677 --> 01:39:31,304
Do you see this?

1306
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:36,143
I am the king of the world.

1307
01:39:36,217 --> 01:39:39,550
The king of the Republic of Ireland.

1308
01:39:41,155 --> 01:39:42,622
Saw you on the box, love.

1309
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:44,385
Yes?
- You were shit.

1310
01:39:44,592 --> 01:39:46,890
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1311
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:51,665
And thank you because you are out of here.

1312
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:57,104
So, you and Sally, man.
Who'd have thought?

1313
01:39:57,772 --> 01:39:59,103
Fucking love her, man.

1314
01:39:59,173 --> 01:40:01,403
Here, wait till I tell you
what we did last night.

1315
01:40:01,475 --> 01:40:03,636
Don't, man, fuck's sake.

1316
01:40:03,744 --> 01:40:06,679
You're right. Keep it to myself, I will.

1317
01:40:07,148 --> 01:40:09,082
Cherish it.
- That's it.

1318
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:11,145
Relish it, I will.

1319
01:40:12,987 --> 01:40:15,148
So, you relish being out of a job?

1320
01:40:15,222 --> 01:40:18,851
Fucking right.
No getting up, no taking orders.

1321
01:40:18,959 --> 01:40:21,621
No Henderson.
- That's the best bit.

1322
01:40:21,729 --> 01:40:24,857
Being free of that fuck.
- Absolutely.

1323
01:40:24,965 --> 01:40:28,264
Are you off, Mr. Henderson?
- I am, indeed, Mrs. Rooney.

1324
01:40:28,336 --> 01:40:31,328
A little R&R, as they say in the States.

1325
01:40:32,206 --> 01:40:34,197
Isn't it lucky for some?

1326
01:40:37,545 --> 01:40:39,979
I am the boss.

1327
01:40:40,748 --> 01:40:42,375
I have authority.

1328
01:40:44,118 --> 01:40:45,881
You are the minion.

1329
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:48,445
You're beneath.

1330
01:40:50,624 --> 01:40:52,251
I have the power.

1331
01:40:53,494 --> 01:40:54,859
What do I have?

1332
01:40:54,929 --> 01:40:58,387
I'm sorry, I didn't get that. Speak up.
What do I have?

1333
01:41:00,067 --> 01:41:01,534
That's right.

1334
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:05,538
That's absolutely...

1335
01:41:07,408 --> 01:41:09,569
What the fuck?

1336
01:41:45,379 --> 01:41:48,177
Where the hell is it?
- Just do it manually.

1337
01:41:48,249 --> 01:41:50,114
Are you sitting on it?

1338
01:41:50,484 --> 01:41:52,281
Just do it manually.

1339
01:41:58,926 --> 01:42:00,393
This is good.

1340
01:42:00,594 --> 01:42:03,961
You can see the nocturnal activities...

1341
01:42:04,231 --> 01:42:07,064
No, I saw this one. Something else.

1342
01:42:08,035 --> 01:42:09,627
Is it under you?

1343
01:42:19,713 --> 01:42:21,908
Keep going. Come on.

1344
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,383
No, back one.

1345
01:42:24,919 --> 01:42:26,216
Back one.
