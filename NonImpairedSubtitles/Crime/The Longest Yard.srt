1
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,988
Hey, sexy.

2
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,628
I love that dress.

3
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,799
Of course you do, Lorenzo.
You made it.

4
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,534
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, guys.

5
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,306
- There you are.
- Lena.

6
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,239
- You've done it again.
- Well, it's all for you, Bradlee.

7
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,774
Gotta mingle.

8
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,706
Oh, the girls are by the pool.

9
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,612
Well, well, well, Lena. So where's
this sexy boy toy of yours hiding?

10
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,615
I didn't know you were
a football fan, Patrick.

11
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,483
I've never watched a game. I'm just
a big fan of his old underwear ads.

12
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:08,555
Well, he's probably just getting out of
the shower. Let me go hurry his ass up.

13
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,955
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

14
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,435
<i>Start of the fourth quarter, and Owens
will throw. He's got Brown wide open!</i>

15
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,831
You have got to be kidding me.

16
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,064
Honey, just let me finish the game,
I'll take you to the movies.

17
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,137
Take me to the movies?

18
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,676
Hello! There's a huge party
going on downstairs.

19
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,111
Remember the catering trucks
and the valet parkers?

20
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,284
Oh, shit, I forgot.

21
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,387
I'll tell you what
you should forget about.

22
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,080
Football.

23
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,589
Because it's forgotten all about you.

24
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,395
Now, you're going to put this outfit on
that I bought you,

25
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,361
drag your drunken ass downstairs

26
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,731
and mingle with my clients
like a good boy.

27
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,797
Who am I? Elton John?
I ain't wearing that shit.

28
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,205
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not your trained monkey, honey.

29
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,539
No. You're much more
expensive than that.

30
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,345
But I tell you what.

31
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,280
If you're not downstairs
in five minutes,

32
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,477
I'm gonna throw you out of my bed,

33
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,781
out of my house and out of my life.

34
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,789
Then you're gonna have to
pay for your own bananas.

35
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,256
I'm just so mad at you
because you're not wearing my gift.

36
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,129
Gift?

37
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,669
What gift?

38
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,738
It's like a l-love-you gift.
I left it in the closet for you.

39
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,668
Really?

40
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,739
Paul, I'm so excited.

41
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,572
I can't believe you did this.

42
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,613
- Where'd you put it?
- In the back, on the right.

43
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,412
Paul? Paul, what are you doing?

44
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,746
I think we need some
alone time, honey,

45
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,788
so I'm gonna go take a cruise
in your Bentley.

46
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,256
Don't you dare take my car,
you drunken bastard!

47
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,453
- I own you!
- I love you.

48
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,648
Somebody please open
this damn door! Patrick?

49
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,187
- Lena?
- Patrick.

50
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,489
What happened to you?

51
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,594
He locked me in the closet
and left me to die.

52
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,094
Oh, my God, he is deranged!

53
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,631
He thinks he can mess with me.

54
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:29,802
<i>911.</i>

55
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,599
Oh, man.
Here come the party poopers.

56
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,748
Well, well, well. I'll be damned.
If it isn't Paul Crewe.

57
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,652
So, what did I do wrong?
Was I driving poorly?

58
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,324
Nope. Nope.
This car was reported stolen.

59
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,964
No, no, no.
It's actually my girlfriend's car.

60
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,656
Shit happens.

61
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,127
Shit does happen. I mean,
look what happened to your ears.

62
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,339
I gotta ask you something.
Does he get XM Radio with those?

63
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,739
Actually, they get
a couple of channels.

64
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,341
It's Paul Crewe.

65
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,846
Another question, though.

66
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,985
Santa Claus. What's he like?

67
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,181
Boy, I hate to arrest a public figure
like yourself,

68
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,358
but, hell, I don't think
you got too many

69
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,925
endorsement deals to worry about,
now, do you?

70
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,858
Now, listen here, Mr. Frodo.
Don't get short with me.

71
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,097
That was good. I mean, he's good.

72
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,934
Man. I hope you got a lot of money
for that game you threw,

73
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,404
because that was the most pathetic
thing I ever saw.

74
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,742
Now, step out of the vehicle,
Mr. Crewe.

75
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,642
Don't you think I should pull the car
over more? I could get sideswiped.

76
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,818
You're slurring your words a bit there,
Paul. You been drinking tonight?

77
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,422
Absolutely not. Now, could you do me a
favor? Hold this beer while I back it up.

78
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:07,161
Hey, you can finish that one.
I got five more. Take care, guys.

79
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,994
We got a 3-94 in progress.

80
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,619
Okay, remain calm.

81
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,885
How you doing? What's up?
What's up? What's up?

82
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,263
<i>What you are watching is live footage
of a vehicle, apparently stolen,</i>

83
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,959
<i>being pursued by police.</i>

84
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,072
<i>We're receiving word now
that the driver of that vehicle</i>

85
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:51,175
<i>is former Pittsburgh football star
Paul Crewe.</i>

86
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,935
<i>Crewe, you might remember,</i>

87
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,673
<i>was the only man ever to be indicted
on federal racketeering charges</i>

88
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,317
<i>for shaving points
in a professional football game,</i>

89
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,146
<i>although it was never fully proven.</i>

90
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,719
Yeah!

91
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,761
- Hello.
- Do not get one more scratch

92
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,491
on my car, or I will slit your throat.

93
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,767
See, that's our problem, sweetie.

94
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,567
You care about this car
more than you do us.

95
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,472
And how'd you even know
there was a scratch on this baby?

96
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:30,672
Because I am watching you on TV,
as is the whole country.

97
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,646
Once again,
you are proving to everyone

98
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,343
what a worthless piece of shit
you are.

99
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,684
Well, I hope they like this.

100
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,103
Hey, Lena!

101
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,876
<i>I think we should start
seeing other people!</i>

102
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,679
I think I'm in love.

103
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,759
Good news, boys,
I didn't spill my beer.

104
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,032
<i>Without question, Crewe's five-year
federal probation for point-shaving</i>

105
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,201
<i>has been severely violated tonight.</i>

106
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,859
<i>The future of this once-great football
star looks very dark indeed.</i>

107
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,253
Long way from the big city,
huh, superstar?

108
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,228
Staying with the times
around here, huh?

109
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,240
Ain't she beautiful?

110
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,527
Home sweet home, boy.

111
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,028
Get on your feet.

112
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,263
You're one lucky son of a bitch,
Crewe.

113
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,497
- Is that right?
- That's right.

114
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,006
See, the warden loves his football.

115
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,270
Fact, he was on the winning side
of your little thing.

116
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,449
- Well, tell him congratulations.
- But I wasn't.

117
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,416
Welcome to Allenville.

118
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,619
Thank you, sergeant.
I'll take it from here.

119
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,994
- Afternoon, inmate Crewe.
- Yeah.

120
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,221
Come on. Warden wants to see you.

121
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:00,889
Let's do it.

122
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,391
Move it.

123
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,556
I used to play
a little college ball myself.

124
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,728
Down at the University of Miami.

125
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,329
I bet a lot of your old teammates
are locked up in here.

126
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,967
No inmates from my playing days.
Couple of guards, though.

127
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,966
See, we got us a fine
prison-guard league down here.

128
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,902
It's like a company softball team.

129
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,336
Now, the warden...

130
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,309
...he's gonna ask you to help out.

131
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,106
Okay. With what?

132
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,113
That wasn't nice.

133
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,861
When the warden asks you,

134
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,324
what are you gonna say?

135
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,125
Yes?

136
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,674
You're gonna tell him "no."
You got it?

137
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,535
You're gonna tell the warden

138
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,045
that you want nothing to do
with his football fantasies.

139
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,052
Not in my back yard.

140
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,480
Because the warden
don't run this prison. I do.

141
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,818
You understand?

142
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,727
Not entirely.

143
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:44,365
Okay. I feel you, dog. I feel you.

144
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,233
Paul "Wrecking" Crewe.

145
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,410
I don't get to say this
to my new guests very often,

146
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,101
but it's an honor to have you
here at this institution.

147
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,611
It's an honor to be
locked up here, sir.

148
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,550
Oh, well, this is Errol Dandridge.

149
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,349
Colonel Sanders
been eating his own chicken.

150
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,191
He's my political adviser.

151
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,294
See, I've been approached
by several very influential people

152
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,795
wondering if I'd be interested
in standing for governor.

153
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:18,527
They see the way I run this prison,
think maybe I should run this state.

154
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,372
Only with less sodomy, right?

155
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,272
Hopefully none.

156
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,048
Sorry.

157
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:35,713
Now, there are two things we take very
seriously here in the state of Texas.

158
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,021
Prison and football.

159
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,123
We play a little of the latter here.

160
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,661
The warden is too modest to admit
that his team is rather good.

161
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,455
But not good enough.

162
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,034
Five years since
our last championship.

163
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,766
Five years.

164
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:56,032
Now, I've worked real hard,
pulled strings,

165
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,608
called in quite a few favors
to get you here, Paul.

166
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,708
Now, why would you go and do that?

167
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,350
Because I am convinced that
you can get us back on track.

168
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,084
I haven't played football in I don't
know how long. I don't really want to.

169
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,658
You wouldn't be playing, Paul.
Just consulting.

170
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,455
Anyone who was once the MVP
of the National Football League

171
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,258
must have a great deal
of expertise to offer.

172
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,225
Captain, what would you say
to Mr. Crewe looking in,

173
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,905
giving us the benefit
of his experience?

174
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:32,373
I think that's a real good idea, warden.
We can use all the help we can get.

175
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,409
Well, then, it's all settled.

176
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:36,973
What you say, Paul?

177
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,282
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm gonna have to pass.

178
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:48,215
Now, I can assure you

179
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,523
that your time here will be a whole
lot easier if you just participate.

180
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,129
I just wanna do my time
and go home. Nothing else.

181
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,872
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Crewe.

182
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:06,537
Captain Knauer, you can stay.

183
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,416
Sit down!

184
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,979
I used to love
your underwear commercials.

185
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,256
Thank you very much.

186
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,658
My ex-husband wore the
same brand of tighty whities.

187
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,832
He didn't fill them out
quite as well as you, though.

188
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,828
Special effects. Hollywood.
Not all me.

189
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,168
Oh, I doubt that very seriously.

190
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,346
Well, then get him enthusiastic,
damn it!

191
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,444
Come on, get up.

192
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,674
How'd it go in there?
We all set now?

193
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,750
Oh, yeah, we're real tight.

194
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,627
Only the finest for you, superstar.

195
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,030
I was just playing.

196
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,412
I ain't gonna forget you, Crewe.

197
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,709
Hey, yo, you owe me money
on that game, punk!

198
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,580
Better watch yourself, Mr. Football!

199
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:22,981
Bitch!

200
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,563
Yeah, you better run, woman.

201
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,965
Yo, football.

202
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,100
Take a seat.

203
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,161
Thanks.

204
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,205
You know, I have never seen
one inmate just walk in here

205
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,503
and be unanimously hated
by the entire population.

206
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,044
- I ain't never seen it.
- How'd I get so lucky?

207
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,113
You could have robbed banks,
sold crack,

208
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,842
stole your grandmama's pension,
and nobody would have cared.

209
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,545
But shaving points off a football game?
Man, that's just un-American.

210
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,951
- You play football?
- Me? No.

211
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,185
I suck so bad, they used to pick me
after the white kids.

212
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,126
Used to be mad too. It's like, "I can't
believe I picked a nigga that can't play."

213
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,325
- Caretaker.
- Paul Crewe.

214
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,004
Whatever your pleasure,
I can facilitate.

215
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:16,333
You need weed, you need meth...
Hey, you need Prozac, I'm your man.

216
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,772
I know how you white boys
always deal with that depression.

217
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,242
I mean, me personally, I don't
understand what you white boys

218
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,472
all depressed about.
Hey, you're white. Smile.

219
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,950
And for a small fee,
I can even get you McDonald's.

220
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,780
- Really?
- Yeah, that's right. Mickey D's.

221
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,718
My man Cheeseburger Eddy
got the hookup.

222
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:32,891
Cheeseburger Eddy?

223
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,923
That's right.
We can get our McFlurry on.

224
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,822
Enjoy it, fat man.

225
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,156
What about the love
of a beautiful woman?

226
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,856
Well, you're gonna have
to lower your standards

227
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,035
on the beautiful part
and on the woman part.

228
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,101
Hey.

229
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,302
Let's just stick
with the cheeseburgers.

230
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,704
Oh, they ugly now, but in eight months,
he gonna look like Beyoncé.

231
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,877
No, thanks.

232
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,012
Now, here's the most important part.

233
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,580
You can't let these guys scare you.
You can't let them punk you.

234
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,513
Because if you do that, you gonna
end up being somebody's bitch.

235
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,511
Don't want that.
Thanks for the advice.

236
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,057
Hey. Let me take that tray
out for you.

237
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,826
I ain't done eating yet.

238
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,830
Oh, you're not?
I'll give it back to you, then.

239
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,527
You're dead!

240
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,374
Hornet's Nest!

241
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,356
Everybody stay down.

242
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,927
Stay quiet!

243
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,330
Come on, Crewe, get up.

244
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,303
Get up, superstar.

245
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,306
Yes, sir.

246
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,635
You think you can do anything
you want around here, don't you?

247
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,404
Well, you are no different
than any other piece of shit

248
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,342
that calls this place home.

249
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:07,477
Really? These guys think
you're a dumb redneck too?

250
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,685
Girl, that's your new boo.

251
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,990
You better cut that shit out.
It's getting old.

252
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,523
That's gonna cost you.

253
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,199
Looking forward to it.

254
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,217
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

255
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,056
Hey, superdick.

256
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,159
Warden's wondering if your stay
in the hotbox has changed your mind.

257
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,330
How long have I been in here?

258
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,005
One week. Wanna go for two?

259
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,774
How'd you find these guys anyways?

260
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,108
Recruitment, boy.

261
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,650
When college stars don't get drafted,
they need a place to go.

262
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,914
A job, money, security.

263
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,820
Who drank all the damn Gatorade?!

264
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,787
Damn it!

265
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,587
And apparently steroids.

266
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,530
Look, seems like you got all the talent
you'd want. So why do you need me?

267
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,599
Well, now, you might
find this hard to believe,

268
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,636
but there's folks here in the prison
league don't care for me very much.

269
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,933
- You, warden?
- They thought it might be amusing

270
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,771
to schedule the defending
league champs as our first game.

271
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,641
And me? Well, I thought
an old pro like yourself

272
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,716
might have some training-camp tricks,
drills, insights to offer up.

273
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,614
Give us the competitive edge.

274
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,884
All right. Relatively simple.
You need a tune-up game.

275
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,059
A tune-up game?

276
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,888
Yeah. In college, we'd start every
season against Appalachian State

277
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,688
or some slack Division II team.

278
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,129
Kick the living shit out of them.
Get their confidence up.

279
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,261
You know something, Paul?

280
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,803
- You've just given me an inspiration.
- That's great. What?

281
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,976
You're gonna assemble a team
to play the first game against us.

282
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,510
And you, Mr. Crewe,
are gonna be the quarterback.

283
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,005
I don't think so.

284
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,546
Let me tell you something.

285
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,742
In my prison, to get along,
you gotta go along.

286
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,114
I just wanna do my three years
and be done.

287
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,086
Three years is before
you assaulted Captain Knauer.

288
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,521
Now, you could be with us
for a very long time, Mr. Crewe.

289
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,156
Fine, I'll do it.

290
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,258
Good choice.

291
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,762
But one condition, though.

292
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,702
Gotta promise me to keep
Captain Knauer off my back.

293
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:17,875
It's a deal.

294
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,670
Now, you got four weeks
to assemble a team and train them.

295
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,076
What, are we gonna have a half-hour
a day to practice with a Nerf ball?

296
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,878
Oh, I'll make sure my boys allow you
sufficient freedom, within these walls,

297
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,883
to get your team in shape.

298
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,357
What's this? "Football 'tree-outs."'

299
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,893
What the hell is a "tree-out"?

300
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,928
"Tryout," you half a meatball.

301
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,125
- What's this football thing about, man?
- Crewe's getting a team together.

302
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,861
- To play against who?
- The guards.

303
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,735
Now, I don't know about y'all,
but I occasionally have the impulse

304
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,740
to physically assault one of our
finer correctional officers.

305
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,140
Yeah? Well, how the hell
we gonna get to do that?

306
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,249
Just show up at the "tree-outs,"
you big, dumb bitch.

307
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,085
Do the girls get to play?

308
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,120
We're playing footballs,
not balls-balls.

309
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,623
This is bullshit. Just another chance
for the guards to beat on us.

310
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,853
Don't you idiots get it? We could get
a free shot at the guards.

311
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,498
This is our turn.
We could beat up on them.

312
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,258
We could kill them.

313
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,669
Kill them.

314
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,571
You know MVP
sold his own teammates out.

315
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,909
What do you think
he's gonna do to you fools?

316
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,718
And that's the truth.
With some cheese on it.

317
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,456
There ain't no meat loaf
between these buns.

318
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,989
Yo, man, that's my flier, man!
I worked hard on it!

319
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,321
You see? He ran like a little bitch,
right? You saw that, right?

320
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,155
Yo, team needs you.
Team needs you.

321
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,233
You sh... You come to the tr...
Come to the tree-outs.

322
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,175
Crappy field, shit-ass equipment...

323
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,403
Hey, man, at least we got some
world-class players over there.

324
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,545
Forty-five.

325
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,377
Forty-six.

326
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,016
Forty-seven.

327
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,417
He might make the team.

328
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,990
Well, if we gotta cut him,
you're doing it.

329
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,888
Forty-nine.

330
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,353
Fifty.

331
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,792
- All right, man.
- Good job, man.

332
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,467
Well, well, well.
You a football player?

333
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,660
Oh, no. I never played
no football, mister.

334
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,035
So, what happened? You read the flier,
thought it looked like some fun?

335
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,937
- Oh, I can't read.
- Oh, don't worry.

336
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,338
Reading's for rich people.

337
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,908
So you know, we're putting together
a football team. Love you to join.

338
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,246
Will you teach me to football?

339
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,682
Sure we'll teach you to football.
Won't we, Caretaker?

340
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,083
Hey, I'll teach you anything.
Just don't eat me.

341
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,223
Okay.

342
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,056
Down, Shrek. Down!

343
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,462
Okay, bring it in. Whoever's trying out
for the team, wake up.

344
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,159
Can you give a brother
a little hustle?

345
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,061
Very good.

346
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,867
For those of you who don't know
who I am, I'm Paul Crewe.

347
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:08,034
I'm gonna be your coach,
your captain, your quarterback.

348
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,237
You haven't played in years.
Why can't I be quarterback?

349
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,440
- You're right. Let's see what you got.
- All right.

350
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,778
- Hit me, I'm open.
- Hike, hike! Hike!

351
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,121
That's why.
Now, sit down and shut up.

352
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,222
It slipped. I just ate popcorn.

353
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,655
Question: Any of you gentlemen
ever play football before?

354
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:25,462
- You did? Where?
- Kansas State.

355
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,859
Are you shitting me?
For Coach Snyder?

356
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,698
Kansas State Prison.

357
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,028
Now, I hear they have
the softest mattresses out there.

358
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,570
Yeah, they do.

359
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,969
Not as soft as the ones
at West Texas Mental Institution.

360
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,804
- Really?
- Let's finish this conversation later.

361
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,106
For now, I wanna see
what you got out there.

362
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,511
We'll grade them
on a scale of one to ten.

363
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,879
Move it! Hustle, hustle, hustle!

364
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,113
Give these guys sixes.
Give these guys fives.

365
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,758
Good. Good.
Give them threes.

366
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,291
Very nice!

367
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,588
- Aren't we missing somebody?
- Where's the Kansas State guy?

368
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,600
You assholes better not cut me!
I'm still on this team!

369
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,863
Negative two.

370
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,099
All right, go with negative two.

371
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,506
Hey! Somebody bring me
a Diet Coke!

372
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,771
- Let's do this!
- That's it!

373
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,911
Five.

374
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,384
Good. Seven.

375
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,417
Stupid tire! You're a fricking tire!

376
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,854
You think you're better than me?!
I'll kick your ass!

377
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,261
Three.

378
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,354
And a half?

379
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,933
Yeah. That's better.

380
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,601
Okay. Good.

381
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,932
Yeah. Hit that bag, man.
There you go, man.

382
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,106
Four.

383
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,273
- Five. I don't know.
- I go.

384
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,139
Come on, Switowski!

385
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,308
Daddy!

386
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,983
Oh, man!

387
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,187
- Look at that.
- He got it off the hinge.

388
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,983
- I think that's a ten.
- Let's go with a ten.

389
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,558
I'm sorry. I "brokeded" your toy.

390
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,890
No, that's a good thing. You should
have a victory hug with Caretaker.

391
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,862
What? What you
talking about, man? Hey!

392
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,304
Asshole!

393
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,902
Okay, fellas, it's pretty simple.
You do a buttonhook.

394
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,600
The rest of you guys block for me.
I'll take care of the rest.

395
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,905
Okay? On "go." On "go."

396
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,048
Ready? Break!

397
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,347
We'll work on that.

398
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,854
Okay, half speed on this one, guys.
Slow and easy.

399
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,026
Ready?!

400
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,819
Go!

401
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,099
Stop it!

402
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,799
Stop the violence!

403
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,502
Can't we all get along?

404
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,956
- Hey, Paul.
- Unger.

405
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,285
- Team's looking great.
- Oh, yeah.

406
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,223
- So are you.
- Yep. Working on it.

407
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:16,560
The blood of the guards is gonna flow
like the rivers of ancient Babylon.

408
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:20,226
That's good news.
Unger, you're the man.

409
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,234
Good job today. You're all starting
to look really sharp out there. Yeah.

410
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,740
See you tomorrow.

411
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,377
- We're gonna suck.
- Yeah. No doubt about it.

412
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,597
You look like
you could use a little help.

413
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,098
No offense, my man,
but you're a little seasoned.

414
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,291
Seasoned?

415
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,837
I'm not asking to play. I'll coach.
I'm Nate Scarborough.

416
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,002
Nate Scarborough?

417
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,110
The Heisman Trophy winner
from Oklahoma?

418
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:05,239
The inmate from cellblock D.

419
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,908
But about a hundred years ago,
when I could run and gun,

420
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,878
yeah, I was a Sooner then.

421
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,717
I heard you were dead.

422
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:18,021
No, I ain't dead.
I've been right here, rotting.

423
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:21,892
Waiting for a chance to get back
at those sadistic guards.

424
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,000
Waiting. For this.

425
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,363
Well, coach, as you can see,

426
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:29,335
we don't exactly have the cream
of the crop to work with here.

427
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,771
Well, what are we gonna do?
How are we gonna find players?

428
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,171
How'd they get you
to go to Florida State?

429
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,937
They recruited me.

430
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,545
I'll get the strippers.

431
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,012
<i>Well, now, Lindsay, this isn't
about credit or congratulations.</i>

432
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,988
This is about giving men
who've made mistakes in their lives

433
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,526
an opportunity
to rise above themselves.

434
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,494
To move beyond
the bars of containment.

435
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:55,988
Say what?

436
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,099
What I would do to you.

437
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,981
Yeah. Nice boot, skin man.

438
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,414
Hey, why does he get to be
the kicker? I was All-State, man.

439
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,383
Let's see what you got.

440
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,250
That's why, you dumb-ass.

441
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,254
Just go do some laps.

442
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,217
I heard you boys needed to see me.

443
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,191
Yeah. I want you to meet Skitchy.

444
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,990
Hey, dog.
Check that building over there.

445
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,531
They keep all the records
in the basement.

446
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,033
He's been here so long,
he knows where everything is.

447
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,263
That ain't necessarily
a good thing, is it?

448
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:39,273
I had a parole date in '86.
But I got in a tussle with a guard and...

449
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,876
One punch and it went away.

450
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,671
Twenty extra years for one punch?

451
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,906
Well, unfortunately for him,
the guard he punched

452
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,981
just happens to be the warden now.

453
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,948
Oh, shit. Warden Hazen?

454
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,280
"Oh, shit" is right.

455
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,822
Fight in the yard. Send backup.

456
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,858
Right on time.

457
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,120
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

458
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,497
Ain't you guys glad you got
a black man for a friend?

459
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,296
- Hell, yeah.
- Come on.

460
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,205
Hazen has a rating system
for every con.

461
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,713
What's three stars?

462
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:24,753
The more prone to violence that the
inmate is, the more stars he gets.

463
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,355
Five stars is the max.

464
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,085
I didn't know that. Let's see how many
stars my maniacal ass got.

465
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:37,164
Half a star? That's gotta be a mistake.
Check it again. Check it again.

466
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,336
You're about as maniacal
as a boxful of kittens.

467
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,697
Come on, that's not funny, man.

468
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,430
I'm gonna have to stab somebody
or something. Get my rep up.

469
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,906
Why don't we have a maniacal pillow
fight tonight. That could get it up some.

470
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,644
Yeah. We can sell it to pay-per-view.

471
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,817
<i>Superstar Versus Half-a-Star.</i>

472
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:56,478
Why don't you shut up before I slit your
throat and watch the dust come out.

473
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,417
Come on, guys,
we only got a couple minutes.

474
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,124
How about this guy?

475
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,123
Damn, this fool got the chair
three times, ain't died yet.

476
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,159
Well, we may not have
the most talented team,

477
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,797
but we will definitely
have the meanest.

478
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,367
- What's he doing that for?
- Because he's a freak.

479
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,797
Hey, Sasquatch!
Someone's here to see you!

480
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,135
Not too smart on your part.

481
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,241
Hey.

482
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,107
How's the headbanging coming?

483
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,645
You're bleeding. Just so you know.

484
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,558
People have told me that
you and I look a lot alike,

485
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,991
so I wanted to see for myself.

486
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,759
I'm gonna take a piss.

487
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,398
You scared him away, dumbshit.

488
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,037
<i>You're kidding. Five-star Torres
likes The View?</i>

489
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,543
No, just Joy Behar.

490
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,614
<i>The good news is she can
breast-feed standing up. That's it.</i>

491
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,949
Where does she come up
with this shit?

492
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,448
I'm a Star Jones man myself.
I love that big bitch.

493
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,621
<i>That was, like, the furthest thing.</i>

494
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,420
<i>I got married so young, so, I mean,</i>

495
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,894
<i>they weren't pressuring me,
the society was pressuring me...</i>

496
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,589
Mr. Torres.

497
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,292
Us convicts are starting up
a football team.

498
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,868
Not interested.

499
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,701
We're playing the guards.

500
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,939
Walk away.

501
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,210
Good idea.

502
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,079
0 for 2.

503
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,449
<i>You're putting the pressure
on her right now.</i>

504
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,049
Show's over, amigo.

505
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,577
I still got 15 minutes of Joy Behar.

506
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:15,282
Well, I'm cutting you short.
Back to your cell, asswipe.

507
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,921
Hey, white boy.

508
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,495
Cherryhead gonna play?

509
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,695
Yes, he is.

510
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,602
Crewe, don't forget,
I'm gonna be open.

511
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,575
Green 40! Hut!

512
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,250
Damn!

513
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,550
Brucie. Brucie. You all right?
You breathing?

514
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,059
I got a bird. His name is Ronnie.

515
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,161
Well, tell Ronnie you got
knocked the fuck out.

516
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:59,365
Wow, no bullshit. Real football?
Against the guards?

517
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,730
Full contact.

518
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,666
Captain Knauer is their quarterback?

519
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:07,069
- Yep.
- So I get to tackle him?

520
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,076
Yeah. You can either tackle him or hit
him over the head with that hammer.

521
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,007
I wanna hurt him. Not kill him.

522
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,411
Let's get out of here
before that thing bites somebody.

523
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,818
All right. We'll see you
and your pet iguana at practice.

524
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,817
Down, set!

525
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,395
Hut! Hut!

526
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,428
Hey!

527
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,063
- Hit me.
- Get rid of it.

528
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,598
Get rid of it!

529
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,742
He didn't get rid of it.

530
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,111
Sacked your ass.

531
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,584
Somebody's gotta get open, guys.

532
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,252
You got hammered by the hammer.

533
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:52,480
I think I felt it on my leg.
We gotta get some speed, man.

534
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,590
What'd you expect?
You got no brothers out there.

535
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,555
What are you talking about?
We got Switowski.

536
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,689
Switowski? That's one brother.

537
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,797
That's a lonely nigga.
This ain't hockey.

538
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,560
You want some speed,
you know where to go.

539
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,706
Hey, yo, check out
this fake Slim Shady, man.

540
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,378
I knew you couldn't resist my shit.

541
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,779
I got the shakes
that'll make you quake.

542
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,784
I got the fries that'll cross your eyes.

543
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,980
I got the burgers that'll...

544
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,826
I just got burgers.

545
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,086
I'm all right. Thank you.

546
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:36,456
Just wanted to talk to you fellas about
possibly joining the football team.

547
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,825
The only game we'd play with you is

548
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:43,973
Slap the Point-Shaving White Boy
Till He Cries Like a Baby-Back Bitch.

549
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:48,269
<i>Baby-back bitch, baby-back bitch
Baby-back bitch</i>

550
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,640
- That's a big-ass robot.
- Yeah.

551
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,545
You gonna help me out here?

552
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,921
Thank you, Half-a-Star.

553
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,827
Just so you know,
we are playing the guards.

554
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,792
That ain't a team.
That's just a bunch of dumb rednecks

555
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,489
giving themselves excuses
to grab each other.

556
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,796
This guy must be
quite the athlete, huh?

557
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,974
You risk bringing your ass in the jungle
because you know I am.

558
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,338
Yeah, so you'd beat me
in a game of one-on-one, right?

559
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,639
- What?
- I think it's time for you to get stepping.

560
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,975
How's this, though? One game.

561
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:30,348
I beat you, you guys play for the team.
You beat me, I'll leave you alone.

562
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,448
Take that. Take that, Deac.

563
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,785
This fool ain't nothing
but a thing, baby.

564
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,389
- Ball, dog.
- Ball up!

565
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:40,962
Can Crewe play ball?

566
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,427
He's a natural athlete.

567
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,898
So is Greg Louganis, but I bet you
he'd get his ass whupped out here.

568
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,736
- Game's 11. Call your own fouls.
- Okay.

569
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,335
- Come on, come on.
- Give it to him, Deac!

570
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,373
Did I get you?

571
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,313
No, that was clean.

572
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,486
He'll be all right. Call his mama.

573
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,155
- If I foul you, tell me, dog.
- Okay, baby.

574
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,683
Take this f... Take this foul.

575
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,233
What happened there?
I think it's my ball, right?

576
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,434
All right.

577
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,398
Get up! Get up, Deac!

578
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,761
Come on, Paul!

579
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,064
- Calm down.
- What?

580
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,707
Now, don't stir up
the brothers, now. Come on.

581
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,903
Come on, Deacon!

582
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,413
Did I get you, dog?

583
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,454
Hell, no, baby. That was clean.
Good D.

584
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,022
I thought he didn't wanna get hurt.

585
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,750
It ain't about getting hurt.
It's about pride.

586
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,861
I bet you he's pretty proud right now.

587
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,890
It ain't easy being cheesy!

588
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,339
Did I get you? Did I get you?

589
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,137
- No, I think I'm okay, baby.
- I didn't get you, did I?

590
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,282
That's traveling, bitch.

591
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,800
You keep coming, huh?

592
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,462
Game point, baby.
How you want the game put up?

593
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,270
Foul.

594
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,241
That was a bullshit call!

595
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,354
My court, my ball.

596
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,893
All right, y'all. Let Deac speak!

597
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,134
Nice spanking that ass, dog.

598
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,208
- Now, get stepping.
- Hold up.

599
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,513
Y'all got a running back?

600
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,710
Not any good ones.

601
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,518
No disrespect, Deac...

602
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,216
...but any man that can take
that kind of beating out here,

603
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,086
I can't wait to see what he can do
in a contact sport.

604
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,260
Shit, I'm in.

605
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:03,266
Man, give me that cheeseburger.
You acting like a real McAsshole.

606
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,925
Cheeseburger, he wants to run
with the white boys, we will let him.

607
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,605
Let's do this.

608
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,507
Earl Megget.

609
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,974
Well, we didn't get the whole chocolate
bar, but we got a Hershey's Kiss.

610
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,237
I'll take it.

611
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,909
Let's get this over with, rookie,
I'm starving.

612
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,780
Fresh meat, boys! Fresh meat!

613
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,580
Down, set!

614
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,782
Battle, you're a psycho!

615
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,960
Tony, you're a fat shit! Hut!

616
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:39,964
Holy shit!

617
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,237
Get him!

618
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:57,181
Ran right out of your shoes, huh?
Hey, manager, don't you think

619
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,720
we can get our new star running back
a decent pair of cleats?

620
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:03,052
Yeah. I think I got a cousin
that drives a truck for Reebok.

621
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,660
It's cool, man.
I never had shoes growing up noway.

622
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,558
- I'll be all right for now.
- Oh, okay.

623
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,256
Get your country ass
back in the huddle.

624
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,060
That boy got some slave feet,
you see that?

625
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,565
Defense! Huddle up over there!

626
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,571
Paul. Paul.

627
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,835
Hey, ladies. How's it hanging?

628
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,070
- Tell him.
- I'm gonna say something to him.

629
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,249
I just wanted to let you know
I am your biggest fan.

630
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,477
And I will be cheering my jailhouse
boobies off for you at game day.

631
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,155
I appreciate that. Thank you.

632
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,823
Paul.

633
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,422
I appreciate you.

634
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,985
Okay, thanks. I'm glad to know that.

635
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,365
Okay, are you done now?

636
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,228
What's wrong with you? Jealous
because I don't cheer for you anymore?

637
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,631
I don't know what
you're talking about, freak show.

638
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,465
Whatever, back freckles.

639
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,339
Oh, yeah, back freckles.
She's making up shit now.

640
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,976
I'm gonna get some water.

641
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,843
That feature interview
worked better than I thought.

642
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,209
I just got off the phone with ESPN2.

643
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,181
They want to televise
the football game.

644
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:06,879
Guards, cons, Paul Crewe,
it's compelling stuff.

645
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,218
Lots of human interest.

646
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,189
Don't do that in here.

647
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,795
Television.

648
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,095
Dandridge, do you think
that might help my visibility

649
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,326
with the registered voters
of this fine state?

650
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,068
Oh, yes.

651
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,485
The freak is back!

652
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,228
Hey, hey. It's me again.

653
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,632
You know, if I take this half down,
we could play together.

654
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,972
I'm just gonna take this half down.

655
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,012
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I got another ball.

656
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:12,518
It's okay.

657
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,556
You wanna serve?

658
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:17,186
I'll serve.

659
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,967
Really good news.
We started a football team.

660
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,804
You like football?

661
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,438
It's kind of like Ping-Pong.

662
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,973
Only the ball's a little bigger
and egg-shaped, like my head.

663
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,178
Just a joke. Stay calm.

664
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,111
Give you a good chance
to throw people on the ground,

665
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:44,617
hurt them like you used to when you
were a kid, 10 feet 6 inches ago.

666
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,982
We'd be playing the guards.

667
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,397
I think Papajohn's their safety.

668
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,583
Turley, nobody gets to me.
We'll play more Ping-Pong later, okay?

669
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,690
Hut!

670
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,321
Effective.

671
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:30,692
- All right.
- He brokeded my nose.

672
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,568
I don't wanna play no more.

673
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,003
Hey, hey, hey. Switowski,
what are you talking about?

674
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,835
This is football. Shit happens.

675
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,706
Paul, he brokeded my nose.

676
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,346
Okay. Stop crying.

677
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,510
All right. We can fix this.
Here we go.

678
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,285
Okay. Good, good.

679
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,078
How's it look?

680
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:56,623
How's it look? It looks... It looks like...
It looks better than before.

681
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,721
- Really?
- Yeah, it's straighter.

682
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,058
More distinguished.
Kind of like a young Michael Jackson.

683
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,462
I love little Michael.

684
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,330
That's great. That's great.

685
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,333
I think he did it on purpose.

686
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,475
No, he didn't.

687
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,169
Okay, maybe he did.

688
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,281
You gotta apologize to him.
Come on, Turley.

689
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,545
Say you're sorry.

690
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,012
Come on. Say it.

691
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:33,194
He said he's sorry.
I got him to say he's sorry.

692
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,989
Yeah, yeah. We're all impressed.

693
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,100
Looking good, gentlemen.
Way to work hard.

694
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,465
Good practice, Paul!
Me and the girls wanna show you

695
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,921
- what we've been practicing.
- Okay, hit me.

696
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,169
- What we've been practicing.
- Okay, hit me.

697
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,539
Come on, let's go. One, two, three.

698
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,647
Give me a...

699
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,148
<i>D, D, give me a I
I, I, give me a C</i>

700
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,341
<i>C, give me a...</i>

701
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,818
All right, all right! I got it.
Just save it for the game.

702
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,888
Don't act like you ain't
want to see more, Brucie!

703
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,253
- Yeah, you wish, pal.
- No, you wish I'd kiss you again,

704
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,396
because your breath
smell like eight cans of shark shit.

705
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,122
I wouldn't touch her
with a 10-foot pole.

706
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,891
- What's he talking about?
- He's a freak.

707
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,814
Run, Forrest, run!

708
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,879
That's how a white man plays guitar.

709
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,487
Captain, he said he had some info.

710
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:43,154
You guys have "Halo 2."
I didn't even think that was out yet.

711
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,664
Focus. Turn the music off!

712
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,030
Yeah, captain.
You know them convicts?

713
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,069
They're starting to get
some serious players.

714
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,402
But their biggest threat?
A running back. Megget.

715
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,010
- He's good?
- He's fast.

716
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,545
He's really, really fast.

717
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,776
I mean, he's so fast,
he makes fast people look not fast.

718
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,351
I got it, he's fast.

719
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,422
Now, why don't you show us your speed
and get your pyro ass out of here.

720
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,125
Yes, sir. Here I go. I'm sorry.

721
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:26,570
Any books
you'd recommend, inmate?

722
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,379
No, sir.

723
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,106
Not much of a reader.

724
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:37,681
Oh, come on, now, maggot.
I've seen you in here reading before.

725
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:40,152
You requested this detail.
Isn't that right?

726
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:47,125
No. It's the quiet time I like, sir.

727
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,362
Maybe you'd like to read this.

728
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,696
What the hell kind of bullshit
book is that?

729
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,236
It's historical. Sir.

730
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,000
Now, why would he want to read
a book about a four-eyed nigger?

731
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:07,649
Does the N word
offend you, nigger?

732
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,047
No, sir.

733
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,229
Sorry about that.

734
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:22,460
You mind fetching
these books for me, boy?

735
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,802
No, sir.

736
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,904
Just pick them up.
Put them on the table.

737
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,736
There you go.

738
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,248
You forgot one.

739
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:49,625
Bet you'd like to hit us, huh?

740
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:53,053
Hit you, sir? No.

741
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,294
Y'all my friends.

742
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,529
Pick these up.

743
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:25,821
Go!

744
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,459
Hit me! I'm open! I'm open!

745
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,403
Come on! We got one week
before we play that game.

746
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,004
We can't complete a pass yet.

747
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,665
- Megget can't run the ball every play.
- I know, coach.

748
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,246
What the hell is he smiling at?

749
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,858
This better be on the up and up.

750
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,023
I guarantee it.

751
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:04,932
Let's do this shit.

752
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,693
There goes the neighborhood.

753
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,371
Now I'll never get to play.

754
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,564
Did you see that? Did you see that?
The Deac is here!

755
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:44,900
Nice.

756
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,934
Okay, we seal off here, seal off here.

757
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,611
- Cheeseburger.
- Yeah.

758
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,473
You're just gonna chip this guy...

759
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,165
That stings.

760
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:12,130
It's nothing a Quarter Pounder
can't fix.

761
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:15,964
With cheese on it?

762
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,697
Hut!

763
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:44,629
Man, that boy would catch a cold
in the desert. Here you go.

764
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,429
- Everything's looking up.
- Yeah.

765
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:49,935
Still got one more
pain in the ass to deal with.

766
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:02,344
All right, what do you say?
How about a little best ball?

767
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,612
No, I hate that bullshit.
Everyone play their own damn ball.

768
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:07,653
Holy shit, is that Paul Crewe?

769
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:11,589
How do you like that, boys?
The MVP coming to kiss my ass.

770
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,556
So, what's on your mind, Paul?

771
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,493
Got a problem with inmate Unger.

772
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,627
- Is he on your little squad?
- I believe he's on your little squad.

773
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:24,169
Mr. Crewe, would you mind
if we had a picture? Please?

774
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,305
That's up to the warden.

775
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,309
- Damn it. All right.
- Rewound it. Did everything.

776
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,947
- The flash is ready.
- You don't need a flash. It's daylight.

777
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,310
Oh, my bad.
I just want a good picture.

778
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:38,150
You know, I think you had sex
with my wife before I married her.

779
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:40,917
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, hell, no.

780
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:44,321
If she's hot enough to have
a one-nighter with a pro football player,

781
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,325
I must be doing all right.

782
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,330
Okay, here we go.

783
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,227
- Sergeant Engleheart?
- Yes, warden.

784
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,265
Would you step out
of the picture, please?

785
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:54,996
Yes, sir.

786
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,009
- His wife has got the hottest ass.
- Great.

787
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,507
Just cut to the chase, shall we?

788
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:04,875
You don't actually think you have
a chance of winning, now, do you?

789
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:06,742
We're gonna get
our asses handed to us.

790
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:11,353
I know it. You know it.
I just don't want my players to know it.

791
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,022
Your players?

792
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,352
Just when I thought
I had you all figured out.

793
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,552
- What does that mean?
- In the time you've been here,

794
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,856
you haven't made or received
one telephone call.

795
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,533
You haven't opened so much
as a single shred of mail.

796
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,066
What do you give a damn
about those slimeballs?

797
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,363
You never cared about anybody
in your entire life.

798
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,101
Well, maybe I finally found
that sense of family

799
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,709
I been yearning for since I'm a baby.

800
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,003
And gosh almighty,

801
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,874
my new family and I
would sure appreciate it

802
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,515
if you got Unger off the field.
You hear?

803
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,415
Sergeant Engleheart.

804
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,114
Thank you.

805
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,213
Oh, and as for your request...

806
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,760
...you'll have my answer
soon enough.

807
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:06,471
Did it rain last night?

808
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:07,904
Not a drop.

809
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:14,579
Son of a bitch.

810
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,680
All right, boys.

811
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,017
The warden is trying
to break our spirit.

812
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:25,761
He thinks we're gonna
skip practice today,

813
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,590
wait for the field to dry,
make it up tomorrow.

814
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,026
You know what? Who gives a shit?

815
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:33,066
Three days till game time.
We can handle it.

816
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,101
But let me say this:

817
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:39,600
That old man flooding this field
tells me something.

818
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,178
The guy is scared.

819
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,874
Scared of you sick,
degenerate convicts.

820
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,813
And you know what?

821
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,687
He should be.

822
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,957
Because I got news for you guys.

823
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,552
We're gonna win this thing.

824
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,619
Did he say "win"?

825
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:02,131
What's it gonna be, boys?

826
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,563
Do we go back to our cells,
call it a day?

827
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:11,839
Or do we get ourselves ready
for the greatest ass-kicking fiesta

828
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,169
in the history of football?

829
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,808
I'll leave it up to you guys.

830
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,233
Hey. You're part
of the goddamn team.

831
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:43,065
Get your point-shaving ass in there.

832
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:44,969
You got it.

833
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,248
I guess that asshole Hazen
wants to play dirty.

834
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:37,392
- We all convicts, right?
- Right.

835
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,585
Maybe it's time
we started acting like it.

836
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,797
Right here. Right here.

837
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:45,994
Take it, Deac.

838
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,171
Let's see which guards
have some broken bones.

839
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,558
Yeah!

840
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,829
Shoes, nigga!

841
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:03,607
Check this out. These be brass
knuckles. They damn near old as me.

842
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,303
Hut!

843
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,484
That's perfect, Cheeseburger!
Never been better.

844
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,353
Good ball. Good ball.

845
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,666
Okay.

846
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,302
- Who we gonna crush?
- The guards!

847
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,372
- Who we gonna kill?
- The guards!

848
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,543
- Who we gonna kiss?
- The guards!

849
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:35,711
Gotcha.

850
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:47,379
Lights out!

851
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,822
Good night, ladies.

852
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,761
- Yo, Crewe!
- Yes, Mr. Caretaker.

853
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:02,301
Check your toilet. There should be
a little surprise in there for you.

854
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,368
You took a shit in my toilet?

855
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:07,236
No, that's the surprise
I left in Brucie's toilet.

856
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,741
- You got something else.
- All right.

857
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,138
Well, would you look at this.

858
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:16,216
A bottle of Ketel One
and two glasses?

859
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:17,852
Now, what would I need two for?

860
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,022
Just shut up
and pour me a drink, bitch.

861
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:24,716
- Man, who taught you to be so cool?
- My mama.

862
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:29,291
Now, when I get out of here, I don't
want you to get all Hollywood on us.

863
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,864
I want you to meet her.

864
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:34,161
Here, look at my girl.
She's your biggest fan.

865
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,799
Your mom's beautiful.

866
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,968
And you, you are ugly.

867
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,304
Thank you. Got it.

868
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,180
Here's to...

869
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:50,117
...the first friend I've had
in I don't know how long.

870
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,413
Hey, I thought
I was your friend, Paul.

871
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:56,718
You are, Switowski. Just finish your
coloring book and go back to sleep.

872
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:57,893
Okay.

873
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,922
And here's to having one of these
with you on the outside,

874
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,462
sometime in the next
three to five years.

875
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,297
- Yo, Crewe.
- Yes, sir.

876
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,937
You being a ex-football player
and all,

877
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:12,164
I'm sure you got a lot
of hot ass on the outside.

878
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,503
Well, let's not forget I wasn't
the most popular guy out there.

879
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:16,679
Don't give me that shit.

880
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,938
O.J. Chopped his wife's head off
and still got some ass.

881
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,144
Yeah.

882
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,420
My mama taught me not to kiss
and tell. Now, go to sleep.

883
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,646
All right. I got one more question
to ask you.

884
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,887
Okay. What is it?

885
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,222
Why'd you shave those points?

886
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:39,260
Didn't you read the papers?
I'm innocent.

887
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,733
Yeah. Ain't we all?

888
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,830
Yo, Crewe, what would you say

889
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:49,136
if I could get you film
from the guards' games last year?

890
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,643
I would say that's incredible,
but how?

891
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,881
Thanks, gentlemen.

892
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,678
The warden will be done with him
in 15 minutes.

893
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:01,489
- We can handle him.
- Yes, ma'am.

894
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,488
Then you're gonna, ma'am.

895
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,362
Nice job.

896
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:15,697
I can't tell you how much this means
to me. Thank you, Lynette.

897
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,271
Now Nate can study
all the guards' formations.

898
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:21,272
Not so fast, sugar bear.

899
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:23,502
You gotta earn them.

900
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,081
We only got 15 minutes,

901
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:39,193
but, sunshine, we're gonna
make them all count.

902
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,804
One more, please?

903
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:03,680
Let's go.

904
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,353
- Quiet down. Guys.
- Let's go.

905
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,396
Before we watch the guards'
game film from last season,

906
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:21,059
we have a special presentation
from our very own Mr. Paul Crewe.

907
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,702
What are you talking about?

908
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,599
What's going on?

909
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,214
Now I gotta relive this shit?

910
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,994
Yeah!

911
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:57,965
You can say this,
my man's a team player!

912
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:03,939
You know what they say. Once
you go gray, there ain't no other way!

913
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:07,248
Hey, hey, hey. Brucie! Brucie!
I'm glad you think that's funny,

914
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,509
because I got something pretty funny
to show you guys.

915
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,085
Tony, hit it. You're gonna like this.

916
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:23,020
- What the hell is this?
- What? It's good. It keeps going.

917
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:25,359
<i>- Hi.
- Here I am.</i>

918
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,263
Turn this shit off. Turn it off.

919
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,234
No!

920
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,279
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very funny.
Trick photography.

921
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,120
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

922
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,189
I was showing a little wrestling move.
That's all.

923
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,993
Knock it off!

924
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,594
Knock it off!

925
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,360
It's time we took a look
at what we came here to see

926
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,500
before the guards come back.

927
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:03,337
The first film is the guards' offense
against Texas Southern.

928
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:06,770
Now, as you can see,
they're running a standard wishbone.

929
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,479
So you're telling me that these animals
are watching our game films.

930
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,517
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir, boss.

931
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,188
They got all last season.

932
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,648
Seems to me that we ought to
do something about this.

933
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,521
What do you want me to do?

934
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,889
You're the criminal. Be creative.

935
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:31,323
But on game day, if I so much as...

936
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,237
What are you doing?

937
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:40,171
I don't know.
I've had hot flashes all shift,

938
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,674
and now my nipples are killing me.

939
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,506
Why are we talking about
your nipples?

940
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,472
We're not. Just go do
what you're doing there.

941
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:49,048
Guys.

942
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,254
I want Crewe finished.

943
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:57,586
Yes, sir. You give me the inspiration,
sir. I got something for him.

944
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,022
Hut!

945
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,401
Everybody!

946
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,233
Huddle up!

947
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:18,909
Every day we've been taking shit,
for a long time.

948
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:24,349
Tomorrow, payback.
Now, think about that for a second.

949
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,459
- What time is it?
- Game time!

950
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,294
- What time is it?
- Game time!

951
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:16,960
- What time is it?
- Game time!

952
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:24,406
Tomorrow, 12:00, the bus leaves.
Don't be late!

953
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:27,607
Where the hell is Caretaker?

954
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,546
I don't know.

955
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,207
A gift for you, Mr. Crewe.

956
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,744
How does he listen
to that cracker shit?

957
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:36,628
<i>We're here deep in the heart
of toothless country,</i>

958
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:39,430
<i>coming to you from a simple
Texas high school stadium</i>

959
01:09:39,639 --> 01:09:41,869
<i>that's been retrofitted
for the big event.</i>

960
01:09:42,075 --> 01:09:44,441
Now, when my man Travis
tried to drag me out here, I said,

961
01:09:44,644 --> 01:09:46,976
"What are you, brain-dead from
talking to too many Raider fans?

962
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:48,204
It's not going to work."

963
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,441
But the fact of the matter is,
this could shape up as an epic day.

964
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:54,848
<i>Hot-dog vendors, high-powered rifles,
I love the combination.</i>
