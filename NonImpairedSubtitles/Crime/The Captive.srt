1
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:57,772
And all I have to do today

2
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:08,115
ls get past remembering...

3
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,962
Maybe.

4
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,768
Just this once.

5
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,233
Let me think about it a little bit.
Okay?

6
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,073
Hi, Tina.

7
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,510
Something happened?

8
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,376
No. I just didn't want
to come this year.

9
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,881
'Cause it's her thirteenth birthday.

10
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,857
I guess.

11
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:18,923
I understand.

12
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,102
I hate living in that house alone.

13
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,046
I miss Matthew.

14
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,686
I miss Cassandra.

15
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,689
I miss living.

16
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,127
Going into town?

17
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,021
Yeah.

18
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,024
All right.

19
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,324
- It's cold out there, huh?
- Sure is.

20
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,400
I'm Matt.

21
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,537
- Page.
- What's your name?

22
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,108
- Page.
- Page.

23
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,146
Nice to meet you, Page.

24
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,214
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,097
Hi.

26
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,036
Hey. What's up?

27
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,045
Not much.

28
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,141
Planning on going?

29
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,079
Well, aren't you?

30
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,743
She said she wanted to meet
with both of us.

31
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,383
Well, it is... it's dumping up here.
How is it down there?

32
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,258
No, it's fine. It's clear.

33
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,722
There's no way
that I'm going to get down there.

34
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,994
It's okay.
You always have excuses, Matthew.

35
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,096
Yeah.

36
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,134
Do you remember that brush
that she used to love?

37
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,538
- The one that my mum gave her?
- Yeah.

38
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,779
Well, I just found one.

39
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,141
It... it's almost the same.

40
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,413
Where?

41
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,017
One of the rooms.

42
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,044
Someone must have left it.

43
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,815
That's weird.

44
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,222
Yeah, it's weird.

45
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,419
I should get back to work.

46
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,259
Okay. I love you.

47
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,226
Love you.

48
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,088
I really feel like...

49
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,959
...I have been cracking the whip here
on them, okay.

50
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,099
But if there is any chance of us
finishing this on time, I...

51
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,567
You will. Which you will 'cause it's your
job to make sure we finish on time.

52
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,037
I mean,

53
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,768
how old were you when you first started
working for me as a welder,

54
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,140
how old were you?

55
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,642
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

56
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:41,052
And in all those years did
I ever treat you like a friend?

57
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,613
Never!

58
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,648
Now I might have treated you like a son,
but I never treated you like a friend.

59
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,417
That's the problem here, Mika.
You're treating all these guys

60
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:54,062
like they're your buddies
and they're not.

61
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,869
They're tradesmen.

62
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,933
They're working for you.
They're not your friend.

63
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,437
Hey there.

64
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,041
This is a...
this is a beautiful development.

65
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,109
We... we sold out the first phase
in a couple of days.

66
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,647
And you jump in now
you can have your place on the ninth hole.

67
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:20,615
Vince Grey.

68
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,856
Detective

69
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,252
Cornwall. Hi. I'd like to...

70
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,663
I'd like to ask you some questions
about your charity ball.

71
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,231
Still no word?

72
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:38,131
Well, I... I gave a statement to one
of your colleagues and...

73
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,371
Listen, we can do this here
or we can go down to the station.

74
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,974
Wherever you want.

75
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,039
Hey, okay. Sure. Sit down.

76
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,051
The woman that offered
Detective Dunlop a ride,

77
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,451
had you seen her before?

78
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,213
- No.
- You'd never seen her?

79
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,424
No.

80
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,290
I had not.
How do you know that...

81
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,866
Detective Dunlop's disappearance
is connected to this woman?

82
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,732
Did... did I say it was?

83
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,099
Look, I've... I've already
made a statement.

84
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,777
- I've already talked to a detective.
- Right.

85
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,072
I mean, I... I really, I don't know
how I can help you more than that.

86
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,485
Your wife is on the board
of this charity, correct?

87
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,388
- Yeah.
- Well, I'd like to speak to her, if I can.

88
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,285
Well, be my guest.

89
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,325
Well, she won't return any of
my phone calls. I've tried many times.

90
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,565
- I'll make sure that she does.
- Good. Thank you.

91
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,160
One more thing.

92
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,063
A guest reported seeing the two
of you having a conversation.

93
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,774
- What was that about?
- I made a comment

94
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,135
to her about how different
she looked...

95
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,974
that night from
how she appears in this picture.

96
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,010
Is that why you kept it?

97
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,590
You were seen having
a conversation in front of it.

98
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,118
Before she went missing.

99
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:02,852
Why don't you take it?

100
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,224
Take 'em both.

101
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,277
Is there any hope of the two
of you getting back together?

102
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:28,650
We talk. He calls, you know,
all the time.

103
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,653
It's like one big talk.

104
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,123
Talks me to sleep sometimes.

105
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,101
But he's scared to show his face.

106
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,200
Why?

107
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,266
'Cause he's guilty.

108
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,003
Because it's his fault.

109
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,437
This whole thing is his fault.

110
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,483
You know,
I want him to feel guilty.

111
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,888
It makes sense.

112
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,327
Nothing else does.

113
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,373
That cowboy?

114
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,242
Yeah.

115
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,374
Come on in.

116
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,085
Thank you.

117
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,490
- Detective Jeffrey Cornwall.
- Hi. Uh,

118
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,216
Yeah, Jeff.

119
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,233
You have an impressive
clearance rate, Detective Cornwall.

120
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,598
Thank you.

121
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,533
Why would you walk away from a great
career in homicide to join my unit?

122
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,136
Well, I figure it's pretty much
the same skill set.

123
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,103
Except here I get to deal
with living victims,

124
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,740
- for a change.
- What is your history with children?

125
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,948
Well, I was one, once.

126
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,315
Have you ever felt attracted to them?

127
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,682
No.

128
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,121
Do you have a fantasy life?

129
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,726
Um...

130
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,866
What does your fantasy life involve?

131
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,197
Adult females.

132
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,002
Brown hair, blue eyes.

133
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,634
Single?

134
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,509
Uh huh. Yes.

135
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,112
Dating?

136
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,015
No, I haven't been
in a relationship in a while.

137
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,279
Why is that?

138
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,580
It's less complicated.

139
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,062
Take a seat.

140
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,894
So here's what we are dealing with.

141
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,106
Ready?

142
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,438
Yeah.

143
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,263
Jesus Christ!

144
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,733
We look at images and videos
like that every day.

145
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,306
Kids being abused...

146
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,973
and tortured online
while others watch.

147
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,880
Our job is to not look away.

148
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,289
The people who do that to kids...

149
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,420
- Pedophiles.
- I want to stop them.

150
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,253
You want to shoot them?
Beat them up? Put them in the ground?

151
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,329
I want to stop 'em.

152
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,005
Internet technology
keeps leaping ahead.

153
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,240
We're always playing catch-up.

154
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,641
Sometimes the only way

155
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,550
to find a needle in the haystack
is one straw at a time.

156
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,491
Sam, our computer geek.
Mike, from Drugs.

157
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,085
Everyone,
this is Detective Jeffrey Cornwall.

158
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,658
You've already met Frank.
He is old school.

159
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,164
- Young at head.
- Yeah but, old everywhere else.

160
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,736
And that's Teddy.
He has a very particular skill:

161
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,801
visual pattern recognition.

162
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,739
Teddy has an eye for detail.

163
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,012
- Wanna show him, Teddy?
- No, I don't, Sam.

164
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,241
I wish you would stop doing
this every time

165
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,579
- someone new comes in the office.
- Come on.

166
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,743
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.

167
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,351
- All right.
- All right.

168
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:05,861
Okay, it's like an old stone building.
It's a church or a castle or something.

169
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,261
With a bridge going over a river.

170
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,693
There's a woman standing
on the bridge in a beige coat,

171
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,763
holding a red umbrella.

172
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:20,771
That's impressive.

173
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,941
Not really.
Practice and guess work.

174
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,578
Could have been a red kite.

175
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,980
- So what's your deal, Jeff?
- Me?

176
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,014
I arrest people.

177
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,018
All right. Sounds good.

178
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,883
- Promise.
- I promise.

179
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,289
Pinkie promise.

180
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,661
Okay. Pinkie promise.

181
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,869
Cass, say bye to Albert, honey.
We gotta go.

182
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,662
- Bye.
- Bye, Albert!

183
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,167
- Bye!
- Bye, buddy.

184
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,542
What were you guys talking about?

185
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,940
I made him promise, he'll never
skate with anyone else.

186
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,879
- Nobody else, ever as long as he lives?
- Nobody else.

187
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,142
- Wow, that's a...
- That's a big promise.

188
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:36,387
- For your whole life?
- Yeah. We're a team.

189
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,053
- There's my girl. But we gotta go.
- Yeah. Bye.

190
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,783
Come here.

191
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,760
Okay, I'll see you at home.
Love you!

192
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:45,960
Bye !

193
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,131
- Bye!
- Bye! I Bye!

194
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,773
But the fact that you guys
made that promise

195
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,210
to each other,
promise to always be a team,

196
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,212
it means you have to start thinking
about how you present yourselves, okay?

197
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,088
It's... it's... I'm just saying
that it's not necessary.

198
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,086
You guys are so good
it's actually distracting.

199
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,690
Albert thinks it makes us stand out.

200
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,553
I don't think so. I think what makes
you stand out is your talent.

201
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,866
Whether you got a white skate
on one foot and a black on the other it's...

202
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,402
What's the...
what's the word I'm thinking of?

203
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,263
- Irrelevant?
- Irrelevant. Right.

204
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,672
Irrelevant.

205
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,733
It's like a trick you don't need.

206
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,209
- A trick?
- Yeah, exactly.

207
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,278
- What's so funny?
- No, it's not a trick, it's a gimmick.

208
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,015
- A gimmick we don't need.
- It's a gimmick you don't need.

209
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:42,984
- A gimmick.
- Well, there you go.

210
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,210
- It's the proper word.
- Oh, that's the proper word?

211
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,786
- Yeah. Gimmick is the proper word.
- Thank you.

212
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,495
Hello.

213
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,132
Hi. Sarah called in sick.
I might be really late.

214
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,067
Ouch.

215
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,935
I don't know
what you're gonna do about dinner.

216
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,739
Well, we'll be fine. We've actually
just pulled up to the pie shop.

217
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,777
You gonna have pie for dinner?

218
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,980
No. We're not gonna have pie for dinner.
We're gonna have macaroni for dinner.

219
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,985
We have leftover macaroni.
We'll put that on top of the pie.

220
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,444
All right.

221
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,385
Will you get me the cherry-rhubarb?

222
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,892
Cherry-rhubarb, got it.
No problem. Done. Love you. Bye.

223
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,656
And ice cream.

224
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,123
- What kind of ice cream?
- Chocolate.

225
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,097
- On your macaroni?
- Ew! Not macaroni!

226
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,667
It may be the grossest thing
I've ever heard.

227
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,572
It's going to be an awesome dinner.

228
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,252
Hey, Linda, you know what? You're lucky
that a 9-year-old makes the menu

229
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,116
because that one in there
wants a macaroni pie.

230
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:27,454
They didn't have chocolate ice cream.
So...

231
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,285
Cass?

232
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,328
Cass!

233
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,130
Cass!

234
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,809
Cass!

235
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,089
Cass!

236
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,140
- Hey, Linda, did Cass back here?
- No?

237
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,836
Is she... is she in the back?
Can you take a look for me, please, thank you?

238
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,408
- Nothing?
- No.

239
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,043
Cass!

240
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,522
Cassandra!

241
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,524
Cass!

242
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:40,962
Cass!

243
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:49,598
Cass!

244
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,047
I have a plan.

245
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,123
A few minutes.

246
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,860
That's all you'll have together.

247
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,991
Do I get to talk to him?

248
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:20,927
Yes.

249
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,638
Does my Dad get to talk to me?

250
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,306
Yes, Cass he does.

251
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,947
And we'll be listening.

252
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,341
Of course,
I was thinking some kind of mic...

253
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,654
hidden microphone.

254
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,185
What are you so worried about?

255
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,759
I have no idea where I am.

256
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,860
How would he ever find me?
I don't even know your name.

257
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,768
Not a word...

258
00:24:58,764 --> 00:24:59,742
or else...

259
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,608
You'll kill him.

260
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:13,022
Wouldn't it just be easier
to kill me...

261
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,893
now that I'm all grown up?

262
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,798
Now that you've lost interest.

263
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,601
I can't be that valuable doing
what I'm doing.

264
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,580
Oh, you are so valuable, Cassandra.

265
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,117
Doing exactly what you're doing.

266
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,688
- So it was the patrolman that flagged him?
- Yeah. Kicked down to us.

267
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:57,356
<i>- Okay
- Ready';?</i>

268
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:58,696
Yeah.

269
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,803
- Okay?
- It's strange they'd send him here.

270
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,006
Well, there weren't any detectives
at the main station.

271
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,544
My buddy must have known
that I could do it.

272
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,472
I'm not used to interviewing adults.

273
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:13,875
You'll be fine.

274
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,248
Mr. Lane.

275
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:21,056
Hi. I'm Detective Dunlop
and this is Detective Cornwall.

276
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:24,318
We have read through your statement
that you gave to the patrolman an hour ago.

277
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,958
We'd just like to go over
a few details with you.

278
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,093
Yeah. Good.

279
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:31,763
Uh, is it okay if we record this?

280
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,163
Yeah. Did you see my wife?
Did someone give her a ride down?

281
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,301
I don't know anything
about your wife, Mr. Lane.

282
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,773
I... I called her three hours ago.
It shouldn't take her this long to get here.

283
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,309
I'm worried that she went
to the main police station, not this one.

284
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,043
I told her to take a cab.

285
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,442
Okay. Um, let's just get
through these questions first

286
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,218
and then we'll look
into the whereabouts of your wife.

287
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:51,944
- All right?
- Yeah.

288
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,583
Just to be clear, this conversation
is completely voluntary.

289
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,925
And you are not being
forced to tell us anything.

290
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,128
Do you understand this?

291
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,732
- “Yes?
- Yes.

292
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:08,903
Okay. Now, you say
you were in the diner for how long?

293
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,572
Um, a few minutes. Less.

294
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,901
Okay.
Were there any other customers?

295
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,375
- No. I... I didn't see any.
- No customers.

296
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,276
It says here you bought a pie?

297
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:23,148
Yeah, we bought a...
we bought a cherry pie. My...

298
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,044
my daughter...
Yeah, we do it every week after practice.

299
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,055
I gotta get a pie.

300
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,815
And I asked Linda
if they had chocolate ice cream...

301
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:29,991
Sorry, you mean Lesley?

302
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,527
And they... they... No.

303
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,098
Linda. They didn't have any chocolate
ice cream. Can I call my wife now?

304
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,360
It's "Lesley". I'm sorry,
it says Lesley right there.

305
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,004
It says "Linda".
I can see it from here.

306
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,266
And my nine-year-old daughter's
another mile away.

307
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,767
You have very good eyesight,
Mr. Lane.

308
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,135
But you claim
you didn't see anything

309
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,611
suspicious when you looked back
to the truck?

310
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,676
It's been three hours since...

311
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,179
someone driving,
even if he's going the speed limit,

312
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,820
which he's not
because he's a fucking kidnapper,

313
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,116
they're hundreds of miles away.
Okay?

314
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,254
They... they've taken my daughter.

315
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,654
I need to know right now,
what are you doing to help?

316
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:08,027
Have you got a helicopter up there?
Are you setting up a roadblock?

317
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,497
What are you doing?
She's a ten-year-old girl.

318
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:10,961
You said she was nine.

319
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,264
What?

320
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,899
You said she was nine.
Is she nine? Is she ten?

321
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,368
What... what is she?

322
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,174
She's almost ten.
Christ, what difference does it make?

323
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,774
What difference does it...?

324
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,016
- What's going on here?
- Linda told the police

325
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,685
that she never saw your daughter.

326
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,415
Okay, so, what does that mean?

327
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:37,127
When you pulled into the diner,
you were alone.

328
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,656
Bullshit. I wasn't alone.

329
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:44,025
She was resting in the back.
That's why she didn't see her.

330
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,997
Okay. Why would she be resting
in the middle of the afternoon?

331
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,363
Why wouldn't she be resting
in the middle of the fucking afternoon?

332
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:53,804
She's a kid! A little girl, okay?
We just finished ice skating practice.

333
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,702
- She was exhausted.
- Did you make any stops

334
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,981
- between the rink and the diner?
- Uh, okay.

335
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,383
I'm gonna stop you right there.

336
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,987
I was the last person
to see my daughter at the diner.

337
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,785
That was me. Okay?

338
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,955
Now, I would... I would like to speak
to somebody in charge.

339
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,031
I'd like to speak to... to real police.

340
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,663
I don't even... This looks like a fucking
kindergarten in here, okay.

341
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,665
I need you to find my daughter, now!

342
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,968
Mr. Lane, I'll ask again.

343
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,941
Did you make any stops

344
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,177
before you arrived at the diner?

345
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,805
I remember the day

346
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,103
we won the trophy.

347
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,815
The look on my mother's face
as I skated over and handed it to her.

348
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,818
And it must be such an amazing
feeling for a parent,

349
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,852
seeing their child realize a dream.

350
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,462
That must be the hardest pan
for Mum now,

351
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,937
not knowing

352
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,008
what I'm dreaming about.

353
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:16,076
Or that I'm even alive
to be dreaming.

354
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,652
That's great, Cassandra.

355
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:27,052
This time, do it again,
but a little less self-pity.

356
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,623
Okay, do it, just one more time
and a little louder.

357
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,130
Less self-pity. Got it?

358
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,011
Tina...

359
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,014
Tina.

360
00:31:54,713 --> 00:31:56,420
Tina, we stopped to get a pie.

361
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,324
We stopped at the diner. You remember,
we spoke on the phone, remember?

362
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,090
You remember, we stopped.
I got out of my truck.

363
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,730
Right after we hung up I got out
of my truck and I went inside and I...

364
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,262
I could see it. I could see it right through
the window. It was right there.

365
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,401
The truck was right there and...
and...

366
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,807
And I went to the bathroom
for like two seconds

367
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,234
and I came back out
and she was gone and she...

368
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,037
What did you do?
You lost our girl!

369
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,847
You lost our girl!

370
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,151
Don't.

371
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:26,083
- No ...No.
- She's gone...

372
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,864
Mrs. Lane.

373
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:46,299
Mr. Lane, I'm sorry,

374
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,775
- we need to speak to your wife now.
- It's gonna be okay.

375
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,107
It's gonna be okay.

376
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,176
Mrs. Lane.

377
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,113
My name is Detective Dunlop.
I've been assigned to your case.

378
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,224
- I just need to ask you a few questions.
- How long do you need to speak to her for?

379
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,287
- A few minutes. Okay.
- Okay.

380
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,623
Right here.

381
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,876
I can't imagine what's going through
your wife's head right now.

382
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,989
It's gotta be tough on you.
It's gotta be.

383
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:39,956
Hey, listen, things get crazy sometimes,
you know?

384
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,528
There seems to be some inconsistencies
about what your husband told us.

385
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:50,395
Listen, I'm just... I'm going through
the files there, and I see... it's my job,

386
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:54,034
I see you got an assault charge?

387
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,203
Is that right?

388
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,947
Teenage daddies with baby girls
shouldn't get into barroom brawls.

389
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,052
Especially if they're
not old enough to drink.

390
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,112
My wife knows about that.

391
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,119
I was eighteen years old.
The fight was over her.

392
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:13,057
So what, you quit school, you got a job
and now nine years later, you're broke.

393
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,265
Yeah, money's tight. I get it.

394
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,732
I heard you say
something to your wife about a...

395
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,401
about a phone call.

396
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,032
She called you, right?

397
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,904
You didn't tell us about that.

398
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,009
My partner's asking her
about that right now.

399
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:32,211
Wondering if she spoke
to your daughter at that time.

400
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:33,780
I guess if she didn't...

401
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,410
if she didn't, then where is she?

402
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,986
She's laying down in the back of the cab.
That's what she does. It's her little space.

403
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,092
But don't kids stop taking afternoon naps
when they're like three or four years old?

404
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,155
I mean, if my dad's buying my favourite
pie, I'm with him. I'm excited.

405
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:48,722
Or I'm watching
from the car window, at least.

406
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,065
Your business failed, right?

407
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,769
Was it TM Landscaping?

408
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:55,938
You got bills piling up.
You're about to go into bankruptcy.

409
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,506
Like I said before, I get it.

410
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:58,964
I do, I get it.

411
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,505
What the fuck
are you talking about?

412
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,508
Big money for lending your daughter
to some demented pal for a few days.

413
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:04,238
Then she's gonna show up,

414
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,605
- damaged, but otherwise...
- You sick fucker!

415
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,451
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

416
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,965
This is what I do, okay?
I give a little shake, I see what falls out.

417
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,797
As well, as give the judge every
reason to dismiss this case.

418
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,771
He's not as innocent as he seems.

419
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,135
- Maybe he is.
- He's got a criminal record.

420
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,973
Assault. As well as a motive.
He owes money through his ears.

421
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,950
So he creates an opportunity,
driving alone on a deserted highway.

422
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,074
Give me a break.

423
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:44,585
Hey!

424
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,325
He reminds me of someone.

425
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,957
Somebody from your past.

426
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,729
Yeah, from my past.

427
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,362
This is the present.

428
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,501
Do you actually believe any of the things
he said to Matt the night we came in?

429
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,280
I'm not going to excuse the way
that he behaved with Matthew.

430
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:18,278
He's dealt with a lot of cases
where someone from the family,

431
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,987
even a parent, is involved.

432
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,089
Matthew reminded him of someone.

433
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,460
- Someone personal.
- That's just bullshit.

434
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,728
Matthew loved Cassandra
more than anything in this world.

435
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:36,737
He still loves her.

436
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,565
Of course.

437
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,572
I don't know if I want to do
this anymore.

438
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,173
I understand. It's up to you.

439
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,340
Happy to meet you
when you need.

440
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,736
On this pillow you will find...

441
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:22,478
a teeny-tiny tooth of mine.

442
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,985
So while I sleep,

443
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,826
where dreams are made

444
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,328
let's see if we can make this trade.

445
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,367
Money for teeth.

446
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,174
It just seems strange
to exchange them for money.

447
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,285
But it's something we all do.

448
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,049
Or did.

449
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:13,132
And if there ever was a Tooth Fairy
that visited me here,

450
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:20,003
I'm sure there's something more useful
she could do than leaving me a dollar.

451
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,106
Or maybe it's just a trick.

452
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:37,018
A trick or a gimmick.

453
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:41,694
A gimmick you don't really need.

454
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,666
Yes, that's the proper word.

455
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,133
Tina...

456
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:37,483
How are you?

457
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,917
I'm fine, I guess.

458
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,956
Hard to believe I've been coming
to see you for six years.

459
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:51,495
You look really good.
Better than last time.

460
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,697
Yeah, I was a mess last time.

461
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,302
How's Matthew?

462
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,538
He's fine.

463
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,241
Can I ask what's happening?

464
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,079
I still can't look at him.

465
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:11,952
I see Cass.

466
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,318
I get mad. I say awful things.

467
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:17,786
Is he completely out of the picture?

468
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,356
- Last time...
- No.

469
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,429
I was just speaking to him, actually.
He said that...

470
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,865
that he wanted to come here.

471
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,130
So why didn't he?

472
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,168
I called him and left him a message.

473
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,237
He thought I'd end up
screaming at him.

474
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,503
Would you?

475
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,569
Probably.

476
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,016
He still thinks he's gonna find her
on his own.

477
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,154
Does he tell you how?

478
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,115
You mean does he have a plan?

479
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,519
Matthew?

480
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,325
Oh yeah. His plan is that
he's on the road a lot.

481
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,152
He keeps his eyes open.
Idiot.

482
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,566
I don't sound very nice, do I?

483
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,565
I've heard a lot worse.

484
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,130
Yeah, I bet.

485
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,100
I couldn't do what you do.

486
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,879
You have a daughter?

487
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:17,984
No.

488
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,761
That's Jeffrey's niece, Jennifer.

489
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,530
- They're really close.
- That's nice.

490
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,264
So should we start?

491
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,009
When you think of Cass,

492
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,148
what do you see?

493
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,246
What do I see?

494
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,890
Mostly I think about her skating.
She loved it so much.

495
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,029
She and Albert,
that was her partner, they...

496
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,228
they talked about going
to the Olympics.

497
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,760
And Matt still goes to the rink
sometimes just to watch Albert practice.

498
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,765
It's like they're both just waiting
for Cass to come back.

499
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,973
And Albert's really strong.

500
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,978
So if Cass stays small like me...

501
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,877
They could carry on
where they left off.

502
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,025
We're here.

503
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:37,966
Mrs. Lane.

504
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,130
Hi.

505
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,064
Hello.

506
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,470
Come in.

507
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,111
Please.

508
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,845
<i>Okay. -</i>

509
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,250
Mrs. Lane, do you know
a lot of illegal images of kids

510
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,121
are circulated on the Internet?

511
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,687
And any picture like that is actual
evidence of where a crime has taken place.

512
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:10,694
Do you understand that?

513
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,092
We study these crime scene images.

514
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,532
We use whatever information
we get out of them to track

515
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,866
down the people
who trade in these illegal pictures.

516
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:21,804
To find the children.
To rescue them.

517
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,113
Sometimes to gain
access to certain rooms,

518
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,645
I play a role.

519
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,251
I try and fit in with the other men
who are...

520
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:40,257
who are watching the abuse
that's taking place in a room.

521
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:44,232
The men are all connected
to a camera.

522
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:49,966
They might give directions
or participate.

523
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:56,038
- A live camera that's in a room.
- Doing what?

524
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,048
Watching a child.

525
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:08,256
Jeffrey believes that he may

526
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,088
have found some images of Cass.

527
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,358
- You found her?
- No. No, no, no. Just a...

528
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,260
...a few screen grabs. Pictures.
That's it.

529
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,331
They were recent.

530
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:24,136
So the good...

531
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:27,642
- the really good news...
- She's alive.

532
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:27,192
Mrs. Lane?

533
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,610
Tina?

534
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,075
Do you think this could be Cass?

535
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,218
I think so.

536
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,276
Hey... How'd it go?

537
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,149
Matthew, listen to me.
They showed me a picture of her.

538
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,818
They found a picture of her.

539
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,125
What do you mean,
a picture of Cass?

540
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:25,691
From where?

541
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,155
They don't know.
They found it on a computer.

542
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,962
Well, when was...
when was the picture from?

543
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,660
They don't know.
It was just her face.

544
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,734
They just showed me a picture of her face.
But it's... it's her, Matthew, it's her.

545
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,967
What's she doing in the photo?

546
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,410
Well...

547
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:45,944
Tina?

548
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,151
Like I said, they... they don't know.
You know, it was just her face. But...

549
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,345
but they said that
she was talking to another girl.

550
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:52,519
Like a younger girl.

551
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,080
Okay, but... okay.
Okay, I got it.

552
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:57,618
But, what... what's she actually
doing in the... in the picture?

553
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,955
Like, I said, they don't know.
Like...

554
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,124
You could have been there and then
you would know all of this already.

555
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:04,522
I said they don't know.

556
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:05,899
<i>Okay'?</i>

557
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,529
But it was her.
It was her face. And they said...

558
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,040
they said that... you know,

559
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:16,743
they're always looking for children
and that Cass is like a...

560
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:19,045
I can't remember exactly
what they said.

561
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:23,343
But they said she's like a...
like a welcoming face on a gateway.

562
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:25,815
Or... or something like that.

563
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:28,115
Gateway?
What do you mean a gateway?

564
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,788
To what?

565
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,502
Tina?

566
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,209
To a ring, they said.

567
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:54,880
Welcoming face to a gateway,
to a ring.

568
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,656
She's helping lure other kids...

569
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,116
Honey...

570
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,121
They've made her like them.

571
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,024
That's what happened
to our daughter, Matthew.

572
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:17,999
She's helping recruit other kids.

573
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,242
That's what happened
when you left her alone.

574
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,476
Those monsters came and took her.

575
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,985
And now she sits
with her smiling face

576
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,218
and talks to other babies.

577
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,453
And then they go and get them.

578
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:45,062
That's what happened to her
when you left her alone.

579
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,748
My fate is grief and lamentation.

580
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:04,343
My daughter's life
has been betrayed.

581
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,413
All joy has turned to desolation.

582
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,683
An evil friend has stolen her away.

583
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,158
Is that how you see yourself...

584
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,968
as an evil friend?

585
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:23,570
Sometimes.

586
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,175
Where is this from?

587
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,510
Mozart It's the...

588
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,981
Queen of the Night's aria
from The Magic Flute.

589
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,878
And how's it going
to help you catch any kids?

590
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:41,649
What do you mean?

591
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:44,655
It doesn't seem like the sort of thing
that would attract them.

592
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,255
It's not.

593
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,001
It's part of story time, Cass.

594
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,206
But it's not my story.

595
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:17,719
The only thing I have to do today

596
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,024
ls to get to the garden

597
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,560
To pick some sage

598
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:31,067
And wrap lavender
with blue string

599
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:37,805
And set the cedar leaves out
for drying

600
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:47,011
Is it spring yet?

601
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:51,585
No.

602
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,661
What's happening with my Dad?

603
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,126
You promised.

604
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,967
Why don't you just...

605
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:11,103
...get back to reading
about your evil friend?

606
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:24,253
I still see her shaking,
her head breaking.

607
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,955
How dreadful her crying,
how hopeless her sighing...

608
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,077
Make her ears stick out.

609
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,683
- Why?
- It's hotter.

610
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:26,117
- Pardon me?
- Well, if you're going to bait the trap...

611
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,983
Use the best bait.

612
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,960
If you're going for hot,
cross your eyes a little.

613
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:35,955
What? It's true. Try it

614
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:38,756
That's weird, man.

615
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,971
- The cross eyes are perfect.
- All right.

616
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,435
We're on.

617
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,202
- Is it Willy?
- Yeah, Willy.

618
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,583
Reel him in, Jeff. Reel him in.

619
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,120
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

620
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,164
Yes! Yes!

621
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,234
Hi.

622
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:55,199
N: Willy.

623
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,375
Sorry. My mistake.

624
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:02,209
You bet it is.

625
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:06,078
Stop! Stop right there!

626
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,015
It's not what you think!
I'm a Good Samaritan.

627
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,652
Well, these arrests are the result
of amazing team work.

628
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:15,825
Incredible cooperation from
a number of different departments.

629
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,828
- Next time you're doing this.
- You look good on camera.

630
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,863
...the public and media.

631
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:25,098
You know,
we all have to be vigilant.

632
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:28,640
You know, there may be young people
who are watching this right now,

633
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,005
some of you might have come
to see me.

634
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,679
And you've trusted me
with your stories

635
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,013
- and I want you to remember...
- I see you do that, you know.

636
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,256
When you're in that room
with those kids, I watch you.

637
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:43,984
The way you get them
to trust you like that.

638
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,089
The way you talk to them.
It's amazing.

639
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,889
Look at me.

640
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,290
No, look at me.
You're amazing.

641
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:54,362
- You're amazing.
- ...we'll show them that we can win.

642
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,335
So, you know,

643
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,163
- Thank you.
- If you're a young person out there

644
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,304
and you think that
an adult around you

645
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,577
is behaving or acting
in an inappropriate way...

646
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,203
I want you to call us.

647
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:06,878
Call the police.
We are here to help.

648
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,074
And... and also, you know, if...

649
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,649
if you are online
and you meet any stranger online,

650
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:16,016
be very careful,
in any chat or in any way,

651
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:18,324
you have to be on guard.

652
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:24,957
I know that it'll... it'll all work out.

653
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,102
What makes you so sure?

654
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:39,778
They have only cracked
the first ring.

655
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:45,052
They'll never get to us.
We are safe.

656
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:48,416
Encrypted beyond the reach of God.

657
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,453
Do not give them the key, Willy.

658
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:56,560
Under no circumstance do you

659
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,097
take any of the bullshit deals
that they offer.

660
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,169
You deny.
Deny, deny, deny, deny, deny.

661
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:08,499
That bitch that set me up,
I want her removed.

662
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,239
- She's a cop, Willy.
- I don't care.

663
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,840
That's what I want.

664
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:18,984
- Willy, just listen to me for a second...
- No.

665
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,018
- No. No!
- That's not...

666
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:25,057
You listen to me, cousin.

667
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,922
I'll keep quiet about our little club

668
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:32,957
as long as she's taught a lesson.

669
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,394
I... I want her buried.

670
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:39,200
Like the others.

671
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,232
Only she stays alive.

672
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,878
She tells me her stories.

673
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,746
All of her stories.

674
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,452
I lost this one yesterday.

675
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,223
You know what the best idea is?

676
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:04,623
Write a note beside your tooth
when you put it under your pillow.

677
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,928
That way the Tooth Fairy will know
what to get you next time.

678
00:57:07,491 --> 00:57:09,368
But letters are for Santa.

679
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,501
Do you still believe in Santa?

680
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,368
Sometimes.

681
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,644
Okay.
Well, I'm not talking about a letter.

682
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,168
Just a note.

683
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:22,282
If you want we can meet
and I can show you how to write one.

684
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:24,848
That way you can get
anything you want.

685
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,887
I thought you
weren't coming 'til later?

686
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:30,514
What's going on?

687
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,928
Look. Look.
Don't let this freak you out, okay?

688
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,457
I talked to my brother.
He knows everything.

689
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,221
He's cool.
He's okay. It's okay.

690
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,926
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey, She's talking to Cass.

691
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:40,524
She's talking to Cass.

692
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,268
Get Jennifer to find out
where she is.

693
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,139
Nicole. Nicole!

694
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,933
- Nicole!
- Hi, Nicole. We're playing a game.

695
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,044
What happened?

696
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,079
I don't know.

697
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,245
Hey, would you mind waiting
in the bedroom for a little bit?

698
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,455
- We were just playing a game.
- No. I know. I understand.

699
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,218
I just need to talk to your uncle
for a little bit, okay?

700
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:12,963
- Did I do something wrong?
- No. No, you did nothing wrong.

701
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:16,158
As a matter of fact, there's a book
back there waiting for you.

702
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,070
The sequel to the one you asked for

703
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:21,839
and I would love for you to get started
on that, tell me what you think.

704
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:39,627
- Are you out of your mind?
- Do you have any idea what you just did?

705
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,657
- Do you have any idea?
- You put Jennifer online.

706
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:42,760
I'm in contact.

707
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:44,723
I've been trying to break in forever!

708
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,990
Okay, I needed to show
I had access to a real girl.

709
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:49,728
- What?
- To get to Cass.

710
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:53,407
That's what she does, okay?
She helps them bring them in.

711
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:55,242
Nothing happened here.

712
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:56,370
- Nothing!
- Nothing?

713
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,143
- Nothing.
- ...except images of Cass.

714
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,440
Images of nothing!

715
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,638
Of her talking in this room.
That's it. That's all.

716
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,680
You don't use children!

717
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,192
- Listen to me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

718
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:14,323
- Don't touch me.
- Listen to me.

719
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,656
- I screwed up, okay? I screwed up.
- You're out of my unit.

720
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,225
I should have done this
a long time ago.

721
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,193
Try to take it easy.
We got tonight, please.

722
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,961
I don't want you there tonight.

723
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,567
- You don't want me there tonight?
- No. I'm going alone.

724
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:26,974
Okay, you're going alone.

725
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:31,173
Jennifer, baby.
I gotta go, I'll call you soon.

726
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,417
Detective Dunlop.

727
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,245
Hi.

728
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:16,787
- Nicole.
- Hi. Diane Grey.

729
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:19,251
I'm so glad you could make it.
You look...

730
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,089
- just fabulous. ...Thank you.
- Thank you. You look beautiful.

731
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:23,523
Are you alone?

732
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,264
I... I thought you were coming
with a guest.

733
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:29,069
He had a work emergency.

734
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,765
Of course. Please come in.

735
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,535
Is there anything you want help
with this evening that I...?

736
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:39,446
- I mean straightforward.
- Yeah, I just... no, no thank you...

737
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:40,811
I feel that I should've...

738
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,950
- I should have wrote something down...
- Hello, gorgeous lady.

739
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,016
- Mika!
- How are you?

740
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,554
- Very well. ...Thank you.
- You look lovely tonight.

741
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,719
Let me introduce you
to Detective Dunlop.

742
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:08,172
Thank you.

743
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,036
Can I talk you into a glass
of champagne?

744
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,771
Oh, no thank you.

745
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:15,673
Detective Dunlop, I'm Vince Grey.

746
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,344
Oh, Diane's Vince.

747
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,115
Yeah. Yeah. This is uh...

748
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:23,889
this is remarkable.

749
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,351
I mean, the difference
really is... that's uh...

750
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,029
Is this the way you dress at work?

751
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,957
No. I do a lot of my work
with children.

752
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,968
- They wouldn't feel comfortable...
- Yeah, with that look of authority.

753
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:38,868
I guess most of them
feel betrayed by that.

754
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,934
- By what?
- By the people they're supposed to trust.

755
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,006
Here you are.

756
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:48,775
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

757
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:50,075
Did I say something to...

758
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:52,014
- You're on.
- Okay.

759
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:52,982
<i>Okay. -</i>

760
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,119
- Excuse me. Nice to meet you too.
- Nice to meet you.

761
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:56,647
Everything okay?

762
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,915
Yeah. Good.

763
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,821
My deepest thank you.

764
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,224
Without your generosity, an evening
like this simply wouldn't happen.

765
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,228
And we wouldn't be able
to celebrate

766
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:08,925
the remarkable woman
I'm about to introduce to you.

767
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:14,202
Why Detective Nicole Dunlop has
become a very public figure recently,

768
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:18,811
most of her time is spent in a room
where she listens to stories.

769
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:25,545
Stories told by the most vulnerable
members of our society, our children.

770
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,654
They come to trust her.
And they feel safe.

771
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:34,093
The difference between
a youth at risk

772
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:38,960
and a young person
with their whole life ahead of them

773
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:43,532
is care and concern.

774
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:51,044
I know this because I nearly
fell through the cracks.

775
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,073
I was living on the street.

776
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:59,986
I spend my fourteenth birthday
sleeping in an abandoned van.

777
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,887
If I hadn't been placed
with the right foster family,

778
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,085
I'd have stayed there.

779
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,054
And that's a scary thought.

780
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,926
Because the kids I know
from those days

781
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,731
disappeared or died.

782
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:24,342
If I showed you pictures
related to my work

783
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,070
most of you would cry.

784
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:33,350
The awful truth is that there are
no happy endings in my line of work.

785
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:40,961
There are only stories
that just stop.

786
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:46,565
On a good day,

787
01:03:47,691 --> 01:03:49,602
I capture the scum of the earth.

788
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,704
On a good day,

789
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,635
I help a damaged young person

790
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,906
take a step forward

791
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:02,149
on a very long journey
through the kind of nightmare that

792
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,877
would ruin this lovely dinner.

793
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:12,686
Listen,

794
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:18,266
you don't want me in your life.

795
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:24,471
You never want me
to come into the picture.

796
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,031
Not with your child.

797
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,943
So please, write big cheques

798
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,181
and maybe none of you will
ever have to see me again.

799
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,850
It's been such an honour to be here.
Thank you.

800
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,632
The speech is over.

801
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:55,963
We broke all our records,
thanks to you. It is time to celebrate.

802
01:04:59,696 --> 01:05:01,369
- All right. One glass.
- Okay.

803
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,977
Cheers. Thank you so much.

804
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:06,944
- Cheers. Thank you.
- Cheers.

805
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,844
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

806
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,619
So, I... I got to ask you,

807
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:17,322
how can you stand to be
in the same room

808
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,526
as some of these people?

809
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,658
Criminals are easy.

810
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,624
The tough pan is the technology.

811
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,860
Really? How... how so?

812
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:36,772
Well, right now we're working with this
locked network that has the best

813
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,110
encryption we've ever seen.

814
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:43,777
So, the bad guys are winning then?
Is that what you're saying?

815
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,550
Well, my guys are really good.

816
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,924
You know, my guys are really good and...
and one of them thinks that...

817
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,590
Well...

818
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,223
I'm sorry.

819
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:01,592
I'm sorry that just got...
got past security.

820
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,128
No, I'm sorry.
Once you get me going...

821
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:08,908
No, it's... No Mika and I are just...
we're working on a big project.

822
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:14,413
The day after begins
before the day before ends. It's just.

823
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,580
Oh, I can't even read that.

824
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:18,644
Is it getting late?

825
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,318
That's why they make women's watches
so small, so you can't see how late it is.

826
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:47,244
Oh, that's great.

827
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,744
- Now just pour me into a taxi.
- A taxi?

828
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:52,886
No, why don't I give you a ride.

829
01:06:58,515 --> 01:06:59,721
Thank you.

830
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,566
Thanks.

831
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,294
I better call my boyfriend.

832
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,267
- Why?
- 'Cause I don't feel very well.

833
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,174
No, you look fine.

834
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:51,706
I don't want him to worry.

835
01:07:52,135 --> 01:07:53,580
Well, let him worry.

836
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:56,341
You're not a helpless child.

837
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,583
Hey.

838
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,025
Come here.

839
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:15,295
You know,

840
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:17,905
one professional to another,

841
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:22,107
I wish I'd met someone like you
when I was a little girl.

842
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,437
Are you joking?
Didn't you get the message?

843
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:33,372
What message?

844
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,482
There's a snowstorm out here.
I'm sending everybody home.

845
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:37,752
Anyway, I want these here tomorrow
when the landscaper's here.

846
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:38,852
Hey, I was driving all day man.

847
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,848
- You can place them where they need to go...
- didn't plan on spending the night.

848
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:42,988
Listen, there's a place
just down the highway.

849
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,186
The Richard Lake Motel.
Just stay there.

850
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,923
Bring the receipts, I'll look after it.

851
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,457
Hi, Daddy.

852
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:50,065
No cry.-

853
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,612
Are you... are you okay?

854
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:03,074
You okay? Yeah?

855
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:11,115
Oh, I've missed you so much.

856
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,462
- Hey, are you okay, huh?
- I'm okay.

857
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:20,966
- Yeah?
- How's Mum?

858
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,673
We miss you so much

859
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:32,040
I wanted to see you so much.

860
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,139
He understood. Just this once.

861
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:39,019
He wanted me to be happy.

862
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:42,089
- As happy as I could be, so...
- Who?

863
01:14:43,112 --> 01:14:44,090
Who, Cass?

864
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:47,693
Who?

865
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,759
I thought... I've thought about you
every second of the day.

866
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:54,123
- I'm so sorry. I should never have left you.
- There's nothing...

867
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:55,667
I shouldn't have left you.

868
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,197
No, you shouldn't have.

869
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,529
But it happened so fast.

870
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:02,307
They would have got me anyway.
They were following us.

871
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:04,977
Who?

872
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:09,047
Who, Cass, who are they?

873
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,640
Huh? Come on.
You gotta come home

874
01:15:12,108 --> 01:15:13,109
to Mum. Let's go.

875
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:14,916
- Was it just a trick?
- Come on. What?

876
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,017
The day you lost me.

877
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:18,853
Was it just a trick?

878
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:21,624
Or maybe gimmick's a better word.

879
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,722
Something we didn't need.

880
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,033
We were so good. We didn't need
anything like to get attention.

881
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:29,601
What, Cass?
What are you talking about?

882
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,268
One black and one white.

883
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:33,072
So distracting.

884
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,968
Was it just a gimmick?
A trick?

885
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:38,005
Cass, I... I don't know
what you're talking about, okay?

886
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,780
A trick you don't need sounds
so funny.

887
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,607
Yes, gimmick's a better word.

888
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:45,376
Irrelevant.

889
01:15:45,775 --> 01:15:47,721
We were so good
we didn't need gimmicks.

890
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,289
A promise was made.

891
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,117
Was that promise kept?

892
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:00,134
They arranged this
so that I would be happy.

893
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:03,125
They'll do anything
to keep me happy.

894
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:06,672
Anything. I'm so precious to them.

895
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:10,102
I have to go.

896
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,508
I... I have to go.

897
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:13,509
What? No.

898
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:15,281
- You can't do it. Please, Dad,
- No!

899
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:16,411
- No! No. I don't...
- you can't tell anybody.

900
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:17,841
- No I'm gonna tell...
- Promise me, Daddy.

901
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:20,051
- I'm telling the police. You're coming with me.
- You have to pretend it's all a dream.

902
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:22,415
- You'll never see me again.
- You're coming to see your mother. I...

903
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,056
- No! Daddy, no!
- I've got you in my hands.

904
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,656
...you're not going anywhere.
You understand me?

905
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:26,222
No.

906
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:28,050
No.

907
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,322
- No.
- Cass...

908
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:32,927
Daddy.

909
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:36,162
- Daddy.
- Cass.

910
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,007
Okay, boys, <i>shows</i> over.

911
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,075
Go on, now.

912
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,084
He'll be conscious in ten minutes.

913
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:05,690
All right, Cassandra.

914
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,402
Alright, now.

915
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:15,331
It's time to go home.
Yeah.

916
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,170
Cassandra, let's go home.

917
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:26,883
All right. All right. All right.

918
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:30,855
Come on, sweetie.

919
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:32,991
That's it.

920
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:35,721
That's it.

921
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:43,196
Detective, I really hope you don't think
I was avoiding your phone calls.

922
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:47,770
It's just that I have spoken already
to two other colleagues of yours.

923
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,167
Yeah, I understand that.

924
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:50,833
As I told them,

925
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:55,240
I have no idea how this woman
would find her way into our charity ball.

926
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,417
You have to understand that this
is a very well-publicized event.

927
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,080
Tell me, what was your your contact

928
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,047
with the woman
after she came to your table?

929
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,585
I hardly spoke with her.

930
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:08,324
There was only one empty chair
in the whole room

931
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,925
and she took that empty seat.

932
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:14,730
You see, Detective Dunlop
was supposed to come with a guest.

933
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,067
Yeah. We...

934
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:23,733
She decided that she...
she wanted to go alone.

935
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:26,010
- So you...?
- Yeah.

936
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,651
Could this mystery woman have

937
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:34,783
somehow known
that you weren't coming?

938
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,115
I'm sorry, you're the detective.

939
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:40,921
Can you tell me anything
more about this woman?

940
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:42,686
Any details, anything at all?

941
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:45,926
Did you see them leave together?

942
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,932
I saw the back of them.

943
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,098
But I was speaking with someone else
at that moment.

944
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:56,100
I think I heard the woman
offer Detective Dunlop a ride.

945
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,036
Didn't that strike you as suspicious?

946
01:18:58,601 --> 01:18:59,511
Suspicious?

947
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:02,140
A stranger offers
a police officer a ride?

948
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:03,576
She needed one.

949
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:08,081
She was alone, after all.

950
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:44,213
Hello?

951
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:47,322
Is anyone there?

952
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:50,125
Hello?

953
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,766
Oh, yeah, I know. I know.

954
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,100
You've been really understanding.
I appreciate that.

955
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:04,002
I mean that.
Do you have any idea where she's gone?

956
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,743
- No.
- Or where she's working now?

957
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:07,976
Linda used to make sure
that these are up all the time...

958
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,980
- It's not... it's not up right now.
- I told you...

959
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:10,982
- she stopped working here last year.
- I understand that.

960
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,010
I'm going to put it up right now, okay?
Thank you.

961
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:13,942
- What's so funny?
- No, it's not a trick, it's a gimmick.

962
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:15,375
A gimmick we don't need.

963
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,147
That day you lost me.
Was it just a trick?

964
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,487
Or maybe gimmick's a better word.
One black, one white.

965
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,012
I made him promise
he'll never skate with anyone else.

966
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,188
We were so good we didn't need
anything like that to get attention.

967
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,293
The promise was made.

968
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,159
Was that promise kept?

969
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:29,781
Nicole,
just tell me what it was like.

970
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:36,323
What was it like to sleep
in an abandoned van on your...

971
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,065
fourteenth birthday?
Yeah?

972
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:43,603
Does this remind you of
what it was like?

973
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,101
Sorry if I got some
of the details wrong.

974
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:51,007
But you didn't tell me
what color the van was so...

975
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:54,507
I found the yellow
to be quite striking.

976
01:22:56,772 --> 01:23:06,591
Just tell me, is this anything like
what you experienced, is it?

977
01:23:09,852 --> 01:23:14,995
Start thinking of the details
or else I might not be back.

978
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:57,974
Uh, excuse me,
you probably shouldn't...

979
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:05,349
What other rooms do you work in?

980
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:07,985
Every room on this floor.

981
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:13,618
Hey, baby.

982
01:24:13,682 --> 01:24:15,559
I was wondering if you could
please come to the house?

983
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,053
- Come home?
- We need to talk.

984
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,025
Talk about what?

985
01:24:20,589 --> 01:24:21,465
Just come to the house.

986
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:24,732
Okay. It's gonna take me a few hours.
I'm gonna be right there.

987
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:27,301
- Three cameras found.
- Can't trace the uplink yet.

988
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,571
- In all the rooms that Tina works?
- Yeah.

989
01:24:32,034 --> 01:24:35,538
- Alright, what's going on? Ideas?
- Yeah. Some kind of thrill crime.

990
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:37,382
What's the thrill?

991
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,348
Watching mummy twist.

992
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:41,177
It's actually not a
bad idea for a reality show.

993
01:24:41,877 --> 01:24:43,720
Look it, it's out there,
I know, but listen, you got the kid.

994
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:48,027
So why not watch the mother's
pain and confusion? A blank trophy.

995
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,853
- A teacup. Throw in some baby teeth.
- A hairbrush. A pinwheel.

996
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:53,358
Eight years after the abduction?

997
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,967
Hey, they might
have been watching all along.

998
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,195
The personality driven
to abduct the child, we're used to.

999
01:25:00,362 --> 01:25:02,364
Noticing a mother's quiet
desperation.

1000
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,201
That's something else.

1001
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:07,442
What are you saying, Sam?

1002
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:11,273
There's a kidnapper
and there's a watcher.

1003
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:12,777
Or watchers.

1004
01:25:13,008 --> 01:25:14,783
Maybe even subscribers.

1005
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,014
A whole new class of freaks.

1006
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,091
Let's go.

1007
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,231
Hi.

1008
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,099
Hello, Matthew.

1009
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:32,899
What's going on?

1010
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:35,399
Let's talk for a minute.

1011
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,442
Well, I don't... I don't really
have anything to say.

1012
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:44,873
Please?

1013
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,830
Nicole thinks that they might be...

1014
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:01,058
they might be watching me.

1015
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:04,729
Who's watching you?

1016
01:26:05,127 --> 01:26:07,664
It looks like the abductors
aren't so far out of the picture.

1017
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,508
Nicole found some cameras
in my rooms that were hidden.

1018
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:13,041
Why?

1019
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,375
We'd love any
ideas you have about that.

1020
01:26:15,971 --> 01:26:17,041
Well, I have no idea.

1021
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:23,012
Did you keep any of Case's teeth,
her baby teeth?

1022
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:25,857
What?

1023
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,487
Tina's found some baby teeth

1024
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:31,854
- and some other things in the rooms.
- Other things? What other things?

1025
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:36,095
A trophy.
Like the one she won.

1026
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,002
The teeth?

1027
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:42,301
- Okay, are they hers?
- Why would you think they were hers?

1028
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:45,008
If they're not hers, then why the fuck
are we talking about them?

1029
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,377
I'm not saying...
I'm not saying anything else with this...

1030
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:53,043
Get outta my house.
Go.

1031
01:27:09,925 --> 01:27:11,097
What do you want from me?

1032
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:16,034
The teeth were placed in the rooms,

1033
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,035
under the pillows.

1034
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:19,710
I found them like they were left
for the Tooth Fairy.

1035
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,571
You know,
like we used to do with Cassie.

1036
01:27:22,504 --> 01:27:24,040
Have you asked the Tooth Fairy?

1037
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:26,875
- Do you think this is funny?
- Yeah. A little. I do. How...

1038
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,180
how long has this been
going on, hon?

1039
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:30,681
How come no one's told me?

1040
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:34,522
Tina, why tell me, right?

1041
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,560
Why ask for my help.
You guys are doing great on your own.

1042
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:38,056
It's only been eight years.

1043
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:41,429
You people can't even do your job.
All you can do is turn my wife against me.

1044
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:44,397
Tina, do you think that I did this?
Is that what you think? That I went in there,

1045
01:27:44,693 --> 01:27:48,766
I put a bunch of... uh, cameras in there?
And then... and what? And what?

1046
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:56,744
Tina.

1047
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:02,488
Mr. Lane,

1048
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,580
is there something
you're not telling us?

1049
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,126
No! No!

1050
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:10,727
So now what? Huh?

1051
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:12,966
You gonna arrest me?
Go ahead, please do it.

1052
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:17,726
Please. If you think that I did this, you...
you come here and you arrest me.

1053
01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:41,049
What's with the shrine here, man?

1054
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,439
It's just there's so many people
from before.

1055
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:07,142
There's Jill from my soccer team.
My best friend, Karen. Albert

1056
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,987
And now that
I can't see my mum anymore I need...

1057
01:29:11,546 --> 01:29:14,083
new experiences.
I need to feel inspired.

1058
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:18,130
Oh, yeah.

1059
01:29:18,253 --> 01:29:21,132
Do you remember that story
I told you about the trophy?

1060
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:24,730
About the moment I skated over
to my mother and handed it to her?

1061
01:29:25,994 --> 01:29:28,099
Remember how moved you were?

1062
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,101
I want to feel that.

1063
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:34,737
You told me it was the best story
I ever told you.

1064
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:37,745
It was.

1065
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:40,953
So why don't we make it
even better?

1066
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:45,383
H OW?

1067
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:08,644
I'm just wondering if you kept
that trophy or if Cass kept it.

1068
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,075
- What's this for?
- It's just for an article I'm writing about

1069
01:30:11,273 --> 01:30:14,413
children who disappear and the impact
that it has years later on the...

1070
01:30:14,643 --> 01:30:16,281
This article sounds like
fucking bullshit.

1071
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,717
- No, it's not. It's very serious...
- What, you come here eight years later

1072
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:20,018
and then bring up Cass?

1073
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:23,061
I'm just wondering about the impact that
it had on your life. I'm wondering...

1074
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,288
Yeah, it impacted my life.
What do you want to know?

1075
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:26,989
I want to know about
this trophy that you won.

1076
01:30:27,055 --> 01:30:28,591
- I wondered if you kept it.
- No. No.

1077
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,168
I'm done.
No, this is fucking bullshit.

1078
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:33,506
- Did you keep the trophy?
- Yeah, I kept the fucking trophy.

1079
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:35,734
Okay. I can...
I can see that you're upset.

1080
01:30:36,031 --> 01:30:37,510
- I won't ask you any more questions.
- Great. Are we done?

1081
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:39,909
- Yeah. Thank you very much for your time.
- Awesome. Thank you so much.

1082
01:30:59,154 --> 01:30:59,962
Albert?

1083
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:02,194
Who's that?

1084
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:05,095
Some creepy bitch asking
about Cass.

1085
01:33:05,013 --> 01:33:05,787
- Yeah?
- Okay,

1086
01:33:06,081 --> 01:33:06,684
I don't know
who's in charge here anymore.

1087
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:09,522
I used to deal with Nicole Dunlop.
Um, 'kay... This is urgent.

1088
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:10,555
Who is this?

1089
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:12,053
Matthew Lane.

1090
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:13,161
Matthew Lane.

1091
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,592
- Case's father. Cass Lane.
- Yeah, I know who you are, Matthew.

1092
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:17,800
I've found them.

1093
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:19,265
Those people who took my daughter,
I found them.

1094
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:21,002
They're at a diner on Route 15.

1095
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:23,338
You been watching a lot of movies,
lately, Matthew?

1096
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:28,040
Listen to me.
These people have my daughter.

1097
01:33:28,636 --> 01:33:31,412
I've seen her.
I've been... I've been with her.

1098
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,582
She's alive.

1099
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:39,079
Hey. I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1100
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,027
I have a phone and the phone has
GPS. I'm gonna plant it on their car.

1101
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:43,293
I'll give you the number.

1102
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,556
I'm gonna plant it on their car
and then you can track it.

1103
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:47,092
And then you can find them

1104
01:33:47,655 --> 01:33:49,999
in case something happens
to me, okay?

1105
01:34:23,925 --> 01:34:26,701
Uh, do you mind if I...
If I ask you a few questions?

1106
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,406
- About what?
- About Cass Lane.

1107
01:34:30,565 --> 01:34:33,637
- Okay.
- Yeah, I... I'm writing an article about...

1108
01:34:33,935 --> 01:34:36,973
children who disappear and the effect
that it has on the people in their lives.

1109
01:34:37,272 --> 01:34:38,444
Yeah.

1110
01:34:40,475 --> 01:34:43,513
- Just got a call from Matthew Lane.
- Yeah, I overheard you.

1111
01:34:44,612 --> 01:34:46,114
What is it with you and that guy?

1112
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:51,928
Says he met this guy at a diner.

1113
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:54,894
Thinks he's the one that stole
his daughter.

1114
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:57,336
So he tossed his cell phone
in the guy's car.

1115
01:34:59,127 --> 01:35:00,128
Want me to check it out?

1116
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:02,973
Yeah.

1117
01:35:13,174 --> 01:35:14,676
Hey! Put that back!

1118
01:35:15,310 --> 01:35:18,189
- It's my daughter.
- I don't care who it is, I said put it back!

1119
01:35:21,249 --> 01:35:22,728
Do you want me to call the cops?

1120
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:24,630
Yeah, I want you to call the cops.

1121
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:27,295
Do it. Do it.

1122
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:52,118
Have you seen this girl?

1123
01:35:54,082 --> 01:35:57,529
I lost her a few miles from here,
at a diner just like this one.

1124
01:35:58,987 --> 01:36:00,295
That's awful.

1125
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,093
Yeah, it's awful.

1126
01:36:05,994 --> 01:36:08,804
I went in to get a
and I came out and she was gone.

1127
01:36:09,797 --> 01:36:10,969
Just like that.

1128
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,572
Eight years ago.

1129
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:16,007
I've spent... I've spent eight years
looking for her.

1130
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:20,279
Without a trace?

1131
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:26,285
Without a trace.

1132
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,027
Isn't that an awful story?

1133
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:36,065
Well, isn't that an awful story?

1134
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:42,968
You know something?

1135
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:46,034
The police think
that I had something to do with it.

1136
01:36:46,434 --> 01:36:47,538
That maybe I sold her.

1137
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:51,414
- Sold her to who?
- To monsters.

1138
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:55,718
How could I do that?

1139
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:58,884
I'm her father. I'm her dad.

1140
01:36:59,047 --> 01:37:01,618
I... I'm supposed to protect her.
I'm the one that loves her.

1141
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,121
Of course you do.

1142
01:37:04,452 --> 01:37:06,523
I miss my daughter so much.

1143
01:37:10,091 --> 01:37:13,265
- I called the police. Now get outta here.
- You called the police?

1144
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:18,636
The police,
they're a useless bunch of...

1145
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:20,946
They're... they're the real monsters here,
the police.

1146
01:37:21,035 --> 01:37:24,278
They're all in this together with the judges
and the lawyers and the priests

1147
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:27,084
and all those people that
we're supposed to trust.

1148
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,293
They know where Cass is.

1149
01:37:37,085 --> 01:37:38,894
They're all the ones
that are hiding her.

1150
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:09,660
He took my phone.

1151
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:55,031
Fuck!

1152
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:08,374
Fuck. Fuck!

1153
01:40:11,272 --> 01:40:12,376
Fuck!

1154
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:13,577
Hey! Hey!

1155
01:41:57,144 --> 01:41:59,090
We just have to go somewhere.

1156
01:42:12,593 --> 01:42:13,663
Put her down!

1157
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:17,134
Freeze!

1158
01:42:28,042 --> 01:42:29,043
Freeze!

1159
01:42:29,844 --> 01:42:30,879
Don't move!

1160
01:42:31,946 --> 01:42:34,790
Don't move or I'll shoot!
Don't move!

1161
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:56,741
Where is she?

1162
01:42:57,772 --> 01:43:00,981
Where's Nicole? Answer me!

1163
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:07,384
Where, where, where?

1164
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:13,465
A van. Where she had her
fourteenth birthday

1165
01:43:13,754 --> 01:43:15,427
Fourteenth birthday?
What the hell are you talking about?

1166
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:17,092
Where's the van, man?
Where is it?

1167
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:19,167
You know we're gonna find it,
now tell us!

1168
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,797
Where's the van? Where is it?

1169
01:43:22,396 --> 01:43:23,568
Just tell us where it is.

1170
01:43:23,798 --> 01:43:24,776
Where is it?!

1171
01:44:02,803 --> 01:44:04,009
Cassie?

1172
01:44:06,774 --> 01:44:07,809
Daddy...

1173
01:44:08,676 --> 01:44:09,586
Baby!

1174
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:56,533
All those years,
you guys wouldn't let up.

1175
01:44:57,725 --> 01:45:01,298
It wasn't just for you,
you know, it was for Nicole too.

1176
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:02,968
For her spirit.

1177
01:45:08,369 --> 01:45:10,144
It was really important for her.

1178
01:45:11,839 --> 01:45:14,683
They'll find her. I know they will.

1179
01:45:16,043 --> 01:45:18,023
Your team is so smart
