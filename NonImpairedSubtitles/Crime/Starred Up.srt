There's been an incident
involving Mr. Love

205
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,848
which has placed
him at extremely high degree of risk,

which is why I brought it to
your immediate attention.

he begins treatment

for his violence as soon as possible,
in my... In my group.

00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,490
He's assaulted
two of my officers

shortly after knocking
another victim unconscious.

You will not be rewarding him
with any kind of group.

it on me for?
