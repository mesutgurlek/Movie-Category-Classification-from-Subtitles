1
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,300
How ya doin'?

2
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,100
That's for you.

3
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,600
- You sure you're up for this?
- Yeah.

4
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,900
- So, see you tonight, right?
- Yeah.

5
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,800
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,600
- So I'll see you tonight.
- OK.

7
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,900
<i>- (man) What happened to you?
- (man #2) What does it look like?</i>

8
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
I don't know.

9
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I had this pit bull, right?
Joe. Joe the dog.

10
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,200
I go to feed the fuck, right?
I put his bowl down, he goes nuts.

11
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,100
Bites my fucking thumb off.
19 stitches.

12
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,700
I'm in the hospital three days.

13
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,000
I get out. I get my gun.

14
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,700
I go to him "You like to bite things?"
Bite this." I put the gun in his mouth.

15
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,200
Bam! I blow him
all over the apartment.

16
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,800
- Ever see a dog explode?
- They're here.

17
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,100
This neighbourhood's a real shit hole.
I don't know why you had to meet here.

18
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,800
We'll do the next meeting at
Tavern on the Green, all right?

19
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,700
- How you doin', Noonan?
- I'm cold. Let's get this over with.

20
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,900
- Fine. Let's see the stuff.
- Show 'em.

21
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,400
- Let's see the money.
- We'll take this at a little discount.

22
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,300
- I knew this shit was gonna happen.
- This is fucking bullshit.

23
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,100
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me?

24
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,400
- I'll shoot him.
- Don't point that at me.

25
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
We'll walk away. This is bullshit.

26
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,000
<i>Give me the bag.
I want to shoot you.</i>

27
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,500
Shoot him.
I'll take this and get the fuck...

28
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,300
Did you hear what I said?
I said give me the fucking bag.

29
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,900
Don't be a fool.
Give me the bag. You want to die?

30
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,800
- Shut up.
- Want me to shoot him?

31
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,100
- I don't give a fuck.
- I'll shoot you now.

32
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,200
Give me the fucking bag!

33
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,700
- Let's go.
- Want to fucking get shot?

34
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,100
Give me that fucking bag!

35
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,100
- Jesus Christ...
- What happened back there?

36
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,000
- What?
- Nothing, right?

37
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,700
I don't... No! No!

38
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
- Do you know me?
- No, I don't know ya!

39
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,000
All right, put me
in a subway station. Go!

40
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
<i>(? "White City" by the Pogues)</i>

41
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,200
He's wearing a silk suit.
He's got crocodile shoes.

42
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,900
I said "I don't care what fucking shoes
you wear. You're still a crack dealer."

43
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,000
The guy says "I didn't know
I was in your neighbourhood, man."

44
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,200
Like his balls were in his throat.

45
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
"Don't go to pieces" I tell him.
Then he gets the joke.

46
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,100
- Who the fuck is this?
- What do you want?

47
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,500
- Whatever you're having.
- Fuck you.

48
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Trying to hurt my feelings?
Won't introduce me to your friends?

49
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,900
- Terry?
- That took you fucking long enough.

50
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,400
Terry Noonan. Terry.

51
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,700
- Terry Noonan.
- Hey, motherfucker.

52
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,800
You fuckin'... Come here, come here.

53
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,600
Where you fuckin' been, man? Oh, man.

54
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,900
<i>(man yells)</i>

55
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,200
- It's great to fucking see ya.
- Hey.

56
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,600
This is my best fucking friend.
See, I love this fucking guy.

57
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,600
Where you been, fucking Mars?
You're looking good.

58
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,500
I gotta take my lord here for a stroll.

59
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,800
- I gotta talk to you.
- Wanna go somewhere?

60
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
- Yeah.
- OK.

61
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,400
Hey, catch you guys later, all right?

62
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,800
Give me this, give me this.

63
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
<i>You're a fucking prick. (laughs)</i>

64
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,500
Where'd our fucking neighbourhood go?
I don't even recognise the place.

65
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,800
A bunch of yuppie condos.
They could've left ten blocks for the Irish.

66
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,400
They don't even want to call it
Hell's Kitchen no more.

67
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,800
Renamed it Clinton.
Sounds like a fucking steamboat.

68
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,100
These guys you dropped.

69
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,800
- The guy you were with, this...
- My partner? DeMarco.

70
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,100
DeMarco? Can you trust him?

71
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,700
He might as well have done it himself,
Jack. Who's he gonna tell?

72
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,900
Who's he gonna tell?
Anybody he fucking wants.

73
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,100
Terry, this guy, this DeMarco,

74
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,600
he gets into a little trouble
with the cops, right?

75
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,400
He'd trade everything he knows
about you for a slice of pizza.

76
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,700
Wake up.

77
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,000
Would you ask Mikey
if he'd throw me something?

78
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Mikey met with a little accident.

79
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
So did Flynn.
Frankie's running the show now.

80
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,400
- Frankie's the boss?
- My big brother is the boss.

81
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,700
- Frank's the boss?
- Yeah.

82
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
He's trying to put this deal together
with the Italians. This guy Borelli.

83
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,100
- Joe Borelli?
- You heard of him?

84
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,200
We're like that.

85
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,600
- Hey, you want another beer?
- I'd love one.

86
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Cheers.

87
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,600
Is your sister still around?

88
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
No, Kate moved way the fuck uptown.

89
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,000
- You wouldn't recognise her.
- Yeah?

90
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,000
Terry.

91
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,300
Check this out.

92
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,400
- What the fuck is that?
- It's...

93
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,800
It's Frankie's idea.
You got your favourite gun, right?

94
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,700
He got tired of tossing away
a perfectly good piece after every job.

95
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,000
You take your hands,

96
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,400
and you take your gun.

97
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,200
You put the prints on the gun,
you stash it.

98
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,600
The cops find the gun.
They're lookin' for a dead man.

99
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
- This is somebody's hands?!
- Yeah.

100
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,700
- What are you touching 'em for?!
- Terry, meet Flynn.

101
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,700
Don't fuck with me.
No, don't fuck with me.

102
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,300
<i>- (Jack laughs hysterically)
- Don't! Don't! You're gonna get... Fuck!</i>

103
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,500
- That's somebody's hands!
- Are you scared?

104
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
- Get the fuck...!
- All right, hands up.

105
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,300
- Put 'em back.
- They're in. They're in.

106
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,500
- They're in. All right?
- You're a sick pup.

107
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
- I know.
- You're a very sick pup.

108
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,100
What's this? Come here.

109
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,000
Sweet.

110
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,400
See this gun I got here?
I love this fucking gun.

111
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,000
- I usually shoot straight when I'm drunk.
- You mean you were aiming?

112
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,700
Thank God you're back. I was feeling like
the last fucking Irishman in the Kitchen.

113
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,100
Terry, you've been away
too long. You gotta wake up.

114
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,500
Never do business with a greaser.
The cops get him, they got an eyewitness.

115
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,400
And an eyewitness puts you away.
Unless it's around here.

116
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,600
The cops can't do shit around here.

117
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,400
Now, me and Frankie took
this union guy out last year.

118
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,200
Went up to him on the street,
popped his button.

119
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,300
There must've been 50 witnesses.

120
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,200
Cops were all over the Kitchen
asking questions.

121
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,700
This one asshole raised his hand.

122
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Cops found his head spinning
inside a washer- dryer over on 47th.

123
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,200
Haven't heard from the cops in a year.

124
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

125
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
- Jackie, where the hell were you?
- Kate.

126
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,700
I waited for you. You said you'd come by.

127
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,300
- When?
- You don't remember?

128
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,500
- At my apartment.
- You shouldn't have moved so far away.

129
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,500
She moved all the fucking way
uptown. Who can get there?

130
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,800
Oh, right. You get above the 50s,
you get disoriented.

131
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,900
Hello, Kathleen.

132
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,600
- Well.
- It's Terry Noonan. He showed up.

133
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- How are you?

134
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,400
I thought you were...
Where did we think he was?

135
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Nobody knew.

136
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
So, you got nostalgic for mayhem?

137
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,400
Yeah, he just appeared.

138
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,700
It's like angels were flying by,
so they dropped him off.

139
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

140
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,000
You've got this look. What's this look?

141
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Trying to remember how I feel about you.

142
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,800
- That hard?
- Yeah, right.

143
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,400
- I think I'm pissed.
- Yeah, you guys were, you know.

144
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,700
Young. Very young.

145
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,300
She cried a lot when you went away.
My poor little sister.

146
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,400
She cried every night, praying
to the rosary you'd come back.

147
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,700
- You broke her heart, Terry.
- You're an asshole, Jackie.

148
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,700
- What did I do?
- I gotta go.

149
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
Stay. Have some coffee.

150
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,800
- You just got here.
- I gotta go to work.

151
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,000
Come on. I never see you.
Just for a minute.

152
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,900
- Terry asked about you.
- What did he want to know?

153
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,900
She works up at the Regent Hotel.

154
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,700
Ashtray in the lobby
costs more than my car.

155
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,400
It's a supernatural event for her
to come down here amongst us.

156
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,500
So, what was it I forgot?

157
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,000
You said it would be no trouble
doing that favour I asked you.

158
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,500
My car got hit by a cab.
I used up all my money to pay for it.

159
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,500
- I have nothing to live on till payday.
- I can loan you right now.

160
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
She likes our money,
but not the way we get it.

161
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,300
Why don't you keep it?
Keep your money.

162
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

163
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Sometimes my feelings get hurt too,
you know? The way you snub us.

164
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,500
Take the money, Kathleen.

165
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,000
- Come on, take it.
- All right. Thank you, Jackie.

166
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,500
You're welcome.

167
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,300
So, Terry.

168
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,600
- You just passin' through?
- No. He's coming home.

169
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,500
We're trying to work something out.

170
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,700
If you get above the 40s,
maybe you'll run into me.

171
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,900
It could happen. Right?

172
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,900
<i>- Be up to the angels, I guess.
- (Jackie) Them fucks.</i>

173
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,300
- Well, nice to see you... I guess.
- Same.

174
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,100
My mother-in-law's got
a foot thing I gotta pay for.

175
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,000
- She's got a foot thing.
- She's in the hospital.

176
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,300
It isn't up to me, all right?

177
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,100
Hey, Stevie! I got a surprise for you!

178
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,700
Don't bother me. I'm negotiatin'.

179
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,100
- Hey, negotiator!
- I don't believe this!

180
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,600
Terry fuckin' Noonan!

181
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,700
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Fuck, look at you.

182
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,400
Scary Terry. What the fuck is this?

183
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,400
- You go to the seminary? You don't write.
- He's bigger than me now.

184
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,500
- It's been a long time.
- Ten years.

185
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,400
- 12 years.
- We're doin' business.

186
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,400
Hey, Stevie. 300 bucks here, Stevie.
It ain't even gonna cut it.

187
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,700
- Where'd you find these two idiots?
- They come lookin' for me.

188
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,000
They take my money. I work
my ass off for it and they take it.

189
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,200
Listen. This punk owes
Jimmy Cavello eight grand.

190
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,300
Cavello's got cuff links
cost more than that.

191
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,200
Eight grand buys Jimmy
a Broadway ticket. Let's talk business.

192
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,600
They're out of spumone,
you blame the waiter?

193
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,300
What do we have, another mick
to contend with? What's going on?

194
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,300
- You heard what I said.
- Where you fuckin' been?

195
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,900
The last guinea around here was
Columbus. He only lasted a week.

196
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,700
Are you some kind of fuckin' asshole,
or just taking lessons?

197
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,800
Hey, I'll kill you!

198
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,200
<i>(cries out)</i>

199
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,900
You want to fuck with me?
You want to do that?!

200
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,100
What do you want to do, asshole?
Play it out? Let's straighten this out here.

201
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,700
Tommy! Tommy, it's over!

202
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,900
It's over, man!

203
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,600
Cocksucker. Who do you think
you're fuckin' with, eh?

204
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,100
You'll be hearing from
Jimmy Cavello, Stevie.

205
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,000
Hope that was your favourite gun.
I hope you loved that gun.

206
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,200
You don't know who you fucked with!

207
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,600
You motherfucker.

208
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,900
Fuck 'em.

209
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,400
- You fuckin' guys.
- You got it all?

210
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,900
You're better than the cavalry.
You saved me from the guineas.

211
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,800
- They was gonna burn you at the stake.
- I'm glad you're back. I missed you.

212
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,500
We'll take this town apart
on St Patty's Day.

213
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,500
Stevie, there's a horse runnin'
called Old Friend Arrives.

214
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,100
No shit. Look at this.

215
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,500
You saved my ass,
now you'll win me money.

216
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,200
I love ya. I gotta go.
OTB opens in ten minutes.

217
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,500
- Hey, today's my lucky day.
- See ya later.

218
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,300
Luckiest day he ever had,
his dog got run over.

219
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,200
- Is he fucked up or is he fucked up?
- I wouldn't let him operate on me.

220
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,600
You'd have to be dead two years first.

221
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,200
I'm gonna call Frankie
about taking you on.

222
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,200
We'll probably have to
go to Jersey to see him.

223
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,100
Jersey? Frankie lives in Jersey?

224
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,900
Yeah. What's the fuckin' world coming to?

225
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,100
I want to have kids. I just gotta
find the right broad, like Frankie did.

226
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,800
She'd let me fuck around on weekends,
and make pancakes before Sunday Mass.

227
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,200
- Like Irene, maybe.
- Who's Irene?

228
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,100
I spend one night with her, my eyes
are crossed for days. I walk into walls.

229
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,200
- I'd like to meet her.
- She's mine.

230
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,800
- Uncle Jackie!
- Hey.

231
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Hey, hey. Lola, come here.

232
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Look what the fuckin' cat dragged in.

233
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,300
Nice to see you, Terry.
You remember Maureen?

234
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,100
- How you doin'?
- Come on inside. We should talk.

235
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
- I'm Pat.
- How you doin'?

236
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,400
Play with the kids, OK, Jackie?
Teach 'em how to kneel or something.

237
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,800
<i>(Jackie) You want to see my gun, hm?</i>

238
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,000
Before you began exploiting these
pathetic skanks' addictive personalities,

239
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,000
- Where were you?
- A lot of different places.

240
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,200
Tell me about one.

241
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,900
- Texas.
- No shit?

242
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,200
I did my bit with the Corps.
Worked an oiI rig for a while.

243
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,400
Spent a couple of years driving
heavy machinery in Oklahoma.

244
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
Even rode a jackhammer in Milwaukee.

245
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,600
You picked some very odd fuckin' places.

246
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,100
- No time in the slam, huh?
- No.

247
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,900
You're lucky.

248
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,500
I gotta say, when you was a kid,
I never took you for a shooter.

249
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,400
You weren't somebody I'd expect to drop
two guys, like I hear you did in the Bronx.

250
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,700
I'll do a good job for you. Take me on.

251
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,700
We'll see.

252
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,100
You wouldn't regret it.

253
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,600
- What do I have to do?
- It's gonna be a hoot, man.

254
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Check him out, Pat.

255
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,900
Find this DeMarco guy
Jackie says is the hit.

256
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,700
If things check out,
relocate DeMarco in a dumpster.

257
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,200
Noonan's with us, I don't want the cops to
look at us for drug bullshit from the Bronx.

258
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,400
This is how me and Frankie deal with
guys tearing apart the neighbourhood.

259
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,200
Easier than sending a telegram.
Don't cost as much.

260
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,900
These guys get rich evicting
the real people who live here.

261
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,600
They kick out the Irish
to build yuppie nests.

262
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,900
Yuppies gotta be thicker
than the rats and the roaches.

263
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,300
Assholes can't live without their dogs.

264
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,400
Got dog shit all over the sidewalk.
It never used to be that way.

265
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,400
Used to be, you dropped a cone,
you could pick it up and finish it.

266
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,000
People wander the streets homeless
cos of these assholes.

267
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,800
- So we're like Robin Hood here.
- Yeah. And I'm Friar Fuck.

268
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,900
- What the fuck you doin'?
- 100-yard dash.

269
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,900
- 100-yard dash?
- Yeah.

270
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Are you fuckin' crazy?
You'll blow up the whole place.

271
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,600
I'll only do it if you really want to, Terry.

272
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,500
All right. All right, you fuckin' asshole.

273
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

274
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,400
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

275
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

276
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,500
OK.

277

Playing with matches?

- Tell you later, OK?
- You can tell me all night.

291

It's a long story.

Hi.

299

You mind I'm here?

00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,100
No. No, but it's busy.

301

What possessed you?

302
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,300
Listen, I have a break in an hour.

303
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
- Meet you here?
- Sure.

304
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,500
- Or outside?
- Here's OK.

305
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,500
- Outside's better.
- OK.

306
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,400
I love your uniform.

307
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,700
Is this your dinner break?
You wanna go eat?

308
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Yeah, we could.
I'm not hungry, really.

309
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,100
Frankie's kids are cute.

310
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,100
His wife looks great next to him in court.

311
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,800
They're some Laura Ashley
suburban mutation.

312
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,700
He commutes,
she drives a station wagon.

313
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,100
<i>So what are we doin'?</i>

314
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
I wanted to see you.

315
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

316
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,100
Where's Jackie? Did he stand you up?

317
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
He ran into Irene.

318
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
What a slut.

319
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,600
So how come you don't have a boyfriend?

320
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,100
I do have a boyfriend. He's out of town.

321
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,900
I met him at the hotel. He travels a lot.

322
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm lying. I recently broke up.

323
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,800
- I'm divorced.
- Divorced? Really?

324
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400
Any kids? I hope not.

325
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,000
Six months ago. Yeah, no kids.

326
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,300
- Let's go dancing.
- Don't you want dinner?

327
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,800
- Don't you have to go back?
- I got somebody.

328
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,500
I called the girl who works the other shift.
I begged her. We can do that.

329
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,300
<i>You want to go dancing with me?</i>

330
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Come on, Terry. No one forgets
their first love. You know that.

331
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Just the slow ones?

332
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,400
Just the slow ones.

333
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,600
<i>? Well, you tell us that we're wrong</i>

334
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
<i>? You tell us not to sing our song</i>

335
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,400
<i>? Nothing we can say will make you see</i>

336
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,500
<i>? You got a heart of stone
you can never feel</i>

337
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,400
<i>? You say: oh, I'm not afraid,
it can't happen to me</i>

338
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,400
- Yeah?
- DeMarco. Buick's out front.

339
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,300
- Point him out.
- You gotta be kidding me, man.

340
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,300
In the corner. At the table.

341
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,500
Just wanted change.

342
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,000
I understand you knew a Terry Noonan.

343
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,400
Get out of my face. I don't know no one.

344
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,200
- What's this?
- We're gonna go for a little walk.

345
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,300
- What are you, a cop?
- Yeah.

346
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,500
- Let's go.
- I don't know no one.

347
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,100
- Come on.
- I don't!

348
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,900
<i>(pounding on door)</i>

349
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,900
- Yeah?
- Hey, Terry. Terry, it's me, Jackie.

350
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Frankie wants us on the job.

351
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,100
Now? It's two in the morning, man.

352
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,600
This is one of Frankie's peak hours.

353
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,700
- How are you, Mr Raferty?
- I'm fine, Stevie.

354
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,800
I got you five cases of Bushmills.

355
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,700
Nobody drinks it, Flannery.
It costs too much.

356
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm selling it cheap. 900 bucks for
all five cases. I'm doing you a favour.

357
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,100
Mikey McDonnell ran
the same scam on me for 500.

358
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,700
Might be the reason
Mikey didn't leave nothing in his will.

359
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,800
<i>(men chuckling)</i>

360
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,600
I ain't paying for any
goddamn Bushmills I don't need.

361
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,900
Jackie, check out the bar.

362
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,100
- See what this gentleman needs.
- Sure thing, Frank.

363
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,600
Stevie, what are you doing
with these bums?

364
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,900
Stevie, are you gonna let
this dickhead insult us like that?

365
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,100
Looks like they're low. Bar got crowded
tomorrow, it'd go dry in an hour.

366
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,900
<i>(men chuckle)</i>

367
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,300
Ain't givin' you a fuckin' cent, Flannery.

368
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,900
What are you doing?
It's like beating up your grandfather.

369
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,100
<i>- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.</i>

370
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,400
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Fuck you. You shut the fuck up.

371
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,900
- I won't tell you again! Shut up!
- The man's 50 years old!

372
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

373
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,000
- Fuck you!
- Stevie, shut up!

374
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,500
- You ain't my fuckin' father!
- Hey, Stevie!

375
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,900
Hey, Pat! Fuck you! Shut up!

376
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,400
- I want your opinion, I'll dial your asshole.
- Nicholson's the asshole.

377
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
What the fuck is goin' on here?!

378
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,100
- Terry! Get outta here!
- What's the matter, tough guy?

379
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,900
Get outta here!

380
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,800
Get outta here!

381
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,100
Pat, you do what I'm telling you!
Get outta here!

382
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,200
The bunch of you,
get the fuck outta here!

383
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,400
Get outta here!

384
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,200
I want the balance in two days, Raferty,

385
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,500
or you can scratch your name
out of the Yellow Pages.

386
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,600
- What the fuck were you doin'?
- He hit Stevie.

387
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,200
I know he hit him. He was supposed to.
He acted like an asshole.

388
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
Why do we have to
beat the shit out of an old man?

389
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,600
To scare him, you clown.

390
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
He was scared. He was already scared.

391
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,700
We're trying to intimidate this dickhead.

392
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,400
Then we're in a self-inflicted brawl
acting like a bunch of cowboys.

393
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,600
The one thing Borelli don't want!

394
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,400
He'll piss on us if he thinks
we lost our manners.

395
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,800
Frankie, I was fuckin' proud of ya.

396
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Acting like yourself for a change,
jumping in there. Not like a greaseball.

397
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,300
You check with Borelli before you shit.
I don't know who you are half the time.

398
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,700
- Fuck you.
- I'm sorry if I love you.

399
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,900
- You're my brother.
- You're a curse.

400
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,100
- I've taken care of you my whole life.
- You were doin' a good job of it, too.

401
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,200
You fuck me up again,
the whip comes down.

402
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,700
- You got that? You understand me?
- Yeah.

403
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
<i>(knocking)</i>

404
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,000
- Who is it?
- Terry.

405
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,500
What's the matter?

406
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Terry, what is it?

407
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,600
Now, Frankie, if we're gonna work
together, I got a little problem.

408
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,700
Somehow I got to solve it.

409
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
Is it something I could
help you with, Mr Borelli?

410
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,400
Stevie McGuire.
Lives in your neighbourhood.

411
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,200
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

412
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,000
It's true. He runs some errands for me.

413
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,500
It's also true he owes
Jimmy here eight grand.

414
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,700
Now, eight grand's not a lot of money.
I got guys out there owe me 80.

415
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,200
Except I know I'm gonna
get it back from them.

416
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,200
It's really not the eight grand
that's got Jimmy and me upset here.

417
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,700
It's this McGuire kid's attitude.

418
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,400
Jimmy here goes asking for our money,

419
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,300
and this McGuire kid, he spills
a drink on Jimmy's new cashmere.

420
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,600
Did it deliberately.

421
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,000
This is what Jimmy tells me.

422
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
Now Jimmy can't get the stain out.

423
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,900
He's been to six fucking cleaners,
and the best they could do was fade it.

424
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,100
This kid just doesn't have
any respect for Jimmy here.

425
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,300
And if he's got no respect for Jimmy,
he's got no respect for me.

426
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:57,100
Frankie, the most important thing
in doing business is good manners.

427
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,900
And I really don't think it would be proper

428
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,400
for us to have to go into your
neighbourhood to solve our problem.

429
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,700
Understand?

430
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,600
Frankie, don't make a mess.

431
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,600
You kids from the Westside.

432
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,400
<i>(Stevie) I'm not a connoisseur,
but I know my wine.</i>

433
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,000
I know my way around if I'm at a table.
Not just by the names.

434
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,400
- How you doin', Stevie?
- Hi, Pat.

435
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,800
- We gotta talk.
- Not tonight, Pat, all right?

436
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,100
I'm right in the middle of
telling her my life story.

437
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,400
Yeah, well, it won't take long. I promise.

438
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,300
I gotta step outside. I'll be right back.

439
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,400
Cindy, right? Sandy. I'm sorry.

440
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,800
What's goin' on, Pat?

441
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,300
The eight grand you owe Jimmy Cavello.
Should have quit at two.

442
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,800
Cavello? What have you
got to do with Cavello?

443
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,100
How you doin', Stevie?

444
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,100
You won't cut me over eight grand
don't even belong to you.

445
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,600
It ain't my habit to cut people up.

446
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I've been working on the eight grand.

447
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,300
I've been chipping away at it. Let me
make a phone call. I'll check on it.

448
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,200
You should've made it yesterday,
Stevie. Rent's overdue.

449
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,000
Frankie, it's me, all right?

450
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,400
We grew up together. We're friends.

451
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,500
Don't give me that bullshit.
My friends don't owe money.

452
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,800
You fuck! Fuck you, Frankie,
you motherfucker!

453
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,800
<i>(Frankie) Fuck you. You son of a bitch!</i>

454
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,500
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

455
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,600
- Give me the knife. Got the knife?
- Yeah. Here.

456
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,000
You shouldn't have fuckin' said that,
Stevie. I was gonna let Pat do this.

457
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,400
Pat's the expert.
Me, I'm just an amateur.

458
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,900
You did better than
you thought you would.

459
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

460
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,300
<i>(phone rings)</i>

461
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,300
<i>(Kathleen on machine) Hi. Please
leave a message after the beep.</i>

462
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,300
<i>(Jackie) Where the fuck are you?
Terry. Kathleen. Stevie's dead.</i>

463
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,200
<i>- Stevie's fuckin' dead.
- Jack? Jack, where are you?</i>

464
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,100
<i>(siren)</i>

465
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,800
Aw, look what they fuckin' did!

466
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,900
- Kate.
- Hello, Frankie.

467
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,900
- What are you doin'?
- Frankie! Frank!

468
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,200
You see this, man?!

469
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,800
- You see this?
- What are you doin' here, Kathleen?

470
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,500
Oh, Jesus! They cut his throat, the fucks!

471
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,000
- You shouldn't have brought Kathleen.
- I want to go.

472
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,100
- Kathleen, I'd like to buy you breakfast.
- I gotta go.

473
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,800
Whoever did it, the fucker doesn't
get his cappuccino in the morning.

474
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,700
And I do it. I fuckin' whack him out!

475
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,100
- Don't you jump to conclusions.
- Hey! Hey, Terry!

476
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,900
I'll be right back.

477
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,400
- What did Frankie say?
- Stevie never hurt nobody.

478
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,400
I hurt people. Frankie hurts people.
Stevie borrowed money, that's all.

479
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Who'd kill him over fuckin' money?!

480
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,900
You act surprised? Are you serious?
This surprises you?

481
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,400
Every time you turn around
somebody's dead.

482
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,900
- What?
- How many wakes did we go to as kids

483
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,300
because somebody forgot to pay money?

484
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,500
Every time we turn around
somebody's dead, huh? Bullshit!

485
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,800
Hey! See?

486
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,500
Hey! See?

487
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,900
Stevie never hurt nobody!
Fuck you!

488
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,600
You'll hunt him down. You three
will conduct an investigation

489
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,500
untiI you find somebody
who maybe did this.

490
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,200
I'm glad I saw this. I was forgetting
how you are, how you think.

491
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,600
- It's crazy of me to be near any of you.
- Let me straighten it out.

492
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,800
I shouldn't be seeing you.
Can we stop? Let's just stop.

493
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,900
- Don't do this.
- I'm not gonna get caught... No!

494
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,600
I won't get caught in this any more.
I'm not falling back.

495
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,600
What about me? Huh?

496
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,100
What about me? Hold on.

497
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,700
- Let's go.
- No, hold on!

498
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,300
Here.

499
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,100
What about me?

500
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,100
All right, fuck it. I'll call you.
I'll fuckin' call.

501
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,700
- Let's go. I gotta go somewhere.
- Where?

502
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,200
Remember Mickey Cassidy? His sister
didn't wear panties to dance class?

503
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,400
He's dead too. He was
dumb enough to become a cop.

504
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,300
I gotta go to the funeral.
It's over in Queens.

505
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,800
- I can't stand driving in Queens.
- You want me to drive?

506
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,300
No. Then I'd have to look out the window.

507
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,900
<i>(? "Amazing Grace" on bagpipes)</i>

508
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,000
<i>Ain't gonna be like this when we go.</i>

509
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,700
Probably paste shamrocks on our
foreheads, drop us next to an expressway.

510
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,200
And two years later,
build a fuckin' mall on top of us.

511
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,600
People walking all over us
to get a fuckin' milkshake.

512
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:20,200
I'm feeling squirrelly, man.
All this fuckin' marching music.

513
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,000
I want a drink.

514
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,100
- What do you want?
- Heineken.

515
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,200
Two Heineken.

516
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,800
Cassidy's old man.

517
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,800
Better go pay my respects. You coming?

518
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Go ahead.

519
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,100
A couple of Buds.

520
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,300
I'm Jackie Flannery. I knew Mickey.

521
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,800
Ain't smart, marching in a parade.
You're supposed to be dead.

522
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,700
If DeMarco were here,
he'd think he was seeing ghosts.

523
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,700
DeMarco is a ghost.

524
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,000
Somebody left him in a dumpster
in his favourite neighbourhood.

525
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,300
Call me.

526
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,100
I gotta get outta here.

527
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,700
I feel like I'm on Mars.

528
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
I feel surrounded.

529
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,600
- The guineas did Stevie, didn't they?
- Stevie owed everybody.

530
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,200
<i>- (Jackie stifles sob)
- Hey.</i>

531
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,000
- All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

532
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,100
This Stevie McGuire they found floating
in the East River, he's part of this?

533
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,600
<i>- (Terry) Cavello did it.
- Could Flannery have been involved?</i>

534
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,800
He didn't hit one of his own
for no reason.

535
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,900
- Money's always a reason.
- He didn't owe Frankie money.

536
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,700
As a favour, to impress Borelli.
Stevie ain't wrapped in a ribbon,

537
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,400
but Borelli's sense of
self- importance is soothed

538
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,700
that this goofball ain't
walking the streets no more.

539
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,400
You gotta get me outta this.
I'm gonna get caught up in this shit.

540
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,800
- What?
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

541
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,600
- You're a cop.
- These guys are my pals.

542
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,900
You smell like a distillery. You drink
too much. How much are you drinking?

543
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,600
Just listen to me.
Please fuckin' listen to me.

544
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,700
- You gotta get me outta this.
- I gotta get you outta this?

545
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,400
- You're talking like my grandma.
- Fuck!

546
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:29,200
I'm drinking too much. You're right.
Jackie's my friend. My best fuckin' friend.

547
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,600
I thought I could walk in
and do this, but I can't.

548
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,000
- It'll get outta control.
- It's a bullshit attack of feelings.

549
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,200
Just surgically remove the fuckers.

550
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,300
Get on with putting these
scumbags off the street.

551
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,200
You think I went to Boston to be a cop
cos I hated Boston crooks so much?

552
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,300
No, to get away. To get as far away as
I could so that this could never happen.

553
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:56,000
I'd never be in such circumstances
where I'd have to arrest my own friends!

554
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,500
These animals are your friends?

555
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,400
Hey, what do you know about it?
I don't know you.

556
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,400
Where are you from?
Poughkeepsie? White Plains?

557
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,700
- Stop drinking, Noonan.
- That's what I'm saying, you fuckin' idiot!

558
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,300
That's all they do is drink.
I'm Irish muscle in these circumstances.

559
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,300
We drink, we shoot people,
and I'll get caught in it.

560
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,100
I'm warning you,
I gotta go back to Boston.

561
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,000
You're talking like an asshole.

562
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,200
I'll run the fuck away,
where none of you can find me.

563
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,300
Jesus Christ, I thought you
Kitchen guys were tough guys.

564
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,700
We're not tough, Nick!

565
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,800
- Just crazy.
- You ain't either.

566
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,000
You're a fuckin' crybaby.

567
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,600
Oh, God.

568
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,500
You gotta get something on Flannery.

569
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,600
Hey. Come on.

570
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,800
You gotta get something on Flannery.

571
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,500
You gotta see something
we can accuse him of.

572
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,000
<i>You can get on the witness stand and say
"Him. Fuck him. Put him away."</i>

573
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,400
It ain't gonna work.

574
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,200
Borelli and Flannery make that deal,
people will drop dead all over the city.

575
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,100
If that happens, Noonan,

576
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,900
the blood's on your hands.

577
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,700
It's a difficult situation.
We're here, they're there in their world.

578
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
Looks like Borelli's
gonna let us in. Now this.

579
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,600
- How'd you find out?
- People saw him take Stevie to the car.

580
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,300
Cavello was there. They all drove away.

581
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,500
- They think they can do this to us.
- I know that.

582
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,500
They don't respect us.
Cavello's head has gotta roll.

583
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,200
Yes, but first we're gonna show some
maturity. Can you show me maturity?

584
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,700
- I'm talking about the neighbourhood.
- I'm talking about I am your boss.

585
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,800
Borelli says nobody gets hit.
We don't have his permission.

586
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,900
The neighbourhood's disappearing
in a tide of yuppies and dog shit.

587
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,200
Borelli's our ticket
so we can retire to Phoenix.

588
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:28,900
Cavello keeps gettin' up in the morning
till I say different. You got that?

589
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,100
Or you want me to put it
in writing on your forehead?

590
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,000
Jack?

591
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,500
Jack?

592
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,800
You listening to me, Jackie?

593
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,800
<i>- (lrene) Stop it!
- Terry, Terry, wait. Hold it.</i>

594
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,300
Jackie, stop it!
He wasn't doin' nothing!

595
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,500
Hey, whoa, Jack. Jackie!

596
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,600
You fuckin' maniac! Fuckin' maniac!

597
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,200
<i>(lrene) You're crazy, you know that?</i>

598
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,000
It's all right. Let him go.

599
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,200
- You OK, huh?
- You all right?

600
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,400
Broads, huh?

601
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,400
They put a wire around your dick
and lead you around like Dodo the dog.

602
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,900
You gotta marry 'em to forget 'em.

603
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,800
Don't worry about Jackie.

604
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:46,000
Sit down. Sit down a minute, Terry.
I want to talk to you.

605
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,300
So, you like Kate, huh?

606
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,500
- You've been seeing her.
- Yeah.

607
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,600
You gotta trust me on this one.

608
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,400
It's a crime, but she holds people
like you and me in nothin' but contempt.

609
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,900
You heard of ice queens? My sister Kate
has moved a Frigidaire inside herself.

610
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,800
I'm just tryin' to let you
learn from my experience.

611
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,200
If she thinks I'm shit,
what will she make of you?

612
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,000
Don't you think we ought to
be worried about Jackie?

613
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,900
Yeah, you're right. Keep an eye on Jackie.

614
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,100
Keep him out of trouble.

615
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,300
I'm countin' on you, Terry.

616
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,300
Pat.

617
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,400
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

618
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,500
When you're not too busy,
keep an eye on Noonan for me.

619
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,700
Love to.

621
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,800
- Who is it?
- Kate, it's Terry.

622
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,900
I'm sorry I'm here,
but Jackie's disappeared.

623
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,500
I looked everywhere. I can't find him.
You got any idea where he might be?

624
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,300
Jack.

625
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,100
I'd offer you a beer, Kate,
except I drank all of it.

626
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,800
You know...

627
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,300
we'd come here...

628
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,700
But not now.

629
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,300
I thought about Stevie
as hard as I could.

630
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,100
I hope that he's praying.

631
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,000
I should've known to look for you here.

632
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,800
Do you remember Stevie used to
come here... and hide with us?

633
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:29,600
Nobody'd ever think we'd come in here
without a nun dragging us in by the ear.

634
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,400
Like Father whatshisface.
Remember him?

635
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,000
He had too much spit, so he foamed
at the mouth when he gave the sermon.

638
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,200
Look at all the saints.

639
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,300
There's St Anthony and St Francis.
Who's that one over there?

640
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,300
Hey.

642
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,200
Let's go see St Anthony.

643
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,800
Maybe he wants a drink.

644

<i>(Terry) Jackie!</i>

645

I don't think he wants a drink, Jack.

00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,300
No.

I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.

I'm gonna make Stevie a saint!

No, I don't want some.
Terry, stop it! What are you doin'?!

What are you doin'? Terry, stop it!

Uh-uh.

That's the way I like it.

I need a little Maalox.
