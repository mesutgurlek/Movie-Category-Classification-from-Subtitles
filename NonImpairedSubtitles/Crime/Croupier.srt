1
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,478
(Man) 'Now he had become

2
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,315
'the still centre of that
spinning wheel of misfortune.

3
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,428
'The world turned round him,
leaving him miraculously untouched.

4
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,672
'The croupier had reached his goal.

5
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,513
'He no longer heard
the sound of the ball.'

6
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,670
(Thunderbolt)

7
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,469
'To begin with, he was Jack Manfred.'

8
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,120
- Now, then.
- I want a job, Giles.

9
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,760
I see. Well...

10
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,479
let me tell you
a little about our operation.

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,348
We like personality authors.
People the public recognises.

12
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,192
Celebrity's what sells books.

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,953
You can always find somebody
to do the writing.

14
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,316
What we need is the face.
Then the concept.

15
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,915
Right now I'm looking
for a soccer novel.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,597
Something where a tycoon buys a
lousy team, takes it to the top.

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,877
Seven-figure transfer fees.
Corruption all down the line.

18
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,269
Violence on and off the pitch.

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,713
Steroids.

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,794
You got any concepts?

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,189
It could be a thug story.

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,112
I'll tell you what,
why don't you think about it?

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,191
Couple of pages.

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,632
With plenty of sex, of course.

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,119
Fiona!

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,670
Interesting, Giles.
I will think about it.

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,153
Let me give you
three words of advice, Jack.

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,596
Don't give up. Stick with it.

29
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,752
Who persists, wins. That's my motto.

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,796
Write, write, write.

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,917
'And Jack had three words for Giles.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,638
'Go fuck yourself.

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,152
'Jack knew something was wrong.

34
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,791
'He'd forgotten Giles' advice,
Giles said three words.'

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,913
(Phone)

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,479
(Answerphone clicks on)

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,711
(Jack) 'Nobody around.
Leave a message after the beep.'

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,153
(Beep)

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,992
(Man) 'Jacko,
if you're there, pick up.

40
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,435
'I want to talk to you.
It's important.

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,995
'Jacko,
I've got some news for you.

42
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,674
'Come on, Jacko.'

43
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,593
- Yeah, Dad, it's me.
- 'How's it going? '

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,875
- Good, yeah.
- 'Found a job yet? '

45
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,390
- No.
- 'I've got something for you.'

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,674
In London.

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,796
I've been chatting with some friends.

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,348
Now, do you know
the Golden Lion casino?

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,192
'They're looking for a dealer.'

50
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,919
Yeah, that's not
what I wanna do, Dad.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,468
I know you don't like
taking my advice...

52
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,278
No, it's not that.

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,590
'Listen, I've set this up for you.'

54
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,878
You call the Golden Lion
and ask to speak to Mr Reynolds.

55
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,518
That's the manager.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,876
I don't know him personally
but I have spoken to his boss.

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,192
'Now, don't say no, Jacko.
Give yourself a break.'

58
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,714
All right, Dad.
Yeah, I'll think about it.

59
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,950
Reynolds at the Golden Lion.

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,793
Yeah. All right, Dad.
Yes. I'll call him.

61
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,394
'You do that. That's my boy.'

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,277
So how are you doing, Dad?

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,715
Great. Just started a new company.

64
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,153
(Fruit machines beeping)

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,356
Solid financing. It's good.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,798
'Jacko,
you know I love you, don't you? '

67
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,351
- Yeah. I know that.
- 'Don't let yourself down.'

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,831
- I won't.
- 'I'll keep in touch.'

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,353
(Dialling tone)

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,078
Goodbye, Dad.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,677
(Bird squawks)

72
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,752
(Woman) It was unbelievable.
I was in the room.

73
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,552
500.

74
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,029
Uh-huh. Blackjack.

75
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,116
See you then, bye.

76
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,033
Sorry to have kept you.
What'll you have?

77
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,430
'No. Jack knew
it still wasn't quite right.'

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,993
(Taps keyboard)

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,992
(Man bawling outside)

80
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,595
(Man) I wanna fuck
the whole world over!

81
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,908
Ha!

82
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,753
(Can clatters down stairs)

83
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,274
'He had just one word for Giles.'

84
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,313
(Buzzer)

85
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,755
(Scottish accent)
David Reynolds. The manager.

86
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,070
- Sit down, John.
- Jack.

87
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,557
You've been recommended
by the management here.

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,710
They knew your father.

89
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,916
He's a bit of a reputation,
hasn't he?

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,639
- Has he?
- In any case, I understand

91
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,598
you've had previous experience
in South Africa.

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,116
You'll find the rules here
a little different.

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,430
Before we start,
have got a police record?

94
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,512
- No.
- What school did you go to?

95
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,636
- I was at Bedales.
- Oh.

96
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,032
I don't think I know that one.
Private, I suppose.

97
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,588
There's three types of casino
in the UK.

98
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,240
High volume, small action
and middle of the road.

99
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,799
That's us. OK, Charlie.

100
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,836
- Do you have a salon prive?
- We tried.

101
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,230
Wasn't enough business.
Punters like company.

102
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,959
'Welcome back, Jack.

103
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,837
'To the house of addiction.'

104
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,475
Thanks, Charlie.

105
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,510
Right. Let's see you
handle the chips.

106
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,717
I assume the serial numbers on
the bowl and wheel correspond.

107
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,236
- We check every two days.
- Why not every day?

108
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,151
Procedure here.

109
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,077
Right, sort the chips.

110
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,835
Go.

111
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,150
(Watch ticking)

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,994
Good.

113
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,391
Right. Now pay me out 1800 in 25s.

114
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,315
Very good.

115
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,233
OK. Let's have a look
at your Blackjack.

116
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,318
14. Too many.

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,033
19, 16.

118
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,235
Too many.

119
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,793
13.

120
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,995
18,14.

121
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,674
19. 20.

122
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,395
(Deals)

123
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,475
What's the count?

124
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,357
Minus nine.

125
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,839
I make it minus eight.

126
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,399
Minus nine.

127
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,754
What makes you so sure?

128
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,319
It's the rule.

129
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,118
Always stand by your first count.

130
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,633
The odds are you're right.

131
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,119
Good call.

132
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,875
- You want me to check?
- I said, good call.

133
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,359
'It had taken him...

134
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,149
'45 minutes, but Jack
now had Mr Reynolds' number.

135
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,798
'The man couldn't count.'

136
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,236
Right. Just let me
run through a few things.

137
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,311
As a dealer, you never gamble.

138
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,674
Not anywhere.

139
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,557
And we'll need your picture.

140
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,471
- What for?
- For the database.

141
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,949
It's accessed by every
casino in the country.

142
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,792
It's the same system for punters.

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,598
- I don't gamble.
- Ever?.

144
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,558
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.

145
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,632
Huh. Next point.

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,832
Friendships between croupiers

147
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,878
inside or outside the casino
are discouraged.

148
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,235
Relationships with
females working here

149
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,912
are expressly forbidden.

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,117
We had the same rule in Sun City
but it was impossible to check.

151
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,316
This isn't South Africa.

152
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,153
We'd know, because someone
would report it.

153
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,676
- Believe me, someone always does.
- Does know, or does report?.

154
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,797
What if I knew something like
that and didn't report it?.

155
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,476
We'd know. There are
no secrets in this casino.

156
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,120
- And you'd be punished.
- How?

157
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,636
First offence, verbal warning.
Second offence, written warning.

158
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,951
That one's filed and sometimes
copied to the Gaming Board.

159
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,156
My discretion.

160
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,152
Third offence,
you'd be sacked on the spot.

161
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,915
You'd never work in a casino
in this country again.

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,718
And there's another rule.

163
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,759
You're forbidden to talk
to or recognise a punter

164
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,193
outside the casino.

165
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,236
If you see someone
who's gambled here,

166
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,799
even casually on the street,

167
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,475
you must ignore him or her.

168
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,913
Not married, are you?

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,231
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

170
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,514
She's not in the...

171
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,353
not in the gaming business, is she?

172
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,670
- No.
- Good.

173
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,270
This is our crow's nest.

174
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,033
I'm showing you it now,
but you'll never see it again.

175
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,951
Very impressive.

176
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,797
We have tapes here
that go back six months.

177
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,916
Here, let me show you something.

178
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,838
(Wheel spinning)

179
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,433
See that?.

180
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,715
Six weeks ago.

181
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,360
Dealer missed it.
Guy up here missed it.

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,352
I watch these tapes after hours.

183
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,510
Nothing gets by me.

184
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,160
Lady's in jail now.

185
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,913
It's easier to take ten million
pounds from a bank

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,719
than to take one penny
from this casino.

187
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,029
Right. Well, as soon as you get
your licence, you can start.

188
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,554
- Fine.
- So...

189
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,632
Are you planning to make
a career in casino work?

190
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,392
'And end up like you? '

191
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,072
I... I just want a job.

192
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,276
You're not the usual type
we get in here.

193
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,316
'Mr Reynolds was right. It was true.'

194
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,436
- (Phone)
- Excuse me.

195
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,078
'Jack was up above the world.

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,271
I can't talk about that just now.

'..voyeur.'

200
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,394
I'm with somebody. They can wait.

201
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,875
I'll be home at the usual time.

202
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,471
Don't get married, Jack.

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,348
Casino work doesn't mix
with house and garden.

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,671
- Any questions?
- Yeah. What's the salary?

205
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,395
'The casino paid its staff
monthly in arrears.

206
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,109
'He would have to wait six weeks

'He needed money now.'

208
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,270
So, what kind of deal
are you looking for?.

209
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,396
What's the book price?

210
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,118
That's not relevant.

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,111
Old car like this.

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,112
Depends on the condition.

213
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,156
'The car was a gift
from Jack's father.

216
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,913
And this ain't exactly
what you call mint.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,831
How about 1500?

218
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,150
- How about 500?
- What?.

219
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,995
How about we split the difference?
750.

220
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,991
Is that your idea of arithmetic?.

221
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,038
I'm not a mathematician.
I'm in business.

Wow.

You really are a beautiful woman.

It's not just inner beauty, is it?.

Marion, let's face the truth.
Nobody is gonna publish it.

260
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,550
Of course they are.

261
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,710
You just have to be patient.

262
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,673
I'm betting on you.

263
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,193
I'm not much of a bet.

You're my prisoner.

267
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,510
I've got something to tell you.

268
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,830
- I wanna hear it.
- I've got a job.

(Sighs)

270
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,635
- What job?
- In a casino.

271
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,950
As a croupier. Dealer.

272
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,272
How did you land that?.

273
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,715
It came my way. 450 a week.

274
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,316
450?

275
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,472
What did you do? Walk in and
say, I want to be a croupier?.

276
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,869
- Don't you need training?
- I had training.

In the Republic.

278
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,991
You were a croupier there?

279
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,150
You never told me that.

280
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,549
I thought you just knew
some gamblers.

281
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,838
- I start Monday week.
- 450 a week?

282
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,150
I've never earned that in my life.

283

You're an enigma, you are.

284

'I'm not an enigma.
Just a contradiction.'

286

You've got a job.

Tell me.

290
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,033
There's no third thing.

291

Don't be superstitious.

292
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,518

are you in, then?

If the supervisor knew I saw
and didn't report it,

485
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,636
I'd lose my job
and I can't afford that.

486
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,790
Oh, so it's Mr Clean.

487
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,553
Wise up, Jack.
This whole business is bent.

488
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,870
The casino's nothing but legal theft

489
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,552
and that's OK - it's the system.

490
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,632
Half the punters who come here
are using stolen money.

491
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,075
Drugs money.
They haven't even earned it.

492
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,754
We earn our money.

493
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,479
I'm on your side, Jack.
I don't need an enemy.

494
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,516
You're talking about complicity.

495
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,750
I don't even know what that means.

496
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,354
I'm talking about
not rocking the boat.

497
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,192
'Matt was an escape artist.

498
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,118
'Like Jack's father.'

499
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,318
OK. Now, let's unwind.

500
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,759
Hey, Andros.

501
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,193
(Speaks Greek)

502
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,718
This is Jack.

503
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,358
- Hello.
- How you doing?

504
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,192
(Greek music)

505
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,316
- Blackjack.
- One blackjack and...

506
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,278
- Drink?
- Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.

507
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,952
Vodka straight coming up.

508
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,959
- Who are these guys?
- A few drug dealers.

509
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,918
Mostly people that work
in the casino business.

510
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,275
- And the girls?
- Just girls.

511
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,318
Blackjack. Vodka straight.

512
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,474
- Does Bella come here?
- The bitch? No.

513
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,959
(Man) Matt, you want in?

514
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,678
Yeah, why not?.

515
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,918
(Door creaks)

516
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,197
Jack, join us?

517
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,633
No thanks.

518
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,439
- I won't report you.
- I don't gamble.

519
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,234
You don't gamble. But do you smoke?

520
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,799
Sometimes.

521
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,912
How about now?

522
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,389
(Laughter)

523
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,910
- Same again, yeah?
- Coming up.

524
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,395
(Woman moaning)

525
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,199
'Marion, I'm on my way.'

526
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,672
All right, lads. Divvy up.

527
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,479
Listen, I'm gonna get off.
I need to sleep.

528
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,199
Loosen up. If you don't,
this job'll get to you.

529
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,111
Pressure's too much. Believe me.

530
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,351
- It'll break you.
- "The world breaks everyone.

531
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,477
"And afterwards many are strong
at the broken places."

532
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,316
Ernest Hemingway.

533
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,995
Wasn't he the one who shot himself?

534
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,953
(Church bell chimes)

535
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,869
Where have you been?

536
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,235
I've got to give evidence
in court at nine.

537
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,993
Don't play the policewoman
with me, Marion.

538
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,039
Take that back!

539
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,236
Fucking take that back!

540
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,639
Yeah, I take it back.

541
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,950
You're not in the police any more.

542
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,031
You're a store detective.

543
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,190
Are you drunk?

544
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,271
Probably.

545
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,237
This fucking job's getting to you.

546
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,515
You haven't written
a fucking word lately.

547
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,670
D'you have to swear all the time?

548
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,159
That's my poor upbringing.

549
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,118
I didn't go to private school.

550
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,156
I haven't got any class.

551
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,995
I wanna live with a writer.

552
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,672
Not a fucking croupier.

553
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,513
I don't even know
what the word means.

554
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,749
Croupier.

555
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,432
Marion, stop this.

556
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,795
What do I mean to you?

557
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,756
I want to know.

558
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,512
Tell me.

559
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,392
You're my conscience.

560
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,195
Haven't you got a conscience
of your own?

561
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,034
(Door slams)

562
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,351
Fuck. Shit!

563
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,558
(Siren)

564
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,354
No. It's not the one. Thank you.

565
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,678
Fancy a drink after work?

566
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,149
What are you doing here?
You know the rules.

567
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,710
- I don't finish till nine.
- Shit. I'm on at nine.

568
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,837
That's our life now, isn't it?.

569
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,589
(Phone)

570
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,109
(Man in distance)
# Show me the way to go home

571
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,273
# I'm tired
and I want to go to bed

572
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,794
# I had a little drink
about an hour ago... #

573
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,269
Thinking of going back?

574
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,759
Oh, my God. Hello.

575
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,196
You know what?.
I'd like to buy you a drink.

576
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,838
It's against the rules.

577
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,150
Dealers are forbidden
to talk to punters.

578
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,435
What are the odds
of you being seen with me?

579
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,876
Impossible to calculate.

580
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,996
It's a coincidence.

581
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,310
You know, there's a casino
in this hotel.

582
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,630
I'm not really much of a gambler.

583
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,551
I just like this bar.

584
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,076
- First visit to London?
- No.

585
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,912
I come every couple of years.

586
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,958
I always plan to stay, but...

587
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,758
I'm from Cape Town originally.

588
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,751
I was born in the Transkei.

589
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,274
- On the Wild Coast.
- Near the casino.

590
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,157
In the casino.

591
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,958
(Laughs)
There's a coincidence -

592
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,871
my father used to gamble there.

593
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,188
Your father?.

594
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,316
I loved the atmosphere.

595
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,675
But it destroyed my mother.

596
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,991
- The debts?
- And the lies.

597
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,435
Gamblers are born liars.

598
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,317
And superstitious.

599
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,039
It's like witchcraft.

600
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,076
That's Africa.

601
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,628
There's an African
in all of us, isn't there?

602
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,235
We all came from Africa supposedly.

603
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,390
Do you believe in astrology?

604
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,232
Absolutely not.

605
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,279
But then I'm a Gemini.
Geminis don't believe in astrology.

606
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,031
You know, you don't strike me
as a typical croupier.

607
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,430
Ah, I'm not married.

608
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,272
I just wear it to keep the flies off.

609
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,475
(Pager)

610
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,075
Look, I have to go.

611
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,718
Let me pay for this.

612
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,756
- Absolutely not.
- Toss you for it.

613
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,989
I don't gamble.

614
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,638
(Piano)

615
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,394
I know this is verboten,

616
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,268
but if you feel like a chat,
or maybe dinner,

617
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,873
give me a call.

618
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,439
I'll understand if you don't.

619
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,748
But I hope that you do.

620

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,199
(Groans)

649
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,358
(Loud music)

650
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,593
Jack!

651
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,908
Jack! Come on, leave him.

652
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,118
Jack, You don't want
the police here. Come on.

653
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,354
(Music stops)

654
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,632
(Bella) Jack!

655
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,878
He won't cheat again.

656
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,632
You're shaking.

657
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,950
It's nothing.

658
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,519
Just tension.

659
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,918
(Groans)

660
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,592
Fuck!

661
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,638
Oh, shit.

662
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,869
(Gasps)

663
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,353
It's funny, isn't it.

664
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,591
If that bloke hadn't come over,
you wouldn't be here now.

665
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,957
I hate cheats.

666
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,708
All men are cheats.

667
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,558
Are they?

668
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,717
Fools.

669
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,631
I spent a year on the game.

670
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,270
Don't worry. I'm clean as a whistle.

671
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,716
I only did S and M.
No blowjobs. No screwing.

672
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,469
Why did you stop?

673
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,915
Got scared.

674
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,798
Yeah. I can imagine.

675
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,108
Can you?

676
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,236
Anyway, I'm happy being a dealer now.

677
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,198
At least the punters keep
their hands to themselves,

678
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,872
even if the other dealers don't.

679
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,638
You called the casino a cesspit.

680
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,990
Well, it is.

681
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,514
But at least I know where I am.

682
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,160
I've been watching you work.

683
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,593
You're good.

684
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,671
Too fucking good for that place.

685
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,910
I despise the job.

686
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,070
If you hate it so much,
why d'you do it?.

687
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,958
Jack suddenly had the feeling
that he was transparent.

688
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,712
That Bella could see through him.

689
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,189
- You've got a guilty look.
- We broke the rules.

690
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,317
'He hadn't meant to say that.
She'd caught him unawares.'

691
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,118
You're different from the others.

692
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,749
'Careful. This liaison, forbidden in
the casino family, was incest.'

693
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,751
Not like Matt, you mean.

694
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,152
Now there's a real shit.
Don't get friendly with him.

695
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,073
D'you know what he said to me once?

696
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,073
"I wanna fuck the whole world
over. That's my mission."

697
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,276
Stupid little shit.

698
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,035
'Thank you, Bella.

699
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,672
'Jack could hear Matt saying it.

700
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,275
'"I want to
fuck the whole world over.

701
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,271
'"It's my mission."

702
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,112
'Eureka. Jack had struck gold.

703
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,909
'He'd found a protagonist
for his book.

704
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,991
'Little Matt.

705
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,069
'Chapter one.'

706
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,957
I look like shit.

707
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,998
- Rough day?
- Rough life, Jack.

708
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,476
- Hi. I'm Pat.
- Hello.

709
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,754
See you, boys.

710
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,400
- What happened to Bella?
- I'll tell you later.

711
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,472
Change.

712
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,915
5,000.

713
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,592
What has happened to Bella?

714
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,113
What's happened to Bella?

715
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,713
She's been re-assigned.

716
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,917
'Not re-assigned.
Just written out of the story.'

717
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,035
Good evening.

718
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,235
Hundreds.

719
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,511
Change. 1,000.

720
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,756
'This was no coincidence.'

721
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,272
15.

722
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,349
Too many.

723
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,438
20, 18, 19, 17...

724

725
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,996
'Did she think he'd bring her luck? '

726
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,078
Can I get anything for you?

727
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,755
14.

728
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,353
'Why had she come? '

729
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,589
Too many.

730
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,398
'Did she want him to help her win? '

731
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,552
11 double. 21.

732
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,029
18, 17, 17...

733
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,156
13, 20.

734
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,389
Change.

735
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,959
'He knew how to fix it for her.'

736
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,189
1,000.

737
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,271
'His father had taught him the trick.

'but Jack was wary of the punters.'

Goodnight.

'Thank you, she said.
For what, Jack thought.

'He ought to thank her.'

751

had just entered his book.'

757
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,953
Yeah.

758
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,715
- How's it going, Jacko?
- 'Fine. I took that job.'

759
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,995
Good. I was wondering
what was happening.

760
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,072
I tried to call you but
your line was disconnected.

761
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,833
Ah, yes. I moved house.

762
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,478
I needed a bigger place.

763
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,471
'How's that book of yours coming on? '

764
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,516
Yeah. I'm getting there.

765
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,239
'It's a good job you've got
the job to fall back on.'

766
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,437
Huh? Oh, there's
my other line. Ciao.

767
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,352
I don't like it.

768
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,875
Why not?.

769
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,679
I don't like it at all.

770
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,195
It had a wonderful character before.

771
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,874
The gambler was so romantic.

772
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,315
He was a loser.

773
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,515
This guy's a croupier.

774
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,795
He can't lose.

775
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,997
People have shat on him all his
life and now he's in control.

776
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,069
He's a winner.

777
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,799
Is that your idea of a winner?.

778
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,757
He couldn't give a shit about anyone.

779
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,354
- He uses people...
- It's because of the sex.

780
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,759
You don't like the sex.

781
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,150
I couldn't give a fuck about the sex.

782
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,151
Most men'll fuck a lamppost.

783
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,958
He's just a miserable zombie.

784
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,029
Is that the way you feel now?

785
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,680
Is that what's happened to you?

786
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,275
- Marion, it's a book.
- Really?

787
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,397
Then why is he called Jake?
Why don't you come clean

788
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,754
and call him Jack?

789
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,877
There's no hope in it.

790
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,396
It's the truth.

791
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,040
Without hope,
there's no point to anything.

792
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,112
What is so fucking hopeful
about your job?

793
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,158
Spending the day catching
poor people stealing?

794
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,549
You say the organised gangs
get away with it.

795
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,154
In the casino everyone
gets caught, rich or poor.

796
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,356
The odds are the same,
it's all relative.

797
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,317
Crap. It is not relative.

798
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,994
It's unfair. It's designed unfair.

799
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,719
Like your casino and your
croupier's a little shit

800
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,279
because he goes along with it.

801
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,952
Yeah, what about the lottery?

802
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,598
(Doorbell)

803
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,592
Look at this. You're like
all the other suckers out there.

804
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,274
14 million to one.
Is that your idea of hope?

805
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,032
- The door, Jack.
- Leave it.

806
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,758
No. Answer it.

807
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,112
Just called round to say
thanks for shopping me, Jack.

808
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,117
What are you talking about?.

809
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,431
Reynolds got a doctor in.
They forced me to do a dope test

810
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,192
which was positive, as you knew.

811
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,838
I don't know anything about it.

812
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,070
- Hiya.
- Hi.

813
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,879
Your boyfriend fucked me,
smoked my dope then shopped me.

814
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,157
What do you think about that?.
I can't get a job now.

815
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,470
You're no different from Matt.

816
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,074
Pair of vicious shits,
that's what you are.

817
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,310
Bella, I don't know
anything about this.

818
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,675
- All men are scumbags.
- I agree.

819
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,669
Well, go on. Go after her.

820
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,830
'He was Jack and he was Jake.

821
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,912
'And he had discovered
there was a price to pay

822
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,230
'for this double life of his.

823
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,675
'He had no idea where Marion
was staying or with whom.

824

'He realised he knew little
about her life, but then...

825
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,751
'he had never asked about it.

826
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,710
'For the first time in a long while,
Jack thought about his mother.

827
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,189
'She'd left when she couldn't
take it any more.

828

'His father had said, "Don't
worry, she'll come back."

'She didn't.

830
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,914
'But Marion wasn't his mother.'

831
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,395
He's paying out twenty-fives,
not tens.

832
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,119
I see that.

833
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,838
Little shit, Matt.

834
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,319
'Chapter three,

835
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,073
'his existence was forming
a pattern of betrayals.

'Sometimes he was unsure whether
he was betrayer or betrayed.'

837
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,631
- Thanks for the information.
- Pleasure.

838
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,790
Pity about Bella.

839
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,474
She was a real asset.

840
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,630
What could I do?

841
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,036
Sorry, Jack. No smoking in the nest.

842
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,314
(Phone)

843
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,236
Thank you, sir.

844
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,551
Fantastic. Just down here.

845
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,115
Jack?

846
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,792
(Laughs)

847
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,632
I thought it was you. It's the hair.

848
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,950
Listen, I'm working on
that soccer story.

849
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,395
Right. Look,
I must get back to Habib.

850
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,914
- Habib?
- My author.

851
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,276
He's a terrorist.
He's written a kill-and-tell book.

852
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,078
Take care.

853
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,957
That's 4.99, sir. Thank you.

854
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,750
Jack, next weekend
I'm having a house party.

855
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,437
Here. It's just near Oxford.

856
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,079
Why don't you come?

857
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,037
It'll just be social, no business.

858
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,953
Bring a friend,
I've got plenty of room.

859
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,476
- I'll try and make it.
- Good. Looking forward.

860
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,198
Right!

861
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,072
- Your change, sir.
- Thanks.

862
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,319
'Books piled like chips.

863

I don't know how you can drive

How'd you hurt your hand?

870
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,318
It was just an accident.
It's nothing.

871
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,595
Should be the next on the right.

872
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,397
Jani, there's something I want
to say before we get there.

873
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,040
I don't know what the sleeping
arrangements are.

874
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,032
Giles probably expects us
to share a room.

875

That's fine.

876

(Voices and laughter)

877
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:01,590
Look, it's no use pretending
it was an accident.

878
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,513
I had a fight with someone.
That's all.

879
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,238
She's a dab hand with
the racket, your friend.

880
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,516
South African women are very sporty.

881
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,033
So I see.

882
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,553
(Man) Nice serve.

883
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,119
(Woman) 40-15.

884
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,997
How did she get that shiner?.

885
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,309
I found her in bed with someone.

886
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,799
Who was he?

887
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,233
She.

888
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,155
I say, you're a dark horse, Jack.

889
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,753
(Man) Lovely shot. Game.

890
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,314
- Come on, Jack.
- I don't gamble.

891
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,675
Don't be a spoil-sport.
It's only a few quid.

892
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,149
It's nothing to do with money.
I don't gamble.

893
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,434
He doesn't gamble.

894
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,988
- I'll watch.
- Jack likes to watch.

895
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,469
Does he like to watch?

896
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,994
One more remark
and I'll break your balls.

897
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,789
I bet she could.

898
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,717
I'll deal, but I won't play.

899
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,037

Although...

906
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,955
I'll stick to bluffing.
That's what I'm best at.

907

- 'Stick.'
- Stick.

- One card.

- Three.

913

I'll start with a tenner.

914
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,678
I'll see your ten
and I'll raise you ten.

915
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,354
I'll see your 20
and raise you ten.

916
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,996
30, raise ten.

917
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,037
40. Raise you by 20.

918
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,317
I'll match that
and raise you a tenner.

I'm in.

920
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,030
Yes. That's it.
I haven't got any more cash.

921
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,479
Yeah.

See you.

924
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,911
A straight.

925
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,479
Beat that.

926
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,437
A flush.

927
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,919
Shit.

928
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,675
Not so fast, darling. Full house.

929
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,320
(Man) Hang on, chaps.
That's impossible.

930
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,514
How's about this for impossible?

931
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,318
Four of a kind.

932
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,719
(Laughter)

933
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,836
(Man) What's going on?
(Woman) No.

934
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,189
Straight flush.

935
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,316
What are the odds of this happening?

936
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,799
Thousands to one.

937
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,836
42,300,000 to one.

938
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,114
Approximately.

939
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,670
Could have won
if I'd been able to bluff.

940
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,751
I get it.

941
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,349
Get what?.

942
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,396
Are you accusing me of cheating?

943
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,913
Good, God. No.

944
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,389
With a skill like that,
why do you want a job?

945
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,436
You don't need to work.

seen that done before.

957
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,995
It can only work with amateurs.
A pro would have spotted it.

958
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,116
- I didn't.
- Then you're not a pro.

959
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,037
Goodnight.

Jack, I need your help.

962
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,355
I'm in a lot of trouble.

963
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,548
What kind of trouble?

964
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,279
I owe a lot of money.

965
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,590
Was that why you did that two grand?

966
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,478
- I couldn't help you.
- I know that.

967
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,357
But you can now.

968
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,476
I'm sorry. I don't have any money.

969
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,828
Some people I know.

970
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,992
They're planning
to rob the Golden Lion.

971
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,911
- You don't mean that.
- They mean it.

972
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,513
- Who's they?
- My creditors.

973
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,115
One night, around 3 am,
they'll come to the casino...

974
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,397
Forget it. It'll never work.

975
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,110
The point is,
they want a man inside.

976
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,918
I took you for a bright woman.

977
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,992
Just listen. You don't have
to do anything criminal.

978
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,992
- Robbery's not criminal?.
- You don't have to be criminal.

979
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,310
A guy'll deliberately
cheat at your table.

980
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,072
You'll see him, stop him.

981
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,630
The guy'll make a big scene
and that's when it'll happen.

982
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,399
You're serious.

983
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,072
You won't be committing a crime.

984
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,311
The man'll cheat, you'll just
be doing your job. That's all.

985
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,879
Shit.

986
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,599
And I thought you were
only after my body.

987
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,238
I've come to know you.

988
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,756
You're honest. I can trust you.

989
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,912
So what will you do
when it all goes wrong?

990
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,877
- It won't.
- If it does.

991
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,516
You'll keep the 10,000 pounds.

992
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,239
What 10,000 pounds?

993
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,075
These people will pay you
10,000 before

994
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,718
and 10,000 after.

995
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,514
They want someone
they can be sure of.

996
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,955
An honest dealer.

997
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,678
That's the point.

998
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,671
Not all dealers are honest.

999
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,677
Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.

1000
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,911
Reynolds. You've done your research.

1001
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,230
There was nothing else I could do.

1002
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,592
You're my last chance.

1003
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,552
Next time it'll be my neck.

1004
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,949
What about my neck?

1005
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,669
I want to go back to Cape Town.

1006
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,990
I want to start again. Clean.

1007
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,078
Can't do it, Jani.

1008
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,789
I'm asking you as a friend.

1009
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,677

the life of a friend.
