1
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,438
No!

2
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,441
No! Put him down!

3
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,441
No!

4
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,447
Mommy, mommy.

5
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,450
Mommy, mommy.

6
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,453
Listen to me!

7
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,461
Please. . . my baby!

8
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,481
Police. I'm police. . .

9
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,491
Mr. Dowd was pronounced dead
on arrival, Detroit Sinai.

10
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:51,496
Perforated cranial pan, projectile
fragmentation frontal lobe.

11
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,501
Now, the woman, Jenine Miller,
she subsequently lost the child.

12
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,505
Uterine damage,
hemorrhaging on admittance.

13
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,509
Infant died due to blood loss
suffered by the mother. . .

14
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:10,516
hospital records indicate acute
fetal trauma, gunshot wound.

15
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,517
This material was covered
some months ago.

16
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,519
Why is it being brought up again?

17
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,523
Have you had contact with
Miss Miller?

18
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,526
-I've spoken to her, yes.
-On what occasion did you speak. . .

19
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,529
with Miss Miller and
what prompted the conversation?

20
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,529
That's a personal. . .

21
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,534
Do you think, in retrospect, acting,
perhaps, less aggressively. . .

22
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,538
-this might have been prevented?
-What might have been prevented?

23
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,541
The infant's death.

24
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,611
That's very dangerous.
You know that?

25
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:51,616
-Hungry?
-Your foot. . . toe cheese.

26
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,619
-I'll bite it off.
-He's gonna wake up.

27
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,622
If the smell didn't wake him up
already, he's out.

28
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,625
-You like that smell.
-Yeah.

29
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,637
-So.
-So, what?

30
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,640
-So, how did it go?
-It went.

31
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,642
Yeah.

32
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,645
-What can I say?
-What did you say?

33
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,648
What do you think?
Ma'am, let me just, uh. . .

34
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,652
-Sorry. Your name again?
-Liz Detmer.

35
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,655
Right, Ms Detmer,
my duty assignment was solely. . .

36
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:34,659
undercover narcotic work. Do you
have any idea what that entails?

37
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,661
I have a general idea, yes.

38
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:41,666
OK. Well, then, Ms Detmer, you don't
know what you're talking about.

39
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,669
Expect to come out with this
''glad to be here'' bullshit.

40
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,672
-Head hung low, hat in hand.
-That's ridiculous.

41
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,675
Well, I'm not gonna forget.

42
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,677
It's all what they say.

43
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:57,682
Then I don't understand why, you
know, you went and talked to them.

44
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,682
Cause they asked.

45
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,685
Mr. Tellis, that's not necessary.

46
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,688
If you haven't seen what I've seen
or done what I've done. . .

47
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,690
you don't know where
I'm coming from.

48
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,693
I am not an officer of the law,
Mr. Tellis, and therefore. . .

49
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,696
I have no formal training, but
I would expect someone that. . .

50
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,699
did would, perhaps,
behave judiciously. . .

51
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,703
exercising discretion and restraint
in necessary quantities. . .

52
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,706
Jesus Christ, lady, look,
we can do this all God damned day.

53
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,709
You want to assess all this blame,
I'm gonna call you on it.

54
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,713
So what is this? I can make it very
simple. You want to talk, I'll talk.

55
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,717
I have no problem with that. But if
this becomes some half-ass ambush. . .

56
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,720
and you're putting me under
the lamp, I will walk. Now.

57
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,727
Are you familiar with
the Michael Calvess case?

58
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,727
Yes.

59
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,730
He was murdered.

60
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,732
Yes, I'm aware of that.

61
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,735
This investigation, which you may
or may not know. . .

62
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,737
has stretched over 60 days. . .

63
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,741
and failed to produce any
tangible or yield a single suspect.

64
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,745
It has not deterred or diminished
our efforts to apprehend and. . .

65
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,745
punish those responsible.

66
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,749
Throughout your undercover stint,
you maintained prolonged contact. . .

67
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,753
with the city's drug element. Would
that be an accurate statement?

68
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,756
-I had some relationships.
-Is it fair to say, given your. . .

69
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,760
rather abrupt discharge from the
ranks 1 8 months ago, that. . .

70
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,763
your cover in those contacts
might remain intact?

71
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,767
We feel that your presence in this
investigation would be invaluable. . .

72
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,770
and would warrant
complete reinstatement.

73
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,773
Homicide Division, detective grade.

74
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,777
When the suspects are caught and
charged and a verdict rendered. . .

75
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,780
you would be eligible for the
assignment of your choosing. . .

76
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,782
commensurate to sentencing.

77
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,789
No.

78
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,791
I'm sorry.

79
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,793
I'm not interested.

80
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,797
Bear in mind, Mr. Tellis,
if I may be so bold that. . .

81
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,800
career opportunities
in law enforcement. . .

82
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,804
What a waste
of time that was.

83
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,806
Tellis.

84
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,808
Captain Mitchell Cheevers.
Thanks for coming down.

85
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,808
Oh, sure.

86
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,811
Listen, I want to apologize
for in there.

87
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,813
They get paid to put
people on the spot.

88
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,815
-They made their money today.
-Hold on.

89
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,819
You gonna make me fucking chase
you, come on. Give me ten seconds.

90
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,821
Go ahead.

91
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,824
Calvess was a cop.

92
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,827
-Okay, he didn't deserve this.
-Nobody does.

93
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,831
Fine. Help me out. Come on, help me
catch these motherfuckers.

94
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,836
Just come down here. Just look at
the files would you? Help me out.

95
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,842
I think that's ten. Time's up.

96
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,846
For who? What the fuck else
are you gonna do?

97
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,848
They offering you something?

98
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,850
They asked me to look at some files.

99
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,852
Shit.

100
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,856
-I swear to God.
-Files? Why?

101
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,860
Cause they got a dead cop and
dead ends and they're reaching.

102
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,864
This welfare, pension bullshit
is not gonna cut it.

103
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,867
I know. You just do something
else then.

104
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,868
What?

105
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,871
-I do something else?
-Yeah.

106
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,871
Okay.

107
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,875
What would that be?

108
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,880
NARC

109
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,966
Hey, Sergeant, has Michael Calvess'
personal effects cleared yet?

110
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,968
Yeah!

111
00:11:45,438 --> 00:12:05,952
J. PATRIC
Enter

112
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,141
Lieutenant Oak, per departmental
mandate, is restricted. . .

113
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,146
from participating in the
Calvess investigation any further.

114
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:47,151
That's the log line and that's
the way it's been worded to me.

115
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:52,156
-Why is that?
-Well. He and Calvess were close.

116
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:56,160
He had been on collateral narcotic
investigations for over a year.

117
00:14:56,228 --> 00:15:01,165
He was the first in the tunnel
that day. He discovered the body.

118
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,169
I like him. I do. He's got a
93 percent conviction rate.

119
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,172
He's swinging a big stick.

120
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,176
He makes solid collars
that make solid cases.

121
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:17,181
But, between you and me,
he's not stable.

122
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,191
He's all that shit a cop just
cannot be. Not right now.

123
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,193
Not in this city.
Not in this department.

124
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,196
We're talking about a marked man.

125
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,202
I swear to fucking God I. . .

126
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,205
. . .for beating on your wife and
kids. You're fucking dead.

127
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,208
Get off me. Get the fuck off me!
Get off!

128
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,211
What the fuck. Go get this piece
of shit out of here.

129
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,214
I've been listening, Captain.
We can both sit here and say. . .

130
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,217
. . .or we can assume that he's
adhering to this department ban.

131
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,220
You're a smart guy.
You know that's bullshit.

132
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,222
-I would hope so.
-Yes, but, again. . .

133
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,224
it's only a matter of time
before I.A. D. . .

134
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,227
brings down an
indictment on him.

135
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,230
Listen, do yourself a
favor concerning Oak.

136
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,233
I would just blow out all
this bullshit code of conduct. . .

137
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:13,237
and ethics inquiry and hinge this
whole thing on his involvement.

138
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,240
No. Would that be up to and
including your own involvement?

139
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,242
I don't understand.

140
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,242
Nick. . .

141
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,247
if I go to bat for him, I'm gonna
have to do it contingent on you. . .

142
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,250
being his partner
for the duration.

143
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,253
-The duration of what?
-The duration of the investigation.

144
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,255
You asked me to read
some files, I did.

145
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,259
The tale of the tape is and this is
nothing you don't already know.

146
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,262
Is that your best shot at breaking
this is bringing him back on. . .

147
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,265
-go off the work he's already done.
-I don't want to waste more time.

148
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,267
Do you want on this
case roster, yes or no.

149
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,270
I'm not looking for an
active assignment.

150
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:52,277
I want a paycheck. This three-
quarters is not cutting this shit.

151
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,280
I don't wanna be with some guy
playing nine-ball on. . .

152
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,282
some perp's skull.

153
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,284
I'll tell you that.

154
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,288
I want a desk.

155
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,291
I need a desk.

156
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,297
Fine. Get me a conviction,
I'll get you a desk.

157
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,299
Like that?

158
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,302
Just like that.

159
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,335
I'm gonna get some coffee.

160
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,346
You must be somebody
something special.

161
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:07,351
-No, not really.
-No, not really?

162
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,354
Getting them to reassign me to a
case that I've been so resoundly. . .

163
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,358
removed from. You gotta admit
that takes some people to pull.

164
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,360
It's not what I did.
It's what you did.

165
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,362
The work you put in.

166
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,365
They know they're better off
with you than without you.

167
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,368
I'm just gonna say this, all right.
I don't know you. . .

168
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,371
so I refuse to fuck around
with you anymore than I have to.

169
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,374
Internal Affairs set you up
with this?

170
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,374
No.

171
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,378
No? Fringe ex-cop fallen out of
favor looking to get back. . .

172
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:38,382
behind a badge? They got files
three feet think on guys like you.

173
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,385
They bunted you on a reflex.

174
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,387
Probably. But I'm telling you
the truth.

175
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:47,391
You weren't approach or asked in any
way to keep tabs on me for I.A.?

176
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,391
No, I was not.

177
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,395
I don't blame you for asking.

178
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,398
You don't do what I did and
just waltz back in.

179
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,400
What does that tell you?

180
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:02,406
That tells me that this
investigation is running on fumes.

181
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,411
Don't get confused thinking that
this is about Calvess.

182
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,414
-I know it's not.
-This all politics.

183
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,417
This is a political appointment. It
is referendum. It's a squashing. . .

184
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,420
a race riot. You think those
assholes give a shit and a shake. . .

185
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,424
about Michael Calvess? They didn't
know him. They don't care about him.

186
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,427
And they can't forget
about him fast enough.

187
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,430
The only thing you need
to know about me. . .

188
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,433
that I'm gonna bag the
motherfuckers that killed Mike.

189
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,437
If that means breaking every point
of procedure then they're broke.

190
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:38,442
His life was worth a little bit more
than a wreath and a rifle salute.

191
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:43,447
Understand? That's just me.
What about you?

192
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,451
What about me?

193
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,455
Why are you coming back to this
shit? Cops die daily. They die bad.

194
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,458
What makes Mike the exception?

195
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,461
I don't know.

196
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,463
You don't know?

197
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,467
Just something to do?

198
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,471
Something.

199
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,513
I know what time it is,
but you can still give me a kiss.

200
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,521
Audrey, I don't want to get into
this with you right now.

201
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,525
I just wanna go to sleep. I just
want to lay down next to you. . .

202
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,528
and go right to sleep. You want
to kick my ass all over. . .

203
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:11,525
in the morning that's. . .
that's fine, but I just wanna. . .

204
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,537
I'm fucking beat, man.

205
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,586
Hi, did you ever
see these guys.

206
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,589
Jimmy Fredericks. It was his
street name. He'd be dirty. . .

207
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,592
Wait. What are you jumping up and
down for? What's the matter?

208
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,595
-Cold man.
-Shut up! Hey! Is it tougher?

209
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,598
Speak English will you?
You're in America, speak English.

210
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,601
You remember a guy
named Jimmy Springs?

211
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:29,613
You seen this guy? Street name
was Jimmy Fredericks.

212
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,615
A guy named Jimmy Fredericks.

213
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,617
What's his street name?

214
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,621
That's his name. Jimmy Fredericks.
Sometimes go by Calvess, no?

215
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,623
-Nothing?
-Nothing.

216
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,625
Sure about that?

217
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,633
I wanna ask you about a cat named
Jimmy Fredericks used to hang. . .

218
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,633
around here.

219
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,637
I don't know that guy.

220
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,643
I want to ask you a question about a
guy. A guy named Jimmy Fredericks.

221
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,643
No, I don't remember him. No.

222
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,646
-No.
-You're sure?

223
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,649
-Never seen him around here before.
-No.

224
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,652
Ask you a couple of questions.

225
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,655
A guy named Jimmy Fredericks.

226
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:16,660
Are you hurt right now? Listen
to me. Jimmy Fredericks.

227
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,663
Never seen him.
Never seen this guy.

228
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,675
Know a guy named Calvess?

229
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,707
Accuses her of sleeping around.
She denies it.

230
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:09,714
He grabs an aerosol can and some
matches and lights her head up.

231
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,716
So he mentions this Jimmy Fredericks
and Cheevers told us to route. . .

232
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,718
-this through you.
-And what's he saying.

233
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,720
He claims he used to snitch
for him. Says he'll trade. . .

234
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,722
what he has to say for some
type of sentence reduction.

235
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,724
We can't do that.
We're not gonna do that.

236
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,726
Well, we got him cuffed up there.
But he's got no pants on.

237
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,730
Tried to get a pair on him,
but the guy's fucking beserk.

238
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,734
All right. What's her name?

239
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,736
-Louisa. . .
-What?

240
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,738
Louisa Nunez. That's all
we could get out of her.

241
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,740
-They married?
-Who knows?

242
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,743
Look what he fucking did to me!

243
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,747
Let go of me! Let go! Octavio,
you're fucking dead !

244
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:48,752
I hate you ! Fuck! Let go of me!
Let the fuck go of me!

245
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,754
Right there to the left.

246
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,758
Have fun.

247
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,767
Señor, itchy cock.

248
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,770
Why you saying, man? What that?

249
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,773
Looks like you got yourself
a bad situation here.

250
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,775
What's your name, Octavio?
That's it?

251
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,778
Go and firebug on your old lady's
wig. What's all this drug stuff.

252
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,780
Did you see what she did
to my fucking Jimmy?

253
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,782
What that puta bitch
did to my shit.

254
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,785
She out there tossing her nasty
snatch on the curb.

255
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,787
She come back here, poison pussy.

256
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,789
Now I can't hardly
even walk around.

257
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,792
I can't have no fabrics on,
nothing.

258
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,794
Look at it. Check it out.
Check it out.

259
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,797
Okay, Hoss, let's just holster
that up, okay?

260
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,799
Never seen no shit like that.

261
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,801
Black and blue.

262
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,803
I can't wear no drawers or shit.

263
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,806
I go to take a piss, piss don't
even want to come out.

264
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,810
She fucking set fire to my dick,
I'll burn her head down.

265
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,813
Great. You want to talk
to us about a Michael Calvess?

266
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,813
Who?

267
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,817
Michael Calvess. You used to
snitch for Michael Calvess. . .

268
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,820
his street name was Jimmy
Fredericks. What can you tell us?

269
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,824
-Yeah, yeah, him. He dead, right?
-That's right. He was killed.

270
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,828
Yeah, I seen that on TV, too.
Yo, could I get a quick hit?

271
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,832
What did you say?

272
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,834
My cock is killing me, man.

273
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,838
Let me get a quick hit.
A quick hit! I'll talk to you.

274
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:15,838
What?

275
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,841
I'll talk to you.

276
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,845
It's almost impossible you're
this dumb. You're serious.

277
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,847
Yeah, just a quick one.

278
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,852
Please, bro.

279
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,858
Fucking junkies.

280
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,864
Who got a light. I used my
last match on that bitch.

281
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,868
Yo, man, I know my ass is
going to jail.

282
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,871
I ain't got no paper to post bail.
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

283
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,873
What it gonna matter,
I hit this real quick.

284
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,876
It ain't gonna take time
or no shit like that, right?

285
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,879
I'll hit this and I'll talk
to you, guys. Come on.

286
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,883
Yo, my nerves, they're
all like jingle jangle. Fuck!

287
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,885
You're gonna tell us everything?

288
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,887
-You sure?
-Yeah.

289
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,889
Don't fuck with us.

290
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,912
Shit is fucking heaven dog.

291
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,916
All right, enough. We took care of
you. Now talk to us about Calvess.

292
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,919
And knock that shit off, or else
I'm gonna turn a hose on you.

293
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,921
-It hurts.
-Stop picking at it then!

294
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,925
Now, Calvess, go! Talk to me.

295
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,928
I seen him over in Belle Isle
a few months back.

296
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,932
-He be friend with my boy Leo Lee.
-You know Leo Lee?

297
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,934
Yeah, you know him and shit?

298
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,938
Leonard Leflore is a punk. Narc used
to run raids on his ass every. . .

299
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,940
other day. So what
were they arguing about?

300
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,944
Some shit. Lee pinched on a buy.
That dude Clavess got a bad temper.

301
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,948
Hey! Listen to me. Nobody gives a
shit what you think you saw.

302
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,950
-Just tell us what happened.
-I'm telling you.

303
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,952
I saw him spit on him.

304
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,955
I saw him walk away talking about
nigger this, nigger that.

305
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,957
-Calvess?
-Yeah, man.

306
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,959
-Don't be fucking with me.
-I'm not.

307
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,961
This shit ain't talking
too loud is it?

308
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,964
Yo, I swear that I saw him, man.
They like scrapping and shit.

309
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,967
They like argue.

310
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,970
So. You could use that, man?

311
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,974
Fucking asshole, look what
you fucking did to me!

312
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,978
Right bitch! And I'll burn you !
Fuck you. I hate you.

313
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:40,985
Crotch rot, pussy stink. Fuck you !
Puta susia.

314
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:50,995
-I love you, baby. Fuck! I love you !
-Fuck you !

315
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,929
-That's a good woman.
-What do you know about Leflore?

316
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,999
Cause his name doesn't
do anything for me.

317
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,002
There's no mention of him in
any of Mike's duty summaries.

318
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,002
There's no FI card on him.

319
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,007
He's a nickel-bagger. Ran across
him maybe half a dozen times.

320
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,009
He's got two whole hobbies,
ganja and guns.

321
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,011
Other than that,
he's a fucking bore.

322
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,014
But I guarantee he's got
outstanding warrants.

323
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,016
You want to run him?

324
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,027
Lay down on the floor,
this is the police!

325
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,065
Sorry to make you. . . I couldn't
get to Gabe's birthday party.

326
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,067
It just. . .
I just had a lot of stuff.

327
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,069
Don't worry about it.
We didn't miss you.

328
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,071
Thanks for the present anyway.

329
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,074
Nick Tellis this is a good
friend, Art Harlan.

330
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,076
He works with the coroner's office.

331
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,079
So I hear your name on the call
and this I have to see.

332
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,082
-What did you do, drown him?
-This might have to do with Mike.

333
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,084
Calvess? I thought they were
closing it out.

334
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,084
Not yet.

335
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:26,089
Okay, thanks guys.
This is good. Rub-a-dub-dub.

336
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,094
Oh, he's been here for awhile.

337
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,096
How long do you think?

338
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:37,100
I'm guessing he's sitting in this,
two, three weeks.

339
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,100
That long?

340
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,103
Oh, yeah, he's ripe.

341
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:47,110
Okay, subject has distended bloat,
upper-lower torso. . .

342
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:52,115
clotting and hematomic
discoloration.

343
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,119
Hello.

344
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,121
What is it?

345
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,125
Tooth.

346
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,127
Back molar.

347
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,129
Blasted it right out of his head.

348
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,132
Most of his mandible is shaterred
along with the rest of. . .

349
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,137
the dental palette, so IDing him
outright will be a little tricky.

350
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,137
Sorry.

351
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,140
What have you got there?

352
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:23,146
Looks like a Mossberg SG 6-shot.
Don't know how he got this.

353
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,148
What? Why?

354
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:29,152
Cause it's tactical issue,
Metro PD. SWAT team uses it.

355
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,154
It looks like the serial
number's been filed down.

356
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,156
Let me see that.

357
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,163
It looks like our man
opted out with it.

358
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,166
No question about that.

359
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,167
Oh, damn!

360
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,170
I don't know about that.

361
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,172
Not on purpose.

362
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,174
Why, what do you mean?

363
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,177
There's no firing pin mark
on the casing.

364
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,181
Boy never even pulled the trigger.

365
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,184
So what do you think happened?

366
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:05,188
I'm stretching here, but,
knowing old Leo. . .

367
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,192
I think maybe he was high out
of his fucking mind.

368
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,196
Reaches for the bong,
goes down, breaks.

369
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,199
His lazy ass is not getting out
of this warm water, so. . .

370
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:20,203
he sees the gauge, maybe,
and takes a little green bud. . .

371
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,206
decides to pop it
in the breech. . .

372
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,208
fires it up, starts
toking away. . .

373
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:29,212
forgets there's a shell in the
pipe. Flame hits the firing cap. . .

374
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:37,220
That's beautiful. Bubble bath, ear
full of tunes, smoking hubba. . .

375
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:41,224
and this is how
the evening ends. Art.

376
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,227
That's fucking fantastic.

377
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,230
It still doesn't explain the
Mossberg. How did he get that?

378
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,234
Well, if it is tactical ordinance,
it could be an underground buy.

379
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,237
I mean, the armory has been
broken into a few times.

380
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,241
Yeah, it could be. Or he could
have known a cop.

381
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,243
Somebody who knew a cop.

382
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,246
What do you want to do about this?

383
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,250
Nothing. Just let Art finish up,
recovery sweep through. . .

384
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,253
if they find something good, if they
get a stolen weapons hit, great.

385
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,255
We came here to corroborate
Ruiz' story. . .

386
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,259
which we obviously can't do. All
right. It was all bullshit anyway.

387
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,262
-Hey, Art, I'll talk to you later.
-Okie-doke.

388
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,266
I hear bubbles.

389
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,268
I hear bubbles.

390
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:32,275
What are you guys doing? We had a
deal I thought, you and me there.

391
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:36,279
So you want to talk about this now
or do you want to wait or what?

392
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,279
I don't know.

393
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,282
Oh my God, what could we have
to talk about?

394
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,285
You know what, I can't believe
that you're out there again.

395
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,288
And don't say that you're not or
give me any of that crap.

396
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,291
What are you talking about? There's
hours involved. Sorry. There are.

397
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:52,295
-What do you want me to tell you?
-Tell me who uttered that famous. . .

398
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,298
''this job will either burn you out
or bury you.'' Remember saying that?

399
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,300
Yeah, it's Narcotics, Audrey.
Fucking. . .

400
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:02,305
I'm just curious, how bad that
you think that is was, huh?

401
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,310
Tell me what you remember cause
I'll tell you what I remember.

402
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,313
Five months pregnant, being in
a detox tank with you.

403
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,315
-Where is this coming from?
-Not sleeping.

404
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,319
And watching you climb the walls.
You remember that?

405
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,322
I'm a little late for bath time?
Well, excuse me. . .

406
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,325
I've been giving one
every day for seven months.

407
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,328
It's no big thing, like you can jump
in and then jump out again.

408
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,331
It is a big thing, all right?
A fucking big thing.

409
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,334
-It's two weeks work.
-That's bullshit. That is. . .

410
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,337
That is bullshit. That's all you
want me to think that it is.

411
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,340
The other day I asked
why you wanted to do this. . .

412
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,343
you said that you didn't
know. Well, I got news for you. . .

413
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,347
you need to know and you need to
let me know, cause for the life. . .

414
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,351
of me I'm looking at you, holding
your son and I can't understand you.

415
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,353
You understand?

416
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,357
I can't understand why you'd ever
feel the need to go back to that.

417
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,359
Yeah, what if it was me who got
wasted out there, Audrey?

418
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,361
-That wasn't you.
-What if it was.

419
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,363
-That wasn't you.
-What if it was?

420
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,369
There are other people aside
from you, okay.

421
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,372
-You're a little. . .
-You know, I got the feeling. . .

422
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,375
This kid beaten half-dead. I could
have walked away. Anyone could've. . .

423
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,379
Instead. . . I took a gun and I blew
half his head off, okay?

424
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:22,386
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

425
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,403
You were right about the Mossberg.

426
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,407
Definitely, it's one of ours. Lab
pulled partial prints off of it.

427
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,410
One set belonged to Leflore, the
other belonged to Latroy Steeds.

428
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,414
They say he's got a bunch of drug
shit. Did 30 days in Wayne County.

429
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,417
-Got out a week ago.
-Do we know where he's at?

430
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:59,422
S-T-E-E-D-S. Larry, you're his
parole officer. He hasn't. . .

431
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,426
-Not once?
-We need an answer about that.

432
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,428
All right, let me know
if he shows, okay?

433
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,430
He hasn't checked in once.
Here, go on.

434
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:13,437
Let's sit on the house, see if
he shows up. Come on, go, go, go.

435
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,480
How long have you been
married, Nick?

436
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,482
Uh, about a year and a half.

437
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,484
Got any kids?

438
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:06,489
Yeah, one, I got a boy, big baby
boy. Almost ten months.

439
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,489
That's nice.

440
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,495
How long you been with your wife?

441
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:19,503
I lost her. We were married
just shy of sixteen years.

442
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,506
She had cancer.

443
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,512
-I didn't know. I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

444
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,517
We were talking wives.
You have one, I had one.

445
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:41,525
I been asked before. Be easier on
people if I took my ring off, but. . .

446
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:49,532
And avoid these embarrassing
little moments, but it's okay.

447
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,535
I like talking about her.

448
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,544
First detail I had was, was Vice.

449
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,548
I wanted Robbery-Homicide,
but I caught Vice.

450
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:10,553
-I worked Vice.
-I hated it. Just hated it.

451
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:16,560
I rode it to the seams hoping to
leapfrog out of there, but, no good.

452
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,561
No dice.

453
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,567
I'd come home just in bad shape.

454
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,569
Pissed off.

455
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:33,577
That's when I first started getting
an ulcer. Just miserable.

456
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:41,584
I'd lie down in her lap.
She'd rub my head.

457
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,589
Some nights, she'd sing me
to sleep.

458
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:51,594
I'd just lie there, staring at her.

459
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,603
It's still the best place
I've ever been.

460
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,616
Tell you this much. I became a much
better cop the day she died.

461
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:19,623
Any half-step, any hesitation
I had about the job was gone.

462
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,626
I'd see a dead-bolted door, I'd
break it down and be the first. . .

463
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,628
one in the room.

464
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:33,637
I started working joint task force,
the head cracking, wrecking crew.

465
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,639
Zombie squad.

466
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:42,645
It was a diversion. It was to just
keep from thinking about her.

467
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,661
I remember one night. . .

468
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,667
I went with the sheriffs
on a warrant raid.

469
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:10,674
This dipshit was selling meth
out of his apartment.

470
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:17,670
It was just a stop and pop. Broke
down the door. Rousted the guy.

471
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,685
I was in one of the back rooms
looking for junk.

472
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,689
And I hear something.

473
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:36,700
Turn around and see these, these
eyes staring at me from a closet.

474
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:46,710
It was a little girl.
A little ten-year-old girl, naked.

475
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,714
Shaking like a leaf,
she was scared to death.

476
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,720
Her stepfather was temping her
out for rent.

477
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:06,729
Wrapped her in my coat,
carried her out to the squad car.

478
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:12,736
I went back and I beat
that motherfucker half dead.

479
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:27,740
I thought of my wife. I thought of
the baby we never had.

480
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,755
All the things about her
that I hung on to.

481
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,759
This little girl being brutalized.

482
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:42,766
A girl being abused has got nothing
to do with rules and regulations.

483
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,769
And everything to do
with right and wrong.

484
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,775
It's the same thing with Calvess.

485
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,861
-Who is the Cookie Monster?
-He loves cookies.

486
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,865
Cause every time in the morning,
I want cookies for dessert.

487
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,868
-Gone, no cookies left.
-No?

488
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,870
-None.
-Cause he eats them all.

489
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,874
He eats cookies for breakfast,
he eats cookies for dinner. . .

490
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:38,871
he eats cookies for lunch,
he eats cookies for anything.

491
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,884
This one won't let me out
of her sight.

492
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:46,889
She drags her dad's t-shirt around
with her wherever she goes.

493
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,894
Can you say hi to the man?

494
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,898
Shy.

495
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,902
She's a little doll, though.

496
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,907
I want to thank you, Kathryn,
for letting me come by.

497
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:10,914
Oh, it was not a problem.
Thank you for bringing his things.

498
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,916
I wasn't too thrilled about going
through them, but I'm glad. . .

499
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,919
you brought them.

500
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:25,928
I haven't seen some of these
pictures for a long time.

501
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,934
You have to forgive me, cause I'm
convinced that anyway I go about. . .

502
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,938
-this is the wrong way, so. . .
-No, please.

503
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:41,945
I don't mind answering questions.
Did you know Mike?

504
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:47,951
No, I didn't. I never got the
chance to meet him. I wish I had.

505
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,953
I know his reputation, though.

506
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:59,952
But what I need to know more of,
I think, what I'm lacking.

507
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:08,971
I worked undercover narcotics for
2 and a half years myself so. . .

508
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,975
I know that life can be very
difficult. I know that it can be. . .

509
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:19,972
very problematic,
especially with a. . . family.

510
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,987
You know, maybe I. . .
Maybe not.

511
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:32,996
Baby you go check on your sister
for mommy? Put your things here.

512
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:42,004
What are you asking me now?

513
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:49,011
Well, I know it's personal.

514
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,019
But did things at work
adversely affect things here?

515
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,021
-Here at home.
-No.

516
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,028
Did he tell you what it was
that he was doing?

517
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:11,033
-Yes.
-Did that seem to bother him?

518
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:17,039
-Did it bother you?
-Yes, it did.

519
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,046
Well, there you have it.

520
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,055
You notice anything about his mood
in the weeks before?

521
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:37,059
Anything strange
about his behavior?

522
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,067
-No.
-Did he mention any names?

523
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:51,074
Maybe there was some people that
he was dealing with that came out.

524
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,078
No.

525
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:03,085
I remember the day that
Mike was killed.

526
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:08,090
I was putting the girls to bed,
and I heard a knock.

527
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:16,098
And when I opened the door. . .

528
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,102
Henry was standing there
with tears in his eyes.

529
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,113
And I knew right away
that he was gone.

530
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:40,122
And I remember running back
to the girls' room. . .

531
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:45,127
And sitting on the edge of
their bed and just. . .

532
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,132
Staring at them.

533
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,137
I needed to see his face.

534
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:15,157
Hi. Hi, come here you.
How are you?

535
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,160
Give me a kiss. Where's my kiss?

536
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:25,167
I have someone here. He's been
asking me questions about Mike.

537
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,169
What?

538
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:33,175
I need to talk to you
outside right now.

539
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,180
I'll be right back okay?

540
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,191
What are you doing talking
to her without me being here?

541
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,195
-I brought her husband's things over.
-You questioned her. What for?

542
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,197
Is this mother-may-I?

543
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:59,201
And some of this doesn't extend to
her. And don't get cute with me.

544
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,203
If you need to know what she said
about anything case-related. . .

545
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,206
-you refer to the file.
-I looked at them. They're thin.

546
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,209
What you don't do is talk to her
without notifying me in advance.

547
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,212
-That's not the way we do things.
-Why is that? What's the problem?

548
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,216
The problem is every question you
asked her, she's already answered.

549
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,219
She's been badgered and bothered
by cops and cop questions. . .

550
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:24,216
for two months now, and the biggest
problem is her husband is dead.

551
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,226
-You understand?
-I understand that.

552
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:29,231
Great.
Don't let it happen again.

553
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,249
INFORMATI ON RESTRI CTED SECURED
NO ACCESS GRANTED.

554
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,349
HERO IN

555
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:10,392
It's a burn back; it's like table
scrap junk that they stew. . .

556
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,396
in a free base and then shoot. That
killed this guy I told you about.

557
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:18,400
I think he tried to sell the same
shit to Calvess. Yeah?

558
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,403
-<i>Tellis, this is mace in records.</i>
-Hey, what's going on?

559
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,406
<i>I got this stuff. You're looking</i>
<i>for maps or hits?</i>

560
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,409
-No. How many hits?
-<i>I got 4 and they're vague.</i>

561
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,412
-<i>You got something to write with?</i>
-Yep, go.

562
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,419
<i>All right. R. Evans, R. Moseley.</i>
<i>G. G. Parks...</i>

563
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:41,423
<i>E. Schepps, the last one,</i>
<i>he got brought in ten months ago.</i>

564
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:46,428
-I got that. You got an address?
-<i>Yeah. Maps for the last guy?</i>

565
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,432
<i>4</i>-<i>4</i>-<i>3 Gratchit. Unit 2, I don't</i>
<i>know how good it is...</i>

566
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,437
-<i>but that's last address we got.</i>
-That's good. I appreciate it.

567
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:59,441
They ran the comp through and about
ten months ago an overdose was. . .

568
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:03,445
brought into the ER, and this guy,
Schepps. Wait a minute.

569
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:10,442
Eugene Schepps, Jesus Christ, I know
Eugene Schepps. I know this guy.

570
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,467
You left the door unlocked.
You shouldn't. Anyone. . .

571
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,469
What the fuck y'all doing
in my house, man?

572
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,471
No need to get up. We just. . .

573
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,484
-Hey, how's that?
-My fucking eyes, man.

574
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,486
There you go.

575
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,490
A spicy little. . .

576
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:52,494
How are you, my man? Let me see.
Take a fucking seat.

577
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,496
How you been, Deacon, good?

578
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:59,501
Jesus, do you still smoke the weed,
Deacon. You still sniffing glue.

579
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,504
Isn't this shit dated, dog? Fucked
with a bottle model glue a. . .

580
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,507
few years and sealed your sinuses
shut. You had to have them drilled.

581
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,510
Do you remember that, back in the
day. When you were still sucking. . .

582
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:13,515
back cans of hair spray? How're you
making your paper these days.

583
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,519
Six months old. Tighten auto. You
still stealing cars and. . .

584
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:21,523
-cutting them up or what, boss.
-Now I know your snitching, man.

585
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:25,527
You're that motherfucker, Grimmy,
Dirty Ed or some shit.

586
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,529
-Wrong answer.
-Fuck that, I seen you man.

587
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,532
You were that motherfucker hanging
around with Endo Joe and shit.

588
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,534
That's right. You know what
happened to him, right?

589
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,536
-He up in Jackson, man.
-No, no, no, he was.

590
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,540
See, he's dead now and he died
talking shit to some Aryans. . .

591
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:42,544
so they peeled him back and they
shanked his bitch ass 56 times.

592
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,547
We got a lot of pals like that,
don't we, huh?

593
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:50,552
I have to ask you about another dead
junky, named Dowd. You know him?

594
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,556
No? No? Are listening to me?

595
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,558
-Yeah, man.
-No?

596
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,561
You see, I do.
I know Dowd and I know Endo Joe.

597
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,564
I know what happened to that little
punk you used roll with, Jay-reed.

598
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,567
I know your daddy nicknamed you
Deacon, after Deacon Jones, cause

599
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:10,572
he had a little thing with him.
You know why I know that don't you?

600
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,576
-How, man?
-Cause I was and I still am a cop.

601
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,579
A fucking cop. You trying to tell
me you a fucking cop?

602
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,581
If you a cop, why you ain't
busting me back then?

603
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,583
Cause you're way to little
to bust, acorn.

604
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:26,588
Fuck. You're forgetting that I
used to smoke blunts with you.

605
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,591
I don't give a shit what you think.
Doesn't matter to me in the least. . .

606
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,594
but I'm about to tell you what does
matter and you're about to listen. . .

607
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:35,597
-like your life depended on it.
-What the fuck, man?

608
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,600
A month ago, an undercover
officer was murdered.

609
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,603
Pedestrian tunnel off of
Houston and West Grand.

610
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,606
They beat him up; put a gun to his
head and put a bullet through it.

611
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,608
I don't want hear any shit about
what you don't know or. . .

612
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,611
what you didn't do, because we both
know you ain't got the nut sack. . .

613
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,615
for something that size. So I'm
positive you didn't kill him.

614
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,618
His name was Michael Calvess.
Take a gander at that buddy.

615
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,618
Now hold on a minute, man.

616
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,622
Ya'll motherfuckers come up in
my fucking crib and shit.

617
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,626
Wanna throw hot sauce and blind my
ass and now you want me to help you?

618
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,629
Street name, Jimmy Fredericks.
I know you know him.

619
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,632
Oh, my bet, my bet.
I know this motherfucker.

620
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,635
I think I might have let him
suck on my dick once or twice.

621
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,639
Come here! You wanna be bounced
back to County, keep it up!

622
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,641
I'll have you wearing half shirts
and halter tops. . .

623
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,644
braiding some nigger's hair.
Piece of shit.

624
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,646
Oh, fuck man. Don't beat a man.

625
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,649
You gonna act like a punk,
you're gonna played like one.

626
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,652
Listen, very, very carefully. They
found smack at the murder scene.

627
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,656
A mean fucking mix. Now you took
some of this exact same stuff. . .

628
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,658
about ten months and it nearly
killed your dumb ass.

629
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,661
You don't the chemistry or
the sense God gave goats. . .

630
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:44,666
which means you didn't do the cook.
Now Dowd is dead, who sold to you?

631
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:48,670
-Whatever man.
-You gonna tell us? No?

632
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,674
You're a real fucking smart ass,
you know that?

633
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,678
We're tossing every inch of
this place. Every inch!

634
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,682
What are you doing, man?
What's going on, man?

635
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,684
Where is it?

636
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:08,690
Oh God. This must be one of those
new refrigerator safes that lock. . .

637
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:13,695
you dumb fucks. What's all this,
huh? What's all this, huh?

638
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,699
Oh, bagels and guns.
What do you know?

639
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,707
Come on, man, fuck all
this shit, man!

640
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:33,715
You're unbelievably so fucking
dumb. Are you kidding me?

641
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:39,722
This is the last time I'm gonna ask
you, who sold you? Who sold you?

642
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,723
It was fucking Darnell, man.

643
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,727
He's gotta shield.

644
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,748
You all right?

645
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,751
Let me see. Where are you hit
in the neck?

646
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,757
Let's see. Let me call it in.
I'll call the paramedics.

647
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,760
Hang in there. I'll be right back.

648
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:10,811
He didn't do it.

649
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,815
I don't know if you're not listening
or you don't want to listen. . .

650
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,815
but he didn't do it.

651
01:24:58,529 --> 00:59:17,887
[ Skipped item nr. 651 ]

652
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,823
What does that mean?
What evidence? What?

653
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,825
That means we're closing it out.

654
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,828
There's absolutely no way
that Shepps killed Calvess.

655
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,830
Now if you're closing because
of that, you're way off.

656
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:29,830
Neither one of us believe
that he did it.

657
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,834
He hadn't the balls to do this.
He didn't have the capabilities.

658
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,837
He didn't have the cold blood.
This guy did not do it.

659
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,840
And yet he had no compunction when
faced with possible arrest. . .

660
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,842
about trying to kill
both of you.

661
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,844
This is someone of questionable
mental stability with a pronounced. .

662
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:43,844
history of drug use.

663
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,849
That you can pin motive on. That
can ride the rap after the fact. . .

664
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,852
cause this is what you're gonna do
lieu of. You all are jazzed up. . .

665
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,854
because this piece of shit that we
killed Shepps, was white.

666
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,858
So the racial card gets cooled and
you can forget about the dead cop.

667
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,861
-That's what this is all about.
-Henry ease off, all right.

668
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:03,865
We initiated and backed this effort
from the very beginning.

669
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,868
But factually irrefutable is the
following. You have a known criminal

670
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,871
with over 40 felony and misdemeanor
offenses, with a drug tie linking. . .

671
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,874
him directly to Calvess and
possession of stolen weapons. . .

672
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:17,879
narcotics, and identification
belonging to another slain officer.

673
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,881
Richard Tekulve was stabbed
to death three years ago.

674
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,884
And homicide got a confession
and conviction out of that. . .

675
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,886
so that's irrelevant. What are you
fucking bringing that into it for?

676
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,889
It still denotes illicit
criminal activity.

677
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,892
Shepps came into possession of
the ID as either a result of. . .

678
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,894
or anticipation in murder
or through. . .

679
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,898
This guy was a 105 pounds
soaking wet.

680
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,901
These injuries that Calvess
sustained, they only could have. . .

681
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,904
come from two men of considerably
more size and strength.

682
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,908
That's not even taking into account.
Christ, there's no murder weapon.

683
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,911
What are we talking about here?

684
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,914
This matter is no longer mine.

685
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,916
You're serious?

686
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,919
It's the District Attorney's office;
it's the Commissioner of Police.

687
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,923
-That is so fucked up.
-Yes, it is fucked up.

688
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,926
This is so fucked up.

689
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,928
Are we done?

690
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,934
You're so wrong, pal.
It's a bullshit.

691
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,937
I'm sorry, Nick.

692
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,961
I want you to stop now.

693
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,964
This is done.

694
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,968
It's not.

695
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,975
You know what, it has to be.

696
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:59,981
You know I wasn't happy
and that was fine.

697
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,984
But this is where I hit the wall.

698
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,986
Cause I've seen you
like this before.

699
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:09,991
I was willing to put myself through
it, but I can't do it anymore.

700
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:15,998
We didn't get them. We didn't
get the guys that did it.

701
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,999
We fucking. . .

702
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,001
. . .didn't do it. . .

703
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:26,008
cause we. . . I lost him.
I lost him.

704
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:30,011
You know, you're running at this
for all the wrong reasons.

705
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,014
What, you think catching him is
gonna make you less like them.

706
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:37,018
Purified, just like Calvess. You
know what, that's bullshit, Nick.

707
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:41,022
Cause that's not what he was.
That's not what you are.

708
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,036
I love you. I do.

709
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:05,047
With everything that I am.
But I'm still gonna leave.

710
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:10,051
Cause I can't be with
you like this.

711
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,054
I'm not trying.

712
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,058
I'm done trying.

713
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,186
Look at this.

714
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,189
-Where did you get a warrant?
-Friends where friends count.

715
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,192
I run that name that Deacon gave us,
Darnell. This is what came back.

716
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,195
Darnell Berry, Big-D Love,
possession, trafficking.

717
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,197
His last arrest was pulling a gun
on an officer.

718
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,199
Look who he was booked with.

719
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,202
Eugene Deacon Shepps,
Latroy Steeds.

720
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,204
Steeds or Berry were never
questioned about Mike's murder.

721
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:46,207
They all used to work at Titan's
Auto. It was closed down. . .

722
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:51,212
after a flood six months ago.
I want to check this place out.

723
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,329
Hey!

724
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,384
Freeze!

725
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:59,400
Do not fucking move! Do not move!

726
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,408
Get down!

727
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,413
Fucking. . . tried to blow
my head off.

728
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:17,418
Is this Darnell? Let me you see
you ! Let me fucking see you !

729
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,422
You don't know what the fucking
shit to talk about.

730
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:29,420
Give me my lawyer! I don't see no
badge, I don't see no warrant.

731
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,444
I'm Detective Lieutenant Henry Oak
of the Detroit Metropolitan. . .

732
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:48,449
Police Department. This is
Detective Sergeant Tellis.

733
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:53,454
We already know who you are,
which is why we are here.

734
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:59,460
You've been hiding from us
cause you killed a cop.

735
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:05,467
That cop's name was Michael
Calvess. Jimmy Fredericks.

736
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,470
Now I'm going to give you
the opportunity. . .

737
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:14,475
to come all the way clean
on this and confess.

738
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:18,479
If you choose, in your limited
wisdom, to fuck around with me. . .

739
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:24,486
force my hand, then you're both
going out of here in a bag.

740
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:27,488
Fuck that!
What you doing is illegal.

741
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,490
Give me my fucking phone call.

742
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,493
You're gonna need a lot
more than a phone call.

743
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,497
You got a jacket on you. Multiple
counts, assault B & E. . .

744
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,499
felony possession,
grand theft fucking auto.

745
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:41,502
You add the murder of a decorated
cop and you've officially fucked. . .

746
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,505
-yourself for life.
-I didn't murder no fucking cop.

747
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:46,507
Enough.

748
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,512
I'm gonna toss this place. Is there
anything you want to tell me?

749
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,514
Huh? No?

750
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,517
Fine.

751
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,577
This is next.

752
01:11:56,645 --> 01:12:01,582
Whose ride is this? Is this yours?
This must be your car, Darnell.

753
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:05,586
-This your car? Give me the keys.
-Fuck this! I'll not give you them.

754
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,589
Say it again. Say fuck you again.
Say fuck you again.

755
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:13,594
Say fuck you again to me.
Your ride? Okay.

756
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:16,597
-What is this, man, take us in.
-You're gonna fuck around with me?

757
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,600
No.
No!

758
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,627
Lieutenant!

759
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,641
Oh, look at that.

760
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:07,648
What are you throwing a coup?
You selling this to the Serbs?

761
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,651
Police issue.

762
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,656
That's from the impound.
Let's hear it.

763
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,659
What you been doing? Uh, Holmes?

764
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:22,663
You been sneaking into the impound.
You're in a lot of trouble.

765
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,665
This is it.

766
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:30,671
This is Calvess' gun.

767
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,676
This is Mike's gun.

768
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:46,687
What the fuck are you doing with
a dead cop's gun?

769
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,690
Answer me. What are you doing
with a dead cop's gun? Answer me!

770
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:53,694
Fuck that. I don't know nothing
about no fucking dead cop's gun.

771
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,697
This is a police issue revolver
that belongs to a slain officer.

772
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,699
-What are you doing with it?
-That was not in there.

773
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,701
That fucking gun wasn't in there.

774
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,704
Shut up!
What are doing with it, huh?

775
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,707
That's fucking bullshit.
It's a throwaway.

776
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,709
-It's a what?
-You planted that.

777
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,712
I planted it. Is that what you're
saying? I planted it?

778
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:12,712
Look at the blood on the barrel.

779
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,716
Look at the dried blood on the
trigger guard. Look at it!

780
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:18,719
Who fucking planted that, huh?
Who planted that?

781
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,722
Who planted that? Listen to me.
Listen to me. You two better. . .

782
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,724
get a fucking God damn groove
going right here. . .

783
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,727
cause you're in a life and death
struggle as of right fucking now.

784
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:28,729
-I want to talk to my lawyer!
-What did you say?

785
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,732
-I want to talk to my lawyer.
-There are no lawyers, dumb fuck.

786
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:36,737
It's just me and you and I am in
your shit for the duration.

787
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,740
Come on, man, you know planted
that shit.

788
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:45,747
Say one more fucking thing. Please
say one more fucking thing. Please.

789
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:55,757
In the fucking trunk!
No I didn't do it. In the trunk!

790
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,762
What did I tell you?

791
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:09,771
They get dumber every year.
Okay, nice and easy, okay?

792
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,774
We'll get this over real quick. And
you're gonna tell me, loud and. . .

793
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:16,777
clear, what happened.

794
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:22,783
Two months ago, a walking tunnel
off of West Grand.

795
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,788
You found out there was an
undercover cop in the group.

796
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:34,785
You confronted him. You overpowered
him. And you beat him.

797
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,799
And you took his pistol off of him.

798
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,805
You took it.
You pointed it in his skull.

799
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:48,809
You pulled the trigger
and you killed him.

800
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,815
-He died instantly.
-That's a fucking lie.

801
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:59,820
I lied? Remember Jimmy Fredericks.
Remember Fredericks, look at him.

802
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,824
Look at him. Look at him.
Look at him. Huh? Remember him?

803
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,827
-You fucking remember him?
-He was a fucking junky, man.

804
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,830
What did you just say?
He's what?

805
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,832
-Junky.
-That's bullshit, Darnell.

806
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,835
Come on. We saw that motherfucker
every day. 3 or 4 times a day.

807
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,838
That's fucking bullshit. You're
fucking lying ! You're lying !

808
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,841
You found out he was undercover.
You tried to sell him a bad score. . .

809
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,844
hoping it'd kill him. He
didn't use it, so you shot him.

810
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:29,851
So you're bullshit, you're
dealing. Motherfuckers. Fuck you !

811
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,853
Where do you think we got them
fucking cop guns from?

812
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:37,858
That motherfucker used to swipe
that shit, sell it, and get high.

813
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:44,855
He was a cop! He was a cop you
killed ! He had a wife. He had kids.

814
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:59,880
No! Stop! No, not like this.
No, stop!

815
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:05,886
We bring them in looking like this,
civil liberty lawyers'll crucify us.

816
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,889
We put them under duress, this bust
gets bounced at arraignment.

817
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,892
These two will color us Klan
and they fucking walk.

818
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,897
They fucking walk for good. Okay?
We're too close.

819
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:20,901
There's a kit in the car. We get
it, we roll prints off the pistol.

820
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:23,904
All right? You grab it. I'm gonna
get on the horn and call a wagon.

821
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:27,908
No! No, no, no.
Don't call it in. We're gonna. . .

822
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:32,913
get the confessions on tape.
Then we call it in.

823
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:37,918
I want some time alone
with these two. Okay?

824
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:44,926
All right. Yeah, okay.
Go grab the kit. All right?

825
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:50,932
We got conclusive guilt, the murder
weapon. It's heavy for conviction.

826
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,934
I'll go upstairs; I'll bag whatever
peripheral evidence I can find.

827
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,938
Let them get their fucking shit
straight. Just for a minute.

828
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,942
This makes no sense to
knuckle down on them right now.

829
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:12,953
A brief reprieve. All right?
So suck it up.

830
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:58,999
Why you got to lock the door? Man,
why you got to lock door? Shit.

831
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:03,003
-There's no fucking time.
-Why things gonna get worse?

832
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:06,006
I wanna make some money for my kid,
my daughter, you better tell her. . .

833
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:10,010
-Look me in the eyes.
-I know you.

834
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,016
You that same fool killed
Elvin, man.

835
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,019
-How do you know that?
-How do you think?

836
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:25,026
Man, you think Calvess just blow
his own game. Blow his own spot.

837
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,027
What the fuck are you talking
about? What?

838
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:31,031
Who do think snitched you off to
Dowd about being a fucking cop?

839
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,035
You think that shit fell out the
fucking sky or something?

840
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:39,039
Come on, man, he came after you
after Calvess told him you was 5-0.

841
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:42,042
He's a cop, he's a cop,
he's one of me, man.

842
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,045
The fuck, you think we making
this shit up for? Huh?

843
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:48,048
We ain't got nothing to gain from
this shit. We both dead anyway.

844
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:53,053
Yo, man, y'all think Calvess is
some kind of a fucking saint, man.

845
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:56,056
I got something about the furthest
thing from that motherfucker.

846
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,058
That motherfucker.

847
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:02,062
Listen to me, we have seconds. Make
every single one of them count.

848
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,065
Before he left, he yelled at you.
You yelled back and you said. . .

849
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:07,067
he knew who killed Calvess.
What does that mean?

850
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:11,071
That means that your fucking
partner Oak is dirty man.

851
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,073
-He's fucking lying to you.
-What did you say?

852
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,075
-He's lying to you.
-He's lying to me?

853
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,075
-Yeah, he's lying.
-What's he lying about?

854
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:20,080
He's lying about what went down in
that tunnel, who killed that cop.

855
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:23,083
Just about everything. Why do you
think we still up in here.

856
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:27,087
-It's cause he was dead.
-He's where?

857
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:31,091
-Motherfucker.
-In the tunnel.

858
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:42,102
That morning, Calvess came around.

859
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:46,106
He told about he wanted to get some
get high. 6 o'clock in the morning.

860
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,108
We told him, you getting me up
this early, this shit. . .

861
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,110
better be worth my while,
better have some big money.

862
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:54,114
-You knew him by his real name.
-He came off for a couple of weeks.

863
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,116
Said his name was some
Fredericks something.

864
01:20:56,184 --> 01:21:00,120
-Jimmy Fredericks. Yeah. Go.
-Yeah, but he got strung out man.

865
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:03,123
Turned straight bitch.
Blew his whole cover.

866
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,123
So you knew?

867
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:07,127
Everybody knew he was a cop, just
like everybody know that you. . .

868
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,129
and a handful of
motherfuckers was cops.

869
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:12,132
Oh, man. You know, he kept us
out of his reports.

870
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,135
Tipped us off to who was getting
fucking raided who was getting got.

871
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:18,138
-We kept him high.
-You say he supplied you with IDs.

872
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:21,141
-He supplied you with police IDs.
-All kinds of shit, man.

873
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:28,138
Badges, IDs, guns. Whenever he had
no money, he'd come trade up shit.

874
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,155
That morning, what was
his condition like that morning?

875
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:39,159
He wasn't looking so good, man.
Talking all kind of crazy shit.

876
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:42,162
Hands looking all shaky.
So we show up in the morning.

877
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:46,166
He got no money, nothing to trade.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

878
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:49,169
I told him to fuck off, man,
I ain't giving him shit.

879
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:53,173
Before we know, this motherfucker
starts straight tripping, man.

880
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:57,177
Talking about he gonna arrest us and
take us in if we don't comp his ass.

881
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:00,180
Then Oak showed up.

882
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:08,188
-Where?
-On the other side of the tunnel.

883
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,191
Did he say anything?

884
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:17,198
No, man. No. When we saw him,
Calvess seen him at the same time.

885
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:21,201
This motherfucker just flipped.
Talking about arresting us.

886
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:24,204
-He started reaching for his gun.
-So what did you do?

887
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,206
I hit him, man.

888
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,209
Cause he's reaching for his gun,
you hit him.

889
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,212
I ain't trying to get shot by
nobody, specially no junky.

890
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,216
-All of sudden trying to be a cop.
-So what then?

891
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:41,221
He fell. Latroy hit in his face once
and then I kicked him again.

892
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:46,226
And then we ran.
And then Oak started shooting.

893
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:54,234
The Lieutenant fired on you?
How many times?

894
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:56,236
Three, four times.

895
01:22:56,304 --> 01:23:01,241
Lieutenant fired on you three or
four times, you didn't get hit?

896
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:13,253
Fucking quickly, tell me what
happened then. Go.

897
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:17,257
When we was running, we heard
Oak yelling at Calvess.

898
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:22,262
-What the fuck are you doing, Mike?
-So he did it.

899
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,265
He did what?

900
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:29,269
That's when he killed him, man.

901
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:39,279
-What did you just say to me?
-Fucking Calvess is a junky.

902
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:42,282
He blew his cover and
Oak killed him.

903
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:46,286
Look me straight fucking in the
face and say that to me? Huh?

904
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,288
You think he ain't capable of
some shit like that?

905
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,291
You think he ain't got it in him?
He come there, see his partner. . .

906
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,294
all strung out like that. That
motherfucker just flipped out.

907
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:58,298
Do you guys think that this is my
first fucking walk in the park?

908
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:00,300
Huh?

909
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:03,303
You cop selling to an officer,
you cop assaulting an officer. . .

910
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,305
but now you won't cop to
fucking killing one. Why?

911
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:07,307
Because you want to fucking spin
some fucking bullshit. . .

912
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:12,312
cause you fucking wasted him.
You fucking wasted him.

913
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:19,319
Yeah, what?
It is over. It is fucking over!

914
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:23,323
Just because I gave you a fucking
shot to set it straight, Darnell. . .

915
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:25,325
and you fucking pissed it away,
both of you pissed it away.

916
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:31,332
So all this shit that's coming down,
you brought all this on yourself.

917
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:36,336
You must be suspicious.

918
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:39,339
If you wasn't then why
the fuck you locked the door, huh?

919
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,341
The only thing you need
to know about me. . .

920
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:45,345
that I'm going to bag the
motherfuckers that killed Mike.

921
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,348
Where we grow up, man,
you kill a cop. . .

922
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:52,352
they will crown you King
motherfucking Kong. You understand?

923
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,354
But there ain't nobody here
talking about killing no cop.

924
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:58,358
Come here and try to fucking stick
this shit to some niggers. . . .

925
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:02,362
because he know that any time
you stick some shit to some niggers,

926
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,364
it's gonna stay stuck.

927
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:09,369
Yo, when did you find that gun in
there? Huh? That gun that Oak. . .

928
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,371
found, Calvess' gun. You the
first one that looked in that trunk.

929
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,373
Did you see a brown bag
in there with no gun?

930
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:15,375
-Oh, God.
-No, you did not.

931
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:18,378
It came up when your back was
turned. Don't you see?

932
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,380
Hey! Hey!

933
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:26,386
Tellis, open the God damned door.

934
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,388
Why don't you dust it for
prints and we'll see. . .

935
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,390
whose prints come up off of
there. I'll bet you all the. . .

936
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,393
prints that come up off of there
belong to your man, Oak.

937
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,395
He planted it, man.
He put it there.

938
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:42,392
You got ten fucking seconds, play
this back, for the record now. Go.

939
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:42,834
God damn it!
Open the door!

940
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,408
Hey, God. . .

941
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:52,412
Tellis!

942
01:25:56,484 --> 01:26:00,420
What the fuck was going on in there?
Why did you just lock me out?

943
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:02,422
I just asked you a question.
What did you lock me out for?

944
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,425
Were you tailing Calvess
the day he was killed?

945
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:08,428
-What?
-You heard me.

946
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:11,431
Did he compromise his cover? And
were you tailing him?

947
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:13,433
You talked to them after I left?

948
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:17,437
The Mossberg we got off Laflore,
Tekulve's ID and badge.

949
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:18,437
You heard them.

950
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:21,441
They're claiming Calvess supplied
them with stolen police issue. . .

951
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,443
to make junk buys. Can you explain
that, cause I am having a hell of. . .

952
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,445
a lot of trouble
figuring it out.

953
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,447
How long after I left
did you let those liberal. . .

954
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,450
stirrings in you spill out
all over the fucking floor?

955
01:26:30,518 --> 01:26:32,452
From the position I'm in, I don't
like where you're putting me in. . .

956
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,456
to ask these questions.
Now, were you following him?

957
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,458
It's not an indictment if you did,
but if you did I need to know that

958
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:41,461
and I need to know that now.

959
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:48,468
No. I was not tailing him.

960
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,472
But you were there before he died.

961
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:57,477
You were there before he died.
Tell me that I'm wrong.

962
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:00,480
You want to fucking talk.

963
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,484
All right, we'll talk.

964
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:11,415
R. LIOTTA
ENTER

965
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,494
Mike was making
a bust that morning.

966
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:18,498
He had enough going against them
to make an arrest.

967
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,500
He needed backup.

968
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,502
-Off roster.
-Why?

969
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:25,505
Because he wanted to bring them
on his own.

970
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:32,502
So I stayed back. I waited.
And the buy went bad.

971
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:35,515
Then how come you couldn't identify
those guys in there right away?

972
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,517
They shot him and ran.

973
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:43,523
They shot them or you shot them
as they fled the scene.

974
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:48,528
What? What did they say to you?

975
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:57,537
The Lieutenant kill Calvess.

976
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,543
You must be out of
your fucking mind.

977
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,546
As much as he meant to me,
you call up my integrity.

978
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:08,548
My commitment to that kid !

979
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,551
You're gonna let these fucking
low-life pieces of shit smear that.

980
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:13,553
We're bringing them,
we're taking them in.

981
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:18,558
You're fucking with something
you can't possibly understand.

982
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:24,565
-I'm taking them in. It's over now.
-You're a fucking joke.

983
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:28,568
You know that.
You're a fucking joke.

984
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:32,572
Your whole career's a fucking joke.
A complete fucking washout.

985
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,574
You popped that needle
freak in the park. . .

986
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:37,577
and in the process, you hit that
woman with a stray bullet. . .

987
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,579
costing her a bouncing baby.

988
01:28:39,647 --> 01:28:41,581
-Enough!
-Fucking her up for life!

989
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:44,584
Enough! Stop!
Shut the fuck up!

990
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:48,588
You're a lie.
A fucking lie.

991
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:55,595
I got this from child welfare.

992
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:00,600
Kathryn Tunney, mother deceased.
Was removed from the custody of. . .

993
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:04,604
her stepfather Myron Cobb, November
23, 1 985. Declared ward of the state.

994
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:10,611
Placed with foster parents.
Did you know that little girl?

995
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,616
I think you do.

996
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:29,629
I know you wanted to adopt her.
She's been in and out of. . .

997
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:32,632
trouble for years, and in and
out of foster homes.

998
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:37,637
A handful of arrests, mostly drug
related. You had them all squashed.

999
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:40,640
You bailed her out of
rehab lots of times.

1000
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,642
When she was a minor, you needed
a doctor to sign the release.

1001
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,645
So who did it?
Your old pal, Harlan.

1002
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:47,647
Nick, this is a good friend
of mine, Art Harlan.

1003
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:51,651
He signed her out of all those
clinics. See, I saw the signatures.

1004
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:54,654
You made sure that Harlan was the
active ME on the Calvess case.

1005
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:58,658
-Didn't you?
-There's been no connection to Mike.

1006
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,660
Calvess? I thought
we were closing it out.

1007
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,662
So, he could doctor
the autopsy, right?

1008
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,665
Alter the lab reports,
make them look clean.

1009
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,668
Made Calvess look clean.

1010
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,671
He's as dirty as you are.

1011
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:15,675
A filthy, fucking
needle-ridden junky.

1012
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:21,681
And you fucking knew it, you
motherfucker. You motherfucker.

1013
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,685
I'm calling this in right now.

1014
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:39,699
Your gun and your shield
on the ground now.

1015
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,704
I am so far from fucking with you.

1016
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:47,707
You're putting a gun in my face.
You're threatening my life.

1017
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:52,712
I'm gonna take your life.
Gun and shield on the ground now.

1018
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,714
You're a fucking lie.

1019
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:57,717
You just wanted me
to back your bullshit.

1020
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:02,722
Sell your story so you could
railroad those pricks in there.

1021
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,734
You pulled her out of all
that shit, didn't you.

1022
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:17,737
You just couldn't afford
to break her heart again.

1023
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,739
You just couldn't do it.

1024
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:30,750
I get it, man. I get it.
He was a fucking addict.

1025
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:35,755
I mean, how long is it before
he starts pimping around, right?

1026
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:45,766
All hopeless, right? Everything he
did was hopeless, didn't matter.

1027
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:50,770
You just took this case so you
could bury him. Oh Good. Yeah.

1028
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:54,774
Kill me. Kill me just like
you killed him.

1029
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:56,776
Come on, buddy.

1030
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:00,780
I'm going back in there
and finish this up.

1031
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:03,783
-Come on.
-Go home.

1032
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:26,807
This bullshit's over! You destroyed
his life, his family. . .

1033
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:29,809
you fucked it all up. So now. . .

1034
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:33,813
you two are gonna tell me
that you killed him.

1035
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:06,836
He identified himself, he attempted
to make an arrest. . .

1036
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:09,849
you overpowered him
and you shot him.

1037
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:13,853
Say it! You say it and
you get out of here.

1038
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:17,857
You think I'm fucking with you?

1039
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:24,864
You think I'm fucking with you?

1040
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:32,872
You ready to talk?
You ready to talk?

1041
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:40,880
This is Calvess' gun. This is the
gun that you used to kill him.

1042
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:44,884
See the gun? Take it.
Take it in your hands!

1043
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:51,891
Grip his gun!

1044
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,896
You are going to tell me calmly.

1045
01:33:56,964 --> 01:34:00,900
Remember, I got two bullets left.
One for this head and one for this.

1046
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:04,904
-You understand.
-Drop your weapon!

1047
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:07,907
-You killed Calvess! Say it!
-I will shoot you where you stand.

1048
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:11,911
I killed Calvess!

1049
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:16,916
-Shut up! Shut up! Say it!
-I killed Calvess.

1050
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:38,938
Don't you leave this with
me, Oak. Don't you do that.

1051
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:42,942
I need to know,
cause there was no bust.

1052
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,946
You killed him. You were there to
kill him. That's what you did.

1053
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,949
You knew what he was.
You knew what he was.

1054
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,951
You planted the gun
cause he was a junky.

1055
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:54,954
I know you did and you killed him,
but you gotta tell me why?

1056
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:56,956
Look me in the eyes
and tell me.

1057
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,959
-They ruined him.
-Who?

1058
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:03,963
They made him a junky.

1059
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:07,967
The department. . . takes everything.

1060
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:11,971
The pension, everything and the
family gets nothing.

1061
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,974
Kathy gets nothing.

1062
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:21,982
Why don't you tell me the truth,
you tell me the fucking truth.

1063
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:29,979
Look at me. Do not fucking go!
Tell me!

1064
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:42,001
Give me the gun!

1065
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:14,033
What the fuck are you doing here,
man?! Huh?

1066
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:18,037
What're you doing here? What're you
doing in here. I'm taking you out.

1067
01:36:18,105 --> 01:36:20,039
-I'm getting you help.
-I don't want help.

1068
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:24,043
You're not taking me anywhere!
I'm not going out!

1069
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,046
Look at me! Do you know what
you're doing to Kathy?

1070
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:30,049
What you're doing to the girls.
You know what they mean to me. . .

1071
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:33,052
you're fucking that up. You're
pissing away your entire life, Mike.

1072
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,054
I won't have it! I won't have it!

1073
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:39,058
I heard about this and I fucking
waited. I ignored it.

1074
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:43,062
Why Kathy didn't tell me, I have no
idea. But that's it. It's over.

1075
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:48,067
I'm sorry I took so God damn long,
but it's over.

1076
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:13,092
Oh my God !

1077
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:18,097
Oh my God, Mike.

1078
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:23,102
Oh my God.
Mike.

1079
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:26,105
Mike.

1080
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:28,107
Mike.

1081
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,110
Mike.

1082
01:37:31,178 --> 01:37:33,112
Jesus Christ.

1083
01:38:00,207 --> 01:38:08,137
Oh Mike, my God, I'm sorry.
Oh my God, I'm sorry.
