00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,192
He was gorgeous.

176
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,729
You want to take
the lady outside?

177
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,197
Getting a little
crowded in here.

178
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,029
Your prints, too, Chief.

179
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,310
So, what's
this guy's name?

180
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,577
James...

181
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,545
Mackey.

182
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,423
Mack the Knife.

183
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,730
You know...

184
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,967
when she was
married to me,

185
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,474
I was never going to die.

186
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,239
We fight, we split,

187
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,745
she goes to you.

188
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,916
So it goes.
Life is forever, right?

189
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,451
What do I care?

190
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,511
I passed my 20 yesterday.

191
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,580
Everybody says retire,

192
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,250
so...

193
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,261
I feel mortal
all of a sudden.

194
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,263
Know what I mean?

195
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,765
I say he's dead 48 hours.

196
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,199
No.

197
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,735
Look at the lividity.

198
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,600
It's more like 36.

199
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,871
Smells like 48.

200
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,373
Smells like 36.

201
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,814
I was just trying to
get some attention.

202
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,215
You know?

203
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,479
I apologize.

204
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,052
It was just...

205
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,262
we're in the same squad...

206
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,355
six years.

207
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,490
Huh?

208
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,525
We don't so much as have
a beer together.

209
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:35,062
How the hell do you
take my wife away?

210
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,539
Hey...

211
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,545
I didn't take
nobody nowhere.

212
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,875
You understand?

213
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,916
You didn't treat her right.
She walked.

214
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,884
I didn't treat her right?

215
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,249
She walked.

216
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,187
You want to kick
somebody's ass about it,

217
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,588
you kick your own.

218
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,551
Fuckface.

219
00:14:58,597 --> 00:14:59,928
I'll check everybody out,

220
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,057
but truthfully,

221
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,000
it boils down to grabbing
the strange trim...

222
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,003
he got hooked up with.

223
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,936
This guy's a swordsman
extraordinaire.

224
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,703
Could be a lady
gets pissed off...

225
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,243
because they're in bed,

226
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,243
he's...

227
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,213
Starts moaning Mary
instead of Gladys.

228
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,713
Hell hath no fury
and all that.

229
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,812
How do you know
the trim is strange?

230
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,322
Maybe it's a steady.

231
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,291
Strange. Know how I know?

232
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,326
Records... 45s.

233
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,294
Nobody whips out old 45s...

234
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,830
except on
first or second dates.

235
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,299
Getting to know you,
so what do you do?

236
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,835
Take out old records,

237
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,303
show the broad
you kept them,

238
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,306
meaning you're
a sentimental individual.

239
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,309
Who does that
with somebody they know?

240
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,608
Once you know them,
who gives a shit?

241
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,823
How you doing, Chief?

242
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,257
Hey...

243
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,295
working hard
or hardly working?

244
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,796
Little of both.
How you doing?

245
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:06,831
Ok.

246
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,298
Was anybody else here?

247
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,801
Maybe the mailman
in the afternoon.

248
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,564
I don't remember.

249
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,572
There's a cable TV repairman.

250
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,039
What's that, Cabletime?

251
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,737
But he was down
in the basement.

252
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,270
Pretty much what I
told you yesterday.

253
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,748
What about ladies?

254
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,047
See any young ladies?

255
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,518
See any of them?

256
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,522
You told me
there was a sex parade.

257
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,058
If I'm looking to see somebody
in particular,

258
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,525
I'll see them.

259
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,528
But if I'm hailing a cab...

260
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,530
or in the package room...

261
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,190
Ok. We'll talk again.

262
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,503
So the emcee says
to the first husband,

263
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,505
"Where did your wife say...

264
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,009
"was the most exotic place
you ever made love?"

265
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,044
So this guy's thinking,
right?

266
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,047
He's got a brain
like a frigging pea,

267
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,548
but he's thinking.

268
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,176
Finally he says,
"In the butt."

269
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,220
You get it?

270
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,222
Hey, anybody do any work...

271
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,157
over at 365
West End Avenue Monday?

272
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,319
I did.

273
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,829
See anybody there
not looking right?

274
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,559
You know...
freaked out, scared?

275
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,294
Running like lost?

276
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,599
I saw some ladies
in the laundry room.

277
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,070
Why? What happened?

278
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,573
There was a shooting.

279
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,576
If you remember,
want to give me a call?

280
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,611
Yeah, sure.

281
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,940
Thank you.

282
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,854
Mmm

283
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,759
Mmm

284
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,026
Mmm

285
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,659
Mmm

286
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,202
Mmm

287
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,259
Mmm

288
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,534
Mmm

289
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,041
Come with me

290
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,011
My love

291
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,640
To the sea

292
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,785
It's so good.

293
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,118
It's so good.

294
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,351
It feels so good.

295
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,556
Please...

296
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,685
please, don't!

297
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,833
Excuse me.

298
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,426
Hey! A toast.

299
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,471
Excuse me.

300
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,268
For our host.
10 promotions, overdue.

301
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,774
Meet your detectives.

302
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:34,711
Tommy Squibb,
detective third grade.

303
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,147
Felix King,
detective third grade.

304
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:42,381
Joe Pines,
detective third grade.

305
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,716
[Whistles]

306
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,916
Hey, fellas!

307
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,053
Come on,
I'm giving a toast here.

308
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,197
Tommy Squibb,
detective third grade.

309
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,666
All right, George.

310
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,669
Where do you learn that?

311
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,671
That's like
watching a movie.

312
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,173
Yeah, well,
it keeps me fit.

313
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,177
I get in a beef
with a guy,

314
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,180
I hit him fast,
I'm out of there.

315
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,182
I don't like getting hurt.

316
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,583
God gave fat guys guns
to handle that.

317
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,585
Frank Keller?

318
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,588
Sherman Touhey
from the 112.

319
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,623
Forest Hills?

320
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,591
I heard you caught
a good one...

321
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,457
Taxpayer, back of the head?

322
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,292
Me, too,
on Yellowstone Boulevard.

323
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,262
No shit?

324
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,821
The bullet's no use...

325
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,868
Pancaked on the bed frame.

326
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,836
We got cigarette butts
with lipstick on them.

327
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,770
We didn't get any butts.

328
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,898
Any prints?

329
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,841
Yeah, nothing showed up
on the files, though.

330
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,503
Let's compare tomorrow.

331
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,289
Uh, Dewars, double Dewars
on the rocks.

332
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,288
Budweiser.

333
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,825
You know something?
You talk lipstick,

334
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,294
I think my guy
got done by a broad.

335
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,796
Oh, yeah?
How's that?

336
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,299
We're talking
four-star ladies here.

337
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,302
Hey, you play, you pay.
Am I right?

338
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,804
My wedding night,
I wake up,

339
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,309
My wife's got the tattoo needle,
the eyeshades.

340
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,606
I got "property of"
on my balls.

341
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,943
Only kidding,
but catch my drift?

342

00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,497
Raymond Brown.
8130 Austin Avenue.

510
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,543
I tracked him
through his postbox.

511
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,100
You a fucking cop?

512
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,237
Sometimes.

513
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,121
Gruber.

514
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,282
I'll catch up with you.

515
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,758
How you doing?

516
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:34,527
This 20-year thing,
it's kicking my ass.

517
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,126
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,545
"Raymond Brown,
Downtown Brown."

519
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,047
Here we go.

520
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,582
"Loneliness and silence...

521
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,050
"envelop a heart
that pounds like thunder.

522
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,587
"All the love
I have inside...

523
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,088
is ripping me asunder."

524
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,055
Ha ha!

525
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,217
"The city
is a jungle of pain,

526
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,454
but my love
is from the soul."

527
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,430
So be so kind
as to answer this ad,

528
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,058
and you can ride on my pole.

529
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,034
Give the guy a break.

530
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,503
This is a major
Ionleyhearts here.

531
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,630
Major.

532
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,409
Good afternoon.

533
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,911
I'm Detective
Frank Keller.

534
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,107
This is Detective
Sherman Touhey.

535
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,116
Does Raymond Brown
live here?

536
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,981
Daddy!

537
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,610
They're cops.

538
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,120
What's up, fellas?

539
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,622
What's the matter?

540
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,282
Daddy, are you ok?

541
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,851
I want to tell
you something.

542
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,328
I love my family.

543
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,332
Raymond, no kidding,
we don't give a shit.

544
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,664
We need names
of your dates...

545
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,930
and their letters.

546
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,096
No letters.

547
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,663
Raymond, there's some
psycho woman killing guys.

548
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,677
I swear I didn't
go out with them.

549
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,043
I threw the letters away.

550
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,048
Raymond, you take the time...

551
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,576
to make up
this beautiful poem...

552
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,645
about Ioneliness
and silence.

553
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,155
You spring $300...

554
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:09,216
to put the ad
in the magazine.

555
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:12,229
You spring another,
say, 5 yards a month...

556
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,266
for some love nest
in the village,

557
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,234
50 bucks for
the post office box.

558
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,736
You're telling us...

559
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,272
you never
went out with them?

560
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,774
Raymond, please.

561
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,743
The worst part
of being a cop...

562
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,747
is all you hear
from people are lies.

563
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,784
"I didn't do it.
I wasn't there.

564
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,250
It's somebody else."

565
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,788
Blah this. Blah that.

566
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,791
I swear on the eyes
of my children.

567
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,097
30 sit-downs,
30 sets of prints,

568
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,099
Miss Wrong, we got her.

569
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:52,102
Upstairs gives us 300
for the magazine ad,

570
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,570
we spring for a few vinos,

571
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,072
maybe a chef's salad,

572
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,937
bag the wine glasses,
it's over.

573
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,840
What? Come on.

574
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,607
"What? Come on"?

575
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,982
Suppose I get my own money,
buy the ad myself,

576
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:11,988
we drop her, you pay me back
like it's a bet?

577
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:15,958
Suppose I set you up
with my sister-in-law?

578
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,460
She got great tits.

579
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,758
Divorced, no kids, no cats.

580
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,535
The lieu's sister-in-law...
she sounds great.

581
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,448
I swear on the eyes
of my children.

582
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,650
We should've tailed him.

583
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,684
We fucked up.

584
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,092
He fucked up.

585
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,926
Don't leave the restaurant.

586
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:57,433
Don't lay a hand on them.

587
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,163
Don't have
intercourse with them.

588
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:00,864
It's over.
I'm not doing it.

589
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,931
You converse, you get prints,
and you split.

590
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,442
You wear a wire.

591
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,911
We'll have
a sound van outside.

592
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,414
Two-man backup
at another table.

593
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,915
Keep the restaurant receipts.

594
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,782
I don't want
to read about this.

595
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:18,321
What's with the backup
and wire?

596
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,324
What's she going to do...
confess, shoot me?

597
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,791
We're in a restaurant.

598
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,293
To make me happy.

599
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,296
Now, who's writing the ad?

600
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,991
Who's the poet?

601
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,999
Roses are red,

602
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,502
violets are blue,

603
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,504
I got one yea-Iong,

604
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,506
and it's all for you.

605
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,508
I got one yea-Iong!

606
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,237
Check it out.

607
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,714
I got one, I got one,
I got one!

608
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,409
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

609
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,951
Check this one out.

610
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,113
Windswept hallways
in my heart...

611
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,921
echo the blackness
of eternity.

612
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,152
Get out!

613
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,161
Edgar Allan Poe, this guy.

614
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,198
I'll be sitting across
from Morticia Addams.

615
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,197
Thing.

616
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,494
Gomez!

617
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,335
No, she's a shooter, right?

618
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,964
So, how about
something like, um...

619
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,908
Uh... many a girl
has shot me down.

620
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,444
I've been shot before...

621
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,945
Shot me down...

622
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:19,449
Hot to trot,
give Frank a shot.

623
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,509
I live alone...

624
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,111
within myself,

625
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,715
like a hut
within the woods.

626
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:32,161
I keep my heart high
upon the shelf,

627
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,131
barren of other goods.

628
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,635
I need another's arms
to reach for it...

629
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,604
and place it
where it belongs.

630
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:44,140
I need another's touch...

631
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,641
and smile...

632
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,146
to fill my hut with songs.

633
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,184
Not bad, huh?

634
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,482
It's a little corny,
but it's good.

635
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,522
Better than what we got.

636
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,989
Just make that up, Mr. K?

637
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,753
Frank's mother wrote that.

638
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,260
In high school.

639
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,920
1934.

640
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:11,492
She was a goddamn
beautiful person.

641
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,966
Go ahead. Use it.

642
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,666
She'd have liked that.

643
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,175
- Good poem.
- Say it again.

644
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,143
You guys are fucking slobs.

645
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,645
And you're GQ.

646
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:23,645
Later, Frank.

647
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,351
Oh, God.

648
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,732
Pop.

649
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:48,703
Come on.

650
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,207
You stay here
with me tonight.

651
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,742
Come on, come on.

652
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,708
Come on.

653
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:54,745
Come.

654
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,710
Come on.

655
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,247
Come on, come on.

656
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,247
Come on.

657
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,715
That's it, that's it.

658
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,252
Where are you taking me?

659
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,489
Am I walking?

660
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,261
I'm walking, I am.

661
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,731
That's good.

662
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,892
Yeah.

663
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,937
You got the wrong guy.

664
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,942
Shut up.

665
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,000
Wrong guy.

666
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,307
Sorry, Frank.

667
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,557
Ok, kid, smell
a shooter in there?

668
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,058
Ahh.

669
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,136
I don't know, Gloria.

670
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,139
I just got this...
this hopeful feeling...

671
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,141
when I read your letter.

672
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,107
It's just...

673
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,768
I can't explain it.

674
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,110
I'm a printer.

675
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,147
Yeah.

676
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,614
My own business.

677
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:06,615
Amanda.

678
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,618
My mother's name
was Amanda.

679
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,653
Ok.

680
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,312
Miranda.

681
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,822
You're a what?

682
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,788
That's what?

683
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,792
You like guys and girls...

684
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,350
or girls?

685
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,060
Oh, that's cool.
That's cool.

686
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,064
Me?

687
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,101
Yeah, well, sometimes,
you know,

688
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,762
but, uh, mainly girls.

689
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,001
Women, you know.

690
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,800
Uh-huh. Well...

691
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,708
how's around, uh...

692
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,079
you a night owl?

693
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,046
Solid.

694
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,878
Let's get crazy then.

695
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,186
Not that I haven't
done this before.

696
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,499
Shove this in here.

697
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,829
I like doing this.

698
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,369
Is he on, Bill?

699
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,426
Yup.

700
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,402
Ok, man.

701
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,939
I look natural.

702
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,474
You look good.

703
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,786
Can I help you?

704
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,131
Good evening, sir.

705
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,132
Good evening.

706
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,634
Chair this evening?

707
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,135
Yes, thank you.

708
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,637
Cocktail this evening?

709
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,637
Yeah.

710
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,173
What kind, sir?

711
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,799
Bourbon and water.

712
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,310
Bourbon and water
it is, sir.

713
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,971
Come back, now.

714
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,741
Do you remember

715
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,720
When we met

716
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,621
That's the day

717
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,318
I knew you were my pet

718
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,352
Can I get a little
hi-de-hi here?

719
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,098
If I look half as good as you
at your age,

720
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,605
you got nothing
to worry about.

721
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,140
You look great.

722
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,641
You're very sweet.

723
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,202
It's just that I should've
said on the phone...

724
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,713
the age I am.

725
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:21,183
You look better than
3/4 of the girls I know...

726
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,220
that are half your age.

727
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,551
Did that come out right?

728
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,224
Yes, yes, thank you.

729
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,850
I'll buy that.

730
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,020
I'll quit while I'm ahead.

731
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,702
So, uh...

732
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,567
the lady would like
another white wine?

733
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,571
Yes, please.

734
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,232
And I'm fine here.

735
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,268
Well...

736
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,463
what do we do now?

737
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,971
Well, I tell you...

738
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,500
I got to pick up
my son in half an hour,

739
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,443
and the timing's terrible.

740
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,572
Should we
have dinner sometime?

741
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,343
Oh, sure. We'll call.

742
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,580
We?

743
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:31,946
We? I said we?

744
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:32,852
Yes.

745
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:33,981
That's me.

746
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,755
All day on the phone,
it's "We this, we that,"

747
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,728
meaning my company,
you know.

748
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:40,729
I'll call.

749
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,163
Check, please.

750
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,757
I'll call you.

751
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,529
Me.

752
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,429
No, you won't.

753
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,148
Oh, well.

754
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,822
I don't know.

755
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,324
I get this
very weird feeling...

756
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,293
you're not
who you say are you.

757
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,796
There's something
not right about this.

758
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,796
Oh?

759
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,299
What do you mean?
Like what?

760
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,801
You got cop's eyes.

761
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,734
Cop's eyes.

762
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:25,264
You look at me, I feel like
I did something.

763
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,274
Like what?

764
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,243
My ex-husband was a cop.

765
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,745
You're a printer?

766
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:33,180
If you're a printer,
I got a dick.

767
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,411
Well.

768
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,284
I didn't doubt it
for a minute, baby.

769
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:46,151
Think you could go
for a babe with a dick?

770
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,357
Depends on
her personality, really.

771
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,467
So, you're divorced, right?

772
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,027
I said that.

773
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,430
You got kids?

774
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,941
Kid... one kid.

775
00:42:59,009 --> 00:42:59,907
A boy?

776
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,501
No. A girl.

777
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,911
You got a girl, right?

778
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,650
You know, it's interesting...

779
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,653
Your coming
from York, Pennsylvania,

780
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,689
because in a way...

781
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,385
you went from York
to New York.

782
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,896
You like the park,
and I like the beach.

783
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,899
You're a printer,
I manage a shoe store.

784
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,664
And I don't believe in
wasting time on this stuff.

785
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,671
You know what you know,

786
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,673
and you go with it.

787
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,208
You go with what?

788
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,836
You're just not my type.

789
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:37,679
Oh, well.

790
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,182
I mean, you just sat down.

791
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,878
Give it a little bit of time.

792
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,887
I believe
in animal attraction.

793
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,186
I believe
in love at first sight.

794
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,657
I believe in this.

795
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,355
I don't feel it with you.

796
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,699
I'm hell on wheels
once you know me.

797
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,201
How are you folks
doing here?

798
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,362
Is that wine ok, miss?

799
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,742
You haven't even
touched your glass.

800
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,471
Have a little sip.

801
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,740
You know, warm up.

802
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,839
Let's raise a glass here.

803
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,349
Come on, here.

804
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,852
Let's have
a happy hunting toast.

805
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,353
It's nothing personal.

806
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,219
Where are you going?

807
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,222
Come on.

808
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,521
Kiss my tiara, bitch.

809
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,027
Look at that.

810
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,619
I didn't get prints.

811
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,858
I didn't get prints.

812
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,962
How many more
of these we got?

813
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,572
Ok. That's two more.

814
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,040
Two more.

815
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,975
Ah, no.

816
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,429
Oh, mercy, mercy, mercy.

817
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:06,363
How are you doing, Frank?

818
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,665
Ok.

819
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,634
Anything on the prints?

820
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,644
Nothing yet.

821
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,112
How's your head?

822
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,648
It couldn't be worse.

823
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,616
Hey, how are you doing?

824
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,117
Terry. Cabletone.

825
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What's up?

826
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,621
I told your partner...

827
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,556
there was a kid there
that day.

828
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,149
A black kid.

829
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,162
I think he was
from the supermarket...

830
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,131
'cause I saw him
with groceries earlier on.

831
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,135
Anyhow, I'm working
down in the basement.

832
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,636
About 20 minutes later,

833
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:44,572
he tears through there
like a bat out of hell.

834
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,767
No groceries.

835
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,711
I mean, why is he going out
through the basement?

836
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,680
There's a lobby, right?

837
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,010
Anyhow,

838
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,019
the kid has those, um...

839
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,555
those black militant
corn holes...

840
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,081
I mean, corn rows
in his hair.

841
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:08,462
He looks like a real shitbag,
if you ask me.

842
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,495
How are you doing, Chief?

843
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:18,268
One of your kids
got corn rows?

844
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,934
You know, Afro hairdo?

845
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,769
Stevie Wonder hair.

846
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:23,744
Wonder hair?

847
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,180
Reggie, he means Quawi.

848
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,581
Where's he?

849
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,619
I fired his ass Monday.

850
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:30,653
How come?

851
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,690
On a delivery,
he doesn't like the tip,

852
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,816
he screams at the customer.

853
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,622
You got his address?

854
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:38,592
Maybe.

855
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,096
What did he do,
kill somebody?

856
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:43,631
Quawi...

857
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,361
Quawi Benjamin.

858
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,370
"Spooney." Call him that,
he goes crazy.

859
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,241
I got nothing here.

860
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,243
He only worked
like a week or so.

861
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:58,042
If he comes in
or you see him, call us.

862
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,104
Sure.

863
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,208
[Humming]

864
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,289
Hell on wheels, huh?

865
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,959
How quickly we forget.

866
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:24,674
No.
I don't forget you.

867
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,141
You're the "animal attraction,"
right?

868
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,543
"Love at first sight."

869
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,047
What, do you
live around here?

870
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,047
Mm-hmm.

871
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,174
Oh, yeah?

872
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,650
88th Street.

873
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,779
Oh, yeah?
I live on 85th.

874
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,290
You know
that poem you wrote,

875
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,791
you didn't write it.

876
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,259
I read that poem...

877
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:47,764
and figured this is either
a very sensitive guy...

878
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,561
or he ripped off
some lady's poem...

879
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,124
or some girl's poem.

880
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,102
You didn't write it,
right?

881
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,103
Nope.

882
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,639
Some lady did, right?

883
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,106
My mother wrote it...

884
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,109
some 50-odd years ago.

885
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:03,635
That's why my father fell
in love with her.

886
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,113
Something like that.

887
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,945
Is that true?

888
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,814
So he says.

889
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,554
Hmm...

890
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,056
I like that.

891
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,716
I like that, uh...

892
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,589
that you did that.

893
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:21,097
You want to hear
my idea of poetry?

894
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,064
Precision in life.

895
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,034
Knowing when and how
to make your move.

896
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,866
Say your piece,

897
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:31,032
like you the other night
with me.

898
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,544
Oh, that was...

899
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,079
poetry in motion.

900
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,546
Beautiful.

901
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:39,877
Beautiful.

902
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,642
Look at me.

903
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,883
What?

904
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:50,290
You still want to go have
that happy hunting toast?

905
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:55,564
What happened to, uh,
the animal attraction?

906
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,401
What are you,
fucking nuts?

907
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,403
What if she's the doer?

908
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,405
We won't get the prints
back till tomorrow.

909
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,065
Wait till then.

910
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:08,077
Hey, come on,
the doer's down south.

911
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:10,943
Spooney, Quawi,
what's his name.

912
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,572
Listen, listen.

913
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,048
This... This one walked.

914
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,914
You remember her?

915
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,419
You with that bitch...

916
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,921
who wouldn't even
drink with you?

917
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,254
Yeah. It's good in a way.

918
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,918
I'll get her prints.

919
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,963
By sending your dick
to the lab?

920
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,930
That'll be
some great testimony...

921
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,432
"You see, Your Honor,

922
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,434
"first, I whipped it out,

923
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,436
then she whipped it out."

924
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,937
You catch my drift?

925
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,975
How do you know
it's this Quawi kid?

926
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,942
You know it's a broad.

927
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,605
She's a friggin' suspect.
Walk away.

928
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:45,579
Frankie?

929
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,412
Just walk away.

930
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,917
Nothing to it, Chief.

931
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,886
That's it.
I'm walking. Ok?

932
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,444
See you tomorrow.

933
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,092
No. Just a girlfriend.

934
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,127
Yeah.

935
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,095
All right.

936
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,596
Ok. Thanks a lot.

937
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,259
I'll talk to you later.

938
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,604
Something came up,
you know.

939
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,139
Isn't that crazy?

940
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,606
Boy.

941
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,102
What's your name again?

942
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,309
Helen.

943
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,546
Helen.

944
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,020
You know why
I got married?

945
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,557
I was 37.
I wasn't married.

946
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,024
So I got married.

947
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,560
I can top that.

948
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,027
You know why
I got married?

949
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,064
Some guy says,
"I love you."

950
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,566
I knew him a week.

951
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:40,068
Playing hard to get?

952
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,002
We didn't last very long.

953
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,164
Me, neither.

954
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,141
The wedding lasted longer
than the marriage.

955
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,676
But we still...

956
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,178
We're still friends.

957
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,509
Sort of.

958
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,614
You?

959
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:54,581
Friends?

960
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:55,583
No.

961
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:59,144
I found out I was pregnant,
I walked.

962
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,154
You walked?

963
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,656
What do you mean?

964
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,660
The guy didn't know
about the kid?

965
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,162
No. He's out of the picture.

966
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,698
You know, sometimes when
I think about...

967
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,166
the people
I got involved with,

968
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,702
the choices I made,

969
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,169
it's pretty amazing.

970
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,172
But I found something out.

971
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,641
There are very few mistakes
that can't be corrected...

972
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,644
if you got the guts.

973
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,703
If you got the guts.

974
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,749
Last call.

975
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,844
What are they, bombing us?

976
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,121
Oh, hell.

977
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,230
You know,
when it gets late...

978
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,925
sometimes...

979
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,237
I feel like a... big cat...

980
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,068
in a small cage.

981
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,700
Oh, yeah?

982
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,676
You know...

983
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,746
I have done some desperate,
foolish things...

984
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:00,840
come 3:00 in the morning.

985
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:04,045
You mean
like being here with me?

986
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,817
Where's your bathroom?

987
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,216
Huh?

988
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,049
Where's your bathroom?

989
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,818
Over there.

990
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:16,953
Where's my bag?

991
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,602
Get in bed.

992
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,638
Jesus Christ.

993
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,263
Oh, good Christ.

994
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,641
Holy fuck.

995
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,268
What the fuck?

996
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,651
Oh, shit.

997
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,618
Holy fuck.

998
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,086
Oh, my God.

999
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:46,987
Holy fuck.

1000
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,991
Oh, I can't believe it.

1001
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,458
I can't believe it.

1002
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:51,551
Oh, fuck.

1003
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,027
Jesus Christ.

1004
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:04,973
Oh! Oh, my God!

1005
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,100
Where did you put it?

1006
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,109
Oh, no!

1007
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,110
No!

1008
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,111
No!

1009
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,647
What are you doing?

1010
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,114
Open the door!

1011
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,616
Open this fucking door!

1012
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,117
Open this door!

1013
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,676
What is it?

1014
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,483
This ain't real.

1015
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,717
Open this fucking door!

1016
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,895
It's a starter's pistol.
I saw...

1017
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,625
You goddamn son of a bitch!

1018
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:30,791
Easy, easy.

1019
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:34,268
Don't you ever fucking
put your hands on me!

1020
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:35,827
I got scared.

1021
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:38,840
What are you doing
with a starter's pistol?

1022
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,341
None of your business!

1023
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,809
Get off of me.

1024
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,243
Listen.

1025
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,746
Listen to me!

1026
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:48,215
I saw the gun
sticking out of the purse.

1027
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,718
I freaked, ok?

1028
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,219
It was a reflex.

1029
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,687
Feel my heart.

1030
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:53,688
Go ahead.

1031
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,782
It's like a drum.

1032
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,292
Feel it?

1033
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,864
I'll tell you some stories
about scared sometime.

1034
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,368
You don't know.

1035
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,248
This city...

1036
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,375
what it does to people.

1037
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,782
I can't apologize enough...

1038
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,758
for...

1039
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,295
I don't know.

1040
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,263
I got this survival rush.

1041
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,799
You start to...

1042
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,767
You start to think
with your hands,

1043
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,235
not your...

1044
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:42,862
Like an animal.

1045
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:43,871
I just...

1046
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,737
Did I hurt you?

1047
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,572
No.

1048
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,060
What?

1049
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,660
What?

1050
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,282
What are you looking for?

1051

It was too late
to call you back.

Yeah, just a friend.

Ok, I'll be home...

1067

You're killing me.

1068

Is that the sun?

1069
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,123
Are we still alive?

1070

I thought you were
an insomniac.

I am.

1072
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,493
I must have fainted.

What are you doing there?

1074
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,276
I can't make you out.

1075

to a standing position.

But you, you're something.

last night in one piece.

I'm going home
to my daughter.

1099

She's with
your mother, right?

Mm-hmm.

It's ok.

No.

but you're a good man.

1120

You never know.

1121

I always know.

1122
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,836

who they really are.
