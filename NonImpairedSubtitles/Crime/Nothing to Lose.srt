1
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:47,074
Hello...
What are you up to?

2
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,290
Back off, ass!

3
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,582
You... you may not jump.
If you jump,

4
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:06,424
I’ll be in big trouble.
Please don’t.

5
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,709
What has that to do with you?

6
00:05:10,134 --> 00:05:13,829
Well, if you jump but I don’t,
then they will think I..

7
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:17,463
I've pushed you.
I would become your murderer.

8
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:24,252
That's your problem.
That's no concern of mine.

9
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:29,248
Don’t do it. Don’t do it.
Wait. Listen to me.

10
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,331
I don’t want to keep you from
jumping. Don’t get me wrong.

11
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,788
It’s just that I want to commit suicide too.

12
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,415
If you’re desperate to do it,
then,

13
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:49,122
then we should do it together.
Give me some time, OK?

14
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:53,415
Why should we do it together?

15
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:57,458
You can tell me that?
I don’t even know you.

16
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:00,713
I don’t want them thinking
we were a couple.

17
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,714
A couple that went mad.

18
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,880
What’s this staring?
Ah, now I understand you.

19
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:10,591
You’re not here to commit suicide, right?

20
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,171
You're not even wearing a shirt.
Are you here to sunbathe or what?

21
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,080
Or do you have a date with a girl

22
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,005
and want to sleep with her?

23
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:29,496
You’ve got a bad mouth,
you sassy goat.

24
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,168
You're off your rocker.
You’re sick.

25
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:35,792
Then, why don’t you jump,
I won’t hold you back.

26
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:39,503
I want you to jump first,
you sick ass-hole.

27
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:41,417
Jump! I want to watch.

28
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,252
You jump first.
- No, you jump first.

29
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:46,043
No, you first!
- You first!

30
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:48,704
No, you first!
- No, after you!

31
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,707
I decided not to jump today.

32
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,963
If I wouldn’t have lacked the courage
I would have done it.

33
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:18,588
I nearly did it.
- Why do you want to die anyway?

34
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,461
I have a lot of gambling debts.
There’s no point in living on.

35
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:28,213
And you? Why do you want to die?
Are you in the need of it?

36
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:35,381
Well, why not? It’s the same for me.
Everybody hates me. All are against me.

37
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:42,126
And of course I hate them too.

38
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,214
I ignore them.
They are unconcerned about me.

39
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:57,497
I’m tired of this game.
I don’t want to play it anymore.

40
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:03,839
Well, that really sounds terrible.

41
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:15,168
What now?
You still want to jump?

42
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,625
What about you?
- I’m too weak.

43
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:25,251
Then let’s go eat.
I’m really hungry.

44
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:28,502
Then you won’t jump?

45
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,004
Well, you just said it.
If you want to commit suicide

46
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,171
you need more strength.
And I’m too tired to jump.

47
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:35,788
I'm trembling with hunger.
You understand?

48
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,967
We'll make a decision after
we have had enough.

49
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:44,501
What’s your name?
- Somchai.

50
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,003
What?
- Somchai.

51
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,965
Hey, and you?
- Gogo.

52
00:09:42,717 --> 00:09:46,295
Why from that building?
You don’t even live there.

53
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:53,755
I don't know.
I just remember...

54
00:09:56,842 --> 00:09:59,627
Well, after I have lost all my money,

55
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,585
I wanted to commit suicide.

56
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:08,959
And as I closed to the building,
somebody,

57
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,882
it was a man,
he waved at me.

58
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,419
I entered the building.
Then he led me to the roof.

59
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:31,630
Now that I think about it,

60
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:35,834
he probably was a ghost.
Yes, I suppose that’s how it was.

61
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,045
That sounds mysterious.

62
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:48,914
You mean, he has known
about your death wish

63
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:53,002
and just wanted to help you die?
Maybe he wanted to screw you.

64
00:10:54,592 --> 00:11:01,916
Yes, maybe. Never mind.
He disappeared and I’m still living.

65
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:07,669
And what about you?

66
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:21,421
It’s all about money.
I owe someone 30,000 Dollar.

67
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:26,790
What, 30,000?! 30,000 Dollar?
What are you going to do now?

68
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,340
How do you want to pay it back?
- You’re an idiot, my sweetie.

69
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:33,086
I don't even think about paying back.

70
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:34,543
I’m not that dumb.

71
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:42,047
If I had the money
I would have some nice days

72
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:45,256
and then jump down some place.

73
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:48,505
Stop it. I’m getting...

74
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:10,795
What was wrong with you?
- Nothing. Had to make a call.

75
00:13:11,675 --> 00:13:15,586
I see.
- Have you paid?

76
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,214
You dumbass. Since when do the
dead have to pay for their meals?

77
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,706
He, he, he, he, he!
Was that you?

78
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:38,711
I was on the way to the toilet.
Haven’t managed to get there in time.

79
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:55,459
Hey! Nothing wrong about that.
Shit happens.

80
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,498
You didn’t eat for a long time,
the whole excitement,

81
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:00,920
the stomach doesn’t like that,
so he sends it all back.

82
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:03,790
It doesn’t concern you
that we have not paid.

83
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:06,496
But it seems to amuse you when I puke.

84
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:11,712
Seems like it bothers you the fact
that I’m in a good mood

85
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,164
and you’re not, you stinky sour puss.
I cannot listen to someone

86
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:16,373
Who’s going through life with such a kisser?

87
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:18,250
Look who’s talking.

88
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:21,382
Didn’t you want to chuck away
your life just now?

89
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:37,758
Hey, argue elsewhere ass-holes.
That’s my parking lot.

90
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:45,090
You said we aren’t afraid of death, right?

91
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,255
Maybe death is afraid of us?

92
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,920
C’mon, let’s drive.
- I don’t know

93
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:23,210
how to run this gear shift.
- I don’t know either.

94
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,925
What do we do now?
- We give the car back.

95
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:01,447
Where to?

96
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:22,233
What do we want to do? Where are
we driving to? You got an idea?

97
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:26,400
We’re going to a sunny place.
We will find something.

98
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:39,018
Hey, my money!
No, no, not so.

99
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:45,719
That makes 75 Baht.

100
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:58,671
Now you have seen them.
You owe me 25.

101
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,630
What? What do you mean?
- One look at my boobs costs 100.

102
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:05,835
I owe you 75 for the drive,
you then owe me 25. Right?

103
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,327
Say, do you want to pay
everything like that?

104
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,032
Then you’ll need other clothes, I guess.

105
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,076
Up yours, ass-hole!
Piss off!

106
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:29,238
Where are you going?
Into that bank?

107
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,815
You have money?
- Of course no.

108
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:38,155
I’ll get some. They have a lot.

109
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:58,305
Don’t worry, you can stay here.
I do it alone.

110
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:49,784
I want to take out my money
and close my account.

111
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,319
Understood. As you wish.

112
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:03,771
Hey, everything OK?

113
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:06,487
Don’t make such a face.

114
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,436
That’s my money, and I withdrew it.

115
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:11,687
You’re always in a bad mood.
It’s no fun with you.

116
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:14,400
I didn't know what you’re up to.

117
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:17,889
Yeah, right. You could have taken
the gun from the guard easily.

118
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:19,184
But you’re a coward.

119
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,141
What do you mean?
What should I do with the gun?

120
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:26,885
It was not my intention to steal,
but if, then we would be

121
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:30,975
in deep trouble.
- Where are we going now?

122
00:19:35,265 --> 00:19:39,921
I’m slowly beginning to like
your stupid questions.

123
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:53,295
A room for two?
- Yes. You got one?

124
00:19:54,589 --> 00:19:56,662
Please fill out this form

125
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,951
and read the rules of the house
on that wall over there.

126
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:08,702
Firstly: The rooms are only being rented

127
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:10,619
to persons aged at least 18.

128
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,407
Secondly: The guests have to specify
their profession and the reason of their stop.

129
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,363
Thirdly: The guests are not allowed
to carry a weapon or explosives.

130
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:24,985
Fourthly: Having sex is
only allowed on the beds.

131
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:31,768
Is this a monastery or a hotel?
Who cares?

132
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,349
The sex thing is only a joke, right?
Why only on the bed?

133
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:41,064
Never mind. Do it wherever you want to.

134
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,930
Agreed. That’s a nice cottage.

135
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,835
What’s your job?
- Job’s out.

136
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,135
And what’s your relationship?

137
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:13,915
Till now we’re just friends.
That could change soon.

138
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,910
Yes, she’s right.
We’ll soon be more than friends.

139
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:23,326
Hey, but you’re not here
to kill yourselves, right?

140
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:26,414
Are you deaf?
Think before speaking.

141
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,242
We’re here to make sex,
we told you.

142
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:34,530
For that I wouldn’t choose
such a miserable gin palace.

143
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:39,946
No, I have taste.
- And how long do you want to rent it?

144
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:48,566
For the time being 3 days.
- 500 Baht prepayment for 3 days.

145
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,440
C’mon. Show him what you’ve got.
I won’t look.

146
00:21:55,444 --> 00:22:04,303
Listen, he doesn’t go for that.
Looking good? So, here are the 500 Baht.

147
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:16,636
Feels good, aunt it?

148
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,166
What are you doing?

149
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:56,735
Did you rent the room just for the TV?

150
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:03,817
Yes. What are you thinking?
What we’re doing here, my friend?

151
00:23:04,908 --> 00:23:09,279
Did you really think
I rented this miserable hole

152
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:13,361
just for fucking you?
Poor you. Keep your trousers zipped.

153
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:14,778
Get lost, you pig! Don’t bother me!
I just don’t want to be alone

154
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:17,116
that’s all. No sex, understood?

155
00:24:23,202 --> 00:24:25,274
Don’t get any stupid ideas, boy.

156
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:57,629
Are you masturbating?

157
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,799
Feeling better now?
Then we can finally sleep.

158
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:21,502
Hey, I’m a normal man.
With normal needs. Understand?

159
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,793
And you are very sexy.

160
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:29,822
You should feel flattered.

161
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:35,201
I’m sorry,
I’m not keen on that.

162
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:42,526
Besides, I don’t trust you.
There’s something weird about you.

163
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:47,947
Where of are living?
You have gambling debts, you say?

164
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:52,114
Your damn passion for gambling has ruined you.

165
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:56,185
Can’t you quit it?
You won’t survive it.

166
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,481
I really tried to quit.

167
00:26:04,816 --> 00:26:08,973
It won’t work. I start again and again.
You cannot understand anyway.

168
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:13,770
Do you get high through gambling?

169
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:18,051
Explain it to me.
Is it as lustful as sex?

170
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,628
Much better.

171
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:23,548
And if you manage to win
then it’s even better

172
00:26:23,597 --> 00:26:27,590
then having sex with two hot women
at the same time.

173
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:38,415
Maybe that would be something for me.

174
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:43,704
Yes. Tell you what.
A lot of people gamble.

175
00:26:43,754 --> 00:26:47,615
Particularly rich people.
And there are no distinctions there.

176
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:51,119
I’m a regular. Everyone knows me.

177
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:57,286
Good service, nice atmosphere.
I win everytime.

178
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,367
Everyone watches me closely.

179
00:27:10,282 --> 00:27:15,186
You’re feeling like a hero.
A hero which gets celebrated by everyone.

180
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:26,020
If you weren’t at a casino like that
till now, you should go there.

181
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:27,890
Spades win again.

182
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:33,891
Then you will experience it yourself.
And you can’t get away thereof.

183
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:40,680
Tomorrow we will go there together.
- Seriously?

184
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:10,129
Oh no, you?
You’re still alive?

185
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:04,942
What’s up?
How much are we gonna place?

186
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:08,897
C’mon, let’s go.

187
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,824
But I don’t want to go.
Go alone if you want to.

188
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:46,044
You have lost everything. C’mon.
- Hey, I can’t go yet.

189
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:52,752
Is it possible to borrow money?
I’d like 5,000 Baht.

190
00:31:52,804 --> 00:31:54,130
Are you nuts?
- Shut up.

191
00:31:56,677 --> 00:32:02,836
Give me chips worth of 5,000 Baht.
Hey, you deaf or what?

192
00:32:02,924 --> 00:32:05,411
Or do you think I can’t pay back?

193
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:22,115
Why should I mistrust a beautiful girl like you?

194
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:26,487
She’s sweet. Besides, if I did,
he would vouch for you.

195
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:31,066
I’m sorry, but I’ve nothing to do with him.

196
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,195
We don’t belong together.

197
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:36,151
Ok, borrow as much as you want.
It’s free of interest.

198
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:42,652
Sweet. It’s free of interest. Awesome.
- But only for you, sweetie.

199
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,847
Don’t stare at my tits.
Give me the money!

200
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,556
Well, was it fun?
You’ve lost everything.

201
00:32:57,604 --> 00:33:01,891
It was great. I really had an amazing feeling.

202
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:04,848
Nearly as exciting as smoking weed
and sucking a dick simultaneously.

203
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:06,467
You understand what I mean?

204
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:10,762
You know you are in deep shit now?

205
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:13,671
You borrowed 5,000 Baht
which you have to pay back.

206
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,665
Is this clear in your mind? And forget
the free of interest thing.

207
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:19,874
He will present you a nice bill.

208
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:24,797
So what?
That’s no concern of yours, is it?

209
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,583
If you’re scared, piss off.
I can cope with it myself.

210
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,287
You have nothing to do with it.

211
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:46,614
Are you thinking about suicide again?
Why did we come here?

212
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:51,109
Well, maybe. But I want to change clothes first.

213
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,359
Wait outside. And don’t run away.

214
00:34:00,155 --> 00:34:01,730
You’re living here, eh?

215
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,103
Why do you behave in your own house
like a thief?

216
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,853
I’ve a shitload of fear of my boyfriend.

217
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:11,849
And now shut up and wait here.

218
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:31,388
Is Jackie here?

219
00:35:40,978 --> 00:35:44,722
What are you doing here?
- Nothing. Zilch.

220
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,674
Are you done with, eh,
stealing from yourself?

221
00:35:49,932 --> 00:35:53,222
Idiot! Mind your own business. Understood?

222
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:58,966
Where are you right now?

223
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:07,377
Who was it? Loan-shark?
- Nothing important. Let’s go.

224
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:42,898
Wait here. I have to go in there.
It shouldn’t take long.

225
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:32,455
Hello. Nice car.
- You think so?

226
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,660
If you have the time,
I can take you for a ride.

227
00:37:38,953 --> 00:37:41,902
Oh, why don’t you keep your hands off the women.

228
00:37:46,823 --> 00:37:49,903
How now? Why do you have so many wigs?

229
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:54,273
I like to look good.
That’s no concern of yours.

230
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:59,687
Go, change your clothes.
You stink, my sweetheart.

231
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,604
Is this your friends?

232
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,637
That even fits me.

233
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:25,499
Tell me, that crap really makes you high, huh?

234
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:28,874
You never did it?

235
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:34,707
It’s like an orgasm.

236
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:48,827
I feel light.
I’m weightless, without burdens.

237
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:51,577
Time seems to stop.

238
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:58,605
Sex is best if you’ve smoked weed beforehand.

239
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:02,475
Orgasms seems to last for hours.

240
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,560
When listening to the music,
you can hear tones

241
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:10,096
you've never heard before.

242
00:39:12,856 --> 00:39:17,096
And you’re doing things you hadn’t
the guts to do before.

243
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,637
Things you were afraid of.

244
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:23,721
By the way, I also smoked weed

245
00:39:23,766 --> 00:39:30,920
the day I wanted to jump down.
Wouldn’t have had the courage otherwise.

246
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:33,876
You get that high?

247
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:44,412
Stop getting on my nerves with
your questions. Smoke!

248
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:46,501
What’s got into you?

249
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:53,368
Well, how was it?

250
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:45,843
Who’s that?

251
00:41:58,924 --> 00:42:00,463
Oh, all of you are ass-holes.

252
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:18,943
You finished?

253
00:42:44,522 --> 00:42:47,139
What’s up?
- Nothing.

254
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:51,178
I’m making a routine check.
Also the rent is due.

255
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:56,627
Why are you crying, madam?
- What’s that to you?

256
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,000
These women.

257
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,295
Do you have to watch TV so early?

258
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:20,790
Go and have a shower.

259
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:29,989
Get your clothes on, we’re going out.
- Where to? Early morning exercise?

260
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:36,858
Funny. We’ll search for a cash machine.
- You still got money?

261
00:43:40,946 --> 00:43:42,900
Well, then let’s go.

262
00:43:50,357 --> 00:43:51,470
Good afternoon.

263
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,300
Go to her. Calm and friendly.

264
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:08,633
Pretend you wanna pay.

265
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:11,792
As she’s taking your money,
the drawer will open up.

266
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:14,379
Then take all the money and run.
Understood?

267
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:19,629
I will pretend chasing you.
Take the basket.

268
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:26,786
But you said we are here to take
money from the cash machine.

269
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,536
Money is money. Either it’s out
of the checkout or out of the cash machine.

270
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:34,077
What’s the difference?
We’re broke, sweetie.

271
00:44:34,123 --> 00:44:38,031
What do we need the money for?
Aren’t you paying by showing your tits?

272
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:42,399
Shut up. Haven't you heard?
The landlord wants the rent?

273
00:44:42,993 --> 00:44:45,314
And if we don’t pay,
we’ll have to sleep on the street.

274
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:49,272
You still,
you still can go home.

275
00:44:49,322 --> 00:44:51,359
I’m sorry, I can’t.

276
00:44:57,234 --> 00:45:00,515
Just do what I tell you.

277
00:45:00,566 --> 00:45:02,271
Or quit being attached to me like a limpet.

278
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:08,935
You have the better reflexes.
Let’s exchange appearances, ok?

279
00:45:10,352 --> 00:45:14,971
You're a man or what?
- I'm.. Yes, I’m a man.

280
00:45:15,932 --> 00:45:20,835
Do you have an idea how difficult it is
to keep my fingers away from you every night?

281
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,466
I don't care a pap for it.

282
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:29,966
Take the 100 Baht and go over.
I’m watching you. Go.

283
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:17,186
87.50 Baht, please.

284
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:53,066
I’ll be back.

285
00:47:08,448 --> 00:47:13,105
Stop! Stand still!
You’re good for nothing, you bugger.

286
00:47:13,157 --> 00:47:15,906
But you can run as fast as Ben Johnson.

287
00:47:20,073 --> 00:47:24,019
That was my first time.
Next time will be better.

288
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:30,279
Hey, here, that’s for you.
But last time

289
00:47:30,324 --> 00:47:33,239
you didn’t pay the rent.
Thus you get nothing now.

290
00:47:35,324 --> 00:47:40,444
It’s ok. I’m fine, as long as I’m alive
and got something to eat.

291
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:43,313
You mean it?
And you think you’re a man?

292
00:47:43,575 --> 00:47:46,940
Of course.
And I’m willing to demonstr...

293
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:49,148
Shut up! I can’t bear you anymore.

294
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,237
Somchai.
Where have you been?

295
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:01,315
Not again. Slow down.

296
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:11,943
Was that your girlfriend?
You’ve got queer taste.

297
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:17,154
She looks like an old cow.
But old cows also have something

298
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:20,898
interesting, I can understand you.
They surely have wonderful udders.

299
00:48:22,743 --> 00:48:27,068
Hey, if it amuses you that much
you can insult me,

300
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,866
but leave her out of the game, ok?

301
00:48:43,577 --> 00:48:48,281
There you are. 80,000 Baht.
That’s all I have. I’m sorry.

302
00:48:50,036 --> 00:48:54,574
This is the last time
I’m paying your debts, Somchai.

303
00:48:55,036 --> 00:48:56,529
What do you want?

304
00:48:56,744 --> 00:49:01,117
You haven’t changed in the last ten years.

305
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:05,404
You made more and more debts.
How should this go on?

306
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:08,943
Er, you want to order something?
- You have to...

307
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,571
Some water please.

308
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:30,198
Sister, I understand you’re hating me
- I don’t hate you.

309
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:35,780
We belong together.
I’d always help you.

310
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:37,988
Even if you’re problems get worse.

311
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:58,197
Whatever mistakes you make.
I never hate you.

312
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,161
I’m plainly disappointed.

313
00:50:33,165 --> 00:50:37,029
Next week’s your birthday.
Here’s a shirt from my shop.

314
00:50:37,082 --> 00:50:41,325
A gift. I hope,
when wearing this shirt,

315
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:45,866
you’ll be starting a new life.
Happy birthday, your sister.

316
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:22,583
Okay. Stop the tape right here.

317
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:27,910
And play back slowly.

318
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:35,452
Okay, stop here.

319
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:40,283
Did you notice?
That guy is totally calm.

320
00:51:40,335 --> 00:51:44,578
Everything was planned thorough.
Looks like he isn’t involved at all,

321
00:51:44,627 --> 00:51:47,032
but that’s not true.
It was all planned.

322
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:52,326
Even the thing with the sanitary napkin.
He began

323
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:56,323
by distracting the till girl.
He distracted her with the sanitary napkin,

324
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:59,210
yes, I’m sure,
whilst the drawer was open.

325
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:02,583
And then came the woman.
She came out of the blue.

326
00:52:04,169 --> 00:52:07,997
She caught the till girl off guard.
And now the most awesome part.

327
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:21,827
What did he tell her?
- You young people don’t have a clue.

328
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,202
During my internship at the FBI

329
00:52:27,254 --> 00:52:31,828
I learnt lip-reading.
Therefore I can see,

330
00:52:31,879 --> 00:52:34,960
what he said before leaving.

331
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:43,832
It’s clearly to see:
I’ll... be... back.

332
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:49,251
That’s what a character
out of a Maverick comic would say.

333
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:53,831
He knows, that the police will look at this,

334
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,787
and that there are people like me.

335
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:58,409
He wants to take on the police of Bangkok.

336
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:02,872
Get to work! Keep everyone busy with this case.

337
00:53:02,922 --> 00:53:05,873
Understood? The compound
is being monitored constantly.

338
00:53:05,922 --> 00:53:09,619
Bring their stories to me.
Open up a file with the name,

339
00:53:09,755 --> 00:53:14,993
Moment, Bonnie and Clyde.
- Understood.

340
00:53:17,172 --> 00:53:21,166
I well get you two.
You’ll be surprised.

341
00:53:26,089 --> 00:53:28,792
So, that was your sister.
She’s worried about you.

342
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,375
Anyway, she didn’t forget your birthday.

343
00:53:33,465 --> 00:53:35,788
But don’t tell me the date.

344
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:39,121
I have no gift for you.

345
00:53:58,007 --> 00:54:00,792
Nothing in the news about us.
It’s too early.

346
00:54:03,466 --> 00:54:06,334
Don’t bother me.
I just want to know

347
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:09,002
who has died today.
Do you get it?

348
00:54:09,675 --> 00:54:12,377
Hey, why do you have to be so bitchy?

349
00:54:14,258 --> 00:54:16,545
Bitchy is much better than heartless.

350
00:54:32,759 --> 00:54:36,207
Listen to me. A good man wouldn’t abandon you.

351
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:39,542
But most men do it
because they are not good.

352
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:44,467
Why, why don’t you search elsewhere?

353
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,626
Can men really understand what women want?

354
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:49,750
Is that possible?

355
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,509
Who do you think I am?
- You don’t know yourself.

356
00:54:56,135 --> 00:54:58,884
You can find something with me,
that no man can give you.

357
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:04,673
I’m hungry. I have to eat.

358
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,385
Pay day, guys. Your time limit is over.

359
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,840
Pay or else you will regret it.
With interest that makes up 20,000 Baht.

360
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:41,759
What? Why so much?

361
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:44,375
I told ya.
Do you understand now?

362
00:55:46,971 --> 00:55:49,459
I don’t have the money now.
Give me two days.

363
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:54,050
Yeah, right. Only two days.
Tell your boss that's what I said.

364
00:55:54,096 --> 00:55:56,217
I’m one of his regulars.

365
00:55:56,638 --> 00:55:59,470
Tell him yourself.
I’m curious if he believes you.

366
00:56:11,055 --> 00:56:15,096
We will find a way.
You have sex with me,

367
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,888
and that’s for the interest.
I’ll be nice to you.

368
00:56:21,097 --> 00:56:25,470
That’s, that’s not right.
That’s not as per agreement.

369
00:56:26,597 --> 00:56:29,086
I was there. All without interest.

370
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:32,926
Do you have the money? Than pay.
- Yes,

371
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:38,886
Yes, first 300 Baht.

372
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:46,342
Boot him out.
- Wait, wait, I raise it.

373
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:50,715
Where do you bring him to? Where?
- Where to? What do you think?

374
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:58,803
You impotent old man want to shag me?
You pig!

375
00:57:00,724 --> 00:57:04,054
Beware. I’ll bite your dick off.

376
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:04,260
What’s up? Doesn’t your old noodle
want to get up?

377
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:11,097
Hey, give me back my girlfriend.
That’s enough money

378
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:12,390
to buy her free.

379
00:59:20,105 --> 00:59:23,850
Fuck it. Nobody goes,
not until I’m done with this bitch.

380
00:59:30,105 --> 00:59:35,687
Somchai! Help me!

381
00:59:45,273 --> 00:59:49,895
That’s not enough. That’s not even
enough for Somchais interest.

382
00:59:50,273 --> 00:59:52,062
Are you a man?

383
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:55,437
I helped you last time,
even though I had no money myself.

384
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:36,769
How dare touch my girl, you pig!

385
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:32,814
Thank you, for rescuing me.
- That wasn’t the first time.

386
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:36,984
I don’t know. Maybe I saved you last time.

387
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,230
I wanted to kill him for a long time.

388
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:49,481
Why?
- Nothing. Not important.

389
01:01:59,445 --> 01:02:06,355
You know what? I changed my opinion of you.

390
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:12,229
Why? What’s different?
- You were brave.

391
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:24,233
I have no fear. No fear of death.

392
01:02:26,196 --> 01:02:32,063
What of should I be afraid of?
Sometimes it’s possible to do everything.

393
01:02:32,113 --> 01:02:38,644
Everything. As long as you take
responsibility for your doings.

394
01:02:44,905 --> 01:02:48,353
That sounds sophisticated.
Go down one step.

395
01:02:50,739 --> 01:02:55,064
Oh, I’m just talking nonsense.
That’s the shock from before.

396
01:02:57,823 --> 01:03:02,196
Listen, we don’t rob shops anymore, ok?

397
01:03:02,948 --> 01:03:04,405
I have a lot of money and chips.

398
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:08,739
Really? How much?
Have you counted?

399
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:16,562
Not bad.

400
01:03:18,032 --> 01:03:21,030
Maybe we should bring it to the bank
and live from the interest.

401
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:27,274
Clean everything up.

402
01:03:55,325 --> 01:03:58,240
Chief. Upstairs are 3 more dead bodies.

403
01:04:11,576 --> 01:04:12,985
Are there any witnesses?

404
01:04:14,493 --> 01:04:17,775
Yes. They say it were a man
and a woman, Chief.

405
01:04:17,868 --> 01:04:21,150
But only the man has shot.
One witness can describe him.

406
01:04:21,243 --> 01:04:24,905
We’ll catch him.
- A man and a woman.

407
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:32,612
That guy has murdered 8 people
Each of them with one bullet.

408
01:04:36,827 --> 01:04:38,450
Very professional.

409
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,368
One man and one woman?

410
01:04:43,744 --> 01:04:46,067
Excuse me, did you see the shooting?

411
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:49,070
Step back. Our witness.
There he is.

412
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:52,408
Did you see the murderers,
the man and the woman?

413
01:04:52,453 --> 01:04:55,119
Yes, I did.
- And could you describe them?

414
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:03,034
They were, well...

415
01:05:05,953 --> 01:05:09,070
Excuse, which broadcast station
is this? Is it live?

416
01:05:09,162 --> 01:05:10,536
I’ll answer immediately.

417
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:13,316
Yes, this is ITV Live.
That’s a live broadcast.

418
01:05:13,745 --> 01:05:18,865
Okay. They were out of the ordinary.
A great couple. Really cool.

419
01:05:20,162 --> 01:05:23,658
The man looked a bit mean
but the woman had style.

420
01:05:23,746 --> 01:05:26,779
They came in and went directly
into the room over there.

421
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:29,116
Later on, they shot their way back out.

422
01:05:29,163 --> 01:05:31,153
The man wore sunglasses.

423
01:05:31,204 --> 01:05:34,037
And he shot with one gun in each hand.

424
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,410
Yes, he looked even cooler then
the guys in Hollywood movies.

425
01:05:38,663 --> 01:05:40,819
Before he left he said something to me.

426
01:05:42,788 --> 01:05:46,485
What did he say?
- He said...

427
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:49,905
You shall gamble no longer.

428
01:05:49,955 --> 01:05:54,862
Oh, and then he threw me a chip worth 10,000 Baht.

429
01:06:14,665 --> 01:06:18,445
They think about themselves as modern Robin Hoods.

430
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:23,118
You know what to do.
- Yes, Sir.

431
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:27,324
Where were you during the shooting?

432
01:06:27,832 --> 01:06:30,949
Luckily I had to go to the toilet before it started.

433
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:33,120
When I came back they already had left.

434
01:06:33,207 --> 01:06:37,865
I simply had luck. Really.
Or else they surely would have killed me.

435
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:40,573
Or I could have handled them.

436
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:15,412
Hey, wake up. C’mon, wake up.
We’re on the first page.

437
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:31,786
Shit! What are we going to do now?

438
01:07:32,168 --> 01:07:35,783
We have to go to the motel. C’mon.
- To the motel? Why there?

439
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:37,198
I have got to get my shirt.

440
01:07:38,752 --> 01:07:41,584
Your shirt? Now that’s important.

441
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,539
Fair enough. I have to go there too.
My papers are still there.

442
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:57,041
What’s now? Is this your brother?

443
01:08:00,336 --> 01:08:04,200
It’s too dark, I can’t see anything.
Turn on the light.

444
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:14,294
If I say no, can I go then?

445
01:08:15,545 --> 01:08:19,491
I verified it. You're his only relative.

446
01:08:20,753 --> 01:08:25,162
And he’s also your only relative.
Your brother has no criminal record.

447
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:29,003
He had a lot of small jobs,
nothing that last long.

448
01:08:29,087 --> 01:08:34,373
Your father was an officer at the army.
Did he show your brother how to shoot?

449
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:39,541
I’m sorry. When Somchai was born,
my father was already dead.

450
01:08:40,004 --> 01:08:42,291
Did he like to play with weapons as a child?

451
01:08:43,046 --> 01:08:45,961
No, he loved to play with marbles.

452
01:08:46,963 --> 01:08:50,411
Madam, I hope you will help us.

453
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:56,661
I’m sorry, I have nothing to say. Nothing.

454
01:08:57,547 --> 01:08:59,621
You know more about him as I do.

455
01:09:01,005 --> 01:09:05,710
Better use your time finding him
instead of talking to me.

456
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:08,545
I have no more to say.

457
01:09:08,589 --> 01:09:13,922
If you capture him I don’t have to it. Thanks.

458
01:10:04,925 --> 01:10:09,049
And now to some news that shocked the public.

459
01:10:09,716 --> 01:10:11,791
For already a longer period

460
01:10:11,842 --> 01:10:13,962
the neighbours have determined a curious smell.

461
01:10:14,383 --> 01:10:17,050
Now a female dead body has been found
wrapped in plastic.

462
01:10:17,425 --> 01:10:19,084
Isn’t that your apartment?
That’s impossible.

463
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:22,707
Look at that.
Come here. Look!

464
01:10:24,717 --> 01:10:28,462
The police has also found a picture
of another woman that lived here.

465
01:10:29,634 --> 01:10:32,087
That woman is aged about 20.

466
01:10:33,676 --> 01:10:37,042
The neighbours describe her
as being inconspicuous, friendly

467
01:10:37,093 --> 01:10:40,707
and living a very secluded life.
As it appears to be,

468
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:45,547
none of the tenants remember talking
to her, not even once.

469
01:10:45,593 --> 01:10:47,667
Also about friends and relatives...

470
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,677
Who’s that? She looks like you.

471
01:11:29,512 --> 01:11:33,257
Now I know why you always change your appearance.

472
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,424
I, I didn’t want to kill her.

473
01:11:39,887 --> 01:11:43,253
She used me and then threw me away.

474
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:46,673
She taught me to mistrust men.

475
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:54,299
I didn’t want to kill her.
She destroyed my life.

476
01:11:56,596 --> 01:11:59,263
You don’t need to explain.
I understand.

477
01:11:59,305 --> 01:12:01,094
We can’t stay here any longer.

478
01:12:03,096 --> 01:12:06,213
You killed one human, I killed eight.

479
01:12:06,305 --> 01:12:08,379
That doesn’t make a difference anymore.

480
01:12:15,389 --> 01:12:18,091
Shit! This shirt brings bad luck.

481
01:12:41,348 --> 01:12:46,385
Hi. Do I speak with the police?
Yes, I’m calling because of Bonnie and Clyde.

482
01:12:48,557 --> 01:12:51,176
Oh, do you give a reward for the information?

483
01:12:52,432 --> 01:12:54,174
You pig!

484
01:13:05,974 --> 01:13:08,048
Gogo, here!

485
01:13:42,642 --> 01:13:43,970
I'll get it going this time.

486
01:14:32,686 --> 01:14:37,225
Help, help! The two over there,
in the car, they are Bonnie and Clyde.

487
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,681
Shut the motor off and
get out of the car.

488
01:14:49,104 --> 01:14:56,973
Gogo, it’s over.
Our goose is cooked. C’mon.

489
01:15:15,313 --> 01:15:19,852
Get out of the car. Immediately!
Don’t fool around. Hands up!

490
01:16:32,233 --> 01:16:33,939
Get in, quick!

491
01:16:36,817 --> 01:16:39,566
Please be cautious with my car.

492
01:16:49,651 --> 01:16:52,649
I hope he won’t die.
- He’s a cop.

493
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:55,560
Injuring him or killing him is the same.

494
01:16:57,734 --> 01:17:01,810
Even so he shouldn’t die.
I don't want him to die.

495
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:04,941
But we’ve arrived at the point of no return.

496
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:15,144
One last time
we can put all one’s eggs in the basket.

497
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:22,641
If we succeed we can resume.
If not...

498
01:17:22,694 --> 01:17:25,313
...we will resume too, but elsewhere.
Understood?

499
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:28,687
I first have to meet someone.

500
01:17:34,361 --> 01:17:37,359
A police officer was injured at 36. Street.

501
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:40,152
The suspects are Bonnie and Clyde.
All units search for

502
01:17:40,194 --> 01:17:45,148
a red cabrio, license number: CU 70-14.

503
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,444
Why don’t you look at me?

504
01:18:10,571 --> 01:18:15,643
They’re searching after you.
And you have the heart to come here?

505
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:19,479
I... I have to tell you something.

506
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:38,482
I, I didn’t listen to you earlier.

507
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,153
That wasn’t right.

508
01:18:43,155 --> 01:18:46,154
I thought, gambling would enrich my life.

509
01:18:52,031 --> 01:18:56,523
That you don’t have to work hard.
That there’s always another way.

510
01:18:57,781 --> 01:19:01,277
I didn’t know that gambling
would make everything worse.

511
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:07,151
Somchai, I never felt that my life is

512
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:10,445
hard or unbearable.
I like working.

513
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:14,239
I also think,
you should not run after money.

514
01:19:15,615 --> 01:19:18,282
How much can you spend in life?

515
01:19:19,282 --> 01:19:25,480
Tell me. Why are you gambling?

516
01:19:26,949 --> 01:19:29,698
And at the end -
just look at yourself.

517
01:19:29,741 --> 01:19:34,197
You don’t even have enough money
to buy some new shoes.

518
01:19:36,991 --> 01:19:42,147
It’s some kind of disease.
Don’t allow it, it would be a shame

519
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,402
if you sneer at yourself some day.

520
01:19:50,408 --> 01:19:58,065
Don’t worry. Everything is going to be alright.
I won’t disappoint you anymore.

521
01:19:58,909 --> 01:20:03,483
I’ll pay back all debts.
You can count on that.

522
01:20:07,034 --> 01:20:10,613
Yes, I know,
you have to hate me.

523
01:20:16,576 --> 01:20:23,699
And that’s terrible for me....
Forgive me.

524
01:21:40,997 --> 01:21:45,986
Hello!
Have your brother been here recently?

525
01:21:49,289 --> 01:21:52,322
How old are you?
- 45.

526
01:21:53,289 --> 01:21:57,532
I didn’t know someone aged 45
could ask such stupid questions.

527
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:10,913
Which one are we going to?
- Let us go to your bank.

528
01:22:10,998 --> 01:22:13,617
Well, then I’ll need a bigger bag.

529
01:22:29,165 --> 01:22:31,619
Hey, you haven’t paid yet.

530
01:22:35,457 --> 01:22:37,033
Rest’s for you. Have a nice day.

531
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:51,956
You know you’re cocky?
- You shouldn’t hide good things.

532
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,448
Besides I want the men to remember me.

533
01:22:58,417 --> 01:23:03,204
Interesting. When did you stop liking men?

534
01:23:18,084 --> 01:23:20,240
You wait here. I do it.

535
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,495
Next please.

536
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,617
I want to open an account.
- What kind of account do you mean?

537
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:57,868
I want you to transfer
all the money to my account.

538
01:24:50,838 --> 01:24:55,496
Listen carefully.
All exits are being monitored.

539
01:24:55,547 --> 01:24:57,336
Surrender immediately.

540
01:25:42,507 --> 01:25:44,747
You, down there, I have to tell you something.

541
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:51,506
We've only got the bank manager.
All other hostages are free.

542
01:25:52,466 --> 01:25:56,412
I don’t want bloodshed.
Send someone upstairs

543
01:25:56,466 --> 01:26:01,005
who’s got the authority to negotiate
so we can find a solution.

544
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:04,132
I repeat. All can be solved peacefully.

545
01:26:04,508 --> 01:26:08,205
Whom are we going to send now?
The negotiator hasn’t arrived yet.

546
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,289
I wanted to meet the two anyway.

547
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:22,212
How are you doing?
Are you seriously injured?

548
01:26:23,051 --> 01:26:27,459
Don’t worry. I surely won’t die this way.

549
01:26:29,676 --> 01:26:33,421
Mister, please don’t kill me.
I have a wife and two children,

550
01:26:33,468 --> 01:26:35,791
they need me.
Please don’t do me any harm.

551
01:26:37,051 --> 01:26:41,424
Relax. I only kill people who deserve it.

552
01:26:43,551 --> 01:26:46,419
Behave and nothing will happen to you.

553
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:50,588
Stop it and let the man go.

554
01:27:51,596 --> 01:27:54,049
Keeping him as a hostage is useless.

555
01:27:54,096 --> 01:27:56,798
You won’t get away with that.
Listen to me.

556
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,092
How old are you, commissar?
- Forty...

557
01:28:06,388 --> 01:28:11,010
I don’t have to answer questions.
From now on I do the asking.

558
01:28:11,597 --> 01:28:14,346
Understood? I question and you answer.

559
01:28:16,597 --> 01:28:19,548
I wouldn’t be sure about that.
Listen.

560
01:28:19,597 --> 01:28:23,294
You don’t seem to realize
how bad your position is.

561
01:28:25,181 --> 01:28:27,848
Namely we have nothing to lose.

562
01:28:28,723 --> 01:28:31,637
I could pick you off easily, ass-hole.

563
01:28:40,765 --> 01:28:45,802
Somchai, listen to me.
You can still start over.

564
01:28:48,182 --> 01:28:49,924
It’s too late for that.

565
01:28:52,265 --> 01:28:55,180
I promised to pay all my debts.

566
01:28:55,599 --> 01:28:56,843
And I will keep my promise.

567
01:29:20,267 --> 01:29:27,804
Hopefully it’s enough,
'cause I won’t be able to get more.

568
01:29:39,559 --> 01:29:47,891
I’m sorry, I ruined your shirt.

569
01:29:54,143 --> 01:30:00,389
Somchai,
I want to tell you,

570
01:30:04,102 --> 01:30:10,763
that I never ever sneered at you.

571
01:30:24,561 --> 01:30:26,219
You know,

572
01:30:28,853 --> 01:30:31,555
I just happened to like men again because of you.

573
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:36,430
Thanks.

574
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:42,558
So what’s your decision?

575
01:30:46,812 --> 01:30:48,905
We are going to fly.
