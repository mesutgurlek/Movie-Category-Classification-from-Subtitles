1
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Excuse me.

2
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,900
Excuse me!

3
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,200
Are you Doctor Margaret Ford?

4
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,800
Yes.

5
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,700
Could I ask you, would you sign my book?

6
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
Yes, of course.

7
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,200
I recognised you from your picture.

8
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,100
- I hope I'm not inconveniencing you.
- Not at all.

9
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,700
It's for a friend.
It's the second one I bought.

10
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,100
Then I'm doubly pleased.
Thank you for buying it.

11
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
You've helped me very much.

12
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm very glad I have.

13
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Thank you.

14
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,700
Goodbye.

15
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,200
And I saw the face of an animal.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
And I said that we all try
to run from experience -

17
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,800
from experience, do you understand me? -
but that it will seek us out.

18
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,900
You think that you're exempt?

19
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,700
I'm talking to you.
Do you think that you're exempt?

20
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Do I think that I'm exempt?
That I'm exempt from what?

21
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,200
- Experience.
- No, I don't think that I'm exempt.

22
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,900
Well, you'd better be assured you're not.

23
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,100
- What is the animal?
- The animal?

24
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,000
You said in your dream,
you saw the face of an animal.

25
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,000
- I don't know how to say it. It was...
- Yes?

26
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,600
It was a... I...

27
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,100
I want to say...

28
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,300
I don't know how to say it.

29
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,700
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- That's OK.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
You've eaten. Good.

31
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,700
- How are you today, Maggie?
- I'm fine.

32
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,000
Listen to this.

33
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,400
In her dream, she saw a foreign animal.

34
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,600
"What is the animal?"
She cannot think of the name.

35
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,700
The animal is saying
"I am only trying to do good."

36
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,300
I say "What name comes up
when you think of this animal?"

37
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,100
- She says...
- Yes?

38
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,800
"It is a lurg. It is called a lurg."

39
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,900
If we invert "lurg", a "lurg" is a "girl".

40
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,600
So she is the animal and she is saying
"I'm just trying to do good."

41
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,300
And now someone has hurt her.

42
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,900
Good, Maggie.
Good for you. Good work.

43
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,600
- And now, what are you going to eat?
- I don't have time.

44
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,900
It's so beautiful.
It's old and it's heavy.

45
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,100
It looks like someone gave it to you.

46
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,700
- I think the only pressures in my life...
- The only what?

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,200
- I'm sorry?
- You said "the only pressures".

48
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,200
- Pleasures. I said "pleasures".
- No. What you said was "pressures".

49
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,800
This is what I'm telling you.

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,900
Many things that should
be pleasures are not.

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,300
Your book is a best seller,
your income jumps up.

52
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,400
People think of you differently perhaps.
This is confusing.

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,300
Listen to me. Slow down.
Try to enjoy your success.

54
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Give yourself all the rewards
you would like to have.

55
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,300
You see a beautiful gold lighter.

56
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,900
Buy one for yourself.

57
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,600
Your friend asks you to lunch.

58
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,900
Go and eat lunch with her.

59
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,000
- Do you forgive me?
- No.

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Bye.

61
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,400
Go work.

62
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,700
- A sort of a...
- A what?

63
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,200
I don't know.
A feeling of nothingness.

64
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,200
- What does that make you think of?
- Leave me alone, for Christ's sake.

65
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,100
What does it matter? It's in my head
or not, it doesn't make a difference.

66
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,400
- Billy...
- What? I'm entitled to my feelings?

67
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,900
What the hell does it matter?

68
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,300
It matters if you're going to cure yourself.

69
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,400
If I'm going to cure myself?

70
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
- And what do I do now?
- What do you do now?

71
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,600
No, what do I do today?
What do I do tomorrow?

72
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,300
Today and tomorrow, you say this:

73
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,400
"I am a compulsive gambler.
The reasons for this are in the past."

74
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,700
Oh, man. I don't know.
What am I doing here?

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,200
You're here to take control of your life.

76
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,100
You wanna know something?

77
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
What the hell do you care?

78
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,200
You're rich. You're comfortable.
You got your goddamn book you wrote.

79
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,200
All the time you wanna help me,
you don't do dick, man.

80
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,100
You and your goddamn book, it's talk.
It's just talk.

81
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
The whole thing is a con game.

82
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,500
You do nothing.
This doesn't help me.

83
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,000
You want to help me?
You want to help me?

84
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,400
Help me with this.

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,900
Help me with this if you can.
Because if not, I gotta use it.

86
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,200
- To use it for what?
- Aren't you gonna ask me, is it loaded?

87
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,300
- To use it for what?
- To use it to kill myself, or...

88
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,700
- Why would you wanna kill yourself?
- What do you think this is? Some dream?

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,100
Man, you're living in the dream.
Your questions!

90
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,100
- Cos there is a real world.
- What happened to you in that world?

91
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
- What happened to you?
- What difference does it make?

92
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,200
You say you want to help. You can't cos,
babe, you don't know what trouble is.

93
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,200
Give me the gun... and I will help you.

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,900
Billy.

95
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,700
Billy. I swear to you.

96
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,300
You give me the gun,
and I will help you.

97
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,000
I just lost $25,000 that I do not have.

98
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,000
And if I do not pay it by tomorrow,
they are going to kill me.

99
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:47,200
Now, what kind of help
is your damn promise now?

100
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,300
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. I need a match.

101
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,400
- You want a partner to play something?
- I'm looking for Mike.

102
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
- Who's Mike?
- Would you get him for me?

103
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
- I don't think Mike is here.
- Why don't you go take a look?

104
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
What the fuck is it?

105
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm looking for Mike.

106
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,300
Mike isn't here. What do you want?

107
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,300
- A friend of mine...
- Cut to the chase. I'm very busy.

108
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
- Why do you want Mike?
- I'm telling you and you're Mike.

109
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,700
- You threatened to kill a friend of mine...
- Is that what I did?

110
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,200
That's exactly what you did, Mike.
That behaviour doesn't go.

111
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,300
Whether you mean it or not,
and it's irrelevant to me,

112
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
cos you aren't going to do it.

113
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,400
This is a sick kid.
He's a compulsive gambler...

114
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,100
Wait. What is this?
What are you gonna do to me?

115
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,800
If I'm this bad dude, why don't I take out
some gun and blow you to bits?

116
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,700
I'll tell you why.
I think you're just a bully.

117
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
"Just a bully"?

118
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,100
What? You're not gonna
let me carry your books?

119
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,800
- Aren't you a caution?
- Let's talk turkey, pal.

120
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,200
One, you threatened to kill my friend.

121
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,900
You aren't going to do that.
Cos if you do, you're going away for life.

122
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,300
Two is the money. He hasn't got it.

123
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,600
- Who is this friend?
- Billy Hahn.

124
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,400
- Billy Hahn. He lost how much to me?
- Come on. $25,000.

125
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,500
$25,000 Billy Hahn has lost to me.

126
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Excuse me one moment, will you?

127
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,700
You say Billy Hahn lost 25 large to me?

128
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm showing you this cos I like you, OK?

129
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Cos you got blonde hair.

130
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,000
You're looking at Billy Hahn's IOU. OK?

131
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,100
Billy Hahn owes me 800 bucks.

132
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,000
- In or out?
- Deal past me.

133
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,500
OK?

134
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,800
How did you size me up so quick

135
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,900
that I'm not some hard guy
who's gonna rough you up?

136
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,400
- I don't know. In my work...
- What work is that?

137
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,100
It's none of your business.

138
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,200
- In or out?
- Out.

139
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Oh, it's none of my business?

140
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,800
OK. Then I stand corrected.

141
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,500
Here's the thing.

142
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,600
- I want something from you.
- What do you want?

143
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,800
- I want you to do me a favour.
- Why should I do you a favour?

144
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,700
If you do, I'll forget the 800
your friend owes me.

145
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,600
- What do you want?
- Let's talk for a minute.

146
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,900
What is it?

147
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,000
- Do you know what a "tell" is?
- A "tell"?

148
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,400
Here. Do this.

149
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,900
You have to choose a hand.
You do it to me. Do it.

150
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Bingo. Do it again.

151
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
OK. Now, I can do that all day.

152
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,500
How? You got a "tell". You're telling
me the hand that has the coin.

153
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,900
- I am? How?
- It's not important.

154
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,400
OK, it's your nose. You point your nose
slightly at the hand that has the coin. OK?

155
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,500
That's a tell.

156
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,500
Now, look back over my shoulder.
The guy in a beard and a cowboy shirt.

157
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,100
- You see him?
- Yes.

158
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,600
He's from Las Vegas. He's been
beating me all night. He's got a tell.

159
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,400
When he's bluffing,
he plays with his little gold ring.

160
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,300
I caught him doing it. He knows I did,
so he stopped. He's conscious of himself.

161
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,200
- I want you to do me this favour.
- What's that?

162
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,600
Be my girlfriend for a while.
Come in the game, watch me play.

163
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,700
We get in a big hand. I go to go pee,

164
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,100
you watch this guy and tell me,
does he play with his gold ring?

165
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,800
Then I know he's bluffing, I win the big
hand and forget the 800 your friend owes.

166
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,700
If you're a good gambler,
how did you fall into this?

167
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,400
- I'm not a gambler.
- You're not a gambler?

168
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,300
- No.
- What are you, then?

169
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,300
I made you a deal. I'll tear up
your friend's marker if you help me out.

170
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Will you do that?

171
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
All right.

172
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,300
Two.

173
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,100
Three.

174
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,700
- One card.
- The man takes one.

175
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
Dealer takes three.

176
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,400
I bet a hundred.

177
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Call.

178
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Call.

179
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,600
Up 200.

180
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,700
Here we go.

181
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Your three, and five more.

182
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,700
- Call.
- Pass.

183
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,300
The guy's got a full house, you got two
pair, you're in an indefensible position.

184
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,700
It's good that I can joke about it, isn't it?
I'm out. You drove me out.

185
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,100
A man with style
is a man who can smile.

186
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,300
How are you?
Are you having a good time?

187
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,600
- Never better.
- Glad to hear it.

188
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
- Out.
- I'm out.

189
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,100
Damn cards are cold as ice.

190
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,900
- Full house.
- New hand.

191
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,800
- Did you win again?
- That's right.

192
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,800
You wanna win the hand,
you gotta stay in till the end.

193
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
Thank you.

194
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,300
- You're gonna help me out here?
- Yes.

195
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,800
Keep looking for the tell.

196
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,800
If he plays with his ring,
I'm gonna gut that son of a bitch.

197
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,000
- Can we deal?
- Deal, say the losers.

198
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,900
The man says
you gotta give action to get action.

199
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,100
I've heard that too.

200
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,900
I bet the flush, the flush don't
come. I slow-play chips, nobody calls.

201
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,400
- A new hand and a winner.
- Budge over, will you?

202
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,900
Everybody stays, everybody pays.
Here they come.

203
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,500
I bet the fifty.

204
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,700
I call.

205
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,400
And 50 back.

206
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Fold.

207
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
100, and 200 more.

208
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,800
I call.

209
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
200, I call it.

210
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,100
Cards to the players. Three good players.

211
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,300
Mike?

212
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,400
One card.

213
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,100
Al?

214
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
One moment.

215
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
I'll take three.

216
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,200
One card.

217
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,900
I pass.

218
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What's the pot? 2, 4, 5... 800 dollars.

219
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,600
That's my bet.

220
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,700
- I call it.
- You call?

221
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
You only call?

222
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
Well, let's go visit Mr More.

223
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Your 800.

224
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,800
And I raise 2500 bucks.

225
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,300
I can't stand it.
South. I'm going south.

226
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,200
South Street Seaport, the man says.

227
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,800
He can't stand the heat. He can't stand it.

228
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,000
You wanna play cards?
The bet is two and a half thou.

229
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,300
The bet? I'll tell you what the bet is.

230
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,600
Your 25.

231
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,400
And I raise you $6,000.

232
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,800
You son of a bitch. You've been
steamrollin' over me all night.

233
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
One card, and you caught a flush?
A boat? What?

234
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,400
I think you're bluffin'.
I think you're tryin' to buy it.

235
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,900
You're gonna have to give me
some respect or give me some money.

236
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,700
- The bet is $6,000.
- I know what the goddamn bet is.

237
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,400
I'm going to pee.

238
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,200
Watch my cards.

239
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,200
- I thought you were gonna bring me luck.
- Make your own luck.

240
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Takin' change.

241
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,600
I think I might
have to go to the well again.

242
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Yes, yes, yes.

243
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,200
Some people say one thing,
some people say something else.

244
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,800
The man can't play,
he should stay away.

245
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,600
His money
is as good as yours is.

246
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,800
His money is.
Now we're gonna see about his cards.

247
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,600
That's right, Miss, isn't it?

248
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Now we're gonna see his hand.

249
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,200
How are you doing, Miss?
Are you bringing him good fortune?

250
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,700
Excuse me?

251
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,800
Who do you like in this hand? Him or me?

252
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,500
- Leave the woman alone.
- Just making conversation.

253
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,600
Who do you like in this showdown?
Your friend or me?

254
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,300
Well, I've seen his hand,
but I haven't seen yours.

255
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,300
That's right.

256
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,100
That's absolutely right.

257
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,900
OK, let's play some cards.

258
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Now, the bet is what?

259
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,600
You're raised $6,000, Mike.

260
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,300
Mike, how you feeling?
You ready to take this guy's money?

261
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,300
- He's bluffing.
- You saw him?

262
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,500
He did what you said.
He played with his ring.

263
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,000
He did? Well, he'd better be,

264
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,500
- cos I don't have the six, and if I lose...
- You aren't going to.

265
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,000
- Are you sure you saw him?
- He played with his ring. Call the bet.

266
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,500
The bet is six thousand dollars.

267
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,400
Six thousand dollars.

268
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,900
- I think you're bluffing.
- I didn't ask what you think.

269
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
Raise, call or fold.

270
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,700
I should raise your ass,
but I'm just gonna call.

271
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
My marker's good for a moment?

272
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
- Marker? Where are you from?
- Where am I from?

273
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,100
The United States of Kiss My Ass.
My marker's good.

274
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,900
Fuck you. Get the goddamn money up
or fold the goddamn hand.

275
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,900
This man is a man of his word.
He's a regular player...

276
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,300
Where I come from, if you can't
call the bet, you're out of the hand.

277
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,900
Call the bet.

278
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,700
I'll call the bet. I'll back it up.

279
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,400
- With what?
- I said, I'll back it up.

280
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,900
If he loses, I'll write you a cheque.

281
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,400
- Who is this broad?
- She's a friend of Mike's. She's all right.

282
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,700
Your bet is called.

283
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,900
Trip aces. Beat 'em, my friend.

284
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,700
Club flush.

285
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,800
You owe me six thousand dollars,
thank you very much.

286
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Next case.

287
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,200
Tough beat, Mike.

288
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,900
It happens to the best,
it happens to the rest.

289
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
I'm going home.

290
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm out too.

291
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Gentlemen.

292
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,100
Good night.

293
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Huh.

294
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,700
I thought you had him, Mike.

295
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,800
- He, uh...
- Yes?

296
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,800
- He didn't do the thing with his ring.
- No, he did it.

297
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,900
He did? What the fuck
is he doing with a flush?

298
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,300
What the fuck are you doing with a flush?

299
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,600
Does that beat trips
where you come from?

300
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,000
Give me the goddamn money.

301
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,800
- We lost.
- I have gathered that.

302
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,700
If you think I'm leaving without
that cheque, you're out of your mind.

303
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,400
- Look...
- I'll look later. Gimme the money.

304
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,500
OK, OK, OK. Give me a moment, will ya?

305
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,100
- I won that money from you, baby.
- I'll give it to you when I get to it!

306
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,400
- Now don't get pushy.
- Pushy, Jim? Pushy?

307
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,300
You don't know what pushy is.

308
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,600
Now give me my six thousand dollars.

309
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,000
They put me in, um...
an embarrassing position,

310
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,700
but I'm gonna have to ask you
for that money.

311
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,300
- That's right.
- I can't tell you how sorry I am.

312
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,300
Please, let's just
complete this transaction and...

313
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,000
I think that that's probably wise.

314
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,700
This cheque had better be like gold,

315
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,300
or I'm coming back here
because I won this money.

316
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,700
OK. OK. OK.

317
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,100
Are you all right?

318
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,500
Cool it, man. Just cool it, please.
You're gonna get your money.

319
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,600
You know what?

320
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't think I'm going to pay you.

321
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,100
Don't get the guy mad.
For heaven's sake, don't get him mad.

322
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,100
- Pay the man.
- You crazy bitch. Pay me what you owe.

323
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,200
No, I don't think I will.
And you know why?

324
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,100
Cos you can't threaten someone
with a squirt gun.

325
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,400
You slut, I can threaten you
with anything I goddamn want.

326
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
- George...
- Shut up.

327
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,500
- George.
- What?

328
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,100
- It's olley olley in free.
- No, I'm doing fine.

329
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,700
- No, George, you blew the gaff.
- I have?

330
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,800
Yes.

331
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,100
- Told you a squirt gun wouldn't work.
- It would have. You didn't have to fill it.

332
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,600
I'm gonna threaten someone
with an empty gun?

333
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,600
No, George, you're right. Of course.

334
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,300
You guys are fantastic.
Do you do this for a living?

335
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,900
Ask her. Is she mad?

336
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,000
You're not miffed at us, are you?
I mean, nothing personal.

337
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,100
You were gonna con me out of my money.

338
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,500
- It was only business.
- Only business.

339
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,800
- It was only business, huh?
- It's the American way.

340
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,500
I don't know about you folks,
but I'm starved.

341
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Anybody care for a snack?

342
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,700
Told you the damn squirt gun
wouldn't work.

343
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Aces and jacks, man with the axe.
Suicide kings.

344
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
Well, there you have it.

345
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,000
A sucker born every minute, huh?

346
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,000
And two to take 'em. Play past it.

347
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Here.

348
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,100
Here's s souvenir of
your escape from the con men.

349
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,500
You run a candy store.
This is the candy store.

350
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:48,300
Now, I come into your candy store,
and I give you $20 in singles and I say

351
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,700
"Could you please give me a $20 bill?"

352
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,300
"I have to send a registered letter
to my mother."

353
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,300
"To your aunt." It's more pathetic.

354
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,100
- "To my aunt."
- It's addressed and there's a stamp on it.

355
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,500
You give me a $20 bill. Give me the 20.

356
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,800
I seal it, and you watch me seal it
in the envelope.

357
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,400
Now, I gave you what appeared
to be $20 in singles

358
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,900
but, when you count it, there's only 19.

359
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,600
- And you say "I've only got 19."
- I've only got 19.

360
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
"Here, let me count it."

361
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
And there are only 19.

362
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,200
"God, I'm sorry. Let me get
another dollar from my wife in the car."

363
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,800
"Here, hold this a minute."

364
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,600
And I give you the envelope
with the $20 in it,

365
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,100
and I take the $19, and I go home.

366
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,300
"Goodbye."

367
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,600
And that's a little larceny called "the flue".

368
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,300
- I don't get it.
- You don't get it?

369
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,700
- You gave me the 20. I gave you the 19.
- Yes.

370
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,400
- I just won a dollar.
- Open the envelope.

371
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,500
- That's right.

372
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,100
- But I saw you put the $20 bill in there.
- No. That's what you thought you saw.

373
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,200
- How did you steal the bill?
- Secrets of the pyramids.

374
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
It's OK, Joe. Show her.

375
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I think we owe her one.

376
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,900
All right. The flue revealed.

377
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,800
Let's do it again.

378
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,500
I come into your store
and I hand you $20 in singles and I say

379
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,200
"Could you please give me a $20 bill?"

380
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400
"I have to send
a registered letter to my aunt."

381
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,600
You give me the bill, and I seal it.

382
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,600
And you watch me seal it in the envelope.

383
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,200
A little page in the history of the short con.

384
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,100
It's been very nice talking to you.

385
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,600
- Here's your cab.
- Thank you.

386
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,800
Good night.

387
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,800
May I talk to you for a moment?

388
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,200
Is my friend square with you
on the 800 dollars?

389
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,200
- I thought you'd say that.
- We struck a bargain.

390
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,100
You said watch for the tell
and you'd cancel his debt.

391
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,700
Are you a man of your word?

392
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,600
- All right. He's square.
- May I have the IOU?

393
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,600
Hey, you're right.

394
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,800
What's right is right.

395
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,600
Thank you.

396
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,500
- What's your name, by the way?
- Thank you for a lovely evening.

397
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,800
You're a lovely woman.

398
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,100
Good night.

399
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,000
Come back anytime
you'd enjoy some more excitement.

400
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,400
Let's go.

401
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,900
He said "I can make any woman
a whore in 15 minutes."

402
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,800
And what did you say to that?

403
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,200
I said he couldn't make anybody a whore
that was not a whore to start out with.

404
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,000
He said "I've been reading your mail,

405
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,300
and you are that whore."

406
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,700
Then... because
he didn't realise what he had done...

407
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,300
- And what had he done?
- I know there are people who are normal.

408
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,200
- Are there?
- Yes, there are.

409
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
- But...
- But what?

410
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
But I don't know what those people do.

411
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
It's all right, darling. It's all right.

412
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,400
No. It's not all right.

413
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,900
It never was all right. How can you
live when you've done something...?

414
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Sssh.

415
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,500
Maria? I have to talk to you.

416
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,800
You excuse me.

417
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Thank you.

418
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Why do we listen to their troubles
when we can't help them?

419
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh, you have been talking
to your murderess.

420
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,600
I know why she is in the hospital.
She's sick.

421
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,400
The question is, what am I doing in there?

422
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,800
It's a sham. It's a con game.
Nothing that I say will help her.

423
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,200
I can learn nothing from her
to help others avoid her mistakes.

424
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,200
That poor girl. All her life,
my father tells her she's a whore, so...

425
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,000
- Your father?
- I'm sorry?

426
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,500
You said your father
says that she's a whore.

427
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,000
- I said "my father"?
- Yes.

428
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,800
You remember
what your friend told you yesterday?

429
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,700
Don't work so hard.

430
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,100
Do something that gives you satisfaction,
something that you always enjoy.

431
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,600
What do you really enjoy?

432
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
- What do I enjoy?
- Yes.

433
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,000
- I enjoyed writing my book.
- Then write another book.

434
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,900
In the short term, come to my house
for dinner tonight. Will you do that?

435
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,500
I'm sorry. I can't come tonight.

436
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,300
Tonight, forgive me for asking,

437
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,600
you have something to do
that gives you enjoyment?

438
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,500
- Yes, I think so.
- That's good.

439
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,800
You need joy.

440
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,700
- You come to play pool?
- I'm looking for Mike.

441
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,900
Mike ain't here.

442
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,200
Try down at Charlie's.

443
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Thank you.

444
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,400
Can I help you?

445
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,400
- Drinking?
- Scotch and water.

446
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,300
- Scotch and water.
- Thank you.

447
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,400
- You pay now.
- How much is it?

448
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,600
Like most things, it's negotiable.

449
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,600
Oldest trick in the book.
Never fails.

450
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,200
Not good for much,
but still of great historical interest.

451
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,000
- Hiya.
- Hi.

452
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,200
It's good to see you.
Did I tell you my name? My name is Mike.

453
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,800
- Glad to meet you.
- Well, I'm glad to meet you too.

454
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,800
- I have a proposition for you.
- And what's your name?

455
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,200
How would you feel if someone were
to do a study of the confidence game?

456
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,500
And to talk to you and learn your views
and watch how you operate?

457
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,100
- A study of?
- Yes.

458
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
- For what?
- For my own reasons.

459
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,500
- Are you a journalist?
- I'm a writer. A sort of writer.

460
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,900
A sort of writer
and that's why you came back?

461
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,100
- How would you feel about that?
- Why did you come back here?

462
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,600
I came back here to write.
I came back...

463
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
I would like to see how you operate.

464
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,900
Is that the idea? You want to see
how a true bad man plies his trade?

465
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Yes.

466
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,300
All right.

467
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,300
- You'll call me when it comes in.
- Yes, sir.

468
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Thank you.

469
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,100
The basic idea is this.

470
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,200
It's called a confidence game. Why?
Because you give me your confidence?

471
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,800
No. Because I give you mine.

472
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,700
How do you get money
when you have no money?

473
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,000
Watch closely.
This is called "short con".

474
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,700
Would you please check again, please?
Howard. Martin Howard.

475
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,500
- Money order for $300.
- Hasn't come in yet.

476
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,800
- As I told you...
- It was supposed to arrive this afternoon.

477
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,100
- The moment it arrives...
- All right, all right. Thank you.

478
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,500
I'm expecting some money.
Sergeant John Moran.

479
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,400
- One moment. Moran?
- Yes, sir.

480
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,400
- I'm sorry, it hasn't come in yet.
- They told me definitely by nine o'clock.

481
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,400
If you'll have a seat,
I'll let you know the moment it arrives.

482
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,400
Thank you.

483
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,000
Can you beat that?

484
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,400
Can you beat this?
I've been waiting here since... Honey?

485
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,800
- Since three o'clock this afternoon.
- No.

486
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,900
Three o'clock this afternoon.

487
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
I got my car stolen. My wallet.

488
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,100
The kid's in a hotel room,
hasn't eaten since noon.

489
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,100
- They told me I'd have my money by nine.
- I swear to God.

490
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,600
I've gotta pick up a bus ticket.

491
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,700
- When's the bus leave?
- Six, but I gotta pick up the ticket.

492
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,800
- Where you going?
- Pendleton.

493
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,900
You're in the Corps?
I was in the Corps!

494
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,700
- When were you in?
- '68 to '70.

495
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,000
Yeah, I was there.

496
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,500
- Marty Howard.
- John Moran.

497
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,300
John.

498
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,300
- OK, look. What do you need for the bus?
- 40.

499
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,500
When my money comes in,
I'll give you the 40.

500
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,000
- No, I couldn't take that.
- Are you gonna miss your formation?

501
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,600
I'll lend you the 40. When you get back
to the base, send it back.

502
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,100
- Um...
- No. You get on that bus.

503
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,800
- Thank you.
- Nothing to it. You'd do the same for me.

504
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,400
- If my money comes in first...
- No, we'll be all right. I couldn't do that.

505
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Moran!

506
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,000
Could I see some ID, please?

507
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,400
Thank you.

508
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,500
Now that man is going to
give his money to a total stranger.

509
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,600
Now, you've got to take some money
from me. I want you to take it.

510
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,900
- What do you need?
- No, we'll get by.

511
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,100
No, wait. You tell me.
What do you need? I've got it right here.

512
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,000
Save your money, Joe. Semper fi.

513
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,200
- What's more fun than human nature?
- You learn something new every day.

514
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,300
- Ain't it the truth? Are you impressed?
- So you can't cheat an honest man?

515
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,800
That's probably true. But what we've
just seen is a slightly different principle.

516
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,000
- Which is?
- Don't trust nobody.

517
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,200
Were you in the Marines?

518
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,900
Everybody gets something
out of every transaction.

519
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,200
I give that guy my confidence.
I ask him for help.

520
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,500
What he gets is he feels
like he's a good man.

521
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,800
Now, what do you get
out of this transaction?

522
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,600
- I told you.
- Did you?

523
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,800
Yes, I said that I wanted...

524
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,400
You want to know a tell?

525
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,500
I'll show you another one.

526
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Give me your hand.

527
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,700
Think of a finger. Think of one.

528
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,400
- Are you thinking of one?
- Yes.

529
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,200
OK. I'm gonna tell you
which finger you're thinking of.

530
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,300
Do you think I can do that?

531
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
- This one.
- Yes. How did you know?

532
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,600
How did I know?
Because you were thinking of it.

533
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,000
- Do you wanna make love with me?
- Excuse me?

534
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,000
Because you're blushing.
That's a tell.

535
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,400
The things we think, the things we want.

536
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,200
We could do them or not do them
but we can't hide them.

537
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,600
What is it you think I want?

538
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,300
I'll tell you.

539
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,700
Somebody to come along.
Somebody to possess you.

540
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,700
To take you into a new thing.

541
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
Would you like that?

542
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Do you want that?

543
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Yes.

544
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,700
What is it?

545
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,700
Yes.

546
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,600
That's good.

547
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,000
Good evening. May I help you, sir?

548
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,200
- A room.
- Your name, please.

549
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,700
- Richard White.
- Mr White.

550
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,800
- Do you have a reservation?
- No, I don't.

551
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:41,200
I'm sorry, but the entire hotel
is booked up with the apparel show.

552
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,700
- Night.
- Good night, Mr Dean.

553
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,500
- You have nothing?
- No. I'm sorry. We don't.

554
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,500
Who's that man? Is that the manager?

555
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,800
No, sir. The manager's away
from the desk now, but I assure you...

556
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,900
That's all right. Thank you.

557
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,700
- If you could check back...
- It's perfectly all right.

558
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,200
What if the...?

559
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,900
What if the man comes back?

560
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,500
He had on a tuxedo. We would
believe he's going out for the evening.

561
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,200
- What if he does?
- I don't think so.

562
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,300
And if he does,
we'll deal with that thing then.

563
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,100
In or out?

564
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,800
We should be leaving.

565
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,300
You said he wasn't coming back.

566
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,800
Probably not.
But why should we wait for him?

567
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,000
Some people would say
that you're an interesting man.

568
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,400
I'm a con man.

569
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,800
That's what I am. I'm a criminal.

570
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,500
You don't have to delude yourself.

571
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,900
You can call things what they are.

572
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,200
You can call yourself what you are.

573
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,000
What am I?

574
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,400
Listen to me.

575
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,700
Cos there are a lot of things in the world.

576
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,200
There are many sides to each of us.

577
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,100
Good blood. Bad blood.

578
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,900
Somehow, all those parts have got to
speak. You know what I'm talking about.

579
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,800
The burden of responsibility has
become too great. It's true, isn't it?

580
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,100
- Yes, it is.
- Babe, I know that it is.

581
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,700
I read a book once which said this:

582
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,600
"If you're fired from your job, when
you're going home, take something."

583
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,400
"A pencil, something to assert yourself.
Take a memento."

584
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,700
Take something from life.

585
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,200
I think what draws you to me is this:

586
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,700
I'm not afraid to examine the rules
and to assert myself.

587
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,300
And I think you aren't either.

588
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,300
Do you really think so?

589
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,200
Yes. That's exactly what I think.

590
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,800
I'm gonna wash up.
Then let's get out of this guy's room.

591
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,500
Let's get out of here!

592
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,500
- Taxi this evening, sir?
- No, thank you.

593
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,700
- I wanna see you again.
- Well, I hope so.

594
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,900
We'll do that. Soon.

595
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,800
- I have to go.
- Can I come? Where do you have to be?

596
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,800
I've actually got to be right here.

597
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,300
- Christ, what time is it?
- What is it?

598
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,000
Look. You remember Joey
from last night?

599
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,900
- Your friend.
- The guy in the bow tie.

600
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:11,900
Slowly look over my left shoulder
and tell me if you see him.

601
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,400
Yes, he's just crossing the street.

602
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,200
- Christ.
- What is it?

603
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,200
There's a bit
that I'm supposed to do here.

604
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,900
OK, I'm gonna call you soon.

605
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,000
- Let me do this with you.
- No! You're getting into the frame-up.

606
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,800
- Let me do this with you.
- No! This is not a game.

607
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,900
- We're about to sting this guy.
- I'll do it with you.

608
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,300
Let me do it with you.
Just tell me what to do.

609
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,400
Babe, you're mucking up my timing.

610
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,700
Come on.

611
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,300
You're my wife. You follow my cue.
Whatever I do, don't volunteer anything.

612
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,700
- Taxi!
- However strange it all seems, keep quiet.

613
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,200
The only one you know is me.

614
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,100
The airport. Hurry.

615
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,100
- You going to the conference?
- Wouldn't miss it.

616
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,800
Wait for the light.
They'll ticket you for jaywalking.

617
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,300
- Fellow left his briefcase.
- Sorry?

618
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,400
Fellow left his briefcase.

619
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,100
He probably came from the hotel.

620
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,100
Let's take it back.

621
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,700
Holy Christ.

622
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,100
Oh, my God.

623
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,600
I'd better get this... I suppose
I'd better get this back to the hotel.

624
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,100
Let's, uh...

625
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:17,000
Let's just talk about this for one moment.

626
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,300
I'm with you.

627
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:34,000
Look, look, look.
This has got to be stolen money.

628
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,900
I understand, but how do we know that?

629
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,100
Are you nuts?
There's $80,000 in the goddamn bag.

630
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,000
Who's gonna be carrying that kind of
money in a bag in the middle of the night?

631
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,200
And there's no way
I'm giving that money to the police.

632
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,400
Why should we?
So some cops can split it?

633
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,100
- That's absolutely right.
- I'm not gonna do it.

634
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,400
All right. Let's just stop
pussyfooting around here.

635
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,800
This is the central proposition.
This money fell into our laps.

636
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,800
There is no way we're gonna give it back.

637
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
We all know what we're gonna do
so let's face the facts.

638
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,000
We know we're gonna split the money,
so let's just do it.

639
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,300
I, uh...

640
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,700
- I work in a bank.
- We don't wanna hear your problems.

641
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:28,100
Will you shut up for a second?
Listen to what I'm gonna tell you.

642
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,600
I work in a bank.

643
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:40,200
If this money's clean,
if it's not counterfeit, I say this:

644
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
I say we split it up.

645
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,600
We split it up down the middle and
we walk away and this never happened.

646
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,100
That's what I say.

647
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,300
That's what I've been saying
for the last three hours.

648
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,400
- I'll take the money to the bank and...
- Excuse me. Do you think we're insane?

649
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,700
Listen to what I'm gonna say! We keep
this money intact. We don't touch it.

650
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,700
I check it out. If it's hot,
we sit on it for six months, a year.

651
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
- And you keep the money?
- Listen to what I'm gonna tell you!

652
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,100
I can go to my bank tomorrow morning,
here, in town.

653
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,900
I can get 10... $20,000 clean money,
my money.

654
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,400
I'll give you a bank cheque. I keep
the briefcase. You keep my money.

655
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,300
- We keep your money?
- Yes.

656
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,200
Wait a second. Back up.
I'll go to my bank, all right?

657
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,300
I'll get $30,000
and I'll get the thing checked out.

658
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,400
I'll give you my money and I'll take
the briefcase, you son of a bitch.

659
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:45,200
Who's he think he's dealing with,
for Christ's sake?

660
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,300
I'm gonna wash up.
I'm gonna change my shirt, then we'll go.

661
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,000
- Keep an eye on the...
- Go on. Don't worry.

662
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,000
- Are you awake?
- Yeah.

663
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,100
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

664
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,300
Got a little bit more
than you bargained for, huh?

665
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,700
- What's happened?
- Yeah.

666
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,400
I don't understand how this works.

667
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,600
OK, I'm gonna tell ya.

668
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:59,300
The mark gets dressed.
We take him to the bank.

669
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,000
Don't include the broad in it, Mike.
Are you nuts?

670
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,300
Leave it be.
She doesn't have to know how we do this.

671
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,300
- Be cool, Joey. It's going good.
- It's going how it's going.

672
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,300
- You were a fool to bring the broad.
- Be that as it may.

673
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,100
We make a deal with the mark. He gets
to ship the briefcase to himself in...

674
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,700
- Where's he from?
- Baltimore.

675
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,300
Now, why do we let him do that?

676
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,500
Because, before he does,
he goes to a bank here

677
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,200
and gives us $30,000 as collateral
so that we trust him.

678
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,800
Just before we send him the briefcase,
we switch it on him

679
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,100
and we've got his $30,000.

680
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,500
If it's phoney money,
why do you have to switch it?

681
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,400
Who said it was phoney money?
It's real.

682
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:48,800
That's the beauty of the thing -
we're showing the guy 80,000 real dollars.

683
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:54,200
We borrowed the money from the hard
guys for a night. Tonight, we give it back.

684
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,700
- How's he doing?
- Changing. We got a couple of minutes.

685
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,400
I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You have seen sights that few have seen.

686
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,100
You're a goddamn fool to bring her along.

687
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,000
It's over, Joe. It's all right.

688
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,200
You did real good.

689
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,700
OK. Time to go. Let's take it to the bank.

690
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,300
You'd better get your jacket.

691
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,300
Coming out in about five minutes.

692
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,500
We'll be coming out in five minutes.

693
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:12,000
As far as I can determine, none of them
are armed. We'll act as if they are.

694
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,700
When you come in,
have the female officer go for the woman.

695
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,500
Get her down on the ground
and frisk her good.

696
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,200
I don't know who she is
and I don't trust her.

697
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,600
I'll take the young guy,
you take the old.

698
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,100
I got it.

699
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,200
The signal is, I clear my throat.

700
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,800
- Say again?
- And that's at the bank?

701
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,300
Yes, at the bank.

702
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,700
- He's a cop.
- What?

703
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,500
- I heard him on the walkie-talkie.
- Oh, God. We gotta get her out of here.

704
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,600
You bloody better well believe it.

705
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,700
- Hold it. Briefcase.
- Got it.

706
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,400
What did we forget?

707
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,500
Good. Come on.

708
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,000
- Where are you going?
- My wife's gotta call...

709
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,400
- No. Hold on.
- We're gonna stay with you.

710
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,600
- Nobody goes anywhere.
- She's very ill.

711
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,200
- Police. Don't move.
- I told you. My wife is ill.

712
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,000
Move back. Get on the floor.
You're under arrest. It's all over for today.

713
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,000
- No.
- Move and I'll blow your head off.

714
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,600
I've gotta get out of here.

715
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,900
How is he?

716
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,400
Yeah. He's dead.

717
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,500
- I can't be here.
- Why did you kill him? Are you nuts?

718
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,800
- We've got seconds to get out of here.
- The bitch panicked.

719
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,500
Shut up. Go check the door.

720
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,300
Come on.

721
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,400
- Stairs.
- Go.

722
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,100
They're out there.

723
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,600
She's killed us.
The bitch has killed us dead.

724
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,600
Steal the car.

725
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,900
I can't do that.

726
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,400
Do you wanna spend
the rest of your life in jail,

727
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,300
or do you wanna get us out of here?

728
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,800
We need you to steal the car.

729
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:09,100
All my life, Mike. All my life
I ain't never had a moment's violence.

730
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,400
Never saw a moment's violence.

731
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,900
Wipe it down and let's get out of here.

732
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:18,300
I swear to God. You had to bring
your square-john broad into it.

733
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,700
You had to bring your trick into the game.

734
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,300
OK. It's something that happened.
It was an accident.

735
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,900
An accident? Goddamn you!
You broke the first rule.

736
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,300
I should have turned around
the moment you brought the broad.

737
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,600
I brought the broad? Who brought the
goddamn cop? Where did you get him?

738
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,500
At the apparel show.
He looked like a businessman.

739
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,800
- OK. Shut up.
- He...

740
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,900
I said shut up!

741
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,300
We're gonna get the car wiped down.
Then we'll be home clean.

742
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,600
None of this ever happened. Go home,
nobody knows your name and it's all over.

743
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,400
We give the Mob back their money...

744
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,700
Where's the briefcase?

745
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,000
You had it.

746
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,600
You had it at the garage.
You had the briefcase.

747
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,400
- I thought we put it in the car.
- Where is it, Joe?

748
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,800
It isn't there.

749
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:28,400
- What does this mean?
- Sorry, Mike.

750
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,000
- When we were in the garage...
- Shut up. Let me think for a second.

751
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,300
- What does it mean?
- I'm sorry, Mike. I was scared.

752
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,700
You were scared? You son of a bitch!
You've killed us.

753
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,500
What does it mean?

754
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,500
We've lost $80,000
we borrowed from the Mob.

755
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,000
If we don't pay it back,
they turn us over for that cop we killed.

756
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,300
- I can give you the money.
- You got senile!

757
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,400
- I can give you the money.
- I need $80,000 by tonight.

758
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,900
- I'll get it.
- You have that kind of money?

759
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,100
I can get it.

760
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,700
Then for God's sakes, get it.

761
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Funny how things happen sometimes.

762
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,600
- I'm sorry, Mike.
- Get in.

763
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,300
- I'll tell 'em...
- They know what happened.

764
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,600
Start for the airport.

765
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,200
What happens now?

766
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,400
What's gonna happen is this:

767
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,400
Joey gives the money back to the Mob,
then he goes away.

768
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,800
I'm gonna go away. You're gonna
stay here, cos you have a life here.

769
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,700
Nobody knows who you are.
They can't trace you.

770
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,700
If you don't tell them,
then they don't know.

771
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:11,700
Listen to me. You're gonna get a strong
urge to confess to thievery, to murder.

772
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,300
You're gonna wanna confess.
Don't do it.

773
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,900
What happened was an accident.
You being there was an accident.

774
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,100
You did nothing wrong
so you go and forget it.

775
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,900
I...

776
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,200
I just wish...

777
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,300
Stop the cab.

778
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:08,800
Inversion, projection,
compression, elaboration...

779
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,500
Excuse me.

780
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:22,100
...projection, inversion,
compression and elaboration

781
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,900
are devices for transforming

782
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,700
in the joke.

783
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,700
Maggie. Maggie!

784
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,900
What is it?
What is it, darling?

785
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,300
- Come inside.
- No.

786
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,900
- No, I...
- What?

787
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,300
- I have to... I have to talk to you.
- Anything. What is it?

788
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,800
You know the dream where you've
done something terrible... some... some...

789
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,300
and you're going to die
and you say "I wish this was a dream."

790
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,500
Maggie, darling.
Come inside, sit down and tell me.

791
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,300
No. Listen to me. If you reveal
yourself, you betray someone else...

792
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,800
When you have done
something unforgivable.

793
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,600
Yes.

794
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,000
When you have done
something unforgivable,

795
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,600
I will tell you exactly what to do.

796
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,900
You forgive yourself.

797
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,000
It isn't as if you've killed somebody.

798
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,200
Dr Littauer? Excuse me. I'm sorry...

799
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:04,700
Dr Ford. Do I have the wrong day?

800
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,200
I'm very sorry.
I'm quite ill. I have to cancel.

801
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,500
- Are you all right?
- Didn't I just tell you? What'd I just say?

802
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,300
No calls through
under any circumstances.

803
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,500
Call my appointments for today
and cancel them.

804
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,400
Dr Ford?

805
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,900
Dr Ford?

806
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
Dr Ford, it's Billy Hahn.

807
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,000
What do you want?

808
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:43,300
I tried to call. I had to cancel
my appointment tomorrow.

809
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,200
They said you weren't taking any calls.
I have to go away for several days.

810
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:51,200
Yes, I think it's best
if we suspended treatment for a while.

811
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:56,200
I stopped by to tell you that I would
be gone and couldn't come tomorrow.

812
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,900
Yes. Thank you.

813
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,500
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

814
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,600
May I speak to Bill, please?

815
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,500
Right, I'll hold.

816
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,100
Bill? How's it going?

817
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,300
Real good.

818
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,200
What? Yeah.

819
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:00,800
Well, that's really good news, man.
I'm always glad to hear that.

820
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,700
Excuse me.

821
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,700
I just won $5,000 on a baseball game.

822
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,600
How about giving me a taste?

823
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,800
I would if you'd make a bet sometime.
You're so cheap.

824
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,200
Why do I always play the straight man?

825
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,700
- Think about it.
- Think about what?

826
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:49,300
- Who filled the water pistol?
- I did.

827
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,800
You're becoming Sarah Bernhardt.
It made a puddle big enough to swim in.

828
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,700
- That's the point.
- A taste for the theatrical.

829
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:00,100
You've no idea. He threw his arm
out batting that bitch around.

830
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,300
- He hit her?
- Oh, yeah.

831
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:07,900
- Slam-bang.
- Look at this fucking bruise you gave me.

832
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,800
You get what you pay for. It's realism.

833
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,300
- So is she gonna stand up?
- Like you said, she's on tilt.

834
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,100
But I don't think
she's gonna beef to the cops.

835
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,000
Shall I send him back
to have him check on her again?

836
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,700
No, I think she'll stand up.
Pay the kid off.

837
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,900
- Keep him a little scared.
- Oh, yeah.

838
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,800
Mike, how did you know
she would go for it?

839
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Go for it? Hey, the broad's an addict.

840
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,600
This is great. This is fantastic.
Listen to this.

841
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,400
- When we were dressing the room...
- My hotel room?

842
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,900
We're spreading personal junk
on the bureau.

843
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,800
We put some personal stuff
on the bureau.

844
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,700
- So it'll look like somebody's in the room.
- Get this. Listen to this.

845
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:56,800
I leave some stuff.
I leave 40 or 50 bucks on the desk.

846
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:00,100
- The broad steals my pocket knife.
- No!

847
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:03,300
My hand to God!
She boosts my lucky pocketknife.

848
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,700
- Can you beat that?
- The bitch is a born thief.

849
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,800
- So you had her made from the jump?
- I'm telling you. A ton of fucking bricks.

850
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,400
- Show me some real con men.
- We showed her some.

851
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:17,200
We showed her some dinosaur con men,
some old-style.

852
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,000
Years from now, you'll have to go
to a museum to see a frame like this.

853
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,600
- Took her money and screwed her too.
- A small price to pay.

854
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,400
We took out for the hotel.
Two hotel rooms.

855
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,800
Speaking of which,
$300 for your hotel room?

856
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:34,100
Always show a little front.
You taught me that, Mike.

857
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,200
- You're such a flatterer.
- Spend 300 to make 80,000.

858
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:43,500
- Mike, you are King Kong.
- One riot, one ranger.

859
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,000
- You put her in the panic bag.
- This is my road game.

860
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:49,500
- What's next?
- A vacation.

861
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:52,500
I'm going to Vegas tonight on
the ten o'clock. Wanna come?

862
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,100
- Quitting winners this time.
- Miss ya.

863
01:26:55,300 --> 01:27:01,600
What did I say? The two hotel rooms.
$52.90 for two policemen's uniforms.

864
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,800
$25 we gave the parking-Iot attendant.
$500 to the kid.

865
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,400
Give me a running total.

866
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,600
Mike. Mike, what are you...?

867
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,900
Why are you here?

868
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,300
- We can't be here.
- What are you doing here?

869
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,400
Listen. They're following me.
They're following me.

870
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,400
They are? Wait a second.

871
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:34,800
- We can't be seen together.
- Don't leave me. I'm so glad you're here.

872
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,300
- You're in no danger.
- I told you, they're waiting for me.

873
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,800
There were policemen following me.

874
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,500
- I thought you'd gone.
- I couldn't get on the right flight.

875
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:48,100
Look. If they haven't followed you
here, then you have some time.

876
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,100
- But we have to split up.
- No, I can't. Don't leave me.

877
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:56,500
- It's a godsend that you're here.
- I'll tell you where I'll be. We'll meet there.

878
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:59,900
No, no, no. I'm so frightened.
And, Mike...

879
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,800
Mike.

880
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:06,600
I took all my money...
I took all my money out of the bank.

881
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:10,900
You'll help us disappear.
We'll disappear together.

882
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,100
Mike.

883
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,700
I've got a quarter of a million dollars.

884
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,800
We can live. We can...

885
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:22,400
I can't believe I'm seeing you.

886
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,400
Were you followed to the airport?

887
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:38,000
I don't know. I'm frightened all the time.

888
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,200
I saw them. I went to the bank.

889
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,900
But I threw them off
before I went to the airport.

890
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,500
Good.

891
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:52,300
- I bought my ticket in another name.
- I think that's wise.

892
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,500
My real name is Margaret.

893
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:58,500
- Margaret. We'll get out of this, I promise.
- Yes.

894
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,800
I'll get us out of the country.
We need a plan.

895
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,600
I've got you.

896
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,400
- It was fate I found you.
- Yes, it was.

897
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,400
- Because together...
- Yes, we can.

898
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:29,900
- When I saw that they came after me...
- It's all right. You're safe.

899
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:33,500
- No, I knew that I was being punished.
- It was an accident. No.

900
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:36,800
No, I knew that I was bad.

901
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,500
Do you know why?
Do you know when I knew?

902
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,100
Because I took your knife.
That's when I knew.

903
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:45,000
- What knife?
- Your knife from the hotel room.

904
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:51,200
And I said that's why it happened.
Yes, because I'm bad. Because I stole.

905
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,300
What is it?

906
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,800
Mike, what is it?

907
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:01,700
Oh, you're a bad pony
and I'm not gonna bet on you.

908
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,800
Mike?

909
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:09,800
You see, the thing of it is,
you just said my knife.

910
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,300
- I don't understand.
- My knife.

911
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,600
You said you took my knife
from the hotel room.

912
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:21,000
You see, in my trade, this is called,
what you did, you cracked out of turn.

913
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:24,800
Huh? You see? You crumbed the play.

914
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
My knife.

915
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,700
What do you want?
What do you fucking want from me?

916
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:34,700
You want your 80 grand back?
I can't give it back. I split it up.

917
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:38,000
- What do you want? Revenge?
- I gave you my trust.

918
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,400
Of course you gave me your trust.
That's what I do for a living!

919
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,600
You asked me what I did for a living.
This is it.

920
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,000
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you.

921
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,500
Really. You're a good kid.

922
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,100
Whatever it is you feel
that you have to do...

923
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,400
- Sit down, please.
- I'd love to...

924
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:57,700
- Sit down!
- You gonna go to the cops?

925
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:00,900
- I may.
- And tell 'em what?

926
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,800
The author of the best-selling Driven,
a guide to compulsive behaviour,

927
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,800
gave her fortune away to some con man?

928
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,200
You see my point?

929
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,500
But we've had fun. You must say that.

930
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,200
I said to sit down.

931
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:22,500
If you walk out that door,
I'm going to kill you.

932
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,600
- I don't believe you.
- What is life without adventure?

933
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,600
What? What do you want me to do?

934
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,600
You took my money.

935
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,100
- How naughty of me.
- You raped me.

936
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:51,000
- You took me under false pretences.
- Well, that's just what happened, isn't it?

937
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,100
OK, you got stung. And you're hurt.
I can understand that.

938
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,500
I wanna know how you could do
what you did to me.

939
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:01,500
It wasn't personal. And, funny as that
sounds, I'm sorry that it happened.

940
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:05,400
But it did. And we've all gotta live
in an imperfect world.

941
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:09,700
- You used me.
- I used you. I did. I'm sorry.

942
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
And you learned things about yourself that
you'd rather not know. I'm sorry for that.

943
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,800
You say I acted atrociously.

944
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,600
Yes, I did.

945
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,900
I do it for a living.

946
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,000
You sit down.

947
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,600
You can't bluff a man
who won't pay attention.

948
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,200
Are you nuts? What are you? Nuts?

949
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,800
- I want you to beg me.
- Fuck you. I'm not gonna beg you.

950
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,300
- Beg me.
- It's a goddamn bluff.

951
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,400
You're all bluff.
Are you gonna kill me and then go to jail?

952
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:49,400
Give up all that good shit you have?
Your best seller? That doctor stuff?

953
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:53,000
All that stuff you're trying so hard
to protect? You'd give it up?

954
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,600
It's not my pistol. I was never here.

955
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:05,400
- Beg for your life or I'm going to kill you.
- Hey. No.

956
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,700
- I can't help it. I'm out of control.
- Hey, no, I...

957
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,600
Beg me for your life.

958
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:15,000
Fuck you! This is what you
always wanted, you crooked bitch!

959
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:18,800
You thief! You always needed to get
caught cos you know you're bad.

960
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,100
I never hurt anybody.
I never shot anybody.

961
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:26,700
This is what you always wanted.
I knew it the first time you came in.

962
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,700
You're worthless, you know it?
You're a whore.

963
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,200
You came back like a dog
to its own vomit, you sick bitch.

964
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,200
I'm not gonna give you shit.

965
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,600
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

966
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:08,500
Are you Doctor Margaret Ford?

967
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,300
Yes, I am.

968
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,100
Would you sign my book?

969
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,200
I'd be delighted.

970
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:43,400
Maggie! Darling!

971
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,600
I missed you!

972
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:49,200
- How are you?
- I'm fine. Really fine.

973
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,600
- Are you?
- Yes, I absolutely am.

974
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,700
Good. Come.

975
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,600
I'm so happy you are back.

976
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:03,200
Now you sit down
and then you'll tell me everything.

977
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,100
Do you know how frightened
I was for you before your trip?

978
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,500
It was the strain.
I had my book coming out.

979
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:16,900
No, no. I know.

980
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:20,300
But there was something on your mind.

981
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:22,700
That's right.

982
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:28,300
You said "When you've done something
unforgivable, you must forgive yourself."

983
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:33,600
- That's what I've done, and it's done.
- Good. Good.

984
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,800
Now, what are we going to eat?
What did you eat down there?

985
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,500
Dr Littauer, you're wanted on the phone.

986
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,700
Oh.

987
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,800
Sorry, darling.

988
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,600
Please, order for me.

989
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:11,000
Excuse me?

990
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:12,400
Yes?

991
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:16,100
Could you tell me
what that is on the buffet?

992
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,400
- A Waldorf salad.
- Thank you.

993
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:30,500
