Yeah.

I couldn't do

And I've been thinking

193
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,653
about doing something
special for you...

194
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,755

and it can't
stop looking at me.

it would've been

"Get out of here!"

have that beautiful jaw...

jewelry I can actually wear?

219

you cleaned out the cat box?

that the weapon is still being
offered to the highest bidder.

knows where that nuke is.

his daughter, Rayna.

Most ominously...

300
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,718
Solsa Dudaev,
the al-Qaeda-funded leader

301
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,487
of the Chechen Martyrs'
Brigade.

302
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,789
We have compelling evidence that
he has the machinery in place

303
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,057
to get that nuke
to New York in time

304
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,558
for next week's
UN General Assembly.

305

306
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,095
One of our sources was told

307
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,662
she has taken up residence
outside of Sofia.

308
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,696
Go get her.

309
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,700
Grab my things, Coop.

310
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,438
Jesus, Cooper, go put on
some sunglasses or something.

311
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,673
I feel like you're a Gypsy,
cursing me with it.

312
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,142
Yep, I'm on it.

313
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,610
Yeah, that's all good.
Oh, Fine?

314
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,646
Hi.
Hey, Super Cooper.

315
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,648
Oh! Um...

316
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:53,086
I just was feeling
a little weird about...

317
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,488
Oh, yeah? ...some of the stuff,
and I think the intel...

318
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:59,126
on Rayna's location
seems a little too easy.

319
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,694
I just...
Something doesn't feel right.

320
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,396
It'll be right when
we get Rayna behind bars

321
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,365
and that nuke
back in our hands.

322
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,602
Yeah, sure. I just...

323
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,639
I don't know. All my alarm bells
are going off with this one.

324
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:17,677
Really? Well, then, it's
okay 'cause I have a plan.

Do I mean that?
You got me. You kidder.

Fine, I'm sorry if I...

336
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:47,006
Don't be.
God, I admire you.

338
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,680
Well, did he at least say it
in a flirty tone that says...

"And because of my admiration, I
shall now take my shirt off...

is if he wants me
to fix his bed.

How is that
the same thing?

There was a little bit
of tongue there.

That's not cheering me up.

you said that to Fine.

"Well-behaved women
often make history."

Yes, you do know
the phrase is...

376
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,460
"Well-behaved women
seldom make history"?

377
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,027
Yeah. That's never
how she said it.

378
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,096
What were her others?

379
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,166
"Just blend in."
"Let somebody else win."

380
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,100
Classic. I got that a
lot in high school.

381
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,603
And there was, "Give up
on your dream, Susan."

382
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,238
She used to write that
in my lunchbox.

different between us

No, hang on, no,
because you were

389

just as good as her
at the Academy.

so perfect, doesn't she?

to sleep every night.

I don't think she probably does.
She probably does.

sort of cute, little tears.

00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,618
I'm guessing you?

486
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,920
Drop your weapon.

487
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,455
Fine, what's happening?

488
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,956
Let me guess.
Whoever is in your ear

489
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,558
wants to know
what's happening?

490
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,695
(SOFTLY) He's about to die.

491
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,397
That's what.

492
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,503
An awfully big gun
for such a little girl.

493
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,606
Oh, God, don't say
stuff like that.

494
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,140
Okay, there's a knife rack
directly to your right.

495
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,810
The way she's holding the gun,
she's not experienced.

496
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,513
If you duck and lunge, you can
get the knife and disarm her.

497
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,866
Did someone just suggest that
you grab one of those knives?

498
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,784
No, no, no!

499
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:32,818
Damn it!

500
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,085
Fine!

501
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,956
Can they see me right now?

502
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:39,931
Let me adjust
the angle a little bit.

503
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,694
(GUNSHOT)
(GASPS)

504
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,400
Oh, my God, Fine.

505
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:52,905
His name was Bradley Fine.
He worked for the CIA.

506
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,674
Other top agents include

507
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,376
Matthew Wright,
Timothy Cress...

508
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,279
Rick Ford and Karen Walker.

509
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,615
Come on, Fine. Come on.

510
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:06,553
I know who all
your active agents are.

511
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:10,122
So, unless you'd like
the body count to grow...

512
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,692
I suggest you stay
far away from me.

513
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,394
Now grab some tissues,

514
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,664
because shit's about
to get real sad.

515
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:18,697
FINE: No, no...
(GUNSHOT)

516
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,604
Oh, my God, Fine.

517
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,774
As Deputy Director...

518
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:31,210
I have never had
a more difficult duty...

519
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,247
than to bid farewell
to colleagues taken from us.

520
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,417
From Dover,
to the family services...

521
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,620
to memorials like these...

522
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,988
it's tough to say goodbye.

523
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,557
There's nothing you
could have done, Susan.

524
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:48,695
Bradley Fine was more than
just a coworker and a friend.

525
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,563
He was part of our family.

526
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,865
And as family,
even knowing that the universe

527
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,802
has a plan
for each human life...

528
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:57,470
it's hard to accept
the sudden loss

529
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:00,473
of such a good
and decent person.

530
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,612
SUSAN: (ON TAPE) Okay, there's a
knife rack directly to your right.

531
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,414
Susan, I got your assessment
report on Rayna Boyanov.

532
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,983
I know you're probably feeling
a lot of emotion right now...

533
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:14,186
but please refrain from using
the term "thundercunt."

534
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,490
Oh, my God. I didn't
realize I wrote that.

535
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:18,925
I'm sorry.

536
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,301
Nancy, I'm sending
you a photo.

537
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:30,703
It's in pretty bad shape.

538
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,071
Can you enhance it?
Mm-hmm.

539
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,582
Paris?

540
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,053
How the fuck did this twat
find out our fucking names?

541
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,521
We don't know.

542
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:50,823
And dial it way back
with the "T" word, Ford.

543
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,259
You're not immune from the
HR department. Grow up.

544
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,327
And "twat" means something
completely different in England.

545
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,063
Here it means a vagina.

546
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,666
Anyway, obviously
we're talking about a mole.

547
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,200
It could be a mole, they could
have hacked our system.

548
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,268
It's anyone's guess.

549
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,737
The bottom line is Rayna
Boyanov is about to sell...

550
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:06,673
a small-scale tactical
nuclear weapon

551
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,207
to a terrorist
organization...

552
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,877
and we don't know
where she or the bomb is.

553
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,279
Fortunately, our analyst
Susan Cooper found a lead.

554
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,949
Rayna had the number
of Sergio De Luca...

555
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,685
and we've long
suspected De Luca

556
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:21,621
of working as an intermediary
with terrorist groups.

557
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,923
Rayna may be using him
to find buyers for the nuke.

558
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,593
The number was to an office
he keeps in Paris.

559
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,427
I told you to send me in
there instead of Fine,

560
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,829
and you didn't.

561
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,598
And now Fine is dead.
I'm going the fuck in.

562
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,165
You can't.

563
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,101
We need someone to follow De
Luca without being detected...

564
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,236
and that will hopefully
take us to Rayna...

565
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,771
but it can't be any of you.

566
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,808
Here's what we do...

567
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:45,311
I go into the Face/Off
machine, get a whole new face.

568
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,513
I turn up,
they never know it's me.

569
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,681
Do you have quarters?
Because it costs 50 cents.

570
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,282
What, I gotta pay?

571
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,384
No, because it doesn't exist.

572
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:53,953
Yes, it does!

573
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:57,590
I heard Cress and Wright talking
about it in the shitter.

574
00:25:57,624 --> 00:25:59,425
I'm pretty sure
they were pulling your leg.

575
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,527
You pair of fucking vaginas.

576
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,796
Seriously,
you've got to cut that out.

577
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,465
Jesus. Look, one of us
has to go in.

578
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,134
Doesn't matter
if we've been exposed.

579
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,836
We've all gone deep before,

580
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,738
and we've always
gotten our guy.

581
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:14,173
Guys, this is more than
just a kill mission.

582
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,809
We can get Rayna, De Luca, and
some top terrorist leadership...

583
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:19,045
and get the weapon back
if we do this right.

584
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,713
We just need someone
who can shadow them

585
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,715
without attracting attention.

586
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,683
We need someone invisible.

587
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:24,951
I'll do it.

588
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,186
Okay, thanks, lunch lady.

589
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,487
I'm serious.

590
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,522
I have never
been out in the field.

591
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,959
Exactly. Stupid fucking idea.

592
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,494
My point is that
it's highly doubtful

593
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,196
that I've ever been exposed.

594
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,131
But you worked with Fine.

595
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,232
They may have
a record of you, too.

596
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,834
SUSAN: Possibly.

597
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:44,704
But the odds of them
knowing my face are very low.

598
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,706
Miss Crocker, I would
really like to do this.

599
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,440
For Fine.

600
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,877
What are you gonna do? Bring one
of your cats as a sidekick?

601
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,145
I don't have any cats!

602
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,815
You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

603
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,050
Look here, Betty...

604
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,752
Ford, if you call me
Betty Crocker,

605
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,620
I will rip your fucking
heart out of your chest.

606
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,656
Not only did I
become a citizen

607
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,358
and take a vow
to protect this country...

608
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:10,697
I also took a vow to avenge my
fallen comrades. We all fucking did.

609
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,299
No, we didn't.
Not me.

610
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,435
I'm pretty sure we all took a fucking vow.
I remember it.

611
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,571
I remember raising my fucking
hand and saying some shit.

612
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,874
If you think
I'm gonna sit by

613
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,548
and let you send in
a fucking secretary...

614
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,577
to do my work...

615
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,179
you might as well accept
my resignation now.

616
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,748
If I can jump in,

617
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,650
I am technically, uh,
classified as an agent.

618
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,886
Look...

619
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,822
SUSAN: Full agent. So...

620
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,324
agent, agent, agent,
I'm an agent.

621
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,893
Are you considering this?

622
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,495
For your safety, and the safety
of those around this table...

623
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,231
I am considering it.

624
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,333
Then consider this,
I quit.

625
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,138
And I know there's a fucking
Face/Off machine.

626
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,206
You're just keeping it
secret from me.

627
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,843
Okay.

628
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,516
That hasn't happened before.
(DOOR CLOSES)

629
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,814
It is quite
a lovely office.

630
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:03,850
What's your deal, Cooper?

631
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,451
What do you mean?

632
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,286
You got a fiery side?

633
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,556
I really did, in that report,
mean to write "cunning."

634
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,991
I've been going over
your files.

635
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,193
You were top of your class
at the Academy,

636
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,627
in all computer
and support skills.

637
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,796
No surprise there.

638
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,697
But you have a certain...

639
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:20,900
tame demeanor
around the office,

640
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,534
that says you've never
even held a gun.

641
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:25,437
So imagine my surprise...

642
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,511
when I saw footage from
this drill back at The Farm.

643
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:33,880
SUSAN: Is that...
I can't even...

644
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,114
Is that me? I can't really...
(GUN CLICKING)

645
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,387
SUSAN: (ON COMPUTER)
Stupid gun!

646
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:39,251
Somebody definitely
sped this up.

647
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,888
Ooh! Camera angle
and stuff make...

648
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:43,990
(YELLING)

649
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,457
Cooper, Cooper, stop!
Jesus Christ, what are you...

650
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:46,826
Ouch.

651
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,260
Out of context, that's...

652
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,430
I must have watched
this 15 times now...

653
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,099
because what the fuck?

654
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,934
I almost put it up
on YouTube.

655
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:59,105
I was, to say the least,
uncomfortable with the event.

656
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,107
But I would also like to say,
it was over 10 years ago.

657
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,408
The instructor
was not harmed.

658
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,643
Fine was your mentor, right?

659
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,112
Yes.

660
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:09,048
Why did you not
become a field agent?

661
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,549
Well, we're such a great
fit and a great team.

662
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,384
Fine made
some great points.

663
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:15,321
Maybe I match better with,
just staying...

664
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,956
In his ear.
Well...

665
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,457
Yeah, he sniped you.

666
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,459
All the top agents used to
do that before I got here.

667
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,261
I really thought he made
some great points.

668
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,064
Women.

669
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,565
All right, have you had any
field training since then?

670
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,599
10 years is a long time.

671
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,268
No, ma'am.

672
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,904
Normally, I would send you back to
The Farm, but there's no time...

673
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:34,240
and I can't take a chance of
anyone leaking your name.

674
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,108
(LAUGHING)
Am I going?

675
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,709
You're going.

676
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:40,212
Okay. Jeez. Sorry.

677
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:44,016
But it's a track and report
mission only.

678
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,717
Got it.

679
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:46,919
We'll be giving you
a new identity.

680
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,687
You'll no longer be
Susan Cooper.

681
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,890
I had a few ideas for that.
Your new name...

682
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,524
I was just spitballing
and I thought...

683
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,626
Seraphina,
Maddox, Gisele...

684
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,295
Carol Jenkins.

685
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,596
Carol Jenkins.

686
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,298
If I may, ma'am,

687
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:02,434
there was a 13-year-old girl
named Carol...

688
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,570
that used to kind of take me
around the neighborhood...

689
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,205
and use my braid
as a dog leash...

690
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,340
and make me
beg for biscuits...

691
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,976
Carol Jenkins.

692
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,378
Yes. Carol Jenkins, huh?

693
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,881
Carol Jenkins
is a single mother of four...

694
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,049
temporarily relocated
from Delaware

695
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,885
to increase sales
for a software company.

696
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,819
Okay, that is...

697
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,354
a different occup...

698
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,325
Is there a problem?
No.

699
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,158
I was just wondering if this was my
family, or if I had taken hostages.

700
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,697
I'm just not sure...

701
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,000
how De Luca is gonna take me
seriously if I look like this.

702
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,035
De Luca is not going to
take you anything.

703
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,203
In case
you did not hear me...

704
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:38,604
you are not to make
direct contact

705
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,306
with any of the targets.

706
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,774
Track and report.

707
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,343
We're setting you up
in a surveillance office

708
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,978
across the street
from De Luca's.

709
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,513
You'll be tapped into
the same telecom trunk...

710
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:50,016
and have access to voice and
data coming into his office...

711
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,249
and that is as sexy
as it gets.

712
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,019
One mistake,

713
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,387
and we've got a nuclear bomb
in the hands of terrorists.

714
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:56,355
Do you understand?

715
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,856
Yes.

716
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,890
Go see Patrick. He's got
special equipment for you.

717
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,565
Oh, my God.

718
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:07,967
What are you doing?

719
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,938
Did you come up
with your spy name yet?

720
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,406
Mine would be
"Amber Valentine."

721
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,408
That sounds like
you're an adult film star.

722
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,177
No, I did the spy
name formula.

723
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,478
"Amber" was the name
of my first pet,

724
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,947
and I grew up
on Valentine Street.

725
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,814
That's how you come up
with your porn name.

726
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,750
I thought it was your spy name!
No!

727
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,118
What would yours be?

728
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:28,654
"Meatball Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard."

729
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,622
Yeah.
Wow.

730
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,226
Oh, my God.

731
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,595
This is so exciting!

732
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,763
(LAUGHS)

733
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:38,897
You're a spy!

734
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,199
I know! I know!

735
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,333
Oh, my God!

736
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,634
You're gonna get
one of those!

737
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:43,970
SUSAN: No, I'm not!

738
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,272
Look at that!

739
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,140
NANCY: That looks high-tech.

740
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,641
It's like the future.

741
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,211
Patrick.
Susan.

742
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,113
Hey, Patrick.
Yes.

743
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,182
I was given specific
instructions by Elaine

744
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,415
to tailor these
gadgets to you.

745
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,751
SUSAN: Wow. NANCY: Wow,
look at that watch.

746
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,785
These are not yours.

747
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:01,988
Oh.

748
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,126
Is that a rape whistle?

749
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,428
Elaine wanted you
to only be carrying items

750
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,464
a single woman travelling
through Europe would have.

751
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,033
But she could get that
at any pharmacy.

752
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,901
Not this whistle.

753
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,303
When you blow
through this whistle,

754
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,171
a small, poisonous
dart flies out...

755
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,140
neutralizing your target.

756
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,043
Also, it needs your
fingerprints on it to work.

757
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,877
That is really neat!
Stop it, that's amazing.

758
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,180
That is really super cool!
I love that!

759
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,094
This anti-fungal spray
can freeze and disable...

760
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,318
any security system.

761
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,520
Wow.

762
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,655
That is quite an image to be
carrying all over Europe.

763
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,290
It's also a pepper spray.

764
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,559
Why not just make it
look like pepper spray?

765
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,428
That's a pretty good idea.

766
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,595
Well, next time.

767
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,031
I can wait,

768
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:47,133
if you want to print up
a new label.

769
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,801
No, I'd have to turn
the printer on again.

770
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:50,835
I don't really want to.

771
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,472
Each of these
are filled with chloroform.

772
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:57,076
Wow, that is an unsettling
amount of hemorrhoid wipes.

773
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,844
Makes me kind of wonder...

774
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,247
what, exactly,
is going on back there.

775
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,714
I wouldn't know.
I don't have that problem.

776
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,216
I don't have that problem.

777
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,052
If you ever feel like
you have been poisoned...

778
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,586
chew one of these.

779
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,626
Have I done something
to you to upset you?

780
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,497
Because this is
a peculiar theme.

781
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,667
Finally, every agent gets
a night vision scope...

782
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,302
hidden in their watch.

783
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,771
I have heard about this.
I've been looking...

784
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,339
Oh.
Who's that?

785
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:29,275
That is Bette Midler
and Barbara Hershey.

786
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,143
From Beaches.

787
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,314
How much am I supposed
to like Beaches?

788
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,616
I would imagine a lot,
if you have the watch.

789
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,418
Hey, Pat, I'm flying!
PATRICK: Anthony!

790
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,087
Don't wear out
the battery on that.

791
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,788
Am I getting that?

792
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:44,856
No, you're not
gonna get that.

793
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,090
I've already packed your bags.
Hurry up and get dressed.

794
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,496
Carol Jenkins has to get
to the airport immediately.

795
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,930
And may I say...

796
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:52,931
I think it's very brave
of you to sacrifice

797
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,500
your life for your country.

798
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,702
I'm not sacrifi...
I'm coming back.

799
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,271
Let's see.

800
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:02,074
Hey, Pat! I'm gonna totally
crop dust these guys.

801
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,309

"Beverly Whine"!

Hack into the Rolls'
tracking system.

That car is a Wraith,

1138

so it has a satellite-aided
transmission.

00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:10,741
Track and report.
No contact!

1282
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:13,344
I'll track De Luca inside,
then I'll report.

1283
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:15,480
And if he initiates
contact with me...

1284
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,082
I'll just go with it.
Susan!

1285
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:20,184
Your "cat lady" look is not
gonna fit in in there.

1286
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:22,353
That's why Penny Morgan is
gonna burn her cat T-shirt...

1287
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:24,021
and spend some
of that Mary Kay money.

1288
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,456

And they're not gonna
reimburse you for all that.

1298
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,213
You should have gone
to cheaper stores, Susan.

1299
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,948
Okay, I'm going offline,
Nancy.

1300
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,082

If I'm not out in 10 minutes,
it's because I won the place.

1306
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,631
Let me just
rub that for luck.

1307
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:08,666
Oh, that's an oily scalp.

1308
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:20,711
I'm sorry, but I have
to check you in.

1309
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:24,214
Your name, please?
Penny Morgan.

1310
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:26,551
I don't see you on the list.
I'm so sorry.

1311
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:28,285
She's with me.

1312
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,187
Darling.
(GROWLS)

1313
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,523
You're late.
The way you look...

1314
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:35,059
I'd say it was more
than worth the wait. Come.

1315
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:36,461
Let's get a drink.
Ow. Ow.

1316
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,228
Such a gentleman.

1317
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,765
You look absolutely stunning
tonight here, darling.

1318
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:42,433
What the fuck are you doing
in here, arsehole?

1319
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:43,668
That's quite a tone
change, isn't it?

1320
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:45,169
What are you doing in here?

1321
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:47,371
You are completely
compromising me right now.

1322
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,173
I'm compromising you?
Fucking hilarious.

1323
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,374
You were about
to cause a scene

1324
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,576
trying to get into
this fucking place.

1325
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:53,177
Give me a little credit. What
do you think I'm gonna do?

1326
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,579
Run over there and be like,
"Hey, I'm a crazy lady!

1327
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,213
"Where's the buffet?
I'm from the Midwest.

1328
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,682
"Where's Blue Man Group?"

1329
00:56:57,715 --> 00:56:59,950
I am not an idiot, Ford.
You are an idiot.

1330
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:01,285
You should not be
in this casino...

1331
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:03,253
because De Luca is here and
I need to get close to him.

1332
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:05,456
How you gonna do that? How
you gonna do that, Cooper?

1333
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:06,423
What, are you gonna
seduce him?

1334
00:57:06,457 --> 00:57:07,592
That your big fucking plan?

1335
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,926
Yeah, what if it is?

1336
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,360
Why is that so hard
to believe?

1337
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:12,196
Because you look like a flute
player in a wedding band.

1338
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:13,564
That's fucking why!

1339
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,432
I'm here to take De Luca out.

1340
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,602
Ooh. It sounds romantic.
I hope you get lucky!

1341
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:19,403
God damn it, if I was trying
to sound romantic...

1342
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,572
you'd be lying on the floor,
soaking wet and breathless...

1343
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:22,940
wondering what came over you.

1344
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,375
But I'm not, so get the
fuck out of my way!

1345
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,411
I need you to rein it in,
buddy, okay?

1346
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,413
If you take out De Luca, we don't
have a shot at getting Rayna.

1347
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,516
So take it down, like,
5,000 notches!

1348
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:32,717
Take it down?
That's how you get

1349
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,951
polonium-210 slipped
into your drink...

1350
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,419
and go 18 months
in intensive care

1351
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,654
for radiation poisoning...

1352
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,556
and go six months
without eyesight...

1353
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:40,758
while everybody you've
ever loved is gunned down!

1354
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,727
Really? Everybody
that you love

1355
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,061
has been gunned down,
and just you survive?

1356
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,062
Did you ever think that maybe

1357
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,463
everybody you love
is not being killed...

1358
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:47,932
but they're
killing themselves

1359
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,000
because they can't stand
to be around you?

1360
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:51,636
This shit's the real deal,
life and death.

1361
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:53,538
This, the field...

1362
00:57:53,571 --> 00:57:55,339
is a hell of a lot different than
sitting behind your fucking monitor...

1363
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:56,473
googling shit.

1364
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:57,775
Stay away from me, Ford.

1365
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,343
And do not let
De Luca see you.

1366
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:00,745
And by the way,
I can see your gun

1367
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:02,112
sticking out
of your back pocket.

1368
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:04,715
Unless you're so extreme that
you've got a second dick...

1369
00:58:04,749 --> 00:58:05,816
coming out of your hip!

1370
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:39,283
Konnichiwa.

1371
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:42,452
Ma'am,
these seats are reserved.

1372
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:43,854
Of course they are.

1373
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:46,390
I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait outside.

1374
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:48,025
Yes, absolutely.

1375
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,259
Nope, not a door?

1376
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:52,630
I knew that.
Of course it's not a door.

1377
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:53,964
It probably
happens all the time.

1378
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:55,600
It's never happened before.
Okay.

1379
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:58,769
Ma'am.
Yes.

1380
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:04,408
Now, right here is okay.
No more exploring, please.

1381
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:05,876
Okay. Lovely.

1382
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:14,184
MAN: (SOFTLY)
From Mr. De Luca.

1383
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,422
(EARPIECE BEEPING)

1384
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:19,455
Nancy?

1385
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,859
Susan. Oh, my God! Hi!

1386
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,327
I found her.

1387
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,029
I found Rayna.
She's with De Luca.

1388
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,396
You did it!

1389
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:28,165
Excellent tracking
and reporting, madam.

1390
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:44,448
Oh, my God.

1391
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:46,550
Somebody just put
something in her drink.

1392
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,185
NANCY: What is it?
Is it poison?

1393
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:49,754
I don't think
it's a fiber supplement.

1394
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,822
She killed Fine, Nance.

1395
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:55,392
I could really enjoy just
watching her die right now.

1396
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,594
She's the only one who knows
where the bomb is...

1397
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:58,996
so Dudaev would never
get his hands on it.

1398
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:00,097
Oh, God, Susan.

1399
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,130
What are you gonna do?

1400
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,934
Excuse me, ma'am.

1401
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,871
Hi, do you speak English?

1402
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:09,373
Because I think somebody just
put a roofie in your cocktail.

1403
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,742
Are you sure
it wasn't you?

1404
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,978
What? No! God, I would never!

1405
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,113
Could you point
the man out?

1406
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:19,349
He just kind of
zipped out that door.

1407
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,351
He's wearing a purple bowtie.

1408
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:25,188
(INAUDIBLE)

1409
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,159
Thank you, Miss...

1410
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:31,929
Oh. Penny. Morgan.

1411
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,231
But it's no trouble, really.

1412
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:37,101
I think us ladies have to
watch out for each other.

1413
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,003
This kind of thing
happens all the time.

1414
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:42,039
People often try
to roofie you?

1415
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,808
Once, I asked someone
for a Tylenol,

1416
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,010
and they gave me
a Tylenol PM.

1417
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:47,883
I'm not sure what
their intentions were, but...

1418
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:53,751
It seems
they may have found him.

1419
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:55,304
Would you come with me
to identify him?

1420
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:57,688
Yes. Of course.

1421
01:00:57,722 --> 01:00:58,923
I'm happy to help.

1422
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,262
(SOFTLY) Holy shit.

1423
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,937
My friend here
said she saw you

1424
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,638
put something in my drink.

1425
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,340
I don't know
any of you people. Okay?

1426
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,108
I'm just in Rome
on business.

1427
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:20,477
I was about to head back
to my hotel and go to sleep.

1428
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,081
Perfect. Just in time
for a nightcap.

1429
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:25,415
Apparently, there's nothing
wrong with it.

1430
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:26,449
I don't want your drink.

1431
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:31,587
(INAUDIBLE)

1432
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:40,097
Fuck you, Rayna.

1433
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,768
Mmm. Scrumptious.

1434
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,037
So, joke's on you.

1435
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,442
(CHOKING) Fuck you!

1436
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:56,380
Fuck you!

1437
01:01:58,749 --> 01:01:59,917
(GURGLING)

1438
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,605
How long was I out?

1439
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,307
You fainted just long enough
for us to laugh at you.

1440
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,842
What happened?

1441
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,876
It was all a dream.

1442
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:29,079
I'm just kidding.
A man's throat dissolved.

1443
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:31,281
Sorry, I'm not usually,
you know...

1444
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:34,952
Oh, thank you. That's...

1445
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,388
surprisingly polite.

1446
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:39,990
Sorry about that.

1447
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:42,059
I've seen a lot of things
in my day. I just haven't...

1448
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,594
I have never seen that,
exactly.

1449
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,997
Penny, do you feel the need

1450
01:02:47,031 --> 01:02:48,591
to tell anybody about
what you just saw?

1451
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,570
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

1452
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,273
That asshole
got what he deserved.

1453
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,775
I knew from the second
I saw him, I thought...

1454
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:00,209
"That guy doesn't
deserve a throat."

1455
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:01,879
So, good on you.

1456
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:07,017
I would like to take you
to dinner to say thank you.

1457
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:09,286
And we must discuss
this hideous dress.

1458
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,988
It's just hysterical.

1459
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:14,258
Oh, good,
that's what I was hoping for.

1460
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,427
And by the way...

1461
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,429
Hristo was supposed to be
looking after me at the bar...

1462
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,398
and making sure nobody
put anything in my drinks.

1463
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:26,904
(SIGHS)

1464
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:28,805
(SIGHS) They'll give him
a talking-to.

1465
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:31,775
Seems fair.
Maybe dock him a day's wage.

1466
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:32,742
(GUNSHOT)
Or shoot him in the head.

1467
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:33,944
That always works.

1468
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,746
Rome is quite amaz...

1469
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,915
Rome is the worst.
Yes.

1470
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:39,884
So boring and tacky.

1471
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:42,953
I'm so glad one of us
finally said it. (LAUGHS)

1472
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,227
You have lipstick
on your teeth.

1473
01:03:44,688 --> 01:03:46,090
Really?

1474
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:47,523
Looks like you ate
a box of crayons.

1475
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,657
Damn it.

1476
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:51,996
Here we are.

1477
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:53,730
These should have been brought
out when we first sat down.

1478
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,632
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1479
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,003
So far, I'm riddled with
disappointment at the service.

1480
01:03:59,036 --> 01:04:01,471
So sorry.
Signora, I apologize.

1481
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,810
I once saw someone eat...

1482
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,914
one of these before.

1483
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:14,718
This is... strange.

1484
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:16,586
Do you always tear your food
up into little pieces?

1485
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,255
You look like a squirrel.

1486
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:20,524
I was just checking
for the consistency.

1487
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:23,693
Mmm.

1488
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:25,295
You eat like a baby.

1489
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:26,463
Thank you.

1490
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:30,134
So, do you like to have a
look at the wine list?

1491
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,635
Yes. Penny, you can order.

1492
01:04:32,937 --> 01:04:34,071
Okay. Oh!

1493
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,973
Has some heft.

1494
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,407
Okay.

1495
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:39,910
I'm feeling a red.

1496
01:04:39,944 --> 01:04:41,979
Kind of a red.
I like a lot of noise.

1497
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,580
I like a little bit of...

1498
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,182
kind of a barky finish.

1499
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,616
I tend to like a white...

1500
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,719
with the grit of a hummus...

1501
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:52,222
that's, of course,
been thinned out.

1502
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:54,925
Just kind of jump up
in the front of your palate...

1503
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:57,394
and then rip back
and sizzle.

1504
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:01,331
Almost a mineral
kind of dirt finish...

1505
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:04,969
if we're having meat. Okay,
here, this is looking...

1506
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:07,071
promising.
Something with...

1507
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:09,006
This one has
nice hints of toast...

1508
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,276
and dogwood,
I assume? Hmm?

1509
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:13,677
Uh...

1510
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,414
I will have
the Sapori e Delizie.

1511
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:19,483
Right.

1512
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,751
That is the name
of this restaurant.

1513
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:23,287
Yes, I'm aware of that.

1514
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,555
So, why don't you
surprise us...

1515
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,224
with something
that we don't know?

1516
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,059
Like a delicious
bottle of wine.

1517
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,962
Right. Sorry, I will be back
in five minutes, okay?

1518
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:34,364
So hard to get
good help these days.

1519
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:36,133
Don't you find that?
I find that.

1520
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:40,670
I know who all
your active agents are.

1521
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:45,009
Okay, I'm sensing, uh...

1522
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:47,477
Can I do a little do over?

1523
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,545
I, uh...

1524
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:52,249
I really don't know
how to order wine.

1525
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,986
I'm from a small town
in Iowa.

1526
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,687
I saved up my money
to come on this Rome trip.

1527
01:05:57,721 --> 01:05:59,589
I had a little jar
on my desk at work...

1528
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,058
and everybody said, "You're
never gonna make enough money."

1529
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,093
But I did, and I'm here.

1530
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:06,063
And then I meet you,
and I can't afford...

1531
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:07,531
to eat at a place like this,

1532
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:09,399
and I'm just trying
to impress you...

1533
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:11,335
and doing a really
poor job of it.

1534
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:14,904
I thought as much.

1535
01:06:14,938 --> 01:06:18,042
Your cheap prom dress doesn't
exactly scream sophistication.

1536
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:19,876
Oh.

1537
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,546
Well, I didn't go to prom,
so maybe it is...

1538
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:24,148
When I was a little girl
growing up in Bulgaria...

1539
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:26,416
which is the worst,
by the way.

1540
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,519
Poor people everywhere and
cabbages constantly cooking.

1541
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:32,089
There was this woman who was
kicked out of her house...

1542
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,890
and she lost
all her money.

1543
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,525
She couldn't even
sell her body.

1544
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:38,528
So she became a clown
on the streets.

1545
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,830
She would perform all her
tricks standing in mud,

1546
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:43,067
and just cry and cry.

1547
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,602
You remind me of this woman.

1548
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:48,438
Oh. Thank you.

1549
01:06:48,472 --> 01:06:51,175
I don't know what it is, but
there's something about you.

1550
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:54,111
The fainting,
the way you talk...

1551
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:56,146
your terrible
sense of style.

1552
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,315
I did get this at
quite a lovely...

1553
01:06:58,348 --> 01:06:59,483
It makes me sad
to think of you here

1554
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,885
spending all your
savings on Rome.

1555
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,088
Come on.
We're going to Budapest.

1556
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:05,722
Budapest?

1557
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:07,124
I have some business
to finish there...

1558
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:09,126
and you can take my private
jet when we're done...

1559
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,960
anywhere you want to
get home.

1560
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:12,634
My way of repaying you
for saving my life.

1561
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,231
Okay.

1562
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:19,768
Is there a problem?

1563
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:27,177
No. Not at all. Let's go.

1564
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:30,080
Hey! Wait, what?

1565
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:31,448
I'm just talking
to the girl!

1566
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:32,841
Okay, okay.
Let's not make a scene.

1567
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:35,319
Let me just
get my room key out...

1568
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:37,454
and I'll grab a bag
and pack my things.

1569
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:39,823
It's Susan.
She's sending a code.

1570
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:40,824
RAYNA: No, they can
fly you back later.

1571
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:42,292
"Shut...

1572
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:43,660
And if the rest of your clothes
look like that dress...

1573
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,061
"...down...

1574
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:45,895
...I can send someone
to burn them for you.

1575
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,264
Ha-ha.

1576
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:48,665
"...the power."
Quite a zinger!

1577
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,337
Shut down the power
to the Casino Di Rome.

1578
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,370
What?

1579
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,041
Shut the entire bloody
grid down, then! Now!

1580
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,075
That would be great.

1581
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,580
(GRUNTING)

1582
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:05,894
MAN: Everybody, please remain
calm and stay where you are.

1583
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,416
(GRUNTS)

1584
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:15,425
Oh, no!
What's happening?

1585
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:16,859
(RAYNA SCREAMS)

1586
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:25,869
(MOUTHING) I've got this.

1587
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:29,173
What the fuck just happened?

1588
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:31,908
God damn it.

1589
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,477
Oh, my God! Rayna.

1590
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,811
Thank God
your hair broke your fall.

1591
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,446
I don't know what happened.

1592
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,482
The lights were going out, and I
don't know if it's a robbery.

1593
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:41,351
Two of your guys slammed
into me and took you down.

1594
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:43,587
I think one of them
touched my bottom.

1595
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,700
I don't know which one,
but I definitely felt a hand.

1596
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:48,358
Are they gonna be okay?

1597
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:49,493
I wouldn't
worry about them.

1598
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:51,295
Their fate has just
been sealed.

1599
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:56,266
Sorry. I'll let you go.

1600
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,301
Shame on you!

1601
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:06,876
Wow.

1602
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,946
This is a really jazzy plane.

1603
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,615
Is this yours?

1604
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,716
It was my father's.

1605
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,585
You've never been
on a private jet before?

1606
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:16,620
Oh, no.

1607
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:19,723
I did get upgraded
to premium economy once...

1608
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:22,125
which was pretty plush.

1609
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,628
Premium economy.

1610
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,196
Sounds like a pen
for dirty animals.

1611
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,931
Yeah, probably.

1612
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,734
But it was not
quite like this.

1613
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,168
Thank you.

1614
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:35,305
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1615
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,940
Can't just be because
I remind you

1616
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:38,842
of some sad Bulgarian clown.

1617
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:40,244
You remind me of my mother.

1618
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:41,777
Oh.

1619
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:44,281
Really?

1620
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:47,183
You know that you and I
are pretty close in age.

1621
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:48,885
You're funny.

1622
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,220
It's the Bulgarian
clown in you.

1623
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:51,955
Okay.
She was marvelous.

1624
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:53,790
But she was different.

1625
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:54,924
Eccentric, like you are.

1626
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,360
Oh.

1627
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:57,427
The moment I saw you
standing there

1628
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:58,595
in that abortion
of a dress...

1629
01:09:58,628 --> 01:09:59,796
Ah... Come on.

1630
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,531
...it was as if to say...

1631
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:03,925
"This is what I've got, world.
It's hideous, but it's mine."

1632
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:07,136
This was her.
(GASPS)

1633
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,705
Oh, wow.

1634
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,240
Hey, how'd you get
that picture of me?

1635
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:11,741
I look amazing.

1636
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:13,743
Hello, doppelganger.

1637
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:15,912
She was the only person
I could ever trust.

1638
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,848
Well, here's to your mom.

1639
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,950
To my mother. And to you.

1640
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:22,552
And here's to you.

1641
01:10:22,586 --> 01:10:25,255
You may never
be as wise as an owl...

1642
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:27,291
but you'll always
be a hoot to me.

1643
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,494
What a stupid fucking
retarded toast.

1644
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:31,961
You're delightful.
As are you.

1645
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:35,732
Mmm.

1646
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,735
Now, where did you say
we were headed?

(CLEARS THROAT)

1649

you have been poisoned...

chew one of these.

1653
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:52,948
Chew one of these.

1654
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:09,799
What happened?

1655
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,167
I've never seen somebody

1656
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,869
dive for
stool softener before.

1657
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:14,938
That's one thing
that happened.

1658
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:15,971
What did you do?

1659
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,207
Did you drug me?

1660
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:19,709
Of course I did.

1661
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:21,345
I told you,
I can't trust anybody.

1662
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:22,698
I had to look
through your things.

1663
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:24,781
Anyway, tell me...

1664
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:25,915
are your hemorrhoids
particularly large,

1665
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:26,949
or just tenacious?

1666
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:28,918

1667
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,887
I'm not texting,
if you must know.

1668

and I just made level 95.

Jesus, Colin,
what the fuck are you doing?

1672
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:42,566
I'm sorry, Rayna, but there's
been a change of plans.

1673
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,067
Who paid you off, Colin?

1674
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,235
Colin hasn't worked here for,
like, eight months.

1675
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:47,437
I'm Fredrick.

1676

Is that why
you're doing this?

1677
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:50,239
Because I don't remember
your fucking name?

1678
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:51,541
Let's just say
there's some people

1679
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:53,142
who really want
what you're selling.

1680
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:54,944
You don't have to do this.

I can give you a very
comfortable life, Col...

Um...

1683
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,283
You forgot my name again,
didn't you?

1684
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,317
No, I didn't.
Yeah.

1685
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:03,286
It's...

1686

Don't say fucking Colin.

1687
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:07,491
Fuck! I don't give a shit
what your name is.

1688
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:08,858
You're the fucking help!

1689
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:11,495
Nice try, Colin... but Stan
and I already sold it to...

It's Fredrick!

paid me for one...

Blow that thing
all you want, lady.

1701

Yeah? Why don't
you blow me, Colin.

01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,414
Yeah, "You look
just like my dead mama.

1753
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,083
"Wah."

1754
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:21,417
And fuck you for saying

1755
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,654
I look anything
like that fucking beast.

1756
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:26,690
No wonder your father
never had the son he wanted.

1757
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:28,625
You fuck that monster once...

1758
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:30,960
and you just drop
the fucking mic and walk out.

1759
01:15:30,994 --> 01:15:33,296
Fuck you. Everything
you've said is a lie.

1760
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,864
Oh.

1761
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:36,933
What happened? Did I hit
a little sore spot?

1762
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,868
Yeah, he always wanted a
son, and you knew it.

1763
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:42,305
Look, he wanted you
to take over the business.

1764
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:45,008
He was just afraid you were
gonna get yourself killed.

1765
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,310
So if you wanna live, and you
wanna unload that bomb...

1766
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:48,845
you stick with me.

1767
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:51,347
And if you got
a problem with that...

1768
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,649
you know what you
can do, Rayna?

1769
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,720
You and your bullshit accent

1770
01:15:56,753 --> 01:15:59,022
can land this fucking plane
by yourselves.

1771
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:03,960
Okay, bodyguard.

1772
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:06,195
But if I find out you're lying
to me about any of this...

1773
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:09,232
I'll show you ways to die
you never even dreamed of.

1774
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,303
Now, let's go to Budapest.
I need a fucking drink.

1775
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:15,672
Yeah, I bet you fucking do.

1776
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,178
(SIGHS)

1777
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:23,647
Oh, my God.

1778
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:30,419
♪ People want my power
And they want my station

1779
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:35,191
♪ Stormed my winter palace
But they couldn't take it

1780
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:39,062
♪ Try to pull my status
But they couldn't fake it ♪

1781
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:45,068
Welcome back to the Four Seasons
Budapest, Miss Boyanov.

1782
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,102
Don't talk to me.
You're not my friend.

1783
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,170
Get away from me.

1784
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,938
Move. Move! I got it.

1785
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:52,942
So, what's the plan?
Who are we meeting?

1786
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:54,944
You're my bodyguard,
not my business partner...

1787
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:56,813
so just focus
on guarding my body.

1788
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,514
So not knowing
who we're meeting tonight

1789
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,582
is gonna make me
extra effective.

1790
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,917
That's okay. I get it.

1791
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,385
I got shit to do.
You'll probably be fine.

1792
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:04,387
Why don't I go get you
a nice dress to be buried in?

1793
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,420
Dumbass.

1794
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,424
I'm meeting
a potential bidder,

1795
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,126
if you must know.

1796
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,627
If they don't top
the current offer,

1797
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:12,821
the sale
will happen tomorrow.

1798
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:14,297
Where?
I don't know yet.

1799
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:23,206
Anton!

1800
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:24,774
Ouch!

1801
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,343
Anton is part of my
security team, psycho!

1802
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,879
Yeah, well, guess what?
I don't like his face.

1803
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:31,380
I don't like the looks
of your face!

1804
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:32,982
And who the fuck are you?

1805
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:34,784
I'm the person that's gonna
cut your dick off

1806
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:36,619
and glue it
to your forehead...

1807
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:37,620
so you look like
a limp-dick unicorn.

1808
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,122
That's who the fuck I am.

1809
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,656
Your name should be
"Mr. Bag o' Dicks"...

1810
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:41,958
not "Anton."

1811
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:45,094
Okay. Jesus.
Let's just calm down, okay?

1812
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:47,630
Does he not look like a bag o' dicks?
Enough.

1813
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,265
I can see why my father
liked you now.

1814
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,268
Amber is my hired bodyguard.

1815
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:54,804
Be more like her.

1816
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:57,206
And your head better not have
broken my fucking phone.

1817
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,985
We've got a big night
ahead of us.

1818
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,854
Don't be afraid
to clean yourself up, Amber.

1819
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:12,421
Take a shower
is what I'm saying.

1820
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:14,390
Yeah? Don't be afraid
to hit water yourself.

1821
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,525
You smell like a dead hooker
that washed up on the beach...

1822
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:17,827
then roasted in the sun
for a week

1823
01:18:17,861 --> 01:18:19,128
before anybody found
her body.

1824
01:18:19,162 --> 01:18:21,130
Okay. You need
to take it way down.

1825
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:22,565
I'm sorry, that's too much.
Okay, that was too much.

1826
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:23,933
Jeez!
Too much.

1827
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:24,967
God.

1828
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:33,042
What are you staring at?

1829
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,212
I will destroy you.

1830
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:37,613
And then after
I'm done destroying you,

1831
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,783
I'll take a picture
of what's left...

1832
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,951
of your body, and I'm gonna
text it to your mother.

1833
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:43,887
With a little note that says
his last words were...

1834
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,189
"My mother was terrible.
You did this to me."

1835
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,323
That's so fucking mean.

1836
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:48,591
Yeah, I'm so fucking mean.

1837
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:49,658
You're just
figuring that out?

1838
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:50,860
Give me your coat.

1839
01:18:50,894 --> 01:18:52,561
This is a man's coat.

1840
01:18:52,595 --> 01:18:54,597
Yeah, but I don't
see a man, do I?

1841
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,365
I see a reject from
The Sound of Music.

1842
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,602
It was my mother's coat,
but she's very masculine.

1843
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:02,471
You look like ABBA took a shit
and put a trench coat on it.

1844
01:19:02,505 --> 01:19:04,373
Well, I won't
give it to you.

1845
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:05,408
I've been in this dress
for 12 fucking hours.

1846
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:06,441
Give me your coat.

1847
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,044
No.

1848
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,114
Yeah. No, I won't give...
This is my coat.

1849
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:12,849
I'm gonna reach through
your fucking body...

1850
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:14,784
and rip out your back
like a fucking werewolf.

1851
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:16,986
Without tearing the jacket.

1852
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:18,521
Just so I can
wear your jacket,

1853
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:20,189
and give you a final
"Fuck you."

1854
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:21,690
Oh, no, you won't.

1855
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:23,126
I'm gonna take
that fucking coat.

1856
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,360
(GROANING)

1857
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:26,495
I warned you, you Swedish
gummy fish motherfucker!

1858
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:27,529
ANTON: Ouch!

1859
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:32,969
Oh, my God.

1860
01:19:33,736 --> 01:19:34,938
Oh, my God.

1861
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:37,807
Nance?
Oh, my God, Susan!

1862
01:19:37,841 --> 01:19:40,209
Hello. Hello?

1863
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:41,544
Just say something
to me, please.

1864
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:43,112
Susan? Anything.

1865
01:19:43,146 --> 01:19:44,948
I cannot handle this,
Susan!

1866
01:19:44,981 --> 01:19:46,349
There is nothing
in real life

1867
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:47,450
that someone could
do to a spy...

1868
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,652
that is filthier
or more upsetting

1869
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:51,087
than what my brain
will cook up right now.

1870
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,789
So save me from myself,
Susan!

1871
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:54,891
Because you know
what's going to happen.

1872
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:56,559
I'm gonna get chattier,
aren't I?

1873
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:58,995
Did you know that you can't
ever change having big pores?

1874
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,831
Oh, my God, Nancy,
you are driving me nuts!

1875
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:04,033
I couldn't talk because I was in
an elevator filled with people.

1876
01:20:04,067 --> 01:20:06,235
You're all right.
Oh, thank God.

1877
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,872
You disappeared for 12 hours.
We didn't know what happened!

1878
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:11,240
I had to take out my earpiece
and my camera.

1879
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:12,914
Rayna's on to our agents
and she was gonna

1880
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:14,610
spot my equipment
from a mile away.

1881
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,312
You're with Rayna?

1882
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:18,948
You're not supposed to be
within a mile away of her.

1883
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:20,483
Nancy, I know,
but I'm in deep

1884
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:22,018
and I'm getting
such good intel.

1885
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,386
Please,
I just need to remain

1886
01:20:23,419 --> 01:20:25,354
on radio silence
just a little bit longer.

1887
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:26,822
Well, don't worry,
because I'll be able

1888
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:28,124
to keep a better eye
on you now.

1889
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,397
What are you
talking about? How?

1890
01:20:31,094 --> 01:20:32,962
What are you doing here?

1891
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:34,630
Elaine wanted to know exactly
what you were up to...

1892
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,166
so I tracked your earpiece.
They sent me here to find you.

1893
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,467
They sent you?

1894
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:39,903
I'm as unknown as you are,

1895
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,104
so they thought
my cover was safe.

1896
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:42,405
Did they give you
an identity?

1897
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:44,407
It's so cool.

1898
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,542
I said I wanted to be
Amber Valentine... What?

1899
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:48,077
...and they let me use it.

1900
01:20:48,111 --> 01:20:49,245
I don't know why you got
to pick your identity.

1901
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:50,746
I had to go
as a freaking cat lady.

1902
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:51,881
RAYNA: Amber!
BOTH: Yes?

1903
01:20:51,915 --> 01:20:53,249
Who is this?

1904
01:20:53,282 --> 01:20:54,817
I'm sorry. I didn't know

01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:47,475
(GROANS)

2223
01:36:01,123 --> 01:36:02,357
(SCREAMS)

2224
01:36:03,425 --> 01:36:04,425
Oh...

2225
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,361
That's clean through.

2226
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,964
Thanks for your weapon.

2227
01:36:08,997 --> 01:36:10,265
It's been inside you,

2228
01:36:10,298 --> 01:36:11,938
so I don't think
it should go inside me...

2229
01:36:22,811 --> 01:36:24,279
Get up. Get up!

2230
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:30,052
You are under arrest
by Susan Cooper...

2231
01:36:30,085 --> 01:36:31,645
and the government
of the United States.

2232
01:36:41,696 --> 01:36:43,298
Rayna, how did you do that?

2233
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:44,331
I didn't.

2234
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:45,666
He did.

2235
01:36:53,175 --> 01:36:54,175
Hello, Coop.

2236
01:36:57,512 --> 01:36:58,580
Fine?

2237
01:36:58,613 --> 01:36:59,613
Ow...

2238
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,516
FINE: Hey.

2239
01:37:02,484 --> 01:37:03,551
Coop.

2240
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,565
Wake up!

2241
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:20,668
Did you have a nice nap?

2242
01:37:20,702 --> 01:37:22,504
You were snoring
very loudly.

2243
01:37:22,537 --> 01:37:23,838
That's just really
not the most

2244
01:37:23,872 --> 01:37:25,773
upsetting news right now.

2245
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:27,943
My father used to
bring people here.

2246
01:37:27,976 --> 01:37:30,545
Did he also make you dress
like a slutty dolphin trainer?

2247
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:32,247
He'd starve them...

2248
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:33,681
torture them.

2249
01:37:33,715 --> 01:37:35,150
You name it.

2250
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:36,618
But he especially
didn't like it

2251
01:37:36,651 --> 01:37:38,020
when people lied to him.

2252
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:40,588
Not that I bought it.

2253
01:37:40,622 --> 01:37:41,656
You knew?

2254
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,125
Of course I knew.

2255
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:45,793
I told you, you were better
off in the basement, Coop.

2256
01:37:45,827 --> 01:37:47,195
You could have
avoided all of this.

2257
01:37:47,229 --> 01:37:48,830
And what, Fine?

2258
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:50,565
Now you're a nuclear
black marketer?

2259
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:51,633
A terrorist?

2260
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:53,335
No...

2261
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:56,071
He's just fucking me.

2262
01:38:03,745 --> 01:38:04,913
You're a loud kisser.

2263
01:38:05,981 --> 01:38:07,950
Excuse me?
You're a loud kisser.

2264
01:38:07,983 --> 01:38:10,185
And it's gross
and unappealing.

2265
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:11,719
You look like some
old, toothless woman

2266
01:38:11,753 --> 01:38:13,055
sucking the jelly
out of a donut.

2267
01:38:14,522 --> 01:38:15,991
Hey, what's it like
sleeping with the man

2268
01:38:16,024 --> 01:38:17,559
that killed your father?

2269
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:18,592
Nice try, Coop.

2270
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:21,964
She already knows
it was Cress.

2271
01:38:22,164 --> 01:38:23,298
Ah.

2272
01:38:23,331 --> 01:38:24,766
Okay.

2273
01:38:24,799 --> 01:38:28,136
You've probably always been in
love with him, haven't you?

2274
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:30,438
Talking in his ear...

2275
01:38:30,472 --> 01:38:33,241
hoping eventually one day
he'll fall in love with you.

2276
01:38:33,608 --> 01:38:35,043
(CHUCKLES)

2277
01:38:35,077 --> 01:38:37,679
Poor little,
pathetic Susan Coleman.

2278
01:38:37,712 --> 01:38:39,114
That's not my last name,

2279
01:38:39,147 --> 01:38:40,747
so it's really not much
of a burn, is it?

2280
01:38:40,782 --> 01:38:41,816
Cooping.

2281
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:42,884
No.

2282
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,152
Croupon.

2283
01:38:44,186 --> 01:38:46,154
Are you thinking "Groupon"?

2284
01:38:46,188 --> 01:38:47,722
No, my name's not "Groupon."

2285
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,524
Croupe.
Keep going.

2286
01:38:49,557 --> 01:38:50,959
Kapowski.

2287
01:38:50,993 --> 01:38:52,527
That's getting
further from it!

2288
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,730
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
let's just call you dead.

2289
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:57,299
Hey, baby?

2290
01:38:57,332 --> 01:38:58,433
I thought we were gonna hang
on to her till tonight.

2291
01:38:58,466 --> 01:39:00,002
I changed my mind.

2292
01:39:03,305 --> 01:39:04,339
Goodbye.

2293
01:39:04,973 --> 01:39:05,974
(CLICKS)
(GASPS)

2294
01:39:06,908 --> 01:39:08,210
(CHUCKLES)

2295
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:10,678
Like I'd waste
a bullet on you.

2296
01:39:12,747 --> 01:39:13,982
Put her in the room.

2297
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:24,191
Ah!

2298
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:33,467
Hey, Aldo.

2299
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:36,838
Hello, captured lady.

2300
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:38,206
I failed.

2301
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:40,675
I failed the mission.

2302
01:39:41,676 --> 01:39:43,678
Fine is alive...

2303
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:45,513
and he's a traitor.

2304
01:39:45,547 --> 01:39:47,182
Don't be downhearted.

2305
01:39:49,084 --> 01:39:51,453
My mama said to me...

2306
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:56,558
"Aldo,
life is full of sorrow...

2307
01:39:56,591 --> 01:39:58,060
"and surprises.

2308
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:04,732
"But, a magnificent
pair of bosoms...

2309
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:08,070
"will..."

2310
01:40:10,905 --> 01:40:12,207
Good story.

2311
01:40:24,586 --> 01:40:26,121
Susan.

2312
01:40:26,154 --> 01:40:27,655
Get away from me.
No, listen.

2313
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:29,091
I haven't got much time.

2314
01:40:29,124 --> 01:40:30,325
Why'd you do it, Fine?

2315
01:40:30,892 --> 01:40:33,295
This was my only way in.

2316
01:40:33,328 --> 01:40:36,398
I had to fake my death
to gain Rayna's trust.

2317
01:40:36,431 --> 01:40:38,666
I jammed the signal,
popped out my lens.

2318
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,535
It was easy.

2319
01:40:40,568 --> 01:40:43,338
I hated to do it to you, Coop,
but I had to. I had to.

2320
01:40:43,371 --> 01:40:45,240
Rayna knew
all about our agents...

2321
01:40:45,273 --> 01:40:47,975
because Karen Walker
sold her the names.

2322
01:40:48,009 --> 01:40:49,277
I just couldn't trust anyone
at the agency

2323
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:51,413
not to give me away,
not even you.

2324
01:40:51,446 --> 01:40:53,081
How do I even know
you're telling me the truth?

2325
01:40:53,115 --> 01:40:55,083
Did Karen Walker
try to kill you?

2326
01:40:55,117 --> 01:40:56,551
You shot her?

2327
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:58,653
I'm deep undercover.

2328
01:40:58,686 --> 01:41:00,622
But not so deep that
I can't still protect you.

2329
01:41:02,023 --> 01:41:03,091
All right, look me
in the eye.

2330
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:04,326
What?

2331
01:41:04,359 --> 01:41:05,793
Really look me
in the eye.

2332
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:10,698
One of your eyes is bigger
than the other.

2333
01:41:10,732 --> 01:41:11,799
Really?

2334
01:41:12,033 --> 01:41:14,068
No.

2335
01:41:14,102 --> 01:41:15,970
You're perfect,
God damn it.

2336
01:41:16,003 --> 01:41:17,439
Asshole.

2337
01:41:17,472 --> 01:41:18,706
(GROANS) SUSAN: God! (GROANS)

2338
01:41:20,108 --> 01:41:21,376
That hurt.

2339
01:41:21,409 --> 01:41:23,611
Good, it was
supposed to.

2340
01:41:23,645 --> 01:41:24,912
Bosom.

2341
01:41:24,946 --> 01:41:26,614
Is he dangerous?

2342
01:41:26,648 --> 01:41:29,016
Only if you have boobs.

2343
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:31,286
So did Rayna
really know I was a spy?

2344
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:34,722
No. Not until you blew your
cover back at that kitchen.

2345
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:37,091
I really thought she was more
experienced than that.

2346
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:38,726
Thank God she's not, huh?

2347
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,496
Because if she was,
you'd be dead now.

2348
01:41:41,529 --> 01:41:42,969
I think they're pretty
good covers...

2349
01:41:42,997 --> 01:41:44,632
I gotta go.

2350
01:41:44,666 --> 01:41:46,768
We're heading to De Luca's
villa to meet with Dudaev.

2351
01:41:46,801 --> 01:41:49,337
Then we're taking him
to wherever the bomb is.

2352
01:41:49,371 --> 01:41:50,438
This thing is almost over.

2353
01:41:52,474 --> 01:41:53,608
Hang tight.

2354
01:41:58,313 --> 01:42:00,315
Hello, bound lady.

2355
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:02,184
Not now, Aldo.

2356
01:42:02,217 --> 01:42:05,920
I think Mr. Fine
has underestimated you.

2357
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:08,022
You found your targets,

2358
01:42:08,055 --> 01:42:09,775
you tracked them down,
you fought very hard.

2359
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:11,359
Susan...

2360
01:42:13,094 --> 01:42:14,229
you are a good agent.

2361
01:42:16,998 --> 01:42:18,866
You'll get them
next time, huh?

2362
01:42:20,635 --> 01:42:22,337
Unless we die here.

2363
01:42:25,207 --> 01:42:27,442
Then you will not.

2364
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:29,411
You know what,
I'm not going down like this.

2365
01:42:29,444 --> 01:42:30,978
I need you to untie me.

2366
01:42:31,012 --> 01:42:32,214
Bosom. What?

2367
01:42:32,247 --> 01:42:33,848
Stop! God damn it!

2368
01:42:34,816 --> 01:42:35,816
Just untie me.

2369
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,720
No, you heard Mr. Fine.
He's working a plan.

2370
01:42:38,753 --> 01:42:39,854
We have to stay put.

2371
01:42:39,887 --> 01:42:41,689
Untie me. Now.

2372
01:42:45,193 --> 01:42:46,728
That's my ass.

2373
01:42:46,761 --> 01:42:49,931
It is very difficult to see
or gauge my position.

2374
01:42:49,964 --> 01:42:51,333
You're just simply
grabbing my ass.

2375
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:53,901
Oh. I am, sorry.

2376
01:42:53,935 --> 01:42:55,970
Let's roll
to our side.

2377
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:57,071
God!

2378
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,840
Oh! Hey!

2379
01:42:58,873 --> 01:43:01,943
The knot is very tight,
but I am making progress.

2380
01:43:01,976 --> 01:43:03,545
Your hand is way up in there.

2381
01:43:03,578 --> 01:43:07,282
My right hand is restrained
from the weight of my body.

2382
01:43:07,315 --> 01:43:08,683
Okay. Let's try this.

2383
01:43:08,716 --> 01:43:09,884
Oh, God.

2384
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:11,386

01:43:11,419 --> 01:43:15,790
Okay. I will
inchworm my way...

(GRUNTING LOUDLY)

2387
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:24,266
You're being very loud.

01:43:26,234 --> 01:43:27,535
(GROANING)

2389
01:43:28,603 --> 01:43:29,603
Shh!

2390
01:43:30,171 --> 01:43:31,506
(GROANING)

2391
01:43:33,007 --> 01:43:35,743
Wait. I have idea.

2392
01:43:35,777 --> 01:43:36,777
God. Another one?

2393
01:43:37,512 --> 01:43:39,314
Oh, Jesus.
Don't move.

2394
01:43:39,347 --> 01:43:40,815
Wait, wait, wait!
Stay still.

2395
01:43:40,848 --> 01:43:42,083
No, no, no!

2396
01:43:42,116 --> 01:43:43,451
Yes, yes, yes.

2397
01:43:43,485 --> 01:43:44,986
Oh, God!
Yes.

2398
01:43:45,019 --> 01:43:46,721
Can't be happening.

2399
01:43:46,754 --> 01:43:48,890
Damn it, I was having
such an empowering moment

2400
01:43:48,923 --> 01:43:50,992
before this started.

2401
01:43:51,025 --> 01:43:56,264
My penis may be gently kissing
the back of your head.

2402
01:43:56,298 --> 01:43:57,832
Just untie me
before I crush your nuts.

2403
01:43:57,865 --> 01:43:59,334
Oh, please.

2404
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:01,869
If only we had time
for such pleasures.

2405
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:04,539
Go!

2406
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:06,941
Your face and the knot
are about to enter my colon.

2407
01:44:08,876 --> 01:44:10,312
Stop licking it!

2408
01:44:12,347 --> 01:44:13,581
(BOTH GRUNTING)

2409
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:15,850
It is done.

2410
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:17,419
Thank you, Aldo.

2411
01:44:17,452 --> 01:44:19,186
I don't wanna know
why my neck is wet...

2412
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:21,088
but you did excellent work.
Prego.

2413
01:44:21,122 --> 01:44:23,057
Turn around,
let me untie you,

2414
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,592
and let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,108
I'm gonna go to De Luca's
and back up Fine.

2418
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,221
You know where
the villa is?

2419
01:45:17,545 --> 01:45:19,847
I know everything.

2420
01:45:19,881 --> 01:45:22,316
One day, lady super spy...

2436
01:47:03,951 --> 01:47:06,153
Welcome to Lake Balaton.

2437
01:47:06,187 --> 01:47:07,589
I found this staircase

2438
01:47:07,622 --> 01:47:10,625
and made them build
a house around it.

2439
01:47:10,658 --> 01:47:13,160
Our dear Mr. Dudaev
will be arriving shortly.

2440
01:47:14,696 --> 01:47:18,666
You are about to become
a very rich woman, Rayna.

2441
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:20,668
Which means you'll have to be
a little more careful...

2442
01:47:20,702 --> 01:47:23,104
about the company you keep.

2443
01:47:23,137 --> 01:47:26,508
So many people have such
terrible agendas...

2444
01:47:26,541 --> 01:47:28,976
like perhaps
your friend here.

2445
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:31,779
I can see his obvious
outer appeal.

2446
01:47:32,647 --> 01:47:34,048
You have terrific eyes.

2447
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:36,183
Thanks.

2448
01:47:36,217 --> 01:47:38,119
But he also works
for the CIA, doesn't he?

2449
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:43,290
An odd choice of companion for
someone in your work, Rayna.

2450
01:47:43,324 --> 01:47:46,360
Doesn't exactly inspire
confidence in those around you.

2451
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:49,497
Fuck you, Sergio. You would never
talk to my father like that.

2452
01:47:49,531 --> 01:47:50,665
I never had to.

2453
01:47:50,698 --> 01:47:52,534
Mr. De Luca, it's true.

2454
01:47:52,567 --> 01:47:55,002
I worked for the CIA,
but they think I'm dead.

2455
01:47:55,036 --> 01:47:57,772
I'm with Rayna now, and I'm
here to help you both.

2456
01:47:58,673 --> 01:48:01,743
You and Karen Walker
are both double agents.

2457
01:48:02,877 --> 01:48:04,912
What's going on
at the CIA?

2458
01:48:04,946 --> 01:48:06,681
Drones taking all
the cool assignments?

2459
01:48:07,081 --> 01:48:08,081
(BOTH LAUGH)

2460
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:10,490
If we don't get rid
of him right now,

2461
01:48:10,518 --> 01:48:11,753
I'm calling off the deal.

2462
01:48:13,755 --> 01:48:16,123
Don't you fucking dare.

2463
01:48:16,157 --> 01:48:17,625
Yeah, why don't you listen
to that asshole.

2464
01:48:17,659 --> 01:48:19,794
Don't you fucking dare.

2465
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:22,564
You're a bit
outnumbered here, Miss...

2466
01:48:23,731 --> 01:48:25,032
I'm sorry, what the
fuck is your name?

2467
01:48:25,066 --> 01:48:27,802
Susan Cooper.
I'm with the CIA.

2468
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:30,605
Jesus. Rayna, did you invite
the entire agency here...

2469
01:48:30,638 --> 01:48:33,340
or are they just having
a company retreat

2470
01:48:33,374 --> 01:48:34,676
at the villa next door?

2471
01:48:34,709 --> 01:48:36,143
God, you're funny, huh?

2472
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:37,511
It's just me.

2473
01:48:37,545 --> 01:48:38,613
It's gonna be
in your best interest

2474
01:48:38,646 --> 01:48:40,782
to keep Fine and me alive.

2475
01:48:40,815 --> 01:48:43,551
I'm trying, but I'm not quite
following your logic.

2476
01:48:43,585 --> 01:48:45,386
You want me to slow it down
for you? Okay.

2477
01:48:45,419 --> 01:48:47,054
You're about to meet
with Solsa Dudaev...

2478
01:48:47,088 --> 01:48:50,091
a man I've been collecting
intelligence on for years.

2479
01:48:50,124 --> 01:48:51,626
And I'm guessing
that your boys here

2480
01:48:51,659 --> 01:48:52,960
are too busy manscaping...

2481
01:48:52,994 --> 01:48:55,429
to have told you
how he does business.

2482
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:57,665
Because about half the people
he deals with end up dead.

2483
01:48:57,699 --> 01:48:58,933
I can tell you what
Dudaev's gonna do

2484
01:48:58,966 --> 01:49:01,035
five minutes before he
even thinks about it.

2485
01:49:01,068 --> 01:49:04,305
And I sure as shit know enough to
cover up a Russian flag tattoo...

2486
01:49:04,338 --> 01:49:06,107
since Dudaev's brother was
killed by the Russian military.

2487
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,609
Jesus!

2488
01:49:07,642 --> 01:49:09,877
You own a computer?
You heard of fucking Google?

2489
01:49:09,911 --> 01:49:11,312
I'll tell you another thing.

2490
01:49:11,345 --> 01:49:12,513
You know
your little girlfriend...

2491
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:14,782
the one from
the Paris bombing?

2492
01:49:14,816 --> 01:49:16,483
She's just using you
to get to Rayna.

2493
01:49:16,517 --> 01:49:18,119
If it hadn't been for me
last night...

2494
01:49:18,152 --> 01:49:19,654
she would've kidnapped her
at the club...

2495
01:49:19,687 --> 01:49:20,622
and then you'd be
standing here

2496
01:49:20,655 --> 01:49:21,823
with your dick
in your hand...

2497
01:49:21,856 --> 01:49:23,224
because you'd never
find that bomb.

2498
01:49:23,257 --> 01:49:25,359
So you need me, De Luca.

2499
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:27,595
And I'm not gonna help you
unless you keep Fine alive.

2500
01:49:34,035 --> 01:49:35,402
Now, let me
get this straight.

2501
01:49:35,436 --> 01:49:36,971
You work for the CIA...

2502
01:49:37,004 --> 01:49:39,641
yet you're willing to help me
sell a nuclear bomb...

2503
01:49:39,674 --> 01:49:41,175
in order to save
this man's life?

2504
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:42,476
Why would I believe that?

2505
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:44,612
Because she's in love
with him.

2506
01:49:46,013 --> 01:49:47,314
Yeah, so what?

2507
01:49:47,348 --> 01:49:49,016
This idiot
doesn't even know it.

2508
01:49:49,050 --> 01:49:51,318
Too dumb to know
I'd do anything for him.

2509
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:54,922
And fuck the CIA, right?

2510
01:49:54,956 --> 01:49:56,758
What have they ever
done for me?

2511
01:49:56,791 --> 01:49:59,026
Took 10 years of my life,
gave me shitty pay...

2512
01:49:59,060 --> 01:50:01,829
put me in a basement with
a ceiling full of bats...

2513
01:50:01,863 --> 01:50:03,865
that pretty sure gave me pinkeye
or at least an allergy...

2514
01:50:03,898 --> 01:50:05,232
Something got fucked up
in my eye.

2515
01:50:07,034 --> 01:50:08,469
I would've been out
a long time ago

2516
01:50:08,502 --> 01:50:09,704
if it hadn't been for Fine.

2517
01:50:11,973 --> 01:50:15,042
So, yeah, I'll do anything
it takes to keep him alive.

2518
01:50:16,678 --> 01:50:18,612
That's pretty pathetic,
right?

2519
01:50:18,646 --> 01:50:21,015
(SCOFFS) Extremely pathetic.

2520
01:50:21,582 --> 01:50:23,350
God, you're an asshole.

2521
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:26,020
When this is over, I'm gonna
shave that fucking head.

2522
01:50:26,754 --> 01:50:27,789
All right, Miss Havisham.

2523
01:50:28,856 --> 01:50:30,357
I'll take you up
on your offer.

2524
01:50:30,391 --> 01:50:32,927
But if you try anything,
I mean anything...

2525
01:50:34,195 --> 01:50:35,697
I'll make
your dream come true

2526
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:37,370
and send you and
your boyfriend to heaven.

2527
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:40,333
Let's go.

2528
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:54,782
Mr. Dudaev.

2529
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:56,984
Welcome to Hungary.

2530
01:50:57,018 --> 01:50:59,687
Like Chechnya,
only easier to pronounce.

2531
01:51:00,554 --> 01:51:02,356
Enough with the bullshit.

2532
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,459
Where is the package?

2533
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:08,696
Once my client
sees the payment...

2534
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:11,465
she'll take us all to its
very secure hiding spot.

2535
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:13,667
Wherever that may be.

2536
01:51:22,143 --> 01:51:23,177
I got it, handsome.

2537
01:51:25,146 --> 01:51:26,647
100,000,000 Euros

2538
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,120
doesn't buy
what it used to, does it?

2539
01:51:31,853 --> 01:51:33,054
Nice ice, Solsa.

2540
01:51:35,122 --> 01:51:36,157
Right.

2541
01:51:37,524 --> 01:51:38,826
He's all yours.

2542
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:41,095
Gentlemen,
if you would follow me.

2543
01:52:08,155 --> 01:52:09,390
Here it is.

2544
01:52:09,423 --> 01:52:10,724
What is this bullshit?

2545
01:52:10,758 --> 01:52:12,659
Bullshit?

2546
01:52:12,693 --> 01:52:14,461
Solsa, I'll have you know...

2547
01:52:14,495 --> 01:52:15,729
It's the nuke.

2548
01:52:17,331 --> 01:52:18,732
Clever girl.

2549
01:52:25,406 --> 01:52:26,406
A lead-lined compartment.

2550
01:52:27,274 --> 01:52:28,542
RAYNA: Correct.

2551
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:31,345
The lead lining is thick as to
mask any radiation detection.

2552
01:52:31,378 --> 01:52:33,714
My father was extremely
good at his job.

2553
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:35,549
DE LUCA: Unbelievable!

2554
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:36,822
You could have warned me,
Rayna.

2555
01:52:36,851 --> 01:52:38,019
I've been throwing
my gym clothes

2556
01:52:38,052 --> 01:52:39,292
on top of that thing
for a week.

2557
01:52:55,803 --> 01:52:57,238
It is beautiful.

2558
01:52:58,472 --> 01:52:59,506
Yes, it is.

2559
01:53:04,846 --> 01:53:05,926
What the fuck
are you doing?

2560
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,849
Conducting business.

2561
01:53:13,988 --> 01:53:14,988
Uh-uh.

2562
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:17,790
Put it in the helicopter.

2563
01:53:18,826 --> 01:53:19,946
And don't forget
my diamonds.

2564
01:53:23,597 --> 01:53:25,099
What the fuck is going on?

2565
01:53:25,132 --> 01:53:26,834
De Luca played you, Rayna.

2566
01:53:26,868 --> 01:53:28,369
And you led him right to it.

2567
01:53:28,402 --> 01:53:30,804
You didn't expect me
to let him have it, did you?

2568
01:53:30,838 --> 01:53:33,307
I mean, it's like giving a
Stradivarius to a hillbilly.

2569
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:35,009
I have a buyer
who's willing to pay me

2570
01:53:35,042 --> 01:53:37,611
500,000,000 Euros for it.

2571
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:39,046
And Dudaev would've
never been able

2572
01:53:39,080 --> 01:53:41,548
to get that bomb
onto American soil.

2573
01:53:41,582 --> 01:53:43,517
My buyer will have it in the
middle of New York City...

2574
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:45,286
and use it next week.

2575
01:53:46,487 --> 01:53:47,989
So, you know,

2576
01:53:48,022 --> 01:53:49,256
if you haven't seen
Phantom yet...

2577
01:53:49,290 --> 01:53:51,425
So, what?

2578
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:53,338
Does this mean you're gonna
kill me too, Sergio?

2579
01:53:53,727 --> 01:53:54,996
I'm afraid so.

2580
01:53:55,897 --> 01:53:57,331
Sorry, Rayna.

2581
01:53:57,364 --> 01:53:58,699
It's just cleaner that way.
You understand.

2582
01:53:58,732 --> 01:53:59,901
Explain it to me, De Luca!

2586
01:54:13,247 --> 01:54:14,916
Thanks for the
performance, folks.

2587
01:54:14,949 --> 01:54:16,450
But sorry, Rayna,
show's over.

01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:24,390

01:54:47,814 --> 01:54:48,815

01:55:23,384 --> 01:55:24,551
Did I get him?

De Luca's got the bomb
on the helicopter. Get up!

are you doing?

Good job, guys.
Sorry about the lake.

2706
01:59:46,247 --> 01:59:47,348
All right, motherfucker,
don't push.

2707
01:59:47,381 --> 01:59:48,949
You're gonna
get your pictures.

2708
01:59:48,982 --> 01:59:50,317
There's enough 50
to go around.

2709
01:59:50,351 --> 01:59:51,518
You know I just helped
kill a terrorist, right?

2710
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,953
You ever see Kanye
do some shit like that?

2711
01:59:52,986 --> 01:59:54,355
He never, never!

2712
01:59:58,459 --> 02:00:00,394
Isn't this wonderful?

2713
02:00:00,427 --> 02:00:02,863
I was hoping to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

2714
02:00:02,896 --> 02:00:04,731
Give me some quality time
to deal with the fact...

2715
02:00:04,765 --> 02:00:06,885
that I was sleeping with
the man who killed my father.

2716
02:00:07,301 --> 02:00:08,635
Anyway. Call my lawyer.

2717
02:00:08,669 --> 02:00:09,970
Get the Goyard tote
from the hotel.

2718
02:00:10,003 --> 02:00:11,238
I need everything on time...

2719
02:00:11,272 --> 02:00:13,039
Do you think
I still work for you?

2720
02:00:13,073 --> 02:00:15,809
Whatever. Fuck you.

2721
02:00:15,842 --> 02:00:18,412
I knew you really liked me.

2722
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:20,580
Hey!

2723
02:00:22,749 --> 02:00:24,585
Fuck you too.

2724
02:00:29,523 --> 02:00:30,991
Don't touch
my fucking hair!

2725
02:00:33,327 --> 02:00:34,561
What are you looking at?

2726
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:40,667
Oh, God, Aldo, don't...

2727
02:00:40,701 --> 02:00:43,704
I am too tired
to fend off your groping.

2728
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:44,938
(WITH BRITISH ACCENT)
Please.

2729
02:00:44,971 --> 02:00:47,240
I understand completely.

2730
02:00:47,274 --> 02:00:50,076
Look, my real name
is Albert...

2731
02:00:50,110 --> 02:00:51,412
MI6.

2732
02:00:51,445 --> 02:00:54,281
Look, I'm sorry if
my disguise was a bit much.

2733
02:00:54,315 --> 02:00:56,216
I just like to really
get into character.

2734
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:58,151
Although I fear
I may have become

2735
02:00:58,184 --> 02:01:00,020
overexcited
at certain points.

2736
02:01:00,053 --> 02:01:01,254
Little bit.

2737
02:01:01,288 --> 02:01:02,723
By way of apology...

2738
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:05,626
should your work ever
bring you to London...

2739
02:01:05,659 --> 02:01:08,228
I would love
to take you for dinner.

2740
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:10,897
Okay. Yeah,
I think that would be nice.

2741
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:12,333
Wonderful.

2742
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:18,071
God!

2743
02:01:18,104 --> 02:01:20,974
(WITH ITALIAN ACCENT) How you
like my English accent, huh?

2744
02:01:21,007 --> 02:01:24,345
I learn it from
the Downton Abbey.

2745
02:01:24,378 --> 02:01:26,018
(WITH BRITISH ACCENT)
No, I'm only joking.

2746
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:27,614
Or am I?

2747
02:01:27,648 --> 02:01:28,749
Oh, my God.

2748
02:01:29,816 --> 02:01:30,816
FINE: Coop.

2749
02:01:31,151 --> 02:01:32,118
Great work.

2750
02:01:32,152 --> 02:01:33,820
What a job.

2751
02:01:33,854 --> 02:01:35,556
Super Cooper.
Really amazing.

2752
02:01:35,589 --> 02:01:37,190
Thanks.
ELAINE: Yes, it was.

2753
02:01:37,223 --> 02:01:38,291
You really came through.

2754
02:01:38,325 --> 02:01:39,626
Thank you, ma'am.

2755
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:41,027
I'd like to keep you
out in the field for now.

2756
02:01:41,227 --> 02:01:42,729
Wow.

2757
02:01:42,763 --> 02:01:44,798
We need you to fly
to Prague tomorrow...

2758
02:01:44,831 --> 02:01:47,067
to infiltrate an international
drug-smuggling ring.

2759
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,369
Here's your new identity.

2760
02:01:50,971 --> 02:01:51,971
You in, Cooper?

2761
02:01:53,139 --> 02:01:55,809
Agent Susan Cooper
reporting for duty, ma'am.

2762
02:01:55,842 --> 02:01:58,011
Nobody says or does that, but great.
I won't do that.

2763
02:01:58,044 --> 02:01:59,044
Okay.

2764
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:00,781
Thank you.

2765
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:03,116
Francis Mays is an
unemployed telemarketer

2766
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:04,351
living off her
disability checks.

2767
02:02:04,385 --> 02:02:06,553
Oh, sweet Jesus!

2768
02:02:06,587 --> 02:02:09,155
And who wears reading glasses
in their passport photo?

2769
02:02:09,189 --> 02:02:11,291
She's only kidding.
She got ya!

2770
02:02:11,324 --> 02:02:13,193
(ALL LAUGHING)

2771
02:02:13,226 --> 02:02:14,695
Oh, my God!
That was a good one!

2772
02:02:17,230 --> 02:02:19,099
Yeah, actually, I'm not. I
don't have a sense of humor.

2773
02:02:19,132 --> 02:02:20,166
No, you don't.

2774
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:21,835
We'll talk soon.

2775
02:02:21,868 --> 02:02:24,371
Glad the pinkeye
is under control.

2776
02:02:24,405 --> 02:02:25,806
That was actually
an allergy...

2777
02:02:25,839 --> 02:02:26,940
Okay. Got it.

2778
02:02:27,541 --> 02:02:28,909
So, you're a spy now, Coop.

2779
02:02:28,942 --> 02:02:29,942
Yeah.

2780
02:02:30,444 --> 02:02:31,311
Congratulations.

2781
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:33,213
Thanks.

2782
02:02:33,246 --> 02:02:34,214
I don't think
I'll ever find anyone

2783
02:02:34,247 --> 02:02:35,447
as good as you
in the basement.

2784
02:02:37,551 --> 02:02:38,885
I think you will.

2785
02:02:38,919 --> 02:02:40,554
There's a lot of good people
down there.

2786
02:02:42,723 --> 02:02:43,957
So, hey...

2787
02:02:43,990 --> 02:02:47,528
I know a great little
restaurant right near here.

2788
02:02:47,561 --> 02:02:51,932
Maybe you and I could go
for a nice, long dinner?

2789
02:02:58,805 --> 02:02:59,973
You know what,

2790
02:03:00,006 --> 02:03:02,443
I'm just kind of feeling
like a girls' night.

2791
02:03:03,309 --> 02:03:04,945
You understand, right?

2792
02:03:04,978 --> 02:03:06,913
Yeah, sure.

2793
02:03:06,947 --> 02:03:08,849
I'll catch you later.
You go have a great time.

2794
02:03:08,882 --> 02:03:09,882
Thank you.

2795
02:03:11,552 --> 02:03:13,420
You're a lot furrier
than I thought you'd be.

2796
02:03:14,054 --> 02:03:15,656
Yeah.
Yeah.

2797
02:03:15,689 --> 02:03:16,990
Smell you later, pal.
(CHUCKLES)

2798
02:03:19,793 --> 02:03:21,962
Hey, Coop.

2799
02:03:21,995 --> 02:03:24,965
All those things you said
about me to De Luca...

2800
02:03:26,833 --> 02:03:27,833
Did you mean that?

2801
02:03:29,002 --> 02:03:30,003
God, I admire you.

2802
02:03:33,507 --> 02:03:34,941
Glad you're still
alive, Beverly,

2803
02:03:34,975 --> 02:03:36,376
you silly fucking
girly wanker!

2804
02:03:36,409 --> 02:03:37,511
God!

2805
02:03:38,078 --> 02:03:39,145
Nice work, Cooper.

2806
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:42,449
Wow. Is that a compliment?

2807
02:03:42,483 --> 02:03:43,984
That's not easy
for you to do.

2808
02:03:44,017 --> 02:03:45,786
Fuck it. Look, you
did a good job.

2809
02:03:45,819 --> 02:03:47,654
Probably just beginner's
luck, though.

2810
02:03:47,688 --> 02:03:50,023
There we go.
Where did you get a suit?

2811
02:03:50,056 --> 02:03:51,758
I fucking made it,
didn't I?

2812
02:03:51,792 --> 02:03:53,126
It's nice.

2813
02:03:53,159 --> 02:03:54,895
You still out
of the CIA?

2814
02:03:54,928 --> 02:03:56,997
Probably not.
They need me.

2815
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:59,032
I think I need to spend some
time on my own first, though.

2816
02:03:59,065 --> 02:04:00,066
Clear my head.

2817
02:04:01,367 --> 02:04:03,670
I'm gonna take this
down the coast.

2818
02:04:03,704 --> 02:04:06,006
Maybe spend some time in Italy.
Drive it to Greece.

2819
02:04:07,574 --> 02:04:09,943
Sometimes a man
needs to go to sea.

2820
02:04:10,544 --> 02:04:11,812
SUSAN: Sounds good, Ford.

2821
02:04:11,845 --> 02:04:12,879
Good for you.

2822
02:04:13,814 --> 02:04:14,814
Take care.

2823
02:04:15,348 --> 02:04:16,348
NANCY: Bye.

2824
02:04:19,052 --> 02:04:20,687
FORD: Arrivederci.

2825
02:04:23,323 --> 02:04:24,491
Do you think
he knows that's a lake?

2826
02:04:24,525 --> 02:04:26,627
No, I don't.

2827
02:04:31,698 --> 02:04:33,634
Let's go.
Okay.

2828
02:04:33,667 --> 02:04:35,836
You can't let anybody see
how sore I am.

2829
02:04:35,869 --> 02:04:36,970
I got you.
Okay.

2830
02:04:37,003 --> 02:04:38,271
Come here.

2831
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:40,406
My glutes
are really seizing up.

2832
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:42,108
If you're sore,
I'll tell you what.

2833
02:04:42,142 --> 02:04:44,044
Take a hot bath and then
we're gonna celebrate.

2834
02:04:44,077 --> 02:04:46,212
I hope you like champagne
and beef jerky.

2835
02:04:46,246 --> 02:04:47,480
Well... Oh. That's a...

2836
02:04:47,514 --> 02:04:48,682
You have to!

2837
02:04:48,715 --> 02:04:50,416
Because I stole
a case of it...

2838
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:51,652
I don't know
if I like them together.

2839
02:04:51,685 --> 02:04:53,787
...out of 50 Cent's
helicopter!

2840
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:56,022
Slower, slower.

2841
02:04:56,056 --> 02:04:58,224
FORD: Cooper,
is this a fucking lake?

2842
02:04:59,926 --> 02:05:02,128
How the fuck
do I get to Italy?

2843
02:05:05,566 --> 02:05:06,967
