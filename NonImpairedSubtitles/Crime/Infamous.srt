1
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,580
Hi.

2
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,620
Okay, here she is, folks. Kitty Dean.

3
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,700
That a girl, Kitty.

4
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,700
It's 38 degrees in New York this morning.
The time is 10:49.

5
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,500
Should I call and get our table for lunch?

6
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,700
Goodie-good.

7
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,420
And Big Mama? Bring lots of gossip.

8
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,140
Everything about him is designed to rivet:

9
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,340
The appearance, the demeanor,
and, of course, the voice.

10
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,580
The voice?

11
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,060
To the lucky person
who has never heard it...

12
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,900
...I can only say imagine what
a Brussels sprout would sound like...

13
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,100
...if a Brussels sprout could talk.

14
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,580
He's so magical...

15
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,020
...you soon forget the most unforgettable
sound in the world.

16
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,820
Here's a word I loathe: eccentric.

17
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,380
Eccentric is a word that boring people use
to describe someone I think of as interesting.

18
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,580
A great many people think of me
as eccentric simply because...

19
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,420
...when I have my shoes polished
I have the entire shoe polished...

20
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,580
...top, sides and soles.

21
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,860
Some people think it eccentric...

22
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,260
...that every morning I have my maid
iron my money.

23
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,820
When I told Truman I had my maid iron
my money, do you know what he said?

24
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,700
Here's what he didn't say, "How eccentric."

25
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,460
Here's what he did say, "How wonderful!"

26
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,140
You can forgive a person a lot
who really enjoys you.

27
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,380
He's loads of fun wherever you go.

28
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,100
He's the rarest thing in the world,
a good talker who is also a good listener.

29
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,260
How could Leland
have been bored with you?

30
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,500
Even someone who doesn't speak
English can look at you.

31
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,300
He listened to me the way you'd listen
to announcements in a train station...

32
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,180
...just enough to hear
if there's an emergency.

33
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,820
Oh, well. He's with Pamela,
and I need to move on.

34
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,340
Maybe you can...

35
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,260
...but tout New York is dividing
into the Slim or Pamela camps.

36
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Babe and I are the head Slimites.

37
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,620
Tru Heart.

38
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,780
Oh, have you heard about Tracy?

39
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,020
Yeah. Having her eyes done, I know.

40
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,700
Well, a little more than that.
She's gone off to have an abortion.

41
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,940
Oh, who's the father?
I presume not Dick.

42
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,860
Chas Fitzgerald.

43
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,940
Oh, perfect. Does Dick know?

44
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,460
I think she should just tell Dick it's his.

45
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,060
- She can't. Dick's infertile.
- What?

46
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,980
- Everybody knows that.
- Well, I'm sure they do now.

47
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,620
Did you see the paper?

48
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,700
Yes. There's a story that's stuck in my teeth
like a little piece of pull candy.

49
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,140
What is it?

50
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,820
Well, these well-to-do farm people
out in Kansas...

51
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,860
...were murdered in the middle of the night
in the most gruesome way imaginable.

52
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,300
- Do they have any idea who did it?
- No idea.

53
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,180
But that won't affect the piece
I want to write for you.

54
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,500
I want to explore how a crime
like this affects a town...

55
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,100
...where everyone trusts each other.

56
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,340
It may be preferable that we don't know
the identity of the killers.

57
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,060
Exactly. Because what I imagine everyone
is now afraid of is:

58
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,220
"Who among us did this horrible thing?"

59
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,340
It used to be you'd look at someone
and think, "There's old Mr. Busybody."

60
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,060
Now you think...

61
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,860
..."Did you do it?"

62
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Oh, I can't bear the thought of you
going to Kansas.

63
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Whom will I talk to?

64
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,580
Oh, that reminds me.
Did you hear about Tracy?

65
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,420
- The eyes?
- More.

66
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,100
Abortion.

67
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,700
Oh, I just saw her at Sotheby's.
She bought an adorable Degas.

68
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,580
I wanted it for the guest bath...

69
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,780
...but Bill wants to put the little
Giacometti man we have in the hall there.

70
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,780
Tell him nobody wants to go to the bathroom
and find a little man in there.

71
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,580
- I know it from bitter personal experience.
- T-Bone.

72
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,260
How did you find out about Tracy?

73
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,300
Slim. But I'm absolutely sworn
to secrecy.

74
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,900
I'm only telling you
because you're my dearest friend.

75
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,820
Nelle, as my oldest and dearest friend,
do you think the Kansas thing is good?

76
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,340
Are you joking?

77
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,300
That small town stuff,
that suspicion, that gossip?

78
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,580
That is your world as much as this,
maybe even more.

79
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,660
- How were they killed?
- Shotgun.

80
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,460
But there's a caretaker not a hundred yards
from the house.

81
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,100
How could he not hear four gunshots
in the dead of night?

82
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,300
Maybe he did it.
Did you consider that?

83
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,300
Maybe. Though the victims
were bound and gagged...

84
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,500
...which suggests at least two
in the killing party...

85
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,300
...one with the gun
to make them cooperate...

86
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,580
...and one to tie them up
and make them sorry they cooperated.

87
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,660
The father and boy were shot
in the basement...

88
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,140
...the mother and girl in their beds.

89
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,180
- How do you know all this?
- I called the D.A.

90
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,380
May I tell him who's calling, please?

91
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,860
Yes, dear. This is Truman Capote.

92
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,380
I'm sorry. The district attorney
doesn't take calls from strange women.

93
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,780
And what did you say?

94
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,660
Who says I'm strange?

95
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,140
They can judge for themselves soon enough.
I'm going down there in a week.

96
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,620
Which of your pillbox hats
do you think they'll like best?

97
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,020
Why didn't Jack come tonight?
If he's your fella, he's always welcome.

98
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,180
Truman and I...

99
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,700
...had a taste for one another's company
above all others...

100
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,380
...but we weren't a together-wherever-we-go
couple. He's very social.

101
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,500
I'm not...

102
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,100
...especially with that crowd.

103
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,100
Jack didn't...

104
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,500
...approve of us.

105
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,980
He has the social graces of a syringe.

106
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,380
Jack is just so iron, you know,
he's so, "That's that."

107
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,100
Before he knew Truman...

108
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,420
...he was married to a darling actress
named Joan McCracken.

109
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,060
They were dancers together in Oklahoma!
and he was mad for her.

110
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,060
And then the war came,
and he went away and he came back.

111
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,260
And she told him that she'd had an affair.

112
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,260
Well, he was so humiliated...

113
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,900
...that not only did he end
their marriage that night...

114
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,380
...but he stopped sleeping with women
altogether and he switched to men.

115
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,940
Can you imagine?

116
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,620
Curing your distaste for infidelity
by turning to men?

117
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,220
What if one of the people
you interview is the killer?

118
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,140
And what if he thinks you know?

119
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,100
He's already committed four murders,
you think he'll spare you?

120
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,940
Honey, is this your funny way of saying
you're worried about me?

121
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,700
- Doesn't it seem dangerous?
- Come with me, then.

122
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,500
I can't. I'm trying to write my book.

123
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,140
Well, then it's O sole mio, off I go!

124
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,500
- I don't want anything to happen to you.
- Honey, I'm indestructible.

125
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,300
- Much to everyone's regret.
- Not mine.

126
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,340
Come with me. Your book's all done.

127
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,860
Well, I am intrigued...

128
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,740
...but I want to get started on my new book
before Mockingbird comes out.

129
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,980
How near did you say the caretaker lived
to the main house?

130
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,940
Nelle grew up with him in Alabama.

131
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,820
She based the other little boy in
To Kill Mockingbird on Truman.

132
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,020
Aptly enough, she named the child Dill.

133
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,500
People always mention his effervescence...

134
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,580
...but one must remember that at the center
of any bright flame...

135
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,460
...there's always that little touch of blue.

136
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,620
Truman's parents deserted him
at an early age...

137
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,340
...leaving him with elderly relations
in my town.

138
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,820
And Truman always disguised his shame
over the absence of his parents...

139
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,180
...with grand tales
of adventure and glory.

140
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,780
"My daddy can't be here,
he's an aviator."

141
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,140
"My mother's a photographic subject,
but they're coming for me"...

142
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,060
...he would always say.
"They're coming for me."

143
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,700
Every year at Christmas...

144
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,700
...our elementary school did a pageant
through the center of town.

145
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,820
And one year, Truman wrote his parents
that he was the star of the pageant...

146
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,380
...though he was only
a snowflake like me.

147
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,540
But, no matter, it worked.

148
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,220
They wired him to say they'd take
the train from New Orleans...

149
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,180
...and get there just in time
for the pageant. They even said...

150
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,020
...they'd stand right by the cannon
in the square so they could cheer him on.

151
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,580
Well, we marched through town
and as we got closer to that cannon...

152
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,700
...I could see him straining
to see his parents.

153
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,500
When we got to that cannon,
he stopped...

154
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,340
...forgetting we were supposed
to be marching in time to the music.

155
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,100
He stopped and he stared.

156
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,540
They had not come.

157
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,220
I thought for a minute he might break.

158
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,740
And then he threw his arms up in the air...

159
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,700
...and twirled himself all the way over.

160
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,300
A cartwheel.

161
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,380
And then again. And again...

162
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,620
...all the way down the street...

163
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,620
...till his tears were gone.

164
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,140
Truman adored Nelle.

165
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,460
She and Jack were just about
his only non-society friends.

166
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,300
I will say it stung him
when she won the Pulitzer.

167
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,500
He might not have minded her winning one,
but only if he'd already won two.

168
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,540
I've always been interested in crime.

169
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Daddy was a lawyer, and sister too.

170
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,260
I studied the law as well...

171
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,580
...but I either lost my nerve
or came to my senses before taking the bar.

172
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,980
But when Truman asked me
to go to Kansas...

173
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,380
...it was deep calling to deep.

174
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,940
Detective Dewey!

175
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,780
- Do you have any leads yet?
- Nothing I can discuss.

176
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,660
- Detective Dewey!
- Jimmy.

177
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,900
Yeah. Will you confirm that there is
more than one killer?

178
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,940
I will not.

179
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,580
Well, of course there was more than one,
unless the killer was a hypnotist.

180
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,340
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

181
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,580
It's illogical to suppose
there's only one killer.

182
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,140
The Clutters were tied up.
To tie them up...

183
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,820
...he'd have to put his gun down.

184
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,660
Once he put the gun down,
the Clutters would run for the hills.

185
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,020
- I don't believe I know who you are.
- Or what.

186
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,860
I'm from out of town.

187
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,260
- What's your paper?
- Ladies Home Journal?

188
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,820
Oh, I'm not a reporter. I'm a writer.

189
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,180
May I see your press card?

190
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Good heavens,
I don't carry any such thing.

191
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,180
But I do have a passport
back at my hotel room.

192
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,300
Would you like to come back
and look at my little picture?

193
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,020
I'll need not only the facts of the case...

194
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,980
...but how this terrible crime
has eaten away at the foundation of trust...

195
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,740
...that makes up your community.

196
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,700
- I see. No.
- And I... What?

197
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,460
No reporter has special access.

198
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,140
Sir, I'm not writing a news story.
I'm from The New Yorker magazine.

199
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,420
I'm writing a psychological study
of a village...

200
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,660
...and how that place is affected
by a vicious crime.

201
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,580
I will not be careless in my depiction.

202
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,780
I shall labor over every word, every sound.

203
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,180
The final result must be just so...

204
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,180
...as dazzling and unique
as a Fabergé egg.

205
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,020
Right. And I got a crime to solve.

206
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,900
But I don't care whether the crime
is solved or not.

207
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,660
I sure as hell care.

208
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,620
The Clutters went to our church.
They were friends of my family's.

209
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,380
No access.

210
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,900
Oh, you are very, very foxy.

211
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,020
I can see I'm gonna have
to work extra hard...

212
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,180
...to get around
that foxy manner of yours.

213
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,100
Isn't he foxy?
But don't you worry, I...

214
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,380
It was lovely how you didn't care
whether or not the murder was solved.

215
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,980
- Lovely.
- Quiet.

216
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,940
Would you folks care for a cocktail?

217
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,620
Yes, a gin and tonic, please.

218
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,260
I'll have J/B on the rocks...

219
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,780
...with a tiny curl of lemon
and a splash and a half of water.

220
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,860
A what, on the rocks?

221
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,540
J/B.

222
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,340
It's a type of Scotch, dear.

223
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,060
You want me to see if we've got any?

224
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,460
That would be a wonderful beginning.

225
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,740
Yes, ma'am.

226
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,140
I think we need to come in
a little under the radar here.

227
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,980
I know where you are headed...

228
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,020
...but you of all people know how impossible
it is for me to modify myself.

229
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,740
I'm not saying get married and have kids...

230
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,460
...but maybe come in
on little cat's paws.

231
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,980
It's no use.
This cat has long, noisy nails.

232
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,020
Anyway...

233
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,820
...I'll call Dewey's office in the morning
and request a proper interview.

234
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,140
- It might better suit his vanity.
- Thank you.

235
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,620
- Let's start talking...
- Thank you. Thank you.

236
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,940
Thank you.

237
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,420
In the meantime,
let's start talking to people.

238
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,460
We don't need his blessing for that.

239
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,180
I think we should just speak
to people on the street.

240
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,660
Yes, and in our nicest way, the way
that would most put people at ease, say...

241
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,020
Madam!

242
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,100
May we ask you about the gruesome murders
out at the Clutter home?

243
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,860
Maybe you should drop
the word "gruesome."

244
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,060
Sir!

245
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,660
Sir!

246
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,700
Excuse me, sir.

247
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,820
My friend and I would like to talk to you
about the tragic events of November 15th.

248
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,540
Sorry, ladies.

249
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,500
Do you think everyone keeps calling me
"lady" to be mean...

250
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,060
...or can they honestly not tell?

251
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,300
I know I'm not Charles Atlas,
but even Ethel Merman doesn't have this.

252
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,540
No. Hers is thicker.

253
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,700
Mr. Capote.

254
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,700
Is this all? No messages?

255
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,740
No, sir.

256
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,260
I simply don't understand why
Alvin Dewey won't return my calls.

257
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,940
I've telephoned three times.

258
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,740
Nelle!

259
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,220
Care package from Babe!

260
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,380
It's beluga!

261
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,300
Let's get some Ritz crackers
and eat it right now.

262
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,660
Let's. And you know what I think
you should do tomorrow?

263
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,820
Go see the Clutter place.

264
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,300
Honey, if Alvin Dewey won't return my calls,
I'll never see the house.

265
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,180
You know everybody on the planet.
Call somebody.

266
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,660
And please tell the duke and duchess
I am sick to miss the dance.

267
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,100
I will.

268
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,180
Bennett hears wonderful things
about your book.

269
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,860
I almost don't care what the critics say...

270
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,420
...as long as I can be allowed
to write another.

271
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,340
Your dream of being the
Jane Austen of Alabama will come true.

272
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,780
Anyway, Bennett knows
the head of Kansas University...

273
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,460
...who knows the Clutters' lawyer.

274
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,660
The killers came in this way.

275
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,980
Any messages?

276
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,500
Princess Margaret...

277
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,140
...and Noël Coward.

278
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,180
No Dewey. Again.

279
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,820
They're in both ways over there.

280
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,100
Right, but this particular form
goes under last name.

281
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,820
- That whole stack?
- That's the one, yeah.

282
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,020
Is this a good time?

283
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,780
Yeah. Come on in.

284
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,900
Ma'am.

285
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
What can I do for you folks?

286
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
Well...

287
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,740
...you can begin by serving me
a large slice of humble pie.

288
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,740
I've come to apologize for acting
too big for my britches.

289
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,020
As you see, I even got new britches.

290
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,380
Yeah, well, no harm done.
Real nice of you.

291
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,100
I wanted to explain myself.

292
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,020
I'm trying to create
a new kind of reportage.

293
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,780
Have you read my book
The Muses Are Heard?

294
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,700
Well, it was very well received.

295
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,780
It's about an American opera company going
to Moscow to perform Porgy and Bess.

296
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,460
Now, if I relied only on what
the press managers told me...

297
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,140
...it would have been no different
than a newspaper article.

298
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,020
But I treated the people with the emotional
and psychological detail of a novel.

299
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,940
I see, so you're doing something different
than a regular reporter.

300
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,260
Yes.

301
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,500
And I can't really know how people feel
without your help.

302
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,300
Oh, well, I can tell you how they feel.
Terrible.

303
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,660
They'll feel better when this is solved.

304
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,300
Yes. I agree. And that's...

305
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Look, I wish you well with your project.
But no access.

306
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,340
I'm sorry, but Nelle
and I will have to stay for Christmas.

307
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,780
Why?

308
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,660
Because no one will talk to me.

309
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,340
I've got to stay until they forget about me
and can open up.

310
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,860
No one forgets about you.

311
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,180
What will you do for Christmas?

312
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,940
Of course, everything will be closed...

313
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,180
...so I thought before I'd go to the market
and get a nice cheese...

314
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,740
...some ham and olives.

315
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,820
Slim sent a wonderful Burgundy.

316
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,860
Nelle and I can make a picnic at the hotel.

317
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,700
VELVEETA

318
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,420
Excuse me?

319
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,380
- Could this be all the cheese?
- Well, how much do you need?

320
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,140
Mine is a matter of quality, dear,
not quantity.

321
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,900
Oh, you mean other types of cheese.
Goodness, no. Not here.

322
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,580
- Are you staying for Christmas?
- Yes, we are.

323
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,660
What will you and Mrs. Capote do
for your Christmas supper?

324
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,740
If this is the only cheese I find,
Mrs. Capote and I might try cyanide.

325
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,060
Would you like to come to our house
for Christmas supper?

326
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,420
Really? Like for a party?

327
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,620
It's just not right you don't have
Christmas supper in a home.

328
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,900
That is so kind of you.

329
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,060
Nelle will be thrilled.
May I ask your name?

330
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,860
Hi.

331
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,180
Hi.

332
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,700
What?

333
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,780
We are spending Christmas
with the Deweys.

334
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,220
This just isn't right.

335
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,140
What isn't right is for two people
to spend Christmas alone.

336
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,540
If there's two of them, they won't be alone.

337
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,820
Hi. We're here.

338
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,620
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

339
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,620
I know you said not to bring anything...

340
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,620
...but my daddy would kill me if I showed up
for company empty-handed.

341
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,260
We brought you fruitcake.

342
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,580
And she doesn't mean me.

343
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,420
My wife, Delores.

344
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,460
- Truman.
- Foxy.

345
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,380
- Thank you.
- My wife, Delores.

346
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,900
And here is our son, Paul.

347
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,300
Hello, Paul. Merry Christmas.

348
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,940
You gonna watch the game?

349
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,540
I got $25 on it.

350
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,220
Truman, you like football?

351
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,980
Not much.

352
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,820
Though I must admit it always sends shivers
up my spine...

353
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,420
...when the men get inside
that little huddle and whisper.

354
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,140
We have treats.

355
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,580
I have kind of a party question.

356
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,580
I hope it's not too awful or mean.

357
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,660
That sounds fun. Let's play.

358
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,780
Paul Dewey. Don't you wanna come in here
and sit with the grownups?

359
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
Since it's Christmas...

360
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:32,660
...I thought we could all take turns telling
what is the worst present you ever got.

361
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,860
Mine was a shawl from an elderly
neighbor lady. I'm not a shawl lover.

362
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,060
- Me neither.
- They're never warm enough.

363
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,660
Are my ears working properly?

364
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,260
Am I the only one here who loves shawls?

365
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,500
Don't look at me.

366
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,180
My goodness, I love shawls.

367
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,140
I have several.

368
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,340
I think the prettiest one is the one
Jennifer Jones gave me.

369
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,980
Jennifer Jones? The movie star?

370
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,300
Yes. We were in Rome making
a picture called Beat the Devil...

371
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,260
...and I was struggling
to write a scene for Bogie...

372
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,660
...when I began to feel
the most inhuman pain.

373
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,740
Bogie? You mean Humphrey Bogart?

374
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,980
I mean Mr. Lauren Bacall, yes.

375
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,940
I was trying to write a scene for him
and Peter in which they both...

376
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,980
Wait a minute. Who's Peter?

377
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,620
Peter Lorre.

378
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,820
But I had a terrible impacted tooth,
and so John...

379
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,300
- Wayne?
- Garfield?

380
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,540
Kennedy?

381
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,180
Huston?

382
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,660
John Huston, the director?

383
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,860
John told me he didn't care if we had
to shut the movie down...

384
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,340
...I was going to the hospital.

385
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,540
So I thought:

386
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,540
"Well, if I have to be in a Roman hospital
for God knows what length of time...

387
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,700
...I may as well have something with me
to make me feel good."

388
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,340
So I wore the beautiful Balmain shawl
that Jennifer gave me...

389
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,620
...and, if I do say so myself...

390
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,420
...I felt and looked dreamy.

391
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,300
- Did you meet Humphrey Bogart?
- Meet?

392
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,660
My dear, every night
we had drinks and dinner...

393
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,340
...and, once, poker!

394
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,980
You played poker with Humphrey Bogart?

395
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,740
I had a disadvantage in that...

396
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,820
...I didn't know the game
in the way that Bogie or Frank did.

397
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,820
Frank?!

398
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,460
Sinatra.

399
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,420
Experience had taught them things...

400
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,900
...a relative novice such as myself
may not know, like, well...

401
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,060
...did you know that three of a kind
beats a pair?

402
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:55,220
So, I did not defeat Mr. Humphrey Bogart
at cards...

403
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,340
...but you may be interested to know
I soundly beat him at something else.

404
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,380
Arm wrestling.

405
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,900
Hold on now.

406
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,340
You expect us to believe...

407
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
...that you beat Humphrey Bogart
at arm wrestling?

408
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,100
Twice.

409
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,100
You're good.

410
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,580
Good match, sir. Thank you.

411
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,380
Hey. I just beat the guy who could beat
Humphrey Bogart.

412
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,820
Cool. You wanna come over
and see what I got?

413
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,420
You didn't beat Humphrey Bogart,
did you?

414
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,100
You don't think I'd defeat your child
on a Christmas afternoon...

415
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,940
...with everyone here thinking
what they do about me?

416
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,820
That would be a gift of switches
and ash.

417
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,580
But you didn't beat Humphrey Bogart,
did you?

418
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,260
All right. Roll up your sleeve.

419
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,980
No, no, no.

420
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,140
Scared?

421
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,140
Well, I'll be.

422
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,500
Listen, Foxy.
When you're tiny you have to be tough.

423
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,140
This world isn't kind to little things.

424
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,180
So glad you could make it.

425
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,180
- Hope you'll come back. Thank you.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

426
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,820
- Merry Christmas. Good night.
- Come on.

427
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,140
Bye-bye.

428
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,020
Foxy, check under the tree.

429
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,140
Hello?

430
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,660
No, they just left.

431
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,700
Well, I know it, but the time flew.
Guess what?

432
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,060
He knows Ava Gardner.

433
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,860
And Humphrey Bogart.

434
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,540
And Betty Bacall. That's Lauren Bacall.

435
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,900
And she got right into the kitchen
and helped. They are so sweet.

436
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,900
Anything good?

437
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,580
Merry Christmas from the queen mother.

438
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,500
She loves me.

439
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,180
Babe.

440
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,940
Slim.

441
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,340
Who's this?

442
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,740
"Mrs. John Stimmell called to invite you
and your friend to dinner."

443
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,260
Who's that?

444
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,620
It says she's a friend of the Deweys.

445
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,300
How nice.

446
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,020
Look, here's another.
"Please call Mrs. Dorn about dinner.

447
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,740
Friend of the Deweys."

448
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,740
Well, that sounds lovely.

449
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,540
Nelle.

450
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,420
These are all invitations!

451
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,460
Then Ava said:

452
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,100
"I'm not afraid of the police.
It's Frank who scares me!"

453
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,820
And Marilyn said,
"Better sorry than safe!"

454
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,460
Marilyn Monroe.

455
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,940
Bonnie Clutter is such a dear and I...

456
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
Was such a dear.

457
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,340
Oh, goodness.

458
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,980
It's hard to put a friend in the past tense.

459
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,740
It seems so sad, especially since Bonnie
wasn't well at that time.

460
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,620
What was the matter?

461
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,300
Oh, well, I shouldn't say.

462
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,820
I just don't think she liked
to be with folks so much.

463
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,220
But if you ever did see her,
if you ever did...

464
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,780
...oh, she was always good old Bonnie.

465
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,940
She was going through
the change of life.

466
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,540
That's all?

467
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,300
You try it. It's enough.

468
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,940
Well, there were four of us went
to the house to clean up...

469
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,580
...clean up...

470
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,860
...all the damage and the mess.

471
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,020
We used to go out to Herb's
to hunt pheasant.

472
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,020
It was strange driving out there
knowing what was waiting for us.

473
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,300
The couch where the boy had been.

474
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,980
It was just,
I mean the bodies were gone, but...

475
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,820
...good Lord, just seeing that couch.

476
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,180
Or the mattress box
where Herb had been.

477
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,740
There was so much blood.

478
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:33,580
There was so much blood.
Sometimes in big, wide pools.

479
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,460
Sometimes in little spatters.
I was going up the stairs...

480
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,500
...and then I saw a big spot
on the banister...

481
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,260
...and I almost...

482
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,420
I swear...

483
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,140
...well, that was worse than the big stuff
on the floor. Because I thought:

484
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,540
"It made it all the way up here?"

485
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,940
I can only say I was a Marine...

486
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,940
...and nothing ever got to me
the way this did.

487
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,220
Herb was one of the most
respected ranchers in this state.

488
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,540
If there was a list that told you how
to succeed with honor...

489
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,980
...well, he just did everything on it.

490
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,980
You see, he worked hard,
he took care of his family...

491
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,420
...and when he went to church,
he just didn't get his time card punched.

492
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,900
No, he went in and he listened.

493
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,500
And I've always believed
that whenever you do something right...

494
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,020
...it gives you a little bit of weight...

495
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,100
...so that you come to feel rooted
to this earth, you know? Solid. Secure.

496
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,780
Now what scares me is that...

497
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,940
...well, sometimes, out of nowhere...

498
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,420
...a bad wind blows up.

499
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,220
Now it could be cancer, could be drink...

500
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,860
...could be some woman
that don't belong to you.

501
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,580
And despite the weight that's holding you
to the ground...

502
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,980
...when that wind comes,
it picks you up light as a leaf...

503
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,580
...and it takes you where it wants.

504
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,540
We're in control until we're not.

505
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,380
Then we're helpless.

506
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,420
"If you ever saw her,
she was always good old Bonnie."

507
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,460
No, no. She said, "If you ever did see her,
if you ever did, she..."

508
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,460
That's right.

509
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,820
"...she was always good old Bonnie."

510
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,980
Good ear.

511
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,260
Drink?

512
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,140
Well, obviously the mother wasn't right.

513
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,940
Oh, I don't know.
It just sounds like menopause.

514
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,300
I hope not.
That's a little grubby for my novel.

515
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,940
Your novel?

516
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,340
What are you talking about?

517
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,020
I think this story is bigger than an article.
I think it's a book.

518
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,180
I can see that. But non-fiction, right?

519
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,620
Yes, of course it will all be true, but...

520
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,700
- But what? Either it is or it isn't.
- You're not understanding.

521
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,820
I wanna to bring fictional techniques
to a non-fiction story.

522
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,220
What fictional techniques?
The ones where you make stuff up?

523
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,820
Excuse me, if I were gonna make stuff up
you think I'd bother taking all these notes?

524
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,140
You obviously plan to turn Bonnie Clutter
into some faux poetic recluse...

525
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,780
...when what it sounds like is that she was
just thrown off by her menopause.

526
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,420
What is your stupid fucking point?

527
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,340
That you shouldn't be doing
what you're doing.

528
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,780
The truth is enough!

529
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,380
I must say I don't appreciate this lecture
from you of all people.

530
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,980
Mockingbird was based on true things,
and you sure improved that.

531
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Right. It's a novel!

532
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,260
Reportage means re-creating,
not creating.

533
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,380
This is a new kind of reportage!

534
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,700
I'll say.

535
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,020
Okay. "But if you ever did see her,
if you ever..."

536
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,540
- I remember.
- Fine.

537
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,420
- It's your book.
- Yes.

538
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,420
My seventh.

539
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,260
- Okay, okay.
- How's your book coming?

540
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,660
It'll take me a long time to shape, but...

541
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,620
...thanks to Nelle,
who's been a gift from heaven...

542
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,460
...and you all...

543
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,700
...we'll probably only need
a week more here.

544
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,060
- Well, I'm gonna miss your Kansas steaks.
- Well, we'll be sorry to see you go.

545
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,620
Is there any news?
You know I can't give you special access.

546
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,900
We got them.

547
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
- What?
- What?

548
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,380
We caught them.
Just like you said, there were two of them.

549
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,540
The killers? We caught the killers?

550
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,860
Who are they?
Are they in jail right now? Can...?

551
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,220
They're in Las Vegas.
I got to get right out there.

552
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,180
- Can I come? Oh, please, Foxy?!
- Not this time, partner.

553
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,620
Well, there isn't gonna be another time.
How many times you gonna arrest them?

554
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,900
I'm sorry.

555
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,500
Honestly, Marie...

556
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,940
...how can you stay married
to such a mule?

557
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,700
Maybe now you'll get
a whole night's sleep.

558
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,620
Congratulations, Foxy.

559
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,460
This kind of changes your book.

560
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,340
You're telling me.

561
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,900
Of course, if I thought it was hard
getting the townspeople to open up...

562
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,220
...how in heaven's name will I ever get
the killers to talk?

563
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,860
Look, look. They're here.

564
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

565
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,980
I can't see the other one.

566
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,820
There he is.

567
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,340
No way. No press inside the prison.

568
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,660
I have many connections in government.

569
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,020
Perhaps I could have someone call,
explain what I'm doing?

570
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,300
You'd pretty much have to know
the president of the United States...

571
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,780
...before I'd let you visit these boys.

572
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,980
Suck my cock, you cocksucker!

573
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,380
I never snack.

574
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,300
You want to kiss my asshole, bitch?

575
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,620
I'd prefer it to your face.

576
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,460
You want to write a book about me?

577
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,980
If my jackass teachers
could hear you say that!

578
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,060
- Did you ever write a book?
- Certainly.

579
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,220
My first novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms,
was heralded by critics...

580
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,060
...as the most exciting literary debut since...

581
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,740
Yeah, okay.

582
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,100
- You a queer?
- Yes.

583
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,740
Because I'd let you suck me.

584
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,020
I'm not a queer, but letting you suck my dick
don't make me queer.

585
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,980
It makes you queer.
A mouth's a mouth.

586
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,020
Well, thanks, I guess, but no.

587
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,660
- So then what's in it for me?
- Money.

588
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,780
I'd give you a share of my royalties.

589
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,700
I got two kids by my first marriage.

590
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,900
Maybe I can give the money to Lacy, my ex.
Would you help me write her a letter?

591
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,340
I'd be glad to.

592
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,700
Okay, I'll do it.
The Clutter deal was my idea.

593
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,900
I shared a cell with a piece of rat shit
called Floyd Wells...

594
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,060
...who told me old man Clutter had
a safe with $ 10,000.

595
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,380
Dick says you first heard
about the Clutter safe from his cellmate...

596
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,140
...Floyd Wells.

597
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,220
- Is that right?
- Well, he told you, didn't he?

598
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,980
Yes, but can I trust him?

599
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,060
He's in jail.

600
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,020
I wouldn't trust him.

601
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,740
You don't want the only perception people
have of you to come from Dick.

602
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:24,180
- I can help get your side out.
- Don't bullshit me.

603
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,140
You don't care about my side.

604
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,260
- You're not trying to help me.
- Well, this would be helpful.

605
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,100
You'd be entitled
to a share of the royalties.

606
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,540
And what would I do
with royalties in here?

607
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,900
- You might get out, and you could use...
- We're not getting out!

608
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,820
I said no bullshit
and you gave me more bullshit.

609
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,780
Go away.

610
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,460
He'll loosen up.
How's Dick?

611
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,540
Dick?
He just goes on and on and on.

612
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,900
Perry probably shot the Clutters
just to get Dick to be quiet.

613
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,460
I have to have both sides.

614
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,580
How do you get your New York lady friends
to tell you everything?

615
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,220
My swans?

616
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,140
I figure out what they need.

617
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,980
Gossip. Comfort. And I give it to them.

618
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:27,180
So find out what Perry needs.
In the meantime, get all you can from Dick.

619
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,940
Surely he'll shed some light
on Perry, hm?

620
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,860
The man and the boy
we took to the basement.

621
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,620
Now, here's something.

622
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,980
When I wanted to enjoy myself on the girl,
you know, knock her box out...

623
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,580
...Perry says for me not to touch her.

624
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,820
But then, when he's tying up that boy,
he put a pillow under his head.

625
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,620
And told the old man
to lay on a mattress box...

626
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,100
...because he said the floor was cold.

627
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,820
Too cold to get shot on?

628
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,940
Why do you think he did that?

629
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:05,100
And I said, "You losing your nerve?
'Cause we can't leave no witnesses."

630
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,180
And he said, "No,"
but I thought, "Are you a faggot?"

631
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:16,300
Putting that pillow for the boy,
telling me not to crack the girl.

632
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,860
But other times he's okay.

633
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,140
Didn't seem like a faggot
when he splattered their hair on the wall.

634
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,820
No, we didn't want to kill them.

635
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,980
We wanted to get in
and get out without a trace!

636
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,020
Perry wanted us
to get stockings for our faces.

637
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,900
But that shit-ass store where we got
the gloves only had light-colored ones.

638
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,740
You could see my eyes through them.
Pick me up out of a lineup. That was no go.

639
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,580
So Perry says we should go to the hospital
and buy black ones off the nuns.

640
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,100
And I thought that was
a damn crazy idea...

641
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,260
...but I didn't feel like fighting
with him...

642
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,420
...so I went and huddled behind the door,
and I came out and said:

643
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,020
"Catholic bitches wouldn't sell me none."

644
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,860
And what did Perry say?

645
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,740
He said:

646
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,620
"Any.

647
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,580
Catholic bitches won't sell you any."

648
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,860
Really?

649
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,980
- He corrected your grammar?
- Listen, sugar.

650
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,180
Perry Smith...

651
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,620
...fancies himself an artiste.

652
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,620
Hey, baby.
You wanna suck my dick through the bars?

653
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,140
Yours couldn't reach through the bars.

654
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,660
The only way to deal with vulgarity
is to rise above it.

655
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,820
I had a similar experience with my friend,
Tennessee Williams.

656
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,580
The artist and intellectual?

657
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,620
Never mind.

658
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,820
Nobody here likes this kind of thing.

659
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,620
I do.

660
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,260
I'd like to hear it.

661
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,340
Well, Tennessee
and I were in this bar once...

662
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,660
...when this very drunk woman
came up to me and said:

663
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,700
"May I have your autograph?"
I said, "Why, yes, dear."

664
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,020
She said she didn't have
a piece of paper.

665
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,180
So she pulled up her shirt,
pointed to her bellybutton...

666
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,340
...and asked me to autograph that.

667
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,780
So then she hands me an eyebrow pencil...

668
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,620
...and I write my name all the way around
her navel like a sundial.

669
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:43,460
All of the sudden appears her angry
and very drunk husband who says:

670
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:48,540
"Since you're in the mood for signing things,
why don't you sign this?"

671
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:53,380
And with that, he unzipped his fly
and hauled out his manhood.

672
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,900
Well, what'd you do?

673
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,060
Well, the room was graveyard silent.

674
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,580
I looked him up and down
and said, calm as I could:

675
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:10,180
"Well, I don't know if I could autograph it,
but perhaps I could initial it."

676
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,420
What kind of stuff does
Tennessee Williams write?

677
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,260
I know his name,
I just can't think what are his books.

678
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,700
He's a dramatist.
He wrote A Streetcar Named Desire.

679
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,940
- That Brando was in?
- The very same.

680
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,100
Marlon Brando is the fucking king!

681
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,940
Now, he's one of my two favorite actors.

682
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,860
- Who's the other?
- Humphrey Bogart.

683
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,460
I beat Humphrey Bogart.

684
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,540
And Alvin Dewey too.

685
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,220
This is the most black-hearted thing
you have ever done, Nelle Harper Lee...

686
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,260
...and I will never forgive you.

687
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,300
Oh, hush your silliness.
You're all set now. Perry's ready to talk.

688
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,820
I need my life back.

689
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,580
There are a few fires I need to rekindle.

690
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,780
Well, goodbye.
I hate you!

691
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,620
Thank you. You too.

692
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,060
- How's the vanquisher of Bogart?
- Okay.

693
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,980
Tell me more about him.

694
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,300
Well, I think we should talk
about some other things first.

695
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,620
Like what?

696
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:01,780
Nothing.
I just don't have a lot more about Bogie.

697
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:10,340
I do have a very amusing story
about Marlon Brando.

698
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,140
I once spent an entire evening with him,
just the two of us...

699
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:19,900
...and he told me all about his life
before he became a star.

700
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,580
Are you guys friends?

701
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,740
Well, I wouldn't say that.
He's told people he wants to kill me.

702
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,900
What for?

703
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,540
He didn't like the way I portrayed him
in my article.

704
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,260
He claims he told me certain things
off the record.

705
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,500
Well, you couldn't just check your notes?

706
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,340
I never take notes.

707
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,460
I employ a memory technique that gives me
almost a hundred percent retention.

708
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,820
Well, "almost" is the key fucking word.

709
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,180
I may miss a word, but never a meaning.

710
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,820
If you miss the right word, you will.

711
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,820
You've got a hell of a fucking nerve.

712
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,580
What are you trying to bother
a great actor like Brando for?

713
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,660
You misunderst...

714
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,100
See, this is why I don't
wanna to talk to you!

715
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,860
If you want to make me look
like some asshole, you will.

716
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,380
Perry, I never judge my characters.

717
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:15,180
Well, here's something for you
to remember all 100 percent of...

718
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,940
...I am not a character.

719
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,540
I'm a human-fucking-being.

720
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,100
- Guard!
- Perry Edward Smith!

721
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:27,780
I am writing this book
with or without you.

722
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:31,940
You can get involved, so I can make you
a three-dimensional human being...

723
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,180
...or you can continue this foolishness...

724
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,620
...and I will head straight back to New York
and write what I want!

725
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,620
Is this my party?

726
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,260
Truman!

727
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:54,300
Welcome home, my darling.
We missed you so much.

728
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,980
I don't believe I've ever said this:

729
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,580
Tell us about the killers.

730
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,660
Well, their names are Dick Hickock
and Perry Smith.

731
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,740
- Have you met them?
- Met them?

732
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,340
My dear, I've been in their cells.

733
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,780
I have goose flesh.

734
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,580
When you're talking to them,
they seem like perfectly nice boys.

735
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:30,140
To be frank, I'm much more concerned
for my safety around Norman Mailer.

736
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,580
Dick speaks about what happened
without any sense that it was wrong.

737
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,020
- It was just something that happened.
- What about Terry?

738
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,300
No, it's Perry. As in Antoinette.

739
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,940
He's an enigma.

740
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,820
You know, before he killed the Clutter boy
he put a pillow under his head.

741
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,580
And he wouldn't let Dick rape the girl.

742
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,140
- He's not all kind.
- Jack's right.

743
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,500
After these demonstrations of gentility,
he did shoot them dead.

744
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,700
And cut the old man's throat.

745
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,260
There's something...

746
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,500
...I can't quite put my finger on it.

747
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,620
It seems insane to say that he's tender...

748
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:16,340
...but he does have the tender
and the terrible side by side inside him.

749
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,940
He's very...

750
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,740
He's very?

751
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,220
Never mind that.
Let's go around the table...

752
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,980
...and you can all tell me whom
you're having affairs with.

753
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,900
Oh, goody.

754
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,980
Bennett?

755
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:59,740
In his letters, Tru Heart always says:
"What's the new thing that everyone loves?"

756
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,940
And, as any of us with children know...

757
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,340
...the big new thing is not on Broadway
or even on CBS.

758
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,420
Sorry, darling.

759
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,540
- It's this.
- And you see your child bring it home...

760
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:15,060
...and you think,
"I am simply gonna have to slit my wrists."

761
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,260
And five minutes later...

762
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,540
...you're doing it.

763
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,420
Doors closed, of course,
but you just can't resist it.

764
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,660
I did.

765
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,220
Well, assholes aren't much for dancing.

766
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,140
Oh, dear.

767
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,420
How's your writing coming, Jack?

768
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,940
Well, let's hear it.

769
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,300
Well, when Babe told me anyone
could learn it...

770
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,820
...I bet her $ 100 she couldn't teach me,
and I now owe her $ 100.

771
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:51,460
Slim and I will show you how it's done,
and then we hope you'll jump right in.

772
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:54,140
- You, especially.
- Needle's on.

773
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,220
Oh, my word.

774
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,580
- Come on, my protégé.
- All right, teacher.

775
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,420
When she taught me,
I said, "What are the other steps?"

776
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,300
She said, "There are no other steps."

777
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,180
- Who's next?
- Who else?

778
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,340
No, how do I?

779
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,460
That's what I said. It's not a dance.

780
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,460
- You're putting the cigarette out.
- Oh, putting the cigarette out.

781
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,620
Truman?

782
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,580
- Just put your foot out there.
- Oh, wonderful.

783
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,460
What are you doing there?

784
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,500
You're doing something with your arms.

785
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,380
- Then we go down.
- Oh, my word. What is that, flamenco?

786
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:55,940
I'm so sorry about Jack.
I almost fainted when he insulted Bill.

787
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,100
Bill can take it, believe me.

788
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:03,060
Jack has a moral certainty
that's so oppressive.

789
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,020
Moral in what way?

790
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,820
Just that anything fun
is a crime against my art...

791
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,820
...certainly not moral in a personal way.

792
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,980
We have an understanding
that if we need something sexual...

793
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,820
...and the other isn't there to provide it,
that...

794
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,700
I understand.

795
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:24,260
I hardly ever wander, but he does.

796
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,540
We don't discuss it.
I can allow it more if I know less about it.

797
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:35,180
But doesn't even the idea upset you?
I mean, how can you bear to think of...

798
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,620
...or keep yourself from picturing...?

799
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,340
Honey, what is it?

800
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,020
Bill is having an affair.

801
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,340
Babaling, no.

802
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:53,740
Please, you absolutely must not breathe
a word of this to anyone.

803
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,820
It will die inside me.

804
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,660
How did you find out?

805
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,660
Our bed sheets were stained.

806
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,060
- Okay, well, now I could vomit.
- Of course, he couldn't give it to the maid.

807
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,700
Well, no.

808
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,140
So, he got on his hands and knees
in front of the tub, and he scrubbed them.

809
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,180
But it didn't quite come out.

810
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,220
And when I got back I noticed
this odd outline on the sheets.

811
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:26,060
And I said, like a fool, I mean,
not even suspecting, I said...

812
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,700
I said:

813
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,220
"What on earth is that?"

814
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,380
I thought Mary Lee had bleached them.

815
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,660
But then I looked at Bill
and there was that...

816
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,900
...that look on his face.
And I thought:

817
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,740
"Thank heavens he is such a bad liar...

818
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,060
...or I would have been most unjust
to Mary Lee."

819
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,420
It doesn't seem possible that a man
who owns a television network...

820
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,460
...can be such a bad liar.

821
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,100
It seems so essential to his success.

822
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,500
What am I gonna do?

823
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,140
You are going to call me
whenever you need me...

824
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,220
...even if it's 3 in the morning
and war has broken out...

825
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:21,340
...between Brooklyn and Manhattan.
I'll come over the bridge, bullets flying...

826
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,780
...to let you know you have
a lifelong friend in me.

827
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,740
T-bone, you are so dear.

828
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:32,940
I can't picture Bill Paley washing sheets!

829
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,540
He must have been frantic.

830
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,100
- Poor Babe.
- I know, I know. Bless her.

831
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,260
Check.

832
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:45,100
Will you come while I find a newsstand?

833
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:50,020
I'm trying to bribe Perry into liking me
so I'm sending Dick and him dirty magazines.

834
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,020
Sure.

835
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,980
Oh, I wish I'd find a man like you.
Sex and the money, I wouldn't care.

836
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,180
We could always have fun like this.

837
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,460
- Oh, thank you, Big Mama. I love you.
- I love you too.

838
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,340
- Do you?
- Well, how can you even ask?

839
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:13,380
- You never confide in me.
- No, I don't darling. You're right.

840
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:14,620
Why don't you?

841
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:20,020
- It's very simple. I can't trust you.
- What? I'm speechless.

842
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,540
Paralyzed and speechless.

843
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,700
Good afternoon.

844
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:27,860
I need two copies of Playboy,
Party Doll, Stag Night...

845
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:32,700
...Baby Doll, Hotsy Totsy, French Flip,
Pink Lace, Busty and Juggle.

846
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,540
Jiggle.

847
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:36,540
Why on earth can you not trust me?

848
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:41,220
Well, you know why.
Because someday you'll use it.

849
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,340
That will never be true.

850
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,060
I may not be a monk,
but I certainly have a moral code.

851
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,580
Good heavens!
Look at this! This is revolting.

852
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,020
Women look much better in clothes,
much, much, better.

853
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,900
Goodness gracious,
look at this messy thing.

854
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,580
I'm glad to see you've recovered.

855
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,340
How are things coming?

856
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,260
I found a superb structure,
going back and forth...

857
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,780
...between the Clutters
and Dick and Perry drawing near.

858
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:23,260
But if I don't find some emotional depth
it's just another police drama.

859
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,780
Who needs it?

860
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,420
Well, face it, without Perry, you're dead.

861
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,180
- I'd cut your losses.
- Nelle!

862
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,580
Here's your mail.

863
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,580
Something from The New Yorker.

864
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:44,300
Something that looks like invitations,
and something...

865
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,700
Do you know anyone
at the Kansas State Penitentiary?

866
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,540
He must be writing to thank me
for that revolting pornography.

867
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,340
Well, you won't believe this.

868
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,500
What?

869
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:13,100
Dear Mr. Capote...

870
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,020
...it was extremely solicitous of you
to send me those periodicals.

871
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,260
He reads the dictionary.

872
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,540
But I regret to inform you
that the reading material was repellent.

873
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,220
My future will soon be determined.

874
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:30,660
But there are only two outcomes:
life in prison or death.

875
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:35,100
So, whether I have a short time remaining
or a long time to come...

876
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:39,980
...I owe it to my mind to fill it
with things of beauty and intelligence.

877
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:42,260
And how about that handwriting?

878
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:46,460
Well, if he wants beauty and intelligence...

879
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,460
...you're his man.

880
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,940
I waited so we could open it together.

881
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,820
Dear Mr. Capote:
Thank you for the reading material.

882
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,660
It was much more intellectual
than the pussy pictures you sent before.

883
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,100
However...

884
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:16,620
However?

885
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,700
Though the stories are told well...

886
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:24,340
...I, ultimately, did not like them, because
I thought the writing lacked kindness.

887
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,180
I have never!

888
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:29,340
Maybe you should go back
to sending him porn.

889
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:34,820
Imagine being told your work
lacked kindness by a four-time killer!

890
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:39,540
My writing is dispassionate
and unsentimental...

891
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,980
...but I wouldn't say it's unkind.

892
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,420
I've never thought about it
in those terms exactly.

893
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,020
- What a thing to say.
- Yes.

894
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,180
I came all this way back,
three days on the train...

895
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,220
...because there's something
I want you to know.

896
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:11,540
I have given my whole life
to one effort...

897
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,300
...the creation of a great work of art.

898
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,420
Please don't laugh at me.

899
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,220
My whole life...

900
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,420
...all I've wanted was
to create a work of art.

901
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:28,260
I sang, nobody listened.

902
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,260
I painted, nobody looked.

903
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:37,020
Now, Dick and me,
we murder four people.

904
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,700
And what's gonna come out of it?

905
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:42,700
A work of art.

906
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,420
I'm laughing at me.

907
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:53,060
You want me to open up,
but I don't think you can understand me.

908
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:56,260
- Why not?
- It was your books.

909
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:00,820
I thought you looked down on the people
you were writing about...

910
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,860
...like you were sneering at them.

911
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:06,500
I would never sneer at my characters.

912
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,980
If I'm gonna put my heart in front of you...

913
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:12,740
...I need to know I'm doing it with someone
who will listen to it...

914
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:17,540
...and not make a joke out of it
like you did with Holly Go-fucking-lightly.

915
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,940
You can't write my story...

916
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,620
...because your idea of suffering
is so far from mine.

917
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:29,060
It's not. I promise.

918
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,420
Goodbye.

919
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,900
Okay.

920
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,460
The reason this is hard
for me to say is that...

921
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,780
...I've never said it out loud before.

922
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,620
He told everyone she was sick, but...

923
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,180
...my mother committed suicide.

924
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:42,140
- Is this a trick?
- No!

925
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,380
- Are you bullshitting me?
- No!

926
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,260
Have you been talking to Dick?

927
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,420
No.

928
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,820
What happened?

929
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:00,820
Why'd she do it?

930
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,620
All my mother ever wanted...

931
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:10,260
...was to be a Park Avenue lady...

932
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,900
...which isn't easy when you're in Alabama
with no money.

933
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,620
So she married my father to get out.

934
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,420
But before they could go, I came.

935
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,100
So she deserted me...

936
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,180
...leaving me with my aunts.

937
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:34,540
And when my father failed to deliver
her to Park Avenue...

938
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,540
...she deserted him too.

939
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,860
Because she was beautiful...

940
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,980
...so beautiful.

941
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,820
She married again,
this time to Joe Capote.

942
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:59,060
He had a job in New York...

943
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,980
...and worked all hours
until her dream came true.

944
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:08,780
We moved to 1060 Park Avenue.
Mother was thrilled.

945
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:13,980
It seemed to extinguish
some sort of anxiety in her.

946
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,980
But the way Joe got us there
couldn't keep us there.

947
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,180
He'd embezzled the money...

948
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:26,340
...a hundred thousand dollars.

949
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,820
He was fired and tainted.
He told Mother we'd have to move.

950
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,780
But not to a smaller place
on Park Avenue...

951
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:38,780
...but to a cold-water flat
in the Bronx.

952
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,620
She couldn't take it.

953
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:54,660
She frantically tried to save money
in any way so they could stay...

954
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,500
...eating less, not buying lipstick.

955
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:06,780
She'd stopped drinking when they moved
to 1060, but now she stopped stopping.

956
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:11,180
And when that failed
to restore a sense of calm...

957
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:15,860
...she swallowed
a bottle of sleeping pills.

958
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,900
I'm sorry about before.

959
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,900
I thought you were trying to trick me.

960
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,660
Trick you?

961
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:42,380
My mother killed herself too.

962
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,100
How?

963
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,260
The slow way. Drank herself to death.

964
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,340
Drinking.

965
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,660
Suicide for the faint of heart.

966
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:59,740
My brother couldn't wait.
He killed himself too.

967
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,340
My God.

968
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:05,020
- So you're all alone?
- No.

969
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,260
I have a sister.

970
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,740
You want to know what I think about her?

971
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:15,380
I think she's one evil bastard.

972
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,820
You want to see the ball-busting letter
she sent me?

973
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,380
Pay attention.

974
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,620
This could be good for our book.

975
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,180
I don't feel like talking.

976
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:56,420
I thought we were off to a good start.

977
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,540
After you left, that asshole next door said:

978
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:03,100
"Hey, Smith, how come your mother
and brother never visit?" He'd heard.

979
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,500
Fuck him, who cares?

980
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,500
You see, when I'm talking to you,
I forget other people are gonna read it.

981
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,900
And then I think abut how you
stabbed Brando in the back.

982
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:13,540
Perry, what I'm gonna write about you
will help people think more of you.

983
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,220
You're not thinking clearly.
How can you?

984
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,380
You're under the most
unimaginable pressure.

985
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,740
Aw, doesn't wittle Perry wike it here?

986
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,940
- Shut the fuck up, Andrews!
- Hush now.

987
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,580
Be above him.

988
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,980
Come.

989
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:46,060
This can be our little tree house.

990
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,500
How come y'all are so quiet?

991
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,580
Now...

992
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,100
...I want you to relax.

993
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:01,420
I can't. Not here. Not with him.

994
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:05,460
I may be wrong,
but there was something in your letter...

995
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,900
...that made me think
you have the soul of an artist.

996
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,820
Artists have the power,
through our imagination...

997
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:18,940
...to escape a degenerate world
and create a better one.

998
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,220
How?

999
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:25,340
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

1000
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:28,940
Trust me.

1001
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:36,100
Now I want you
to picture the most serene...

1002
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,420
...and relaxing place you know.

1003
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,260
Mexico.

1004
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,780
I know it well.
Water like liquid turquoise.

1005
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:51,780
Feel that hot sun beating down on you...

1006
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:56,820
...warming all the tension out of you.

1007
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:01,300
Feel the heat soaking into you.

1008
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,420
And then...

1009
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:09,460
...gentle as a feather
falling past your cheek...

1010
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,140
...there's a breeze.

1011
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:17,860
Close them.

1012
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,660
Good.

1013
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,140
Feel the breeze...

1014
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,420
...that sensual breath from heaven.

1015
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,780
Just let go...

1016
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,340
...relax every muscle.

1017
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:52,460
I'm ready.

1018
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:00,100
When I was a boy,
we were always moving around.

1019
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:03,780
His parents were rodeo performers.

1020
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:06,940
It was a hard life in lots of ways...

1021
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,980
...but it sure looked good once we lost it.

1022
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,620
Mom and Dad had to quit.

1023
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:17,820
That kind of riding wears your bones out.

1024
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:22,100
But that's what they were: riders.

1025
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,260
So, when that went away...

1026
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,940
...everything went with it.

1027
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,100
Jesus, Flo.

1028
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:32,940
Fuck off! It's just beer.

1029
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,300
Fucking asshole!

1030
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:41,500
So Mom left him, and she took me
and my brother and sister with her.

1031
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:49,620
I dreamed Dad would rescue me.

1032
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:51,820
How funny.

1033
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,180
Me too.

1034
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,820
Every day I waited for him,
but he never came.

1035
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,500
And then one day
I was walking to school...

1036
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,380
Please be real. Please be real.

1037
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:17,620
Please be real.

1038
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:21,980
Dad.

1039
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,940
Are you here to take me with you?

1040
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:30,540
I wish I could, but I can't.

1041
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,460
I don't know how to take care of you.

1042
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,780
I came to tell you to be
the best boy you can be.

1043
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,020
And he made me get down.

1044
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,940
He hated his old lady.
Never forgave her.

1045
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,540
She took his daddy away.

1046
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:53,660
A boy needs his daddy.

1047
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,340
And did he hate the father too?

1048
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:01,820
He always said he hated his old man,
but he used to do this thing...

1049
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:06,740
...this excruciatingly poignant thing.

1050
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:12,260
Dick says that sometimes
when I'd be sleeping...

1051
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,260
Dad!

1052
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,660
Dad!

1053
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,460
Where you been?

1054
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,340
I've been looking everywhere for you.

1055
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,940
Years later, after the Army...

1056
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,820
...I got a letter from Dad saying
he had an idea to make money.

1057
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,860
Wanted me to come help him.

1058
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:43,020
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I wasn't
pretty jazzed up when I got his letter.

1059
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:45,180
He finally had a place for me.

1060
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:49,700
I was gonna sing and play my guitar
in the bar.

1061
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:54,700
I painted all the pictures.
I even painted the sign.

1062
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,540
Nobody's coming here!

1063
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:00,460
Nobody!

1064
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,860
Know why?

1065
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:07,660
It's because of you,
you useless piece of shit!

1066
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,820
Your fucking sign is no good!

1067
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:13,140
I said, "Buy a neon sign"...

1068
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,860
...and you said, "I'll paint us a good one."

1069
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,380
Fucking sissy.

1070
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,500
Come on.

1071
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,380
He killed me, this guy.

1072
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:34,740
Over and over my whole life,
the things he said and did to me.

1073
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,820
It was always like having a knife in me.

1074
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:44,860
So I decided to kill him right then,
in cold blood.

1075
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,100
Sissy.

1076
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,620
But I couldn't do it.

1077
01:20:51,940 --> 01:20:56,180
And all this stuff about Dad
and everything...

1078
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:01,020
...it's gonna make me look like
a fucking crybaby.

1079
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:05,380
No! It will help people see you
as a complete person...

1080
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:10,260
...not just as someone who has caused
suffering, but as someone who has suffered.

1081
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,300
Can I see what you've written so far?

1082
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:18,140
Not till it's perfect.
But I promise, it's sympathetic.

1083
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,660
No one's ever treated me like you have.

1084
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,100
Is it just to get me to tell you stuff?

1085
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:26,660
No.

1086
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,620
It's because I respect you.

1087
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:34,220
All right. Time's up.

1088
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:49,740
- Thanks for that beautiful thing you said.
- What beautiful thing?

1089
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,540
About respect.

1090
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,300
So, I'm sympathetic, am I?

1091
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,740
You been looking out for me, have you?

1092
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:36,420
What's the title of your book?
The "sympathetic" one about me?

1093
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:43,780
I know the title. The fucking guard told me,
and it's not sympathetic.

1094
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,780
It's called In Cold Blood, isn't it?

1095
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:53,700
It is, isn't it?
It's called In Cold Fucking Blood!

1096
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:55,780
You sold me out, you shit...

1097
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:59,020
...after I opened myself up
and gave you everything.

1098
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,660
Well, you're not gonna get away with it.

1099
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,900
One sound out of you...

1100
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,020
...and you'll join the Clutters in hell.

1101
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:11,100
Okay?

1102
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,620
Open your mouth!

1103
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,580
Open your mouth!

1104
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:27,620
Open your fucking lying mouth!

1105
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,660
You're gonna pay for that title now.

1106
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:36,220
You fucked me,
so now I'm gonna fuck you.

1107
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:16,020
I'm not gonna rape you...

1108
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:20,260
...because you can trust me.

1109
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,380
But look.

1110
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,020
Look

1111
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:33,820
That's how your fucking title made me feel.

1112
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:57,620
Don't let him in.

1113
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,460
I need to talk to you, please.

1114
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:01,900
From there.

1115
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:07,220
Can we have some privacy?

1116
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:18,740
In Cold Blood is the title of my book,
but it's not exactly what you think.

1117
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,580
You boys did a monstrous thing.

1118
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:26,340
And the public and their prosecutors
are calling for your blood.

1119
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:29,260
If they get what they want,
they will kill you...

1120
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:34,300
...not in a senseless moment of passion,
but with scrupulous premeditation.

1121
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,860
That is the legal definition
of "in cold blood."

1122
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:41,380
This title is a condemnation of their plans.

1123
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,660
But not only their plans.

1124
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:46,820
No. No, not only.

1125
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:51,940
Look, you did a terrible thing.
You're not innocent.

1126
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:57,700
That doesn't mean you're not
a human being. I want people to see that.

1127
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:01,300
I'm not talking to you
until I've read what you've written.

1128
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,300
It's tough to read the family stuff.

1129
01:26:19,060 --> 01:26:22,700
- But you told it to me.
- Not my family.

1130
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,380
The Clutters.

1131
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:33,860
There better be more than this in this house,
or you'll sure be sorry.

1132
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:36,980
Get him to the basement.

1133
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:39,060
I'll get the old man.

1134
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:44,700
You don't think about it
if someone has a boyfriend, or is in 4-H.

1135
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:48,660
Why don't you put some clothes on?
It's gonna be cold down there.

1136
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,700
Yes, sir.

1137
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,260
We didn't know anything about them.

1138
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,260
Except that they had a safe.

1139
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:02,580
But I don't have a safe.

1140
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:07,300
How old are you, baby?
Well, now don't be scared.

1141
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:12,140
- Let me help you down with these covers.
- Hey! Out here, now.

1142
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,700
Now!

1143
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:19,020
- You touch her, and I'll kill you.
- You can ride her when I'm done.

1144
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,220
Let's just go. There's no safe.
You fucking blew that!

1145
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:26,180
We're not leaving, baby.
They've seen us plain.

1146
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:29,740
Get down to the basement so we
can take care of that. I'll be there soon.

1147
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,460
I'm not leaving you here.

1148
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:34,420
Fuck you, then!

1149
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:36,940
Let's go.

1150
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,340
I know this is crazy...

1151
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:30,420
...but when I looked in his eyes,
I was thinking:

1152
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:33,340
"Too bad we couldn't be friends."

1153
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,700
He had 4-H stuff in his room.

1154
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:41,260
And, I could have told him about my folks
and the rodeo.

1155
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:49,780
- Why don't you kiss him?
- Fuck off!

1156
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:51,860
You never like anything to do with girls.

1157
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:53,620
- You never want a whore.
- Shut up!

1158
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,740
You won't even watch me
when I'm on one.

1159
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:57,420
- You like boys better?
- Shut up!

1160
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:00,220
- Go ahead. Then I can break his sister's box!
- Shut up!

1161
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,380
Go ahead, sugar, kiss him.

1162
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:05,860
Or would you rather kiss his daddy?

1163
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,460
Shit, Perry! His hand came free!

1164
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:45,260
Now, now you kill the women.

1165
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,380
I wish I could have saved them...

1166
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,780
...but at least...

1167
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:20,220
I knew what he wanted to do to that girl.

1168
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,140
Least I spared her that.

1169
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:45,460
About the best example I can give you
of his split nature is this.

1170
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:48,620
He told me what he thought
of Herb Clutter.

1171
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:53,500
He said, "Right before I cut his throat
I was thinking how nice he was."

1172
01:30:53,660 --> 01:30:56,180
"He was a nice soft-spoken gentleman.

1173
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:59,300
I thought that right before
I cut his throat."

1174
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:03,140
"I thought he was a very nice gentleman.
Soft-spoken.

1175
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:07,620
I thought so right up to the moment
I cut his throat."

1176
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:09,860
What an extraordinary thing to say.

1177
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:11,500
Extraordinary.

1178
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,340
So how's the book?

1179
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:33,660
Well, it's coming. I have to leave
in a couple days for their trial.

1180
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:36,940
That's all pro forma, right?
They're not contesting anything, are they?

1181
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,700
No, they hope for life, not death.

1182
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:42,020
Death would be better for the book.

1183
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:46,340
It would satisfy the readers more,
and it would make the title work too.

1184
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:52,020
Honey, I've worked harder on this
than anything my whole life.

1185
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:56,500
I don't want it ruined just because
a jury makes a dumb decision.

1186
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:00,100
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1187
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,620
We have, Your Honor.

1188
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,780
Will the clerk please bring the verdict up?

1189
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:15,100
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Perry Edward Smith...

1190
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,900
...guilty of the crime of murder
in the first degree.

1191
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:20,940
And the punishment...

1192
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,060
...is death.

1193
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:33,740
- Will you appeal?
- Dick wants to.

1194
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:37,540
But we'll hang. We should.

1195
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,420
You think hanging is fair?

1196
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,660
It's funny.
Last night I was laying awake...

1197
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:48,740
...and thinking:
"What is punishment?"

1198
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:53,940
Being in jail isn't punishment,
if you didn't like it on the outside.

1199
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:58,460
And neither is death,
if it was painful to live.

1200
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,620
I'll tell you what punishment is for me.

1201
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:05,220
What?

1202
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:09,460
It's hoping there's someone for you.

1203
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:17,300
And after years of no one
you find him and you can't have him.

1204
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:36,660
- We really connected, didn't we?
- Of course, we did.

1205
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:39,660
You weren't being nice to me
just for the book, were you?

1206
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:42,940
No! I think about you all the time.

1207
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:46,660
- Dick too?
- Only for the book.

1208
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:51,020
You're the only person
I ever feel real around.

1209
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,500
Me too.

1210
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:57,060
I don't have to act
like a little wind-up toy with you.

1211
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:07,900
Perry...

1212
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,460
...I don't want you to die.

1213
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,780
Look, Ron and Nancy Reagan we're not.

1214
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:07,060
We're apart for long times.
We know we have to have sex.

1215
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:15,660
But we're men. We can have sex
just to release the desire to have sex.

1216
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:18,900
What's not allowed is falling in love.

1217
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:30,500
You see, that would be a betrayal.

1218
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:37,180
A terrible breach of a very mature...

1219
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:41,260
...and very sensible arrangement.

1220
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:45,900
After the verdicts,
Truman buried himself in the book.

1221
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,740
By mid-'63 it was done.

1222
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:53,380
Perfect as a diamond,
as tough, as multi-faceted...

1223
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:55,500
...only this time...

1224
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:57,620
...it had kindness.

1225
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:02,340
But we couldn't publish it
until it had an ending...

1226
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:05,820
...until something had been settled
about the boys.

1227
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:08,940
There were four appeals,
all the way to the Supreme Court.

1228
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:11,620
It took five full years
for a final judgment.

1229
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:17,100
That was hard on the killers, which doesn't
make a dime's difference to me. But...

1230
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:32,460
Do you have any word yet
about when the book is coming out?

1231
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,900
I don't know.

1232
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:40,700
You simply cannot conceive
of the agony.

1233
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:48,500
I've worked on this book ceaselessly
for four years...

1234
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:54,380
...pouring the whole of myself into it,
head and heart.

1235
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:57,500
And then to be waiting like this...

1236
01:36:57,660 --> 01:37:01,140
...unable to publish what I've done
until they're hanged.

1237
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,500
I can hardly wait.

1238
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:09,020
Do you feel that your book is worth
a human life?

1239
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:13,220
- Well, it's certainly worth Dick's.
- What about the other man?

1240
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:16,900
His name is Perry.

1241
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:20,780
I mean, it's just an intolerable position.

1242
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:25,980
Because to get an ending for the book
means an end for...

1243
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:38,500
On death row,
you may only write two letters a week.

1244
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:42,900
Every week, for five years...

1245
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:47,380
...Perry wrote both letters to Truman.

1246
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:50,860
Friend Truman, cold in Kansas today...

1247
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:54,740
...though not as frigid as I imagine
it is in Switzerland.

1248
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,820
How big are those Alps?

1249
01:37:57,020 --> 01:38:00,860
Friend Truman, do you know the song
"Gold Mine in the Sky"?

1250
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,260
It was Dad's favorite.

1251
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:08,020
Maybe you could use your influence
with the authorities in this shithole...

1252
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,780
...and get me a tape recorder
so I could sing it for you.

1253
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:12,940
Not much to say today.

1254
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:15,100
Awful blue.

1255
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:19,460
God, I miss you. Please write soon.

1256
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:22,780
You can't imagine what it does to me
when they bring the mail...

1257
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,700
...and there's something from you.

1258
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:26,220
Friend Truman:

1259
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:28,940
It's all over.

1260
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:32,380
Our last appeal has been denied.

1261
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:35,780
Dick and I are allowed
to have a witness at the hanging.

1262
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:39,060
We both pick you.

1263
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:42,700
- You have to come with me.
- I can't.

1264
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:47,860
I'm getting desperate about my new book.
It's not coming together.

1265
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:58,380
Anyway,
I thought this was what you wanted.

1266
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:00,620
I know I said that...

1267
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:03,260
...but to see him killed?

1268
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,660
It's too much.

1269
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,900
- I don't suppose Jack would?
- No.

1270
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,460
He wouldn't anyway, but...

1271
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:19,180
...for some reason,
he gets funny about Perry.

1272
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:23,140
It's like he's jealous.

1273
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,500
Truman...

1274
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:34,580
...are you and Perry?

1275
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:36,540
Please, Nelle.

1276
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:40,540
I'm begging you.

1277
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:44,860
But I couldn't.

1278
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,540
And I wouldn't.

1279
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:54,100
I'm sorry, he can't take the call.

1280
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,540
It was the boys again.

1281
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:00,740
They want me to help...

1282
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,220
...but I can't help them.

1283
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:07,660
Maybe they want you for comfort.

1284
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,020
Rain is good.

1285
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,860
I hope he apologizes.

1286
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:24,300
That would really make him sympathetic.

1287
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:38,100
Hey, Truman. Where you been?

1288
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,140
I thought you were gonna spend
the whole day with us.

1289
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:48,260
I couldn't get here earlier.
I was making calls on your behalf.

1290
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,380
It's just so late now.

1291
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:57,940
- Hickock, let's get ready.
- We have some time.

1292
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,660
I have something I want to tell you.

1293
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:07,780
They're gonna ask if you have anything
to say, and you must apologize.

1294
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:16,180
- That won't bring them back.
- No. It restores your humanity to you.

1295
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:34,180
It's time.

1296
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:39,020
Anyone saying goodbye
needs to say it here.

1297
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:47,940
Bye, Truman.

1298
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:50,420
Thanks for it.

1299
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:15,940
Did he say anything to you?

1300
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:21,620
He said he loved me...

1301
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,340
...and he always had.

1302
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:13,700
Richard Eugene Hickock.
Do you have anything to say?

1303
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,980
Just that I hold no hard feelings.

1304
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:23,140
You people are...

1305
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:27,620
...sending me to a better world
than this one ever was.

1306
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:55,660
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

1307
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:00,340
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1308
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,660
He restoreth my soul.

1309
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:07,460
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for His name's sake.

1310
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,380
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1311
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:16,900
...I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me."

1312
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,380
Not dead yet.

1313
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:14,260
I still hear breathing.

1314
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,300
Okay, he's ready.

1315
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:40,820
Perry Edward Smith.
Do you have anything to say?

1316
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:45,500
Friend Truman...

1317
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:50,580
...I don't know what you did,
but the tape recorder arrived.

1318
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:59,340
There's a gold mine in the sky
Far away

1319
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:07,620
We will find it
You and I, some sweet day

1320
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:15,180
There'll be a clover just for you
Down the line

1321
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:23,460
Where the skies are always blue
Pal of mine

1322
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:28,500
Far away

1323
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:33,460
Far away

1324
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:41,620
We will find that long lost gold mine
Some sweet day

1325
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:48,860
And we'll say hello to friends
Who said goodbye

1326
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:55,500
When we find that long lost gold mine

1327
01:47:56,620 --> 01:47:58,380
In the...

1328
01:48:00,220 --> 01:48:01,220
...sky

1329
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:05,900
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

1330
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:07,180
He maketh me..."

1331
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,580
Was he able to speak?

1332
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,260
Yes, he spoke.

1333
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:24,380
What did he say?

1334
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:27,340
Smith did not speak.

1335
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,860
He apologized.

1336
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:32,380
Just chewed his gum.

1337
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:38,100
You saw those two men hanged.
It must be...

1338
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:42,660
Isn't it painful for you?

1339
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:51,660
Babaling, life is painful.

1340
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:56,420
It's the one experience
that unites rich and poor.

1341
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:01,380
I suppose I'm able to endure it...

1342
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:05,860
...because I can alchemize
what wounds me into art.

1343
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:07,900
Yes, but...

1344
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:14,100
...at what cost?

1345
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:21,060
It made him the most famous author
in America and very, very rich.

1346
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,980
He moved to Manhattan where, oddly...

1347
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:28,900
...he had a very good view
of the place he had left.

1348
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:42,940
Who ever knows
what our hearts will want?

1349
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:45,540
Who can...

1350
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:50,220
...defend themselves from it?

1351
01:49:57,220 --> 01:49:59,900
Seeing what's happened to him since...

1352
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:04,620
...well, despite the bravado
that only appears to be confidence...

1353
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:11,540
...I have come to feel
with great heart-sickness...

1354
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:19,140
...that there were three deaths
on the gallows that night.

1355
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:22,300
He never wrote anything big again.

1356
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:26,780
Just collections,
fragments pulled together.

1357
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:33,340
God knows he didn't have to write,
not after all that money on In Cold Blood.

1358
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,580
It's funny.

1359
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:40,580
It made him, and it ruined him.

1360
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:42,620
You know, in his will...

1361
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:47,260
...Perry left everything to Truman.

1362
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:59,580
America is not a country
where the small gesture goes noticed.

1363
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:03,620
We're not a country like France...

1364
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:08,980
...where charm,
something light or effervescent...

1365
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:10,820
...can survive.

1366
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:13,940
We want everything you have...

1367
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:17,620
...and we want it as fast
as you can turn it out.

1368
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:02,260
friend TRUMAN

1369
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:11,380
I read an interview with Frank Sinatra...

1370
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:14,380
...in which he said about Judy Garland:

1371
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:19,300
"Every time she sings, she dies a little."

1372
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:23,700
That's how much she gave.

1373
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:29,420
It's true for writers, too...

1374
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:33,500
...who hope to create something lasting.

1375
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:37,740
They die a little getting it right.

1376
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:42,180
And then the book comes out...

1377
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:46,100
...and there's a dinner.

1378
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:49,620
Maybe they give you a prize.

1379
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:55,380
And then comes the inevitable
and very American question:

1380
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:57,180
What's next?

1381
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:03,820
But the next thing can be...

1382
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:09,380
...so hard...

1383
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:15,660
...because now you know
what it demands.

1384
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,500
Hi, Nelle.

1385
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:23,900
I just began my novel
and I had such a good morning writing...

1386
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:26,140
...that I want to celebrate.

1387
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,220
Want to come to lunch?

1388
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:34,660
No, honey, I don't care where.

1389
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:40,820
Just someplace pretty
where we can have fun...

1390
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,460
...and be ourselves.
