1
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,754
Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,591
Bloody hell.

3
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,178
I'm sweatin' here.

4
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,723
Roastin'.

5
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,560
Boilin'.

6
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,897
Bakin'.

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,734
Swelterin'.

8
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,946
It's like a sauna.

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,783
A furnace.

10
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,746
You could fry an egg on my stomach.

11
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,792
Ohh...

12
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,005
Ooh, now that is hot.

13
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,173
It's ridiculous.

14
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,926
Tremendous.

15
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,763
Fantastic.

16
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:41,435
Fan-dabby-dozy...

17
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,272
...tastic.

18
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,216
Oi. Give it some.

19
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,135
This brush is sick.

20
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,096
It's a good brush,
what's the matter with you?

21
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,434
Don't blame the brush, it's the man.
It's you, it's your technique.

22
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,229
Put your back into it.

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,858
Mush!

24
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,485
Yes, sir!

25
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:35,030
Walking on the beaches
looking at the peaches

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,158
Well, I got the notion, girl,
that you got some suntan lotion

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,660
In that bottle of yours

28
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,747
Spread it all over
my peeling skin, baby

29
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,667
That feels real good

30
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,004
All the skirts
lapping up the sun

31
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,797
Lap me up!

32
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:57,886
Why don't you come on
and lap me up

33
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:06,478
Walking on the beaches
looking at the peaches

34
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,815
Well, there goes another one
just lying down on the sand dunes

35
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,692
I better go take a swim

36
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:17,572
And see if I can
cool down a little bit

37
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,616
Cos you and me, woman

38
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,411
We got a lot of
things on our minds...

39
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:28,375
Oi, I don't pay you to flap about,
go and get us a coupla beers.

40
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,712
Walking on the beaches
looking at the peaches

41
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,465
Well, you just
take a look over there

42
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,551
Where?

43
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,346
Is she trying
to get out of that clitoris?

44
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,141
Liberation for women,
that's what I preach

45
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,271
Preacher man!

46
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:57,404
Walking on the beaches
looking at the peaches

47
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,281
Oh, shit!

48
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,994
There goes the charabanc

49
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,830
Looks like I'm gonna be
stuck here the whole summer

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,208
Well, what a bummer!

51
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,961
I can think of
a lot worse places to be

52
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,339
Like down in the street
or down in the sewer

53
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,802
Or even
on the end of a skewer...

54
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,454
Oh, lovely...

55
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,291
Down on the beaches
just look at all the peaches

56
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,710
Down on the beaches...

57
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,134
Down on the beaches
just look at all the peaches

58
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,597
Down on the beaches
just look at all the peaches

59
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,150
Mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm!

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,569
Mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm!

61
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,739
Mmm!

62
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,911
Mm-mm mm-mm mm!

63
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,745
- What's that?
- It's a boulder.

64
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,789
- What?
- A fuckin' boulder.

65
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,707
I've got the fuckin' bends.

66
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,209
How did that happen?

67
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,045
I don't fuckin' know.
Where's the mobile?

68
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,047
I almost got killed, Dee!

69
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,801
I was that close
to gettin' killed. Serious!

70
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,888
You nearly had a squashed husband.
Here, give your mate a call.

71
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,141
- What?
- Your mate, the one with the truck.

72
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,019
- Felipe?
- Yeah, if that's his name.

73
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,274
Don't worry about this, darlin'.
It's nothing.

74
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:45,154
Come here.

75
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,907
It has done
a fair bit of damage, Gal.

76
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,827
- Cracked the tiles.
- I had noticed!

77
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,872
- When's that gettin' fixed?
- Saturday, apparently.

78
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,749
Wouldn't bet on it.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,544
They're takin'
the boulder out Tuesday

80
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,255
and retilin' on Saturday, I hope.

81
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,965
Oh!
Fuckin' hell!

82
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,342
- Fuckin' thing!

83
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,178
He should be in the circus.
He's a menace.

84
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,055
You all right?

85
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,767
Yeah, I'm all right.

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,563
Oi, Gal.

87
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:23,484
You gonna stay with
the same colour water?

88
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,280
- What d'you mean?
- Water.

89
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,411
You stickin' with the plain?

90
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,916
You can have different colours.

91
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,669
- Fuck off!
- Straight up!

92
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,797
Aquamarine, deep blue,

93
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:51,179
mid-blue, tangerine, lilac, pink,
plum, anything you want.

94
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,765
- They've got a chart.
- Is that right?

95
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,768
- Check it out.
- Gal, he's at it.

96
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,729
I'm not! What do you know?

97
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,356
- Just have the fuckin' plain.

98
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,943
I fully intend to!
Now, eat your sausage!

99
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,882
People say,
"Don't you miss it, Gal?"

100
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,259
I say, "What? England?"

101
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,304
"Nah, fuckin' place. It's a dump."

102
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,890
"Don't make me laugh."

103
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,728
"Grey, grimy, sooty."

104
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,315
"What a shithole. What a toilet."

105
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:50,029
"Every cunt with a long face,
shufflin' about, moanin' or worried."

106
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,074
"No thanks, not for me."

107
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,702
They say,
"What's it like, then? Spain."

108
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:01,082
And I'll say, "It's hot."

109
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,042
"Hot."

110
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,671
"Oh, it's fuckin' hot."

111
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,051
"Too hot?"

112
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,263
"Not for me."

113
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,975
"I love it."

114
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,837
He ain't gonna hit
fuck all with that blunderbuss.

115
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,965
- Better off with a spear.
- Shut up, Aitch.

116
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,592
Shh!

117
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:57,221
I'll give you 100 to 1.

118
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,255
Hold up.

119
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,341
Little peach.

120
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,843
It's only a tiddler.

121
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,680
That's his problem.

122
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,770
Prepare to meet your maker.

123
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,861
Cowboy gun? Fucking right,
it was a cowboy gun.

124
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,115
Clunk!

125
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,666
What?

126
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,586
I'm gonna have the calamari.
What you havin'?

127
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,922
I'm not sure yet.

128
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,925
You like mussels, have the mussels.

129
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,260
No, I'll have this chicken thing.

130
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:23,265
What chicken thing?
I didn't see that.

131
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:25,935
Oh, yeah.

132
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:31,690
No, I'm gonna have the calamari.
I'll have the calamari.

133
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,486
Shall we just order? I'm starvin'.
I'm Lee Marvin.

134
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:39,323
Here they are.

135
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,747
- Hello, babe.

136
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:51,085
Whatever it is, leave it outside.

137
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,712
That way,
we can have a nice evening.

138
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,299
Jackie... you look beautiful.

139
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,177
Can you get me a brandy, Aitch?

140
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:03,514
Now, that's what
I like to hear, brandy.

141
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,977
Bloody brandy.
I'll have one of them.

142
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,271
- You all right, Jackie?
- Aitch...

143
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,816
Tell him, then.

144
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,070
- Tell me what?
- Jackie?

145
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,032
Are you definitely retired?

146
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,409
Yeah, why?

147
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,745
- Definitely?
- I'm definitely retired.

148
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,747
What's this about?

149
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:33,460
Gal, we had a phone call,
just before we left the house.

150
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,588
- Yeah?
- It was from London.

151
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,007
He's definitely retired.

152
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,927
Wait a minute, love.

153
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,014
Now, let me get this straight.

154
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,852
You had a call. The phone goes.

155
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,104
It's a job, right?

156
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:56,108
- Yeah.
- And they want me?

157
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,735
Yeah.

158
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,778
- No one else?
- No.

159
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,114
- They want me?
- Yeah.

160
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:08,370
All right. You've asked me
and I've said no. That's it.

161
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:13,334
So... why are we still talking?

162
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,464
Jack?

163
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,425
It was Don Logan.

164
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:26,138
- Oh, Christ.
- Don Logan.

165
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,515
Gal, I'm sorry, I didn't know...

166
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,894
- It's all right.
- Why didn't he just call us?

167
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,688
Who knows what goes on
in that cunt's head?

168
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:38,525
- It's not your fault.
- Shouldn't have picked it up.

169
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,112
All right, right, um...

170
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,282
You tell Don...

171
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:49,411
Umm... Tell him... thanks.

172
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,248
Thanks for thinkin' of me,
but I've gotta decline.

173
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,876
- No offence, but...
- You can't.

174
00:13:56,126 --> 00:14:00,881
Well, then, tell him...

175
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,719
Tell him...

176
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,349
- I'd be no good.
- They're serious.

177
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,852
Tell him what the fuck
you like, anything!

178
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:19,441
- You can tell him yourself.
- What?

179
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,361
- Yeah.
- He's comin' over.

180
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,280
Tomorrow.

181
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,201
Wants us to pick him up.

182
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,580
OK.

183
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,834
Seòor.

184
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:42,673
He rates you, Gal.
Reckons there's no risk.

185
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:52,724
Oh, that's nice, that. Nice and cold.

186
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:58,188
I love this restaurant.

187
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,362
Deedee, my lovely wife...

188
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:11,326
Come Saturday I'll have
me pool back, swim in it.

189
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:14,830
Always dreamed of that... this.

190
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,791
Guess where?

191
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,377
That's it. You got it right in one.

192
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:24,464
Inside, that's where.

193
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,886
"No risk."

194
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:32,431
No fucking risk?

195
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:37,644
Nine years of my fucking life,
no fucking risk?

196
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:49,406
What you havin'?
I'm havin' the calamari.

197
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:38,265
Look, what's the worst thing
that could happen?

198
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,852
He's gonna come here, ask me,
I'm gonna say no.

199
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,938
He's not gonna be happy,
then he'll leave.

200
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:48,442
- That simple?
- Yeah.

201
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,280
Now, please, come to bed,
I miss you.

202
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,615
We don't have to be here.

203
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,827
Now, that would be
the wrong thing to do.

204
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,537
You know that.

205
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:05,709
That'd be like a red rag to a bull.

206
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,379
All I can do
is tell him to his face

207
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:14,342
that I'm not interested,
that's all I can do.

208
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,096
And I'm not.

209
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:22,100
And I will tell him.

210
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,063
Come here, give us a hug.

211
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,742
He'll hurt you.

212
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,077
No...

213
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,122
He won't.

214
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:46,249
He won't hurt me. He can't.

215
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:48,001
You know he can.

216
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:05,560
Come on. Let's get some kip.

217
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:56,027
Oi!

218
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,113
Here y'are, sort him out.

219
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,824
He'll have the balance
on Saturday.

220
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,493
Listen, stay away
from here for a bit.

221
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:07,205
I'm all right for the moment.

222
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:20,009
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,860
Gotta change my shirt,
it's sticking to me.

224
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,198
I'm sweatin' like a cunt.

225
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,763
How's your brother?

226
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:51,226
Malky? He's all right, I suppose.
Dunno, you'd have to ask him.

227
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:56,314
- You patched things up?
- It's up to him, innit?

228
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:04,614
- How was the flight, Don?
- Was all right.

229
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,619
So this is a Spanish villa, is it?

230
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:13,790
Yeah, this is it. The old hacienda.

231
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,875
Bit remote, innit? Cut off.

232
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:21,047
No, it's perfect, Don.
It's just how we like it.

233
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:23,091
D'you wanna look round?

234
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:28,221
Yeah, I will in a minute,
when I have a piss.

235
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,310
Right, girls, you fit?

236
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,020
Where you goin'?

237
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,899
Taking the ladies out to eat.
Leave you two to it.

238
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:43,403
- Ain't I invited?
- No, Don.

239
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,363
No, no - course you are!

240
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:49,283
Only I thought you'd want
some time. Talk about things.

241
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,788
No, I'm jokin'. It's all right.
Here y'are, I'll get it.

242
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:56,666
That's all right, Don.
No need for that.

243
00:22:56,916 --> 00:23:02,296
Aitch! Behave.
I'm payin' for your meal.

244
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,342
Oh, that's, er, very kind of you.

245
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:10,763
- Very nice of you.
- Shut up.

246
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:24,569
Yeah, this is all right, innit?

247
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:26,362
Not bad.

248
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:27,989
What's that?

249
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,075
- A swimming pool.
- It's a bath, innit?

250
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:33,619
- We had an accident.
- Accident?

251
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,956
Yeah, this boulder
came rollin' down the hill,

252
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,583
just missed me.

253
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:42,211
Smashed some tiles. Look.

254
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:48,468
- You happy here?
- Yeah. Very.

255
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:55,725
What did Jackie say?

256
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:04,650
- Just that something was happening.
- Which it is. And?

257
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:08,821
- You were planning something.
- And you said?

258
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:12,575
I didn't say much, just listened.

259
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,660
She put a question to you.

260
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,748
- Yeah.
- Which was?

261
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,501
That you thought of me.

262
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,336
To which you said?

263
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:25,463
She probably told you.

264
00:24:25,713 --> 00:24:28,841
Told me nothing.

265
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:31,344
- Look, Don...
- Look, Don?

266
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:35,556
- It's like this.
- Like what?

267
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:38,142
I'm...

268
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:41,395
retired.

269
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,357
Are ya?

270
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:48,194
'Fraid so.

271
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:52,073
I haven't... not got lots
of money. I got enough.

272
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:57,620
I'd do anything not to offend you,
but I can't take part.

273
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,705
I'm not really up to it.

274
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:03,918
- Not up to it?
- No, I'm not.

275
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:05,419
I see.

276
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,714
- I'd be useless.
- Useless.

277
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,800
- I would be.
- In what way?

278
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,343
In every fuckin' way.

279
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:17,556
Why are you swearin'?
I'm not swearin'.

280
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:22,144
I'm gonna tell you a little story.

281
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:30,236
I know a bloke who knows a bloke
who knows a bloke.

282
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:31,612
Hello?

283
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:33,364
Now, you know this bloke.

284
00:25:33,614 --> 00:25:36,158
- Do I?
- This is a bloke you know.

285
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,827
Is that Mr Logan?

286
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:40,454
- Who's this?
- Hello, Mr Logan.

287
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,540
- Hello.
- What you doin'?

288
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,543
- Watching telly.
- What you watchin'?

289
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:48,838
Nuffin'. Is that Stan?

290
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:51,007
Course it is, you cunt.

291
00:25:51,257 --> 00:25:53,175
Stan Higgins.

292
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,970
Wants me to put a team together.

293
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,722
Eight men. Strong.

294
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:01,225
Ain't afraid of graft.
It's gonna take all night.

295
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:04,186
Good boys, gotta be good boys.

296
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,356
Reliable. Positive attitude.

297
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:11,235
That's very important.
Very important.

298
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:14,321
That's what we're looking for, Don.

299
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,990
Who's behind this, Stan?

300
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,950
Who do you think?

301
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,911
- Who do you think, Gal?
- I dunno. Who?

302
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,582
- Who?
- Teddy.

303
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:27,543
Teddy?

304
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:33,466
Teddy Bass.
Mr. Black Magic himself. Teddy Bass.

305
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:36,218
Months ago,
he gets invited to this party,

306
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,263
massive place on the Bishops Avenue.

307
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:41,098
Wild party, orgy.

308
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:42,933
Orgy?

309
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:51,067
Said it was fucking incredible.

310
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:56,405
Arses everywhere. Doin' everything.

311
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,908
Wanking, spanking...

312
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:01,410
Fucking...

313
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,164
Cocaine, camcorders...

314
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:09,168
Like ancient Rome.

315
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,797
How are you feeling, Teddy?
Are you all right?

316
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,632
Having fun?

317
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:18,260
Yeah, it's a gas.

318
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:23,974
What you staring at?

319
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,352
Who's he fuckin' sitting next to?

320
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:29,021
Who's he fuckin' sitting next to?

321
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:34,068
Teddy, this is Harry,
chairman of Imperial Emblatt.

322
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:36,737
Only the fuckin' chairman
of Imperial Emblatt.

323
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,280
Heard of that?

324
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,573
No.

325
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:44,286
That's cos they're one of those
sniffy lot, don't need publicity.

326
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,455
The back of your head.

327
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,499
What did you say?

328
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,668
I'm staring at the back of your head.

329
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:55,673
Well, don't. Stare at the back
of your own fucking head.

330
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:58,759
Like Standard Gradings TMD,
remember them?

331
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:01,845
Yeah, safety deposits, late '70s.

332
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,598
That's it. Only these are bigger.

333
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:08,394
Much bigger.

334
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,735
Men or women?

335
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,322
Oh...

336
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:24,827
definitely.

337
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:41,111
This chairman's
not such a big prick.

338
00:29:41,361 --> 00:29:43,072
He knows who Teddy Bass is.

339
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:46,533
What he is, what he's up to.

340
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:48,452
But does he care?

341
00:29:48,702 --> 00:29:51,580
- Does he, fuck.
- Thank you for that, Harry.

342
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,917
I've been looking
for somewhere safe for that.

343
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:58,921
It's been in the family
for donkey's years, generations.

344
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:02,132
Why? Cos the place is impregnable.

345
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:05,636
The most elaborate
security system in Europe.

346
00:30:05,886 --> 00:30:09,056
Well, thanks, Teddy.
Thank you for choosing us.

347
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:11,350
It's a modern fortress.

348
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,603
No, it's perfect for me.
I'm well impressed.

349
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:18,649
I feel very... safe.

350
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,819
Well, rest assured, Teddy,
we're very safe.

351
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:24,988
Very comforting to know that, Harry.

352
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:28,784
Nice doing business with you.

353
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:32,871
See you around.

354
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:51,139
Tell you what, Stan. That is
fucking impressive, that place.

355
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,184
I'll say that, fucking futuristic.

356
00:30:54,434 --> 00:30:56,228
Yeah?

357
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:59,898
Doable?

358
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:04,528
I don't see why not.

359
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:09,992
See, where there's a will,
and there is a fucking will...

360
00:31:10,242 --> 00:31:12,119
There's a way.

361
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:15,706
And there is a fuckin' way.

362
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:18,875
There's always a fucking way.

363
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:22,296
It's Saturday but you're needed
in London Friday.

364
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:24,339
It's a bit sudden, innit?

365
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,508
No, it's very far from sudden.

366
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:30,387
It's been five months,
I've been in on it for two.

367
00:31:30,637 --> 00:31:34,558
It's not sudden. Preparation,
preparation, preparation.

368
00:31:34,808 --> 00:31:38,645
It's a piece of piss, a monkey
could do it, so I thought of you!

369
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:40,606
Cheers, Don.

370
00:31:40,856 --> 00:31:44,443
You're at the Grosvenor,
your name's Rowntree.

371
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:48,780
If they give you a pull,
you're just here to see some friends.

372
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:54,286
Somebody'll call you,
pick you up. Probably Mike.

373
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:57,956
What's that mean?

374
00:31:58,373 --> 00:32:02,628
- What?
- That stupid nodding you're doing.

375
00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:10,344
Is this a fuck-off, Gal?

376
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:11,845
No, course not.

377
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:13,930
- Are you saying no?
- No.

378
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:17,309
- Is that what you're saying?
- Not exactly.

379
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,562
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying...

380
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:23,940
Thanks and all that,
thanks for thinking of me,

381
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:27,194
but I've got to turn
this opportunity down.

382
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:30,781
No, you've got to
turn this opportunity yes.

383
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:33,950
- I'm not match fit.
- You seem all right to me.

384
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:36,036
- Not really.
- You look fine.

385
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:37,954
- Do the job.
- What?

386
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:39,581
- Do the job.
- No, Don.

387
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:40,832
- Yes.
- No.

388
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:42,084
- Yes.
- I can't.

389
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:43,627
- Can.
- I can't.

390
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,462
- Don't do this.
- Do what?

391
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:47,714
- What am I doin'?!
- This.

392
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:51,259
This? This what?

393
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:56,056
- Come on, Don.
- There's a boy lookin' at us.

394
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,775
Go home, son. Go on.
I don't need you today.

395
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:10,362
Go on, go home.

396
00:33:10,737 --> 00:33:14,241
Go home!

397
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:24,209
Who was that?

398
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:29,464
A Spanish kid who helps
around the house. Nice kid.

399
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:38,598
D'you wanna go into town for
a drink? I'll show you round?

400
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:42,602
If you like. I'm not fussed.

401
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:46,773
You're on two per cent,
maybe even three.

402
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:49,484
Depends on the usual bumflufferies.

403
00:33:49,734 --> 00:33:52,154
It's not about money with us, is it?

404
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:57,534
It's the charge, the bolt, the buzz.
The sheer fuck-offness, right?

405
00:33:57,784 --> 00:34:00,745
Dance to the music
like nobody does

406
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:04,499
The first time I saw you
I knew it was love

407
00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:08,211
Groover...

408
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,215
She's all right, Jackie, isn't she?

409
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:15,385
Yeah, she's great. Great laugh.

410
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:18,388
Big tits.

411
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,307
Yeah, she's a lovely girl.

412
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:24,102
My heart is on fire
the night is divine

413
00:34:24,352 --> 00:34:27,439
My only desire
is making you mine...

414
00:34:27,689 --> 00:34:31,526
I've missed my plane,
I'm staying tonight, that all right?

415
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:34,404
Course.

416
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:37,532
I fucked her.

417
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,118
It's none of my business.

418
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:45,123
I know, I'm just tellin' you.
Three years ago.

419
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh, yeah?

420
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,127
- Dirty cow.
- Yeah.

421
00:34:49,377 --> 00:34:51,254
Aitch knows fuck-all about it.

422
00:34:51,504 --> 00:34:56,843
What's she doing with him,
lanky hunk of piss, fucking pillock.

423
00:34:57,093 --> 00:34:59,012
He loves her, Don.

424
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:01,306
I'm tempted to tell him.

425
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:04,768
She tried to stick her finger
up my bum.

426
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:06,770
I almost hit the roof.

427
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,316
What d'you make
of a woman who'd do that?

428
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:18,448
Listen, don't say nothin',
Gal, but I...

429
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:24,079
- I quite liked her.
- Did ya?

430
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:27,499
Mmm.

431
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:31,836
How is she, all right?

432
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,341
- What's that, Don?
- You heard.

433
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:38,426
No, I didn't, Don. Sorry.

434
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:42,680
Yeah? Well, I'm not repeating it.

435
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:46,768
How far's the sea?

436
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,778
Talk to me, Gal.

437
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:59,823
I'm here for you.

438
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:01,866
I'm a good listener.

439
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:04,160
What can I say? I've said it all.

440
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:07,831
- I'm retired.
- Shut up!

441
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:10,083
Cunt.

442
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:13,670
You louse. You got some
fuckin' neck. Retired?

443
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,797
Fuck off, you're revolting.

444
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,883
Your fuckin' suntan,
you're like leather.

445
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:20,385
Like a leather man.

446
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:22,887
You could make a fuckin' suitcase.

447
00:36:23,138 --> 00:36:26,266
You look like a
fat crocodile, fat bastard.

448
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:28,601
You look like fuckin' Idi Amin.

449
00:36:28,852 --> 00:36:34,232
State of you.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

450
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:37,861
Who d'you think you are?

451
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:40,572
King of the castle? Cock of the walk?

452
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:43,449
Oof!

453
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,661
You think this is
the Wheel of Fortune?

454
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:49,080
You make your dough and fuck off?

455
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:54,294
Thanks, Don. See you, Don
Off to Spain, Don. Fuck off, Don.

456
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:58,464
Lie in your pool laughing at me,
d'you think I'll have that?

457
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:02,135
You think I'll have that, ya ponce?

458
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:06,222
All right, I'll make it easy.

459
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,725
God, you're fucking trying.

460
00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:12,770
Are you gonna do the job?

461
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:16,482
It's not a
difficult question. Yes or no?

462
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:19,819
- Don...
- Say it.

463
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:21,362
No.

464
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:26,034
Yes. Fuck off, wanker,
you're doin' it.

465
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:34,042
You know what I've noticed, Gal?
What stands out?

466
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:36,502
You haven't asked about anybody.

467
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:40,381
Everyone asks after you
"How's Gal? Heard from him?"

468
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:43,301
"No, not for a while."
"Is he all right?"

469
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:45,929
Leaves me wondering,
"Have I upset him?"

470
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:49,057
"Must have, I'll ask him."
Have I upset you?

471
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:51,059
- Course not.
- Meaning?

472
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:52,977
Well, you haven't.

473
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,897
You're British,
not a fucking Spaniard.

474
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:57,565
Don't kid yourself...

475
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:06,950
What's that?

476
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:10,411
It's a goat.

477
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:12,622
They're a fucking nuisance.

478
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:16,042
What's it lookin' at me for?

479
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,753
God, the steak was enormous!

480
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:22,799
Size of it. Couldn't finish it.

481
00:38:24,676 --> 00:38:27,387
And he were nice, weren't he?
The waiter.

482
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:31,557
Oh, yeah. Very attentive.

483
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:33,893
He liked you, Deedee, didn't he, Dee?

484
00:38:34,143 --> 00:38:38,606
- Liked you.
- He's got good taste.

485
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:41,859
Handsome, weren't he?
Bloody Adonis.

486
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,486
Wasn't expensive...

487
00:38:43,736 --> 00:38:47,782
You sound nice on the phone, Jack.

488
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:51,077
Nice telephone voice.

489
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:55,581
Sound like you work in an office.

490
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:01,629
- You ever worked in an office?
- No.

491
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:05,675
No?

492
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:09,846
Nice telephone voice.

493
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:13,975
I've worked in an office.

494
00:39:14,225 --> 00:39:15,643
I was 17.

495
00:39:15,893 --> 00:39:17,979
Does that surprise you?

496
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:22,024
What, that you were 17?

497
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:30,450
You got very nice eyes, Deedee.
Never noticed them before.

498
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,620
They real?

499
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:38,040
I'll get us all a drink, eh?

500
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:41,919
I'll give you a hand.

501
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:49,135
- He's staying the night.
- Have you told him?

502
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:51,012
Have you told him?!

503
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:54,432
- Yeah.
- And?

504
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:56,142
It's not that simple.

505
00:39:56,392 --> 00:39:59,896
Did you know he fucked Jackie?

506
00:40:00,146 --> 00:40:03,024
Yeah.

507
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:12,366
What the fuck was she playing at?

508
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:15,161
This is a fucking nightmare.

509
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:17,330
He's a fucking nightmare.

510
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,293
What happened?
What'd he say? You told him?

511
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:25,713
He knows.

512
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:08,315
Shouldn't have told him that.
Shouldn't have said anything.

513
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:10,818
Where? In the bar. About Jackie.

514
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:12,695
Jackie the Paki.

515
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:14,905
What, Gal? He's all right?

516
00:42:15,156 --> 00:42:18,242
Still, giving too much of
yourself away. Fucking mouth.

517
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:19,910
Best keep schtum.

518
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:22,413
Schtum schtum, quick quick, schtum.

519
00:42:22,663 --> 00:42:27,585
Big mouth
fucking big mouth Don, Don, Don.

520
00:42:45,936 --> 00:42:49,273
You all right, mate?

521
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,943
Don't look it.

522
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:57,031
Someone taking the piss, are they?

523
00:42:57,281 --> 00:43:00,409
Liberties?

524
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:04,622
What? That cunt through there?

525
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:07,875
What's he said to you?
It's all right, mate.

526
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,878
You can tell me.

527
00:43:11,128 --> 00:43:15,174
He said that?

528
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:17,259
Just like that? No...

529
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,345
That lump of shit said that?

530
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:21,430
Expects you to take that?

531
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,016
What, does he think you're a cunt?

532
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:29,605
I'll sort him out for you,
shall I? It's not a problem.

533
00:43:29,939 --> 00:43:33,525
Can't have that.

534
00:43:35,236 --> 00:43:37,196
Get up, you cunt!

535
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:40,491
- Lazy bastard!
- Get out of our room!

536
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:42,117
Get out, Don.

537
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:45,037
Get out!

538
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:46,872
I'll be downstairs.

539
00:43:47,122 --> 00:43:51,460
Unh... unh...
