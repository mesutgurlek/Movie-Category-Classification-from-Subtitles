Billy, are you all right?

Called themselves
the Flight Crew.

Brilliant.

Yeah, but they
were very stubborn.

A man...

36
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,620
has got to have all
of his parts to make it.

Don't you agree
with that, Billy?

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,300
Quite uneventful.

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,800

I'm not the only one
who just arrived.

How about your trip
to Berlin, Stick?

as you figured.

Now that, uh,
he's the big star,

I couldn't
reason with him.

95
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,070
He said
he was pulling out.

96
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,160
Then he
threatened me.

97
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,450
Oh, my, my, my, my.

98
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,830
Ha ha.

99
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,910
The rest of it
was in the papers.

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,920
That's when
he committed suicide, huh?

Ha ha ha.

102
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,050

103
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,670
and jumped
out the window.

Looks good.
Looks great.

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,040
Besides the gate
and our TV rights,

119
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,040
it's generating the kind
of international betting

120
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,670
we'd hoped for.

121
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,510
We ought to turn over
about $30 million.

122
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,430
That was the computer's
readout as of today.

123
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,300
Yes, well, the fight
is only 3 weeks off.

124
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,060
I assume
your training

125
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,770
is going well, Carl.
You look fit.

126
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,730
I'll be ready.

127

We've got a little
problem in Detroit,

128
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,690
a couple of reluctant
ball players.

129
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,440
Hakim, think you can fly
to Detroit and handle that

130
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,030
and be back in time
for the fight?

131
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,030
Figure. It's done, man.

132
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,530
Also, I'm afraid

133
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,790
we're going to have to do
something about Billy Lo.

134
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,990
I was wondering

135
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,080
about that.

136
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,080
I was going to ask
how that was going.

137
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, he refuses to sign
our management contract,

138
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,750
but that's not
what bothers me now.

139
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,540
He's starting
to shoot off his mouth.

140
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,050
He's holding out.

141
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,420
Dr. Land:
We've given him so many chances--

142
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,430
an amazing amount
of resistance.

143
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,590
And then there's
that girlfriend:

144
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,850
Ann Morris.

145
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,850
I went to talk
to her today.

146
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,520
Her last album
was on the charts

147
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,850
and is doing great

148
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,190
in Australia
and France.

149
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,850
She says she wants
to talk to Billy

150
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,190
about her contract
before she signs.

151
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,780
Doctor, I think we ought
to squeeze a little.

152
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,070
Dr. Land:
Yeah, let's just

153
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,860
squeeze a little,

154
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,200
wouldn't you say?

155
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,830
Billy?

156
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,450
Yeah.

157
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,040

from one
of those syndicate men.

159
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,540
Did he threaten you?

160
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,040
Well, not exactly.

161
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,420
I mean,
not in so many words,

162
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,050
but I knew
I was being threatened.

163
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,090
Billy, do you think
it's worth holding out?

164
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,590
I mean, I've heard

165
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,390
some pretty ugly things
about those guys,

166
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,640
ugly stories.

167
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,540
If we're stopped,
don't do anything

168
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,210
that will give them

169
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,170
an excuse
to hurt you.

170
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,060
Ann, I love you,

171
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,060
and I don't
want you hurt.

172
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,770
Trust me
to handle this.

173
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,110
Billy:
I would like Miss Morris to leave.

174
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,610
I'm afraid we can't
do that, Billy.

175
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,240
We're all
in this together.

176
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,780
Now, would you mind

177
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,570
stepping out
of the car?

178
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,580
No matter what happens,

179
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,950
don't get out of the car.

180
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,040
You've got until

181
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,800
tomorrow morning
to call us.

182
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,250
It's the last time

183
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,920
we're going to ask,
Billy.

184
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,510
Billy!

185
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,480
No!

186
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,790
Billy.

187
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,220
Hyah!

188
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,680
Please stop it!

189
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,240
Please don't!

190
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,320
Billy.

191
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,040
Billy!

192
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,760
He hasn't
got too much time.

193
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,220
You tell him that.

194
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,220
We want
to hear from him

195
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,640
in the morning.

196
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,540
Billy, I've always
been straight with you.

197
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,750
You don't have
too many choices.

198
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,340
You and Ann
are nothing to them.

199
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,920
You're just
another piece of property,

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,510
just one
of a couple of thousand

201
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,590
of public personalities
that they own all of

202
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,010
or a piece of.

203
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,390
It seems like
a good thing at the moment.

204
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,770
They take care
of everything--

205
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,060
your booking,

206
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,600
your salary, your taxes.

207
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,520
If you need 5, 000
in your pocket,

208
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,360
you've got it.

209
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,530
It's later

210
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,280
that you start to realize

211
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,950
what it's costing you.

212
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,120
I don't have to remind you
about Charlie Wang.

213
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,530
We know the pressure
they put on him,

214
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,200
and we know they
called him in for a "talk."

215
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,540
Hyah!

216
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,040
The next day,

217
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,960
he was fished
out of the harbor.

218
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,380
But going along with them
isn't much better.

219
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,130
You've come up
fast, Billy.

220
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,340
The pictures are grossing big
all over the world.

221
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,510
You're an international
celebrity,

222
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,840
and they smell
that money.

223
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,510
Thank you.

224
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,510
You can sign
with them

225
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,020
and live very well,
or you can defy them

226
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,690
and go
to the police,

227
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,020
which means you
won't live so well,

228
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,190
if at all.

229
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,440
Is it your advice
to let them own us?

230
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,030
No. I just

231
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,530
don't want to write
an obituary on you.

232
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,620
I like you too much,

233
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,120
which is my cue

234
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,870
to get my ass
down to the bureau.

235
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,580
I've got
a midnight deadline

236
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,040
for the States.

237
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,840
I can't allow it.

238
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,960
It is better to die
a broken piece of jade

239
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,550
than to live a life of clay.

240
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,340
Quit. You've got
enough money.

241
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,350
Tell them to go to hell.

242
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,390
Ann:
I can leave this all behind.

243
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,810
I don't
need this

244
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,350
if you
don't need it.

245
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,530
There has
to be another answer.

246
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,490
I've got to find one.

247
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,870
Ann:
The Chinese opera is in town.

248
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,250
Maybe see your uncle.

249
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,250
Yeah, he just got back.

250
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,420
I'll go to the theater tomorrow.
Good idea.

251
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,970
All three of them
are leaving the restaurant.

252
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,510
What should we do?

253
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,010
Dr. Land:
Don't lose them.

254
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,310
Steiner:
Alegandre, from now on,

255
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,730
I want you to coordinate

256
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,900
all your efforts with
the ad agency in New York.

257
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,780
And by the way, what are
the odds where you are now?

258
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,780
Well, then keep
the publicity going

259
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,450
about Carl's rumored
sprained ligament.

260
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,860
Don't give the impression

261
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,820
that the fight's
going to be canceled,

262
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,200
just that he's in pain

263
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,790
and might be
at a disadvantage.

264
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,000
You got that?

265
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,870
Ciao.

266
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,380
The odds are a little
too heavy on Carl,

267
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,340
especially in London.

268
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,840
Yes, a good idea
to even that up a bit.

269
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,720
Oh, by the way,

270
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,470
what about Billy Lo?

271
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,890
He was told to
call earlier today.

272
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,810
He has
the number to call.

273
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,140
Oh, do we know where
he is at this moment?

274
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,640
Well, we always know
where he is.

275
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,610
Well, then
a final warning,

276
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,730
Ok, Carl?

277
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,280
Yes, Pasqual.
You go with him.

[ Chuckling ]

279
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,030
Pasqual
loves to fight, yes.

280
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,040
Ha ha.

281
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,450
Let me use your brush.
Thanks.

282
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,450
Man:
Billy, good to see you.

283
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,460
Billy:
Hi, John. I'm glad you're back.

284
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,130
Your uncle
is in his room.

285
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,340
Billy. Come in, Billy.

286
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,390
Come in. Hey. Hey!

287
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,760
You go ahead.

288
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,810
It's good to see you, boy.
Sit down. Sit down.

[ Clears Throat ]

290
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,360
We do not see you much

291
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,610
since you got to be
a big man.

292
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,110
Oh, yes, I know.

293
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,650
I've been running
for months.

294
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,570
Yeah, very busy, huh?

295
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,580
I heard that the syndicate
is after you.

296
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,790
You must be a big man.

297
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,410
How did you
know that?

298
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,370
It's
a small business.

299
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,880
I can't join them,

300
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,750
and I can't
be forced to join.

301
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,920
You have just
described a problem

302
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,420
as old as man.

303
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,880
You're not unique.

304
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,430
There is a solution

305
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,930
I do not think
you've considered.

306
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,430
When you get to the top,

307
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,440
you understand
how far it is to fall,

308
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,940
but if you think
very little of yourself,

309
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,940
then you can be pushed off

310
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,570
and fall very easily.

311
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,450
What is your opinion
of yourself?.

312
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,660
I believe I deserve
to be where I am.

313
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,870
I've worked
hard for it.

314
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,410
Then don't let them push.

315
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,580
They will never
let you rest.

316
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,960
You push.

317
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,000
You mean kill?

318
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,920
Integrity can be
an expensive thing.

319
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,470
What is the price
of your integrity?

320
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,510
What are you
willing to pay?

321

There is another
person as well,

322
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,020
a girl.

323

If I fight,
she may be hurt.

No.

Have you talked
to them?

995
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:21,466
Just now.
They want an exchange--

996
01:11:21,556 --> 01:11:23,676
you for her,
even up,

997
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:25,176
or so they say.

998
01:11:25,266 --> 01:11:27,686
You could go
to the police.

999
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:29,186
No. That would

1000
01:11:29,266 --> 01:11:30,686
just get her
killed.

1001
01:11:30,766 --> 01:11:32,896
What do they
want me to do?

1002

You better go over there

across the street.
