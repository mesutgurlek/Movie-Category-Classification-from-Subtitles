1
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,958
Here you go. Thank you.

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,936
I'll be right back with your order.

3
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,868
Good morning, Bill.

4
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,918
Let me guess. Pancakes, side of bacon.

5
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,252
Who's dying? Come on, pick it up.

6
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,456
Phil, Big Papa, please? I need 15.

7
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,957
I love it when you call me Big Papa.

8
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,931
Hey, you're up early today.

9
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,799
Okay, you're good to go.

10
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,203
Is this yours?

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,438
Does that line ever work?

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,410
What's the problem here?

13
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,613
It's hot!

14
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,193
Here you go.

15
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,525
Sorry.

16
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:51,005
Why not? My grandfather was a lawyer.
Plus, I have a logical mind.

17
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:56,079
And you're only, like, what?
$299,000 short of what you need for law school?

18
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,909
-Piece of cake.
-Piece of pie.

19
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,851
Piece of ass. So what would you do?

20
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,457
-I don't know.
-Liar.

21
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,419
You know, I was thinking
I could go back to school full-time.

22
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,790
And quit here? I won't allow it, Slim.

23
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,034
-Careful, it's hot.
-Sorry, sir.

24
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,071
-Ever try the Roc?
-What?

25
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,900
It's the deodorant thing.
It's like salts or something.

26
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:30,305
You rub it on your pits.
It looks like some kind of hippie crystal.

27
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,247
-Are you saying I sweat?
-No, you just....

28
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,915
-Do I smell?
-No. God....

29
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,553
-Ladies?
-Okay. Your turn.

30
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,326
I'm sweating too much.

31
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,662
You waiting for somebody?

32
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,471
-Something to drink?
-Just water, thanks.

33
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,807
I'll give you a minute to look at the menu.

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,111
That's okay. I was in here yesterday, Slim.

35
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,682
-What's your real name?
-No.

36
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,924
I like it. Don't you think
it's kind of negative, though?

37
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,721
No, I don't tell my name.

38
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,022
Okay.

39
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:22,130
Give me the soup, turkey burger,
coleslaw, couple of extra slices of tomato.

40
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,328
I write books. Do you read books?
What are you reading now?

41
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,608
You know Finnegans Wake by James Joyce?

42
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,140
My friend told me it's the hardest book
in the English language.

43
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,448
I mean, not the hardest,
but the hardest one that you can actually read.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,781
I thought to myself, if I can get through it,
I could probably read the rest.

45
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,189
-How long have you been reading it?
-Six years.

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,152
I'll be back with your soup.

47
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,062
-He likes you.
-He's a dick.

48
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,869
-He was in here yesterday, you know?
-I know.

49
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:03,807
Now he's back today, he brought a rose,
he pulls you into conversation.

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,843
Okay, so he likes me.

51
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,811
-So, do you like him?
-I don't know him.

52
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,346
What's that got to do with anything?
He's a major piece of cake, piece of pie.

53
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,047
Trust me, okay? He's carrot cake.

54
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,020
And when a guy like that,
who's actually cuter than you, likes you....

55
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:25,929
He's cuter than me?

56
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,127
Face it, no one will ever go for you
because of your looks.

57
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,202
That sucks, because my personality bites.

58
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,632
Cup of soup.

59
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,714
You don't really write books, do you?

60
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:43,912
No.

61
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,349
I haven't really been reading
Finnegans Wake either.

62
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,219
I'm going into law...

63
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:51,949
...enforcement.

64
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,492
Who's the rose for?

65
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,958
Enjoy your grub.

66
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,156
Hey!

67
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,828
You.

68
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,605
How much did you settle on?

69
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,181
Excuse me?

70
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,252
The bet. How much is it?

71
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,990
You and your friend, yesterday, was it $200?

72
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,930
Was it $500? What was it?

73
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:35,956
What?

74
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,466
He bet his friend...

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,241
...that he could get into your pants
by noon tomorrow.

76
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,178
Is this your business?
Are you the morals police?

77
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,545
Take it easy, man. I was just having some fun.

78
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,579
What was it? $200 or $500?

79
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,853
I want to know what I'm worth.

80
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,626
The bet was for $200.

81
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,730
But now that I know you...

82
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,930
...way too high.

83
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,531
Don't come back here again...

84
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:15,908
...ever.

85
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,849
I'm sorry to get in your business.

86
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,485
No. Thanks.

87
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,157
I can't believe you actually said something.

88
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,487
I'd have felt bad about it...

89
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,485
...if I'd have kept quiet.

90
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,831
Good luck.

91
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,836
Please tell me, Phil, as Mitch was rather vague...

92
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,442
...is her father dead, too?

93
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,640
Well, he is to her.
He left when she was maybe two or three.

94
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,984
-Then I'm happy to pay for the wedding.
-Yes, we're very happy.

95
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,826
You sure you love me?

96
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,621
Forever and ever?

97
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,725
You're safe with me, Slim.

98
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:54,495
You're safe, and it's okay to be happy.
We deserve it.

99
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,743
-Wait, so this was during or after college?
-During.

100
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,243
What's wrong with you?

101
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,158
No, I mean, why did you and Slim break up?

102
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,788
I'm terrible in bed.

103
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,463
Plus, she had to drop out,
some money problems...

104
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,025
...and so we kind of evolved into being friends.

105
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,201
What do you think?

106
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,778
Can I take you home right now?

107
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,985
If you've got a sense of humor.

108
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,482
My kids are out for tonight--

109
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,689
I live in Seattle.
Women always want the possibility of long-term.

110
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,221
I didn't just propose.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,230
I just thought that maybe we could...

112
00:08:56,302 --> 00:09:00,500
...have a brief,
totally unsatisfying sexual encounter.

113
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,473
I'm your guy.

114
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,310
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

115
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,918
...but I've got to get up at 5:00 in the morning
to buy green beans.

116
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,149
Now...

117
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,626
...l know you don't need it,
but it's tradition in my family...

118
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,762
-...to give money to the groom.
-That's sweet.

119
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,996
Thank you, Phil.
And thank you for giving me away today.

120
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,299
You're the best substitute father a girl ever had.

121
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,905
No substitute. I'm the real thing.

122
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,774
Thank you.

123
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,185
He really loves you.

124
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,050
Yeah.

125
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,421
You gonna give me babies, Slim?

126
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,057
Yeah.

127
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,489
How soon?

128
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,233
How soon can we get out of here?

129
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,509
-Hi.
-Hello.

130
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,211
We've been driving around...

131
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,710
...and my wife has fallen completely in love
with your house.

132
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,949
Yes, it's great, isn't it?

133
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,519
We want to buy it. She wants it for our family.

134
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,200
-Well, it's.... We're not selling.
-Sure you are.

135
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,269
That's the price.

136
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,906
Don't worry, it's well over market.

137
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,780
-You're out of your mind.
-I know, that's just it.

138
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,081
So before you say no again...

139
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,613
...think how miserable one determined,
crazy person can make you.

140
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,484
Miserable today, tomorrow,
pretty much every day, until the day you sell.

141
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,558
Your kids are grown,
you'll be happier in a smaller place.

142
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,215
Parker, how are you? How's the jump shot?

143
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,821
Mitch!

144
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,384
-Not now, sweetie.
-It's Slim.

145
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,657
Give me a second. Yeah?

146
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,058
What?

147
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,367
Hey, Parker!
Parker, give me a ride to the hospital.

148
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,474
Look after the client.

149
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,358
She looks just like my baby pictures.

150
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,159
Don't you?

151
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:20,863
Who was that?

152
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,843
I don't know. Who cares?
Some construction thing.

153
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,106
Bring her here. Let me see.

154
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,909
That's my baby, that's my baby.

155
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,028
What do you got there?

156
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,096
Okay. Let's put it out here.

157
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,430
What's that one?

158
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,184
Hey.

159
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,524
Hey.

160
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,393
Should I join you?

161
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,298
No. I'm about to get out.

162
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,341
I'm just showering to wake myself up.
I got to go back to work.

163
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,442
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

164
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,878
Me, too.

165
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,828
Hi, darling. Where are you?

166
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,402
You just paged my husband, right?

167
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,007
Oh, my God.

168
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,600
Mitch?

169
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,544
Who are you? What's your name?

170
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,008
I'm so sorry, l--

171
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,710
No, it's too late to deny it now.

172
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,918
-Your name?
-I have to go.

173
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,856
Don't hang up. Don't be a coward.

174
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,990
Just tell me your name.

175
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,068
That's the least you could do, don't you think?

176
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,834
I'm Darcelle. I'm very sorry.

177
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,753
Hey.

178
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,765
She paged you.

179
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,229
Who?

180
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,770
Number 33. Darcelle.

181
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,784
I guess you're late.

182
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,683
She's French?

183
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,890
-She's not important.
-No?

184
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,058
-You're important.
-Yeah.

185
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,065
And Gracie.

186
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,733
I must be brain-dead.

187
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,136
I must be the biggest moron on the planet
because I thought we were happy.

188
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,673
Were we happy?

189
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,606
And I used to think we were so lucky.

190
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,673
And I thought in bed we were still....

191
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,842
-Slim, please.
-No.

192
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,288
-You said I was safe with you.
-You are.

193
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,854
You are. I promise.

194
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,856
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,194
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

196
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,937
Everything is going to be okay.

197
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,357
-I can smell her.
-What?

198
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,052
Her perfume.

199
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,228
-Darcelle, or whoever.
-We just had a drink.

200
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,393
Stop it!

201
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:28,632
You're caught! I caught you!
And you won't talk your way out of this.

202
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,569
How many, Mitch?

203
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,373
How many are there?
How many have there been?

204
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,048
What does it matter?

205
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:46,449
It's not that our sex life hasn't been good.
It's been great, Slim. But I'm a man.

206
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,427
Men and women have different needs...

207
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,763
...and that's okay. Darcelle's....

208
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:58,093
She's willing to take care of that,
and maybe that's better for everybody.

209
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,870
It's better for you!

210
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,066
You have a pretty good deal, don't you?

211
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:07,841
You go out, you fool around!
I sit here, take care of your house and kid.

212
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,070
Well, no more, Mitch!

213
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,484
That's it! The party is over!

214
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,042
-Calm down.
-I won't do this anymore.

215
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:19,220
I won't sit here and take it, and take it, and take it.

216
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,051
Sorry! I love you, yes.

217
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,863
But I am not a doormat!
I'm your wife. I'm your wife.

218
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:31,029
And you cannot do this to me!
You cannot do this to me anymore.

219
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,877
What? I can't hit you?

220
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,446
No, you can't.

221
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,456
You want to fight?

222
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,923
I'm a man, honey, it's no contest.

223
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,585
You have to understand, and I thought you did.

224
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:03,659
I make the money here,
so I set the rules, right? It's my rules.

225
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,634
You're with me?

226
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,736
It's your rules.

227
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,564
Yeah.

228
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,841
-And what if I don't like the rules?
-If you don't like them?

229
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,678
Come on, sweetie,
life isn't just stuff we like, is it?

230
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,450
We have to take the good with the bad.

231
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,886
That's what marriage is.

232
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,756
So, for you, maybe today is a bad day.
Tomorrow may be great.

233
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,331
Tomorrow will be great.

234
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:39,926
Yeah.

235
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,004
Today...

236
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,872
...is the price you pay for having such a good life.

237
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,107
I'm going to go out.

238
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,951
This will be better, don't you think?

239
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,456
I don't have to sneak around
and pretend I'm going to work. I can say:

240
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:03,553
"I'm going to Darcelle's.
I'll be back in a few hours."

241
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,677
Just so you don't do anything later
you might regret. Okay?

242
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,894
Who are you calling?

243
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,422
Your mother.

244
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,800
What will you tell her?

245
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,869
I was supposed to bring Gracie by tomorrow,
so I better cancel.

246
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,702
You know, love is a scary thing.

247
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,370
How powerful it is, what it does to you.

248
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,745
That is what happened here.

249
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,211
See, if I ever think of....

250
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,421
I just.... I can't....

251
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,129
I refuse to live without you.

252
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,233
I think you understand what I'm saying.

253
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,589
Hey, you're late.

254
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:15,757
Where have you been? You are late.
I was worried you weren't coming at all.

255
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,053
No Gracie?

256
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,597
We will have a regular girls' luncheon...

257
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,331
...and we will gossip about absolutely everybody.

258
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,907
My poor baby. My God.

259
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,672
Honey, I am so sorry.

260
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,782
What did you do? What did you say to him?

261
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,827
Men are like land mines.

262
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,965
Some you trigger the first week,
others it's years in.

263
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,502
The problem is you want a man-man.

264
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:05,673
Meaning his veins run thick with testosterone,
which is good.

265
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,074
But then he can turn around
without any warning and...

266
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:10,837
...hit you.

267
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,080
I'm not this person.

268
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,812
I'm not a person whose husband beats her up.

269
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,454
I know.

270
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,358
What do I do?

271
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:31,867
You got to go to the cops.

272
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:39,573
He's the father of my child, okay?
I will not put him in jail!

273
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,137
Hold on. I'm sorry.

274
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,750
I'm sorry, okay? Sit down. Relax for a second.

275
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:54,658
I'm just saying that either you endure this...

276
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,560
...and you live it out like you're
in some goddamn country western song...

277
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,995
...or you take the kid,
you take Gracie and you get out.

278
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,337
Mrs. Hiller, how are you? Your husband got her.

279
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,944
I must've forgotten.

280
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,282
Gracie was totally psyched.
I told him he should do it more often.

281
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,858
Mitch!

282
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,634
Toots!

283
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,365
Gracie!

284
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,502
Is that my little croissant?

285
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,534
No, it's your loaf of bread.

286
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,509
Oh, hi. How is it going?

287
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,211
-Where are you?
-Zoo.

288
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,981
-Why didn't you tell me--
-I called you at home, left messages.

289
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,409
Hey, Daddy.

290
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,786
-Come here.
-It's your mom, honey.

291
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,381
Mom, the elephants are peeing.

292
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,350
She's a little excited.

293
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:40,922
Hey, Dad, here. Come here. Look at the giraffe.

294
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,726
So, when are you guys going to be home?

295
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:51,533
I don't know. I'll take her for a pony ride,
maybe get a cotton candy.

296
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,111
You want a cotton candy, honey?

297
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,877
-I'll see you later.
-'Bye, Mommy.

298
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,058
Made me nervous
when I couldn't reach you today.

299
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,227
I thought you were going to cancel
with my mother.

300
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,066
And you have to go crying to the old gang
at the greasy spoon.

301
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,006
Whatever happened to privacy?

302
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,146
I guess it's dead, along with chivalry and fidelity.

303
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,380
Tell me.

304
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,113
Do you have any idea...

305
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,352
...how bad things can get?

306
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,152
Educate me.

307
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:49,458
Slim, I'm a determined man.
I was determined to have you, and I did.

308
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,337
This house, my company....

309
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,269
I am and always will be a person
who gets what he wants.

310
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,075
And I still want you.

311
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,786
You can either accept that...

312
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,915
...or you can fight it.
Which way do you want to go?

313
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,188
I want to be happy.

314
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:23,894
Good.

315
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,916
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

316
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,613
I have a friend whose husband beats her up.

317
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,792
She should come in here and file a complaint.

318
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,689
If she has physical evidence of abuse
on her person...

319
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,594
...we'll go out and arrest him.

320
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:59,603
-If he has money, he can bail himself out.
-That's true.

321
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:03,771
-Then he's free till it goes to trial.
-If it goes to trial.

322
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,302
It's up to the city's attorney's office
whether to prosecute.

323
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:08,402
Okay, so...

324
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,677
...she comes in here, she has him arrested...

325
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,345
...and pisses him off...

326
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,115
...then there's no guarantee
that he won't come after her once he's out.

327
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,986
She could get a protection order.

328
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,391
What's that? A little piece of paper
that says he can't come around?

329
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,960
And when he comes around,
what does she do, throw it at him?

330
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,992
She calls us.

331
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,668
And what about the kid? ls the....

332
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:40,343
-Is the paper good for the kid, too?
-There's a child involved?

333
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,878
That's a matter for the family courts.

334
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,179
But unless she can prove
that he's a danger to the child...

335
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,446
...she can't legally bar him access. Miss! Miss!

336
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,878
-Maybe she didn't hear the signal.
-No, she heard it.

337
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:21,968
No.

338
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,039
I think maybe Teddy is right.

339
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,582
Maybe she could still be sleeping.

340
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,922
She's not sleeping, okay, Phil?
She's coming any second.

341
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,740
Okay, do it again.

342
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:56,266
Put her down.

343
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,909
We should go in.

344
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,235
It'd be crazy if we woke him up.

345
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,683
Plus, she's going to flick the lights
if anything is wrong.

346
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,742
-Right?
-Yeah.

347
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,019
Another step and you're dead.

348
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,562
Oh, my God!

349
00:33:56,567 --> 00:34:00,298
You don't understand.
You've broken into our house.

350
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,601
She's alive.

351
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:06,439
The lights are out. I can't see who you are.
I could kill you free and clear.

352
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,543
Sir, please.

353
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,550
-Where's Gracie?
-She's here.

354
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:17,418
We are happy to leave, Mitch,
with Slim and Miss Gracie.

355
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,720
And make no mistake. If you keep them here,
we will go straight to the police...

356
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:27,497
...who will surely arrest you
with a great deal of pleasure.

357
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,995
I don't want to say this in front of the group...

358
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,172
...but you are just a rug head.

359
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,166
If you go to the cops,
it will be her word against mine.

360
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,843
And they will find drugs in her bureau
or her car, or whatever.

361
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,779
Trust me on that. I'll have custody of Gracie
by the end of the week.

362
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,883
No. Help me. I got to get her out of here.

363
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,392
Enough with her. Get out.

364
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,530
Wake up, baby. Wake up. Look at your papa.

365
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,331
We're going for a little ride. Look at your papa.

366
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,702
Help them up. Get the bag.

367
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,601
-Look at your papa.
-I'll see you soon.

368
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,040
'Bye, sweetie.

369
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,386
And she's tied up because...

370
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:31,321
...once a mean guy got her, tied her up....

371
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,056
Could be a broken rib.

372
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,891
You could play with her ears.

373
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,124
Flicks her ears out.

374
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,269
At least it's not my face this time.

375
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,130
Where are we going?

376
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,832
-Hospital.
-No.

377
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,043
-I'm fine.
-You are not.

378
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,777
-Where to, Phil?
-Hospital.

379
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:52,509
I don't want to take her to the ER
in the middle of the night.

380
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,516
She needs someplace safe where she can sleep.

381
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,555
We could go to my house.

382
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,991
No. He knows where you live.

383
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,527
He knows where we all live.

384
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,622
Yeah.

385
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,443
-One queen-size bed is all right?
-Yeah, it's just me and my daughter.

386
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:36,225
I'm sorry. This card has been refused.
Would you like to try another?

387
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,876
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hiller.
The funds in your account seem to be frozen.

388
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,746
-I love motels.
-Me, too.

389
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,484
-Hotels, too.
-Yeah, more potato.

390
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:14,057
-I'm going to bounce on the bed.
-Okay, toots. Be careful.

391
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,496
-Hello.
-Hey, there.

392
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,200
-Not too high.
-What?

393
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,636
I'm talking to Gracie.

394
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,838
We're watching some TV,
getting ready to hit the sack.

395
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,669
Look, Mom.

396
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,014
-What about what we talked about?
-No. No shelters.

397
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,653
She hasn't been tainted by anything so far...

398
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:43,592
-...and I want to keep it that way.
-Okay. I understand.

399
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,789
-Can we talk about this tomorrow?
-Piece of cake.

400
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,898
Piece of pie. 'Bye.

401
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,104
Come on, toots. Ready for bed.

402
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,271
What's "tainted"? ls that like "painted"?

403
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:09,175
-Gin, I said tomorrow, okay?
-Not exactly the Biltmore, is it?

404
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:14,624
It's the information age, sweetheart.
You leave a trail everywhere.

405
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:18,126
Especially when your best friend
rents your room with her credit card.

406
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:21,926
I had to do that since someone froze
all my accounts, right?

407
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,700
-We need to talk.
-No, we don't.

408
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,958
Please.

409
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,064
If we do this the hard way,
you know who will suffer.

410
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,109
I'm not talking about you, honey.
I mean Gracie.

411
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:36,406
You don't want her touched or affected
by something bad or undesirable.

412
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,971
-What?
-"Tainted, " right?

413
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,314
That's what tainted means.

414
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,967
-Who's banging on the door?
-I don't know.

415
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,934
Why? What's going on?

416
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,373
-Mom, I'm scared.
-It will be okay, baby.

417
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,015
Slim!

418
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,392
Hold the bus!

419
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:31,957
Hold the bus!

420
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,743
Go, go, go!

421
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,610
Open the door. Open it.

422
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,018
Los Angeles-Seattle?

423
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:03,795
That fare is $409 round trip.
How would you like to pay for that?

424
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,297
Cash.

425
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:17,509
I always thought you'd come back here with me,
but not eight years later.

426
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,482
Well, if I had known how pretty it was....

427
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,716
This place really sparkles!

428
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,450
You know what they call it? The Emerald City.

429
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,782
Isn't that where Dorothy is?

430
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,795
No, sweetie,
that's where Dorothy goes in her dream.

431
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,958
Where is she when she wakes up?

432
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,593
Back in Kansas.

433
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,172
-All right, game time. Duck your heads.
-Pigeon poop.

434
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,890
Why did you come to me?

435
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,064
I tried to think of the last time that I felt safe.

436
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,396
Then I saw your face.

437
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,442
And, I wanted a place that...

438
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,404
...M-l-T-C-H wouldn't think of.

439
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,045
-And someone who was stupid enough to do it.
-Yeah.

440
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,490
-Anybody here like hot fudge sundaes?
-Yeah.

441
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,982
I do. I do.

442
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,404
Yeah.

443
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,284
-FBl. Can we talk?
-Go ahead.

444
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:07,015
Would you mind opening up?
I'm investigating a kidnapping.

445
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,683
I'd like to look around.

446
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:14,992
You got a warrant?

447
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,111
-You letting us in or not?
-Hold on a second.

448
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,988
Can I see the warrant?

449
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,234
Watch the front.

450
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,640
Who are you looking for?

451
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,920
Mister, unless you leave right now,
I'm calling the police.

452
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,597
Jeez, that's a scary thought.

453
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,867
I married a cop.
I don't need their bullshit right now.

454
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,974
That's enough. Do you hear me?
It's time to go. Now!

455
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,816
You're not FBl, okay. I know who hired you.

456
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,112
Do you know what it's like
to have a knife hit your carotid?

457
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,281
No.

458
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,918
Do you know what it's like to die
because you're really stupid?

459
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,963
No, I really don't.

460
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,522
John boy.

461
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,492
This is not listed on the program.

462
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,036
They're not here. Let's ride.

463
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,366
-Can't I just--
-No!

464
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,502
Not today.

465
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,777
Your phone.

466
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:52,919
'Night, John boy.

467
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,962
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I needed a shave anyway.

468
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,089
I'm sorry.

469
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,091
-I shouldn't be here.
-Sure you should.

470
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,032
No.

471
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:43,996
-I can't keep putting people I love in danger.
-What danger? They killed my sofa.

472
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,910
-Hello.
-Joe. This is Mitch Hiller.

473
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,008
It's him.

474
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,090
Hello. How are you?

475
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,086
I assume Slim's called you?

476
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:06,393
Yeah. Of course.

477
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,527
Could you give her a message?

478
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:12,033
-If she calls back again, I mean?
-I don't know.

479
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,570
I'm on her side, not yours.

480
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,428
Her side.

481
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,232
What did you expect, Mitch? Really?

482
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,169
Come on, Joe. You're a smart guy.

483
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,505
Let me say two words to you, okay?

484
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,413
Lug nuts.

485
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,948
You don't want to worry they are loose
every time you pull on the freeway.

486
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,788
How about the windows in your apartment?
Are they still locked?

487
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,887
Person could go crazy
thinking about stuff like that.

488
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,369
-You think those thugs are coming back?
-It doesn't make any difference.

489
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,908
Sure it does.

490
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,638
You don't have to go.
They're not coming back tonight.

491
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:00,216
You know that it is not safe for you
if I stay here.

492
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:05,145
You can come back any time.
Tomorrow, the next day.

493
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,555
Maybe I'll take you up on that one day.

494
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,461
Where will you go? What will you do?

495
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:35,715
Jupiter, girl out there says she's your daughter.
She insists on seeing you.

496
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,226
She can't possibly be my daughter.
I haven't had sex since 1995.

497
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,629
Not in this country, at least.

498
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,693
Not her. Me.

499
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:52,992
I'm your daughter.

500
00:47:56,974 --> 00:48:00,671
-What year were you born?
-You are my father, Jupiter.

501
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:05,409
I wrote you, like, 20 times.
But even when Mom died you didn't answer.

502
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:10,249
-I didn't have enough money to bury her.
-Don't blame me. I didn't kill her.

503
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,047
No. You had help.

504
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,383
That's a stupid thing to say.

505
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,820
What do you want? Money?

506
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,589
I wanted Gracie to meet her grandpa.

507
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,658
Hi.

508
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,000
And, yes, we need money to survive.

509
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,170
Look, sweetheart...

510
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:40,449
...from 1968-1972, I had five kids. Maybe more.

511
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:45,515
Half the people in that room could be my kid.
It's a running joke around here.

512
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:50,189
How will you feel when you wake up one day
and find out your daughter is dead?

513
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,726
And you didn't do anything to help?

514
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,665
You're good. The kid's a sweet touch, too.

515
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:02,336
But you're not the first to think of this gig
since that Fortune article.

516
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:06,368
So I'll give you the same thing
I gave the other three.

517
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:11,105
$6. Enough to buy a sandwich.
But for you, I'll make it $12.

518
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,944
Make sure you buy the kid a sandwich, too.

519
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:21,116
I believe this originally belonged to you.

520
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:25,417
Pawn it, since you're so hard up.
I'm sure it's worth more than $12.

521
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,319
Mommy, don't cry.

522
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,723
Please don't cry.

523
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,585
Mommy!

524
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:39,733
This way.

525
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,247
I'm sorry. This is the best we can do.

526
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,890
It's okay. We're fine. Thanks.

527
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,925
Who are all these people?

528
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,760
They're kind of friends of friends of Phil.

529
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,172
What is it?

530
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,846
It's food, okay?

531
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,469
Hi, I lost my birth certificate.

532
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,284
This is for you. Phil sent it.

533
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,852
Are you surprised?

534
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,422
Sure, we take care of you. All right?

535
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:16,529
Dear Slim:

536
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,200
Yesterday three men threatened to kill me
if I helped you in any way.

537
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,305
Fortunately for you, this aroused my interest.

538
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,107
But she may also be....

539
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:30,544
I'm sending this to an old address,
the diner where you worked.

540
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:33,644
If this reaches you and you need more...

541
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,183
...leave word at my office. Jupiter.

542
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,167
What do we think? We like it here?

543
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:33,834
-Why? Are we moving again?
-No. We just--

544
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,103
Good.

545
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:39,308
Because I'm sick and tired to death of moving.

546
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,549
Me, too. So here's the deal.

547
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:47,249
You can call me Mom or you can call me Erin,
but you cannot call me Slim.

548
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,115
I never call you Slim.

549
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,191
I know, but just in case
somebody asks you someday--

550
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,264
I don't think you are that slim.

551
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:57,796
Thanks a lot.

552
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:04,902
-Do I get a new name, too?
-I guess. If you want one.

553
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,373
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

554
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,805
-Hi. Betty?
-Yes?

555
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:13,671
-I'm Erin Shleeter. I called you.
-Yes, I remember.

556
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,377
This is my daughter.

557
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,516
Look at you. You are so.... What's your name?

558
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,321
Queen Elizabeth.

559
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,822
Welcome, Queen Elizabeth.
You'll have a good time here.

560
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:28,693
May I call you "Queen" for short?

561
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:34,568
I like talking to Grandma, but every Sunday...

562
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:38,737
...do we have to drive for 55 hours...

563
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,806
...just to reach some phone booth?

564
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:46,073
-Can I call Daddy this time?
-No.

565
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:49,016
Please? Please?

566
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,015
Don't beg. You look like a dog.

567
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,291
You know he has friends
in the police department...

568
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:03,628
...and you're depriving him of his rights
as a father, nonsense like that.

569
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,394
It's leading up to a big custody hearing.

570
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,868
What are you saying?

571
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:12,033
Talk to him. Calm him down.
Call him before he does something stupid.

572
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,736
It might help if he talked to Gracie...

573
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:20,148
...for her sake, too.
It's not healthy to be without a father.

574
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,114
We better keep this short. I'll call you next week.

575
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,553
Wait. I want to speak to Gracie--

576
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,233
Hi, Daddy. We're having a great vacation.

577
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,525
Where?

578
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:44,229
We've been everywhere. Chicago and--

579
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:47,109
No questions, okay? Or it ends now.

580
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:52,711
Listen, bitch. She's my daughter, too.
Don't tell me how I can talk to her.

581
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:56,712
Put me back on the phone with Gracie.
Give her the damn phone.

582
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,749
Tell Daddy that you love him and say goodbye.

583
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,321
Gracie, you there, honey? Sweetheart, talk to me.

584
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:06,327
'Bye, Daddy.

585
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,729
Honey, I'm sorry, baby.
Daddy didn't mean to use bad words.

586
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,061
-I'm really, really sad.
-Graciel

587
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,997
I'm sorry, kid. It was my mistake.

588
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,777
Mommy's just a big dummy.

589
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,082
What do you think?

590
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:38,386
-Her voice?
-Yeah, she sounds the same.

591
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:41,656
Good. 'Cause if she's changed her appearance--

592
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,164
Thanks, John.

593
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:49,134
I remember her. I told you.
The diner. The scam.

594
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:53,265
I don't remember why you broke the rules
and decided to marry the bitch.

595
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,101
She's not a bitch.

596
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,272
Sorry.

597
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,639
She is a waitress.

598
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,719
-What does that mean?
-Means she's stupid.

599
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,514
-Call your mother. Now to call you.
-She's not stupid.

600
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:12,391
She thinks if the calls are short
they can't be traced.

601
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:16,626
I still want to know.
With all the girls that we pulled that on, why her?

602
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:18,965
Maybe it's love.

603
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,001
Yeah.

604
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:25,234
I know what that means.
If you were smart, you'd forget her.

605
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:29,072
I can't simply forget her. She kidnapped my kid.

606
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:33,446
How many times do I have to go there?
It's not kidnapping.

607
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:37,578
Kidnapping is when someone
who isn't the mother takes the kid.

608
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:40,282
When the mother takes the kid,
it's called parenting.

609
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:42,050
How soon can you get there?

610
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,956
I don't know.
You know, I could lose my job for this.

611
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,319
Robbie...

612
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:53,892
...you could lose your job for all the jobs
you're doing besides doing your job.

613
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,928
-You know what I mean?
-You got to be reasonable.

614
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,973
-I know some guys in Detroit.
-Like your guys in Seattle?

615
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,475
I don't think so. I know what they're like.

616
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,844
They've never met her, never heard her voice.

617
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,810
She'll spot them and run
before they even see her.

618
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,056
It's you, Robbie.

619
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,092
It's you...

620
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:19,525
...or it's you.

621
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,501
What do you think? ls it okay?

622
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,829
It's okay, right?

623
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,635
No, it's not. It's horrible.

624
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,472
It's not horrible, Mom.

625
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,238
Yeah, but it's not good, is it?

626
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,972
Mom, you tasted it.

627
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,306
You know what I think?

628
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:08,908
No, what's that?

629
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:11,676
I think you miss Daddy.

630
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,346
Daddy yells at me, toots.

631
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,547
Well, you miss somebody.

632
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,770
There he is.

633
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,298
Joe! Joe!

634
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:40,770
-Joe!
-Joe!

635
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,443
Joe! Joe, over here!

636
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,882
Hey! How are you?

637
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:57,015
You're lucky I like you.
This is the most preposterous trip I've ever taken.

638
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,519
Change your plane. Rent a car.

639
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:04,121
Let's do it.

640
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:25,083
You guys hungry as I am?

641
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,503
-Seems like she's doing great.
-Yeah.

642
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,000
How about you? You okay?

643
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:50,005
Cut off from everybody,
can't talk to your friends....

644
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,041
Gracie is safe.

645
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,545
So Mitch is....

646
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,087
-When is this custody thing?
-Couple of months.

647
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,849
Anyway, they favor the mother, so....

648
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:06,892
Yeah, they do.

649
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,727
But he has a lot of money, and a lot of lawyers.

650
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:15,403
That's kind of what I mean.
I mean, you can't run forever, Slim.

651
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,735
Why not? I'm good at it.

652
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:22,911
You are. But, then again,
you're good at everything.

653
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:36,020
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you criticizing me or flirting with me?

654
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,523
Let me get back to you on that.

655
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:43,655
-Hi, Gracie. Is that your ball?
-Yes.

656
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,227
You want to see a trick?

657
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,698
Yeah.

658
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,804
I don't hear the basketball. Do you?

659
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:58,643
She was just....

660
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:00,604
Gracie!

661
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:03,774
Gracie!

662
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:07,853
Gracie! I mean, Queen!

663
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:11,292
Mommy! Mommy! Watch my new trick!

664
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,389
Didn't I tell you to stay close?

665
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:19,623
Come on.

666
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,730
Do you remember the house rules?

667
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,424
Who can forget, with Gracie here?

668
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,470
Joe.

669
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,950
-What would have happened if we--
-Don't.

670
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,051
It's wrong to think like that.

671
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,387
-Why?
-Because of Gracie.

672
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,854
She's truly a great kid.

673
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:26,292
Any path that doesn't include her
doesn't make any sense.

674
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,569
Ginny told me about that weekend.

675
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,103
Of your wedding?

676
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,537
Did she tell you how terrible I was?

677
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:43,311
Joe, that might work with other people,
but you forget. I've had you.

678
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,915
I didn't forget.

679
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:51,624
And I'm telling you from experience...

680
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:54,495
...you're not that bad.

681
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:02,670
-Do you have to go tomorrow?
-Yeah.

682
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:07,308
Why? Why can't you quit your job
and come here...

683
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,337
...and play the horses,
and become independently wealthy?

684
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:15,478
Please, kiss me, Slim.

685
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,548
I know we're not supposed to,
and it's against house rules.

686
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,920
But for me to come all this way
and feel the way I do--

687
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,180
You're a great person, Slim.

688
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,951
You're a great person. Just like your daughter.

689
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:15,538
Can I get a chocolate kiss?

690
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,348
-Who wants to put two eggs in.
-I want to put the eggs.

691
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:22,446
Careful.

692
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,254
I want you back.

693
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,485
No.

694
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,691
-It could be just like it was.
-No!

695
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,202
That's pretty stupid. You know why?

696
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:33,004
Because if I can't have you, nobody will.

697
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:39,839
Like that jerk who was here with you.
He'll be fishing for his guts.

698
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:43,518
You know what else?
For murder, they need a body.

699
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,420
Otherwise, they'll think you ran away again.

700
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,316
Only this time, you'll never come back.

701
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:52,616
Mommy!

702
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:55,558
Daddy, no!

703
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,698
Stop, Daddy! Stop it!

704
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,256
Mommy!

705
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,436
Stop, Daddy! Stop!

706
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:29,697
Go on, honey. Get in your seat.
Get in the back. Strap yourself in.

707
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:03,589
Put that on.

708
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,824
Mommy, what's happening?

709
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,129
Put it on. Put these on, too.

710
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:15,539
You.

711
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,419
Car seat, honey.

712
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:35,188
-Then slow so I can.
-I can't slow down right now.

713
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:21,171
Bitch!

714
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:34,387
Pull over.

715
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,184
Pull the car over!

716
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,250
Mommy, stop it!

717
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:40,988
Hold on tight.

718
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,457
Pull over.

719
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:51,465
Shit!

720
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,069
Come on.

721
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,985
-Mommy!
-Hold on, Gracie, okay.

722
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:08,879
Mommy!

723
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:16,559
Come on!

724
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:23,229
It will be over soon. We're almost there!
Just hold on, okay?

725
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:32,504
You'll be all right, okay? All right.

726
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:04,836
Okay, toots.

727
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,035
Let's talk.

728
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,639
You want me to tell you what happened?

729
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,243
Fair enough.

730
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:17,316
First thing...

731
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,052
...Erin is over.

732
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,256
I liked Erin.

733
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:26,059
And you are not the Queen of England anymore.

734
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:28,756
Okay?

735
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:36,868
I'm hungry.

736
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:51,084
-Is everything okay here?
-Yeah, thanks.

737
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,579
Hey there, little cutie. What's your name?

738
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:56,619
I don't know.

739
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,932
Hey, Millie, 14 needs menus.

740
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,172
Come on.

741
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:22,374
You'll be okay? You're going to sit here,
be Mommy's good girl? Okay?

742
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:26,048
All right. Don't talk to any strangers.
Be right back.

743
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:30,452
-Is Mr. Toller with someone?
-No, but--

744
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,188
Good. I'm not a crazy person. I swear.

745
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,753
-Wait a minute. You can't--
-Don't call security.

746
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:39,460
Hi, Mr. Toller. My name is Erin....
I mean, my name is Slim.

747
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,938
I got your name from Millie.
Down at the diner, right down the block.

748
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,064
The thing is....

749
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:49,974
My husband keeps trying to kill me.
You know? See?

750
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:53,206
I need someone to talk to who is smart.

751
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:56,713
And I have money, you know.

752
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:00,417
I have money. $500.

753
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,155
And you can have it. You can have it all...

754
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:07,688
...if you just listen to what....

755
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:10,086
Two minutes.

756
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,329
Please.

757
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:23,140
Thanks.

758
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,071
Small person. Can you watch her? Thank you.

759
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,848
Pardon my French, dear, but...

760
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:37,548
...l hope you got some pleasure from it
because you've really screwed yourself.

761
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,887
You had two chances to go to the police,
file a complaint...

762
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,955
...put his violence on record.

763
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:45,931
You ignored them both.

764
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:49,568
Which tells him to keep on coming
until he kills you.

765
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:54,364
As for Gracie,
you're going to the custody hearing?

766
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:55,506
Yes, sir.

767
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:59,612
If you didn't, the judge would rule against you,
and you'd become a fugitive.

768
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:04,944
Once you're there, your husband will,
as you say, portray you as a drug addict.

769
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:09,421
For all I know, you are one.
You break in here uninvited.

770
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:14,991
I'd say your attacker has a very good chance
of gaining sole custody.

771
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,833
-If you don't mind, put this away.
-No, no. Take it.

772
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:20,926
Is that it?

773
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:25,704
You won't help me?

774
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,475
That's what I'm telling you.

775
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,504
It's too late.

776
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,884
There isn't anybody who can help you.

777
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:45,149
In good conscience, I should say...

778
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:47,525
...the custody hearing is probably a trick.

779
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:51,423
It's not about itself. It's a way to find you.

780
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:56,997
A way to get you in a particular place and time
so his men can follow you...

781
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,039
...and he can come to wherever you are...

782
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,210
...and kill you.

783
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:12,112
Okay.

784
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,858
Now I got to make you a promise, Grace.

785
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:25,656
Ever since you were born....

786
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:31,271
One day I started thinking
of all the awful things that could happen.

787
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:36,244
People who you'd love would die...

788
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,245
...or leave you, or betray you...

789
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:44,041
...and break your heart.

790
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:47,348
Or a guy would hurt you in some way.

791
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,189
And I thought to myself, if I could...

792
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:53,689
...protect you from that, even once.

793
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,831
If I could just...

794
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,528
...absorb any of that myself.

795
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,049
Here goes.

796
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:26,285
Okay, you guys, keep up with me.
This is really busy here.

797
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,456
Would you hold her hand, please?

798
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,996
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.

799
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:38,333
-Oh, yeah? How about Horace?
-Okay, the second most.

800
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:41,809
Rent a car, drive to Reno, then fly to San Jose.

801
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:45,472
-Are you out of your mind?
-You noticed?

802
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,187
Oh, my!

803
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:08,634
What happened?
I thought I'm supposed to drive to Reno.

804
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,762
I had to make sure you weren't followed.

805
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,102
Okay.

806
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:16,275
Hey, Graceland. How are you?

807
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,276
Hey, Gracie! Over here!

808
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,184
-Here are the tickets.
-Okay.

809
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:29,448
Some cash and credit cards. It's on me.

810
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,686
-Just don't call home. Or Phil's.
-Okay.

811
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:37,630
Think of it as a paid vacation you never had.

812
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:42,636
Hey, toots.

813
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,565
You want to give Mommy a hug?

814
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,002
Come here.

815
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,405
Say goodbye to me. Okay?

816
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:56,116
I'm going to miss you. It's just for a little while.

817
01:20:58,320 --> 01:20:59,480
A little kiss?

818
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:02,915
Can I have a little smile before you go?

819
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,350
Okay.

820
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,868
Sweetie, why don't you sit up front, okay?

821
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,010
Take care of her.

822
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:24,735
Oh, honey.

823
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,649
I don't want you to worry, okay?

824
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:33,484
Eric will have her dribbling behind her back
the next time you see her.

825
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:38,087
Thanks. I'm number 1 on the auto dialer.

826
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,521
Call me, or I'll call you.

827
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,660
All calls, 15 seconds or less.

828
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:48,228
-Cake?
-Pie.

829
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:52,963
Try to have fun.

830
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,709
Hey, how long?

831
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:58,473
The custody hearing is in the next month, so....

832
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:01,605
-That's my deadline.
-Deadline for what?

833
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:19,857
Relax. Close your eyes.

834
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:24,138
I'm not here. He's not here.

835
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,636
Time!

836
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:31,877
Relax. Breathe. Close your eyes.

837
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:35,011
Close your eyes. That's it. Go!

838
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,811
Relax. Keep your balance.

839
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:43,050
-You ready?
-Yes.

840
01:22:43,692 --> 01:22:44,886
You sure?

841
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:50,390
-Can you lose?
-No.

842
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,858
-Can he hurt you?
-No.

843
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:57,169
-Even though he's bigger?
-He's a lot bigger.

844
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:00,897
-Even though he's stronger?
-He's a lot stronger.

845
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,039
Get some rest tonight.
Tomorrow we're gonna work on the ball.

846
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:13,177
Look at me!

847
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,417
-If he hits you....
-No way.

848
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:17,949
Say it.

849
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:21,893
It takes twice as much energy
to swing and miss as to swing and hit.

850
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:26,592
You think you're done for.
He's got you by the throat. Left arm up.

851
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:31,132
Good. Rotate around. Drop that arm.
Reach up, grab my hand.

852
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,639
There. Good.

853
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,172
So how do you win?

854
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,507
How?

855
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:43,215
I attack.

856
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:47,214
-And what do you do after you attack?
-Nothing.

857
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,386
Why nothing?

858
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,386
Because I never stop attacking.

859
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:57,356
Good! Do it!

860
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,730
Use your legs. Keep that chin down!

861
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:03,199
That's it! Go! Go!

862
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:07,973
One last thing.

863
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:11,169
The hardest lesson.

864
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,713
We can't control the universe.

865
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:18,441
Suddenly the maid enters.

866
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,580
You're distracted for an instant and he hits you.

867
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,623
That's not possible.

868
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:28,385
To win, we must prepare,
even for the impossible.

869
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:33,126
We bend the universe to our will,
but it will only go so far.

870
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,796
-So you're saying....
-Yes.

871
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:45,374
You're down.

872
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:47,709
Lying there.

873
01:24:48,616 --> 01:24:50,083
Seemingly beaten.

874
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:54,982
But hear me.

875
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:57,790
Hold on to my voice.

876
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:01,485
He's standing over you.

877
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:04,688
He thinks he's won.

878
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:09,661
And as sure as he's a coward,
he will try to kick you.

879
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:11,331
Yes.

880
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,468
But because you know what he'll do...

881
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:17,838
...you're smiling inside.

882
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:28,550
-How's that guy I set you up with?
-He's good.

883
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:32,019
-He teach you how to think?
-I hope so.

884
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,352
Did you find Mitch?

885
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:38,490
He sold the house.
Bought a place out near the marina.

886
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:42,835
I need a woman who looks like me.
5'5", 115 pounds.

887
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:46,840
An off-duty cop or something.
She should have her hair cut short, too.

888
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:49,933
-She should wear jeans and sneakers.
-Here's his address.

889
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,479
I got her a room at the Washington Square lnn.

890
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,106
What's she for?

891
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:56,810
I need Mitch to think I'm here, in San Francisco.

892
01:25:57,352 --> 01:26:00,378
Have her meet me, 5:45,
top floor of the Vesuvio's.

893
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:04,456
Today? Well, that's awful short notice.
I don't know--

894
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:09,463
I thought Jupiter was almighty,
powerful, king of the gods.

895
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:14,958
Yeah. One more thing.

896
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:18,597
At some point,
not right now because it would be phony...

897
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:20,867
...l need you to acknowledge I'm your kid.

898
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:33,820
-You sure this will work?
-You bet your life.

899
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:38,092
Thanks. I will.

900
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,194
-And where is Gracie?
-Well, she gets back the day after tomorrow.

901
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:45,229
And then we're gonna fly to LA.

902
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,166
Tell me something, please.
Why is this call different?

903
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:52,704
Well, you know, we were in the country then.

904
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:55,766
Now we're in the city, meeting with my lawyers.

905
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:58,334
So, you know, there's lots of cell phones here.

906
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:02,479
So, there's no way they can trace this.

907
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:05,315
Make sure you call me the minute you get back.

908
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:07,445
I can't wait to see my girls, okay?

909
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:10,347
Hey, give me the ball, man!

910
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:45,171
-Coffee?
-No, I got to get home. Change for work.

911
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:47,501
I'll call you.

912
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:50,809
You want my number?

913
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,173
Sure.

914
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,283
-Thanks, for everything.
-You, too.

915
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:02,850
I really appreciate it.

916
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:06,985
Really.

917
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:16,262
Lucy. Hey, baby.

918
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:19,731
No, I had to work late.

919
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,778
Tonight's no good. I have a flight
to San Francisco early tomorrow morning.

920
01:31:28,349 --> 01:31:30,715
If it was pleasure, you'd be going, too.

921
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:34,082
No, I have to go up and pick up my daughter.

922
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:37,653
Yeah, the custody hearing is down here.

923
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:41,519
But it looks as if Gracie
is being taken to San Francisco...

924
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:43,857
...and my wife...

925
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:48,391
...it seems as if she has completely vanished.
Right off the face of the earth.

926
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,999
I doubt they'll ever find her this time.

927
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:57,973
I want her to meet you, too.
We'll call you as soon as we get back.

928
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:00,111
Love you. 'Bye.

929
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:34,357
-Hi. What's up?
-I'm in.

930
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,051
Thanks for letting me come talk about Gracie.

931
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,725
I'm glad you're willing to admit your temper.

932
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:38,658
And let's not mince words.
The physical abuse you subjected me to.

933
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,727
Perhaps with your new attitude,
we can really work something out.

934
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:46,362
Per your last letter, I'll see you the evening of....

935
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,461
Hey. You okay?

936
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,293
Say it again.

937
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:53,071
Say what?

938
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,332
You know, what you told me.

939
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:59,235
You have a divine, animal right...

940
01:36:59,547 --> 01:37:02,573
...to protect your own life
and the life of your offspring.

941
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:09,784
Are you still there?

942
01:37:10,858 --> 01:37:11,847
Yeah.

943
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,792
Stay on the line. I want to see if this works.

944
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:26,689
It's me.

945
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:35,991
Yeah.

946
01:39:37,271 --> 01:39:38,704
And this morning?

947
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:41,366
You always did forget to turn off the coffee.

948
01:39:53,587 --> 01:39:55,418
I found it, Mitch.

949
01:40:31,225 --> 01:40:33,557
It's a machine. It knocks out cell phones.

950
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:52,009
Found that gun, too.

951
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:56,481
-Scared?
-Of what?

952
01:40:57,651 --> 01:40:59,642
Now is when you decide, Mitch.

953
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:04,119
Whether you're a coward or not.
If you are, you can run.

954
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:05,686
Go ahead, run.

955
01:41:05,826 --> 01:41:07,919
You will shoot me with my own gun?

956
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:10,219
I threw them away.

957
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:14,359
Then someone else is here with you.

958
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,496
No.

959
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:20,839
You're alone.

960
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:22,770
Why not?

961
01:41:31,985 --> 01:41:33,953
This is what you wanted, right?

962
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:37,988
What you were going to San Francisco for?

963
01:41:38,692 --> 01:41:40,284
The chance to get me alone?

964
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:42,121
Yeah.

965
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:44,622
But what are you doing?

966
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:51,737
You want to fight me? Man to man?

967
01:41:53,073 --> 01:41:54,563
Woman, Mitch.

968
01:41:56,477 --> 01:41:58,968
Yeah, that's what I mean. Man against woman.

969
01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:03,416
You sure that's fair?

970
01:42:05,185 --> 01:42:06,447
Fair to whom?

971
01:42:09,323 --> 01:42:13,020
-No, I'm sorry. I can't do this.
-Can't do what?

972
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:14,989
This. It's ridiculous.

973
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:19,457
You could hit me before, though, couldn't you?
When I was defenseless.

974
01:42:23,937 --> 01:42:25,302
That's not going to--

975
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:33,805
As I was saying, that's not going to do anything.

976
01:42:34,214 --> 01:42:35,681
Then what will do it?

977
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:39,612
Are you such a coward that you can only hit me
when I'm not expecting it?

978
01:42:59,773 --> 01:43:00,535
Come on.

979
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:03,201
I don't understand, Slim.
How does this work for you?

980
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:07,740
I mean, this is carefully thought out.

981
01:43:08,482 --> 01:43:12,782
But say you do succeed. You beat me up
or whatever. You won't murder me.

982
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:20,257
So all you've done is further piss me off.

983
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:29,992
Self-defense is not murder.

984
01:43:31,972 --> 01:43:33,633
You don't have the guts.

985
01:43:40,113 --> 01:43:41,102
Come on.

986
01:43:41,648 --> 01:43:44,515
It's not self-defense
when you break in here and attack me.

987
01:43:44,585 --> 01:43:47,816
Attack you?
All I did was slap you around a little bit.

988
01:43:50,424 --> 01:43:53,621
You really think you're going to kill me
and get away with it?

989
01:43:57,598 --> 01:44:00,032
I told you. Self-defense.

990
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:04,196
As arranged in our letters,
I'm here to talk about Gracie.

991
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:06,171
There are no letters.

992
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,902
Sure there are.
In the drawer where your pistol was.

993
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:15,542
You just put your prints all over them.

994
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:18,745
You attacked me, I fought back.

995
01:44:19,953 --> 01:44:21,716
If something should happen....

996
01:44:28,228 --> 01:44:31,959
I don't care how long it takes.
I only have to hit you once.

997
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:35,534
Just one good hit and it's over.

998
01:44:47,614 --> 01:44:48,603
He bleeds.

999
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:50,613
You can count on one thing, baby.

1000
01:44:50,717 --> 01:44:54,016
Even if I don't kill you,
you'll never see Gracie again.

1001
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:55,682
You never will.

1002
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:16,336
I'm confused, Mitch. Aren't you a man?

1003
01:45:17,711 --> 01:45:19,508
Can't you hit me again, even once?

1004
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:38,154
What do you think now?

1005
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:42,659
All your training, all your practice....
It's over, baby.

1006
01:45:42,903 --> 01:45:43,801
It's over.

1007
01:46:34,321 --> 01:46:36,255
-Hi.
-I can't do it, Gin.

1008
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:38,290
What do you mean? What happened?

1009
01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:40,352
I can't do it.

1010
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,890
He'll come after you and after Gracie.

1011
01:46:42,963 --> 01:46:46,194
I know all that, but I can't do it.

1012
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,429
I'm not a killer, Gin.

1013
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:52,872
I'm not him. I can't do this.

1014
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:58,304
Hello? Slim, are you there?
Should I call the cops?

1015
01:46:58,612 --> 01:47:00,944
Slim, answer mel Sliml

1016
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,948
Hold on to my voice.

1017
01:47:05,685 --> 01:47:07,346
He thinks he's won.

1018
01:47:08,155 --> 01:47:11,682
And as sure as he's a coward,
he will try to kick you.

1019
01:48:37,377 --> 01:48:39,504
Some woman called. Ginny?

1020
01:48:42,949 --> 01:48:44,246
He's still in there?

1021
01:48:46,253 --> 01:48:47,550
Armed?

1022
01:48:48,622 --> 01:48:50,021
Dangerous?

1023
01:49:01,468 --> 01:49:03,663
Looks like you're one of the lucky ones.

1024
01:49:49,849 --> 01:49:50,838
Gracie!

1025
01:49:53,286 --> 01:49:54,583
Mommy!

1026
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:03,491
My baby!

1027
01:50:03,563 --> 01:50:06,054
Where are we going now, Mommy?

1028
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:07,699
Anywhere you want to go.

1029
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:09,462
Emerald City.

1030
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:12,632
I was thinking the same thing.

1031
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:18,577
-I have something to show you, Mommy.
-You do? Show me.

1032
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,739
Something for you.

1033
01:50:27,253 --> 01:50:29,915
Oh, my goodness. Look at all this.

1034
01:50:30,857 --> 01:50:32,848
Where did you get all this stuff?

1035
01:50:34,894 --> 01:50:36,486
From Hawaii.
