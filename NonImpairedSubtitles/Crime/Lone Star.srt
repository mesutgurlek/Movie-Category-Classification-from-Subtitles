1
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,632
We got cenizo...

2
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,876
...that's purple sage...

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,270
...agave, nopal...

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,953
What's that stuff?

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,275
That's whatchamacallit.

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,752
That's horse crippler.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,070
This place is a gold mine.

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,993
Lead mine.

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,429
What?

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,351
I said it's a lead mine.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,476
- Right.
- Why am I talking to you?

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,437
You got that thing on your head.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,670
You find lots of cactus and shit?

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,876
Not just cactus. There's acacias...

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,873
...the yuccas...
- Looks like a lot of cactus to me.

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,151
Man knows 150 varieties of beer,
can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,275
Cliff!

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,637
You live in a place,
you should learn about it.

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,349
- Explore.
- You've got to look at this.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,314
Don't tell me.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,277
Spanish treasure, right?

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,395
Pieces of eight...

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,630
...from the Coronado Expedition.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,149
Jesus!

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,110
Was Coronado in the Masons?

26
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,510
The forensics fella's coming down
from San Marcos.

27
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,915
There's no way to know how old
the body is without lab work.

28
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,473
That ring?

29
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,439
Mason's been around a long while.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,558
He a treasure hunter?

31
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,799
Old bullets.

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,832
Makes art out of them.

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,832
Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything.

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,031
He can't hear with that rig on.

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,713
Mikey!

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,998
Hey, what have we got here?

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,954
We're supposed to leave everything
where we found it.

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,952
They're real particular about that.

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,872
The scene of the crime.

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,999
No telling yet if there's been a crime...

41
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,558
...but this country's seen a good number
of disagreements over the years.

42
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,909
He went to school on the post
when we were in Korea.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,798
It's all kids in the same boat, army brats...

44
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,591
His record shows he's a good student.

45
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,310
I'm more worried about the social thing.
Are there, like, gangs or guns...

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,711
We haven't had any serious violence,
if that's what you mean.

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,031
But we've got a pretty lively mix.
Mexican kids...

48
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,792
...anglo kids, black kids.

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,389
- And the blacks are what?
- The smallest group.

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,708
Except for a couple...

51
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,074
...of Kickapoo kids.

52
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,958
Look, you're obviously a concerned parent.

53
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,398
Chet has no history of getting into trouble.

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,589
Pilar...

55
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,309
Is Amado okay?

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,234
He's not here?

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,196
Is he sick?

58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,590
He's going to wish he was dead.

59
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,310
Somebody hand me a CD player.

60
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,072
They've come a long way
since those old eight-tracks, ain't they?

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,354
Something wrong?

62
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,557
Stolen property. I'm hauling
the bunch of you to jail.

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,713
If anything else is wrong,
tell me on the way to the station.

64
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,758
Cleaning his toenails with a pocketknife.

65
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,877
He was the most hygienic
of all the McHenry's.

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,192
"Fishbait," Buddy says,
in that quiet way of his...

67
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,155
..."what do you know about the tires
that went missing from Merkel's?"

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,038
Fishbait thinks for a minute...

69
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,998
...then lifts up a loose board
from the porch floor...

70
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,191
...and calls down into it.

71
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,678
"Come on out, Hooter, they caught us!"

72
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,636
Buddy Deeds, he had a way.

73
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,757
He'd known who it was
from the tire tracks in the dirt...

74
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,832
...leading from the back of the garage
to where they loaded up.

75
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,273
"Old Fishbait," he said...

76
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,955
..."never lifted a thing,
if there was a way he could roll it. "

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,672
Never be another like him.

78
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,115
You know that boy of his can't cut it.

79
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,351
He's all hat and no cattle.

80
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,195
Hey, fellas.

81
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,196
We was telling a few on your old man.

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,510
He was a unique individual.

83
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,113
He was that.

84
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,159
Big day coming up.

85
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,397
I wish we'd have thought of it
while he was still living.

86
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,039
Went so unexpected.

87
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,151
Better late than never.

88
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,756
Korean War hero,
sheriff for nearly 30 years...

89
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,708
The Buddy Deeds Memorial Courthouse.

90
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,030
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.

91
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,151
Well, the usual troublemakers.

92
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,756
<i>Danny Padilla from the Sentinel.
That crowd.</i>

93
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,390
We call everything else in the country
after Martin Luther King.

94
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,671
We can't have one measly courthouse?

95
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,273
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton.

96
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,193
Bad enough that all the street names
are in Spanish.

97
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,998
They were here first.

98
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,352
Then let's call it after Big Chief
Shit-In-The-Bucket. That Tonkawa had...

99
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,759
...the Mexes beat by centuries.

100
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,638
Nineteen out of 20 people here
are Mexican.

101
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,950
There was a faction pulling
for that boy killed in the Gulf War...

102
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,992
Yeah. Santiago.

103
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,355
Mexicans that know remember what...

104
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,998
...Buddy was for their people.

105
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,196
Hell, it was Mercedes over there
who swung...

106
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,793
...the deciding vote for him.

107
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,518
She made it an even 3-3.

108
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,109
As mayor, I get to cast the tiebreaker.

109
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,832
The old-timers won't have a problem.
They know how Buddy come to be sheriff.

110
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,832
Tell that story, Hollis.

111
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,990
Everybody heard it a million times.

112
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,673
I'd like to hear it.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,709
Your version of it.

114
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,553
Yeah, come on, Hollis.

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,028
Well, the two of us...

116
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,516
...were the only deputies back then.

117
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,270
Me and Buddy, in what, '58?

118
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,278
'57, I think.

119
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,876
The sheriff at the time
was big Charlie Wade.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,955
Charlie...

121
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,113
...was one of your old-fashioned
bribe-or-bullets kind of sheriffs.

122
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,115
He took a healthy bite out of whatever
moved through this country.

123
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,191
It was in here one night...

124
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,875
...back when Jimmy Herrera run the place.

125
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,879
<i>Started over a basket of tortillas.</i>

126
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,715
This beaner fare doesn't agree with me
but the price sure is right.

127
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,435
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks,
most of them relatives.

128
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,830
Those people breed like chickens.

129
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,549
So?

130
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,233
<i>I roust some muchacho on the street
with no papers, all he's got to say is:</i>

131
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,231
<i>I work for Jimmy Herrera.</i>

132
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,154
Sort of a...

133
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,632
...I- scratch-his-back-he-washes-mine
arrangement, if you know what I mean.

134
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,638
This'll be one of your pickups.
First of the month, like the rent.

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,513
Get the car, Hollis.

136
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,152
I'm not doing it.

137
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,953
Come again?

138
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,159
It's your deal.

139
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,834
There's going to be some left over for you.

140
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,353
I take care of my boys.

141
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,671
That's not the point, Charlie.

142
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,190
You feeling bad about Jimmy?

143
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,230
<i>Ask him how big a mordida they took
when he run a place on the other side.</i>

144
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,631
Those old boys from Ciudad León...

145
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,393
I'm not picking it up.

146
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,756
You do whatever I say you do
or else you put it on the trail, son.

147
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,318
How about this, Charlie?

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,310
How about you lay that shield
on this table and vanish...

149
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,396
...before you end up dead...

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,834
...or in jail?

151
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,996
You're not making sense, Buddy.

152
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,390
Stick around and I'm bringing up charges
on the county road project.

153
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,153
Two-thirds of that money went straight
into your pocket.

154
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,239
You're being mighty careless
with your mouth, son.

155
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,238
You ever shoot a man
who's looking you in the eye?

156
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,835
It's a whole different story, isn't it?

157
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,079
You're fired.

158
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,632
Not a soul in this county isn't sick to death
of your bullshit.

159
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,313
Make yourself scarce and you'll make a lot
of people happy.

160
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,958
- You little piss ant.
- Now...

161
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,029
...or later.

162
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,710
You won't have any trouble finding me.

163
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,511
You're a dead man.

164
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,678
Get the goddamn car.
We're going to Roderick's.

165
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,755
<i>Boy...</i>

166
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,031
<i>...another beer, please.</i>

167
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,110
Yeah, that Buddy was a cool breeze.

168
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,635
Wade was known to put quite a few people
in the ground...

169
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,752
...and your daddy gets eyeball-to-eyeball
with him.

170
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,473
We made our pickup at Roderick's place.

171
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
Nobody's seen hide nor hair of him since.

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,391
He went missing the next day along
with $10,000 in county funds from the safe.

173
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,958
Never heard from him again.

174
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,952
Buddy Deeds said a thing,
he damn well backed it up.

175
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,712
Never be another like him.

176
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,119
So, I suppose then he arrested
all of Jimmy Herrera's people and...

177
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,111
...sent them back to the other side?

178
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,111
He came to an accommodation.

179
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,153
Money doesn't always have to change
hands to keep the wheels turning.

180
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,749
I know you had problems with your father.

181
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,234
- And he and Muriel...
- Your mother was a saint.

182
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,349
But Buddy Deeds was my salvation.

183
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,796
Won't be another like him.

184
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,953
It is an honor for me...

185
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,792
...to assume command of this unit.

186
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,189
I look forward to working with all of you.

187
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,794
I'm sure you're all aware
of the Army's decision...

188
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,518
...to shut this post down.

189
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,958
That doesn't mean, however,
that we're here to mark time...

190
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,678
...until we're reassigned.

191
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,357
You may have heard rumors...

192
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,875
...that I run a very tight operation.

193
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,993
These rumors...

194
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,918
...are not exaggerated.

195
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,870
Somebody call a doctor!

196
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,151
You weren't in here tonight, were you?

197
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,355
No, no, sir.

198
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,913
Go out the back way.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,150
Somebody call a doctor!

200
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,712
Tearing everything down.

201
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,237
Our heritage, the memory of the people
who fought and died for this land.

202
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,675
We fought and died for this land too.

203
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,110
We fought the U.S. Army,
the Texas Rangers...

204
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,679
Yeah, and you lost.

205
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,436
Winners get the bragging rights.

206
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,310
People. It'd be best if we don't view this
in terms of winners and losers.

207
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,119
The way she teaches,
she's got everything backward.

208
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,839
I was on the textbook committee.
Her version...

209
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,389
We think of the textbook...

210
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,516
...as a guide, not as an absolute.

211
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,234
It is not what we set as the standard.

212
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,399
Now, you people can believe
whatever you want...

213
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,152
...but when it comes to teaching...

214
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,199
They're our children too. As the majority
in this community, we have the right.

215
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,070
The men who founded this state
have the right to have their story told.

216
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,669
The men who founded this state
broke from Mexico.

217
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,389
They needed slavery to be legal
to make a fortune in the cotton business.

218
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,994
I think that's a bit of an oversimplification.

219
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,516
- You reporting or running this meeting?
- Adding some historical perspective.

220
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,795
You call it history, I call it propaganda.

221
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,634
I'm sure they've got their own account
of the Alamo on the other side...

222
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,718
...but our schools shouldn't teach it
that way.

223
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,915
Excuse me.

224
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,190
I've only been trying to get across part
of the complexity of our situation here.

225
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,311
Cultures coming together
in both negative and positive ways.

226
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,592
If you mean food and music and all,
I have no problem.

227
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,959
But when you start changing...

228
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,314
...who did what to who...

229
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,676
We're just trying to present
a more complete picture.

230
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,712
That's what's got to stop!

231
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,112
There's enough ignorance in the world
without us encouraging it in school.

232
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Now, who are you calling ignorant?

233
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,079
I hope the sucker dies.
Mess with me, that's what you get.

234
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,116
Hospital says the kid is in bad shape.

235
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,474
The shooter local?

236
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,438
Houston. I think he knew the girl
from before.

237
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,957
We'll take a statement from the GI's
before they go back to post.

238
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,474
You can get the story from Otis.

239
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,600
Any poop on the John Doe
we found today?

240
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,873
No, nothing much.
Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it.

241
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,753
I'll catch you later.

242
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,349
He's only 15. He's about 5 foot 5...

243
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,475
Pilar.

244
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,434
Something wrong?

245
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,113
They've got my son.

246
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,156
Here?

247
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,030
Somebody called about a house that was
broken into. They say they don't have...

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,035
All right, I know what he looks like.

249
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,798
I'll see what's going on.

250
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,949
I was...

251
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,919
I was real sorry about Nando.

252
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,358
He was a good fella.

253
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,719
We haven't talked...

254
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,916
We haven't talked since high school.

255
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,878
I'll go check on your boy.

256
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,875
Ritchie didn't say nothing,
'cause he didn't want to get in it.

257
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,239
Then, next thing I know
there's shots and Ritchie's down.

258
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,196
You got some boys you run in earlier?

259
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,598
They tell me you're good at fixing things.

260
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,629
Your father was a hell of a mechanic.

261
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,628
You know, if you figure minimum wage...

262
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,280
...on the time most thieves spend in jail...

263
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,358
...they could have bought
most everything they stole.

264
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,116
They asked me to hook it up for them.
I didn't steal anything.

265
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,716
Well, I didn't say you did.

266
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,070
My name's Sam, by the way.

267
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,751
- He's all yours.
- Are you okay?

268
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,831
What's the big deal?

269
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,717
You'll find out when I get you home.

270
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,395
Thanks, Sam.

271
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,233
It's no problem.

272
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,153
It was good seeing you again.

273
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,511
Big O's is the only place
where African American soldiers...

274
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,352
...feel comfortable, sir.

275
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,751
- Have we had trouble there before?
- Fistfight now and then.

276
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,479
- This town isn't much.
- They didn't come for a vacation.

277
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,712
For many, it's their first time away
from home, dealing with new people...

278
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,235
- I remember my first hitch...
- Substance abuse?

279
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,073
Yes, sir, but I went through the program.
I haven't drunk...

280
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,799
I meant on the post.
How are you dealing with it?

281
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,474
We throw a urine test at them
once a month.

282
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,199
Random numbers...

283
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,191
...maybe 100 people at a time.

284
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,192
- Let's make it once a week for a while.
- Yes, sir.

285
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,194
I sprint the last quarter mile.
You don't have to keep up.

286
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,954
Appreciate it, sir.

287
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,675
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.

288
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,310
You get the feeling
he doesn't want to be here?

289
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,115
Sam the Man.

290
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,154
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

291
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,719
So, how's business?

292
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,078
Business is booming.

293
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,870
Got your drugs, got your illegals.

294
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,273
Had a shooting the other night
at O's place. Soldier got ventilated.

295
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,194
I hear they're closing Fort McKenzie.

296
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,430
It'll pull a lot of jobs out of this county.

297
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,718
We'll have folks swimming over to Mexico
to work in the sweat shops.

298
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,632
Is that the word on our boy?

299
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,514
This is Skinny.

300
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,036
Skinny?

301
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,799
When we find a body, it's Skinny or Stinky.

302
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,269
Depends on how much meat's left
on the bones.

303
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,198
That's a nice job.

304
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,878
"A male Caucasian...

305
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,358
"... 40 to 60 years old...

306
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,998
"... 5 foot 9...

307
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,559
"... 5 foot 11.

308
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,514
"Chewed tobacco. "

309
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,114
Then we'll get the dental records
and personal effects.

310
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,758
It's Charlie Wade.

311
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,949
That badge...

312
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,349
Didn't come out of a cereal box.

313
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,557
You know the popular version
of how he left town.

314
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,315
Everybody on the border knows that story.

315
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,272
You got a cause of death?

316
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,554
Skull was intact.

317
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,995
No signs of trauma on what we found.

318
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,872
Not much to go on.

319
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,633
So, he could have gone out to the post,
just hopped the fence...

320
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,236
...dug into the dirt on the rifle range...

321
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,072
...and had a heart attack.

322
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,271
You remember what old Buddy carried
for a side arm?

323
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,719
Colt Peacemaker.

324
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,869
.45.

325
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,109
He swore by it.

326
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,909
What?

327
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,393
I was just wondering.

328
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,191
Is Buddy on your short list?

329
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,995
<i>If it were some poor majadero
who swam across, got lost in the brush...</i>

330
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,231
...and starved out there
it wouldn't go much further, but...

331
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,034
...this is a once prominent citizen
who disappeared.

332
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,551
You've got to investigate.
There's no question about it.

333
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,433
I'll keep names out of it until we get
some answers or hit a dead end.

334
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,671
You know how the press is when they get
ahold of a murder story, even 40 years old.

335
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,920
Yeah, yeah. They can do a number on you.

336
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,239
I remember...

337
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,831
...Charlie Wade come
to my father's hardware store once.

338
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,558
I was just a little boy.

339
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,909
I'd heard stories
about how he shot this one...

340
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,877
...how he shot that one.

341
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,952
The man winked at me.

342
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,432
I peed my pants.

343
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,074
Winked at me.

344
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,753
We have the fight against the Spanish,
a bloody conflict for dozens of years...

345
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,991
...till they are finally defeated in 1821...

346
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,232
...and Mexican independence is declared.

347
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,757
Anglo settlers are invited
to colonize the area.

348
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,117
By the time they begin the movement
against Santa Anna...

349
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,477
...they outnumber the Mexicans here
by four to one.

350
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,834
The war between Mexico
and the anglo forces ends...

351
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,672
...in 1836...

352
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,879
...with the formation
of the Texas republic. Texas...

353
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,032
...joins the United States...

354
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,635
...as a state where slavery
is legal in 1845...

355
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,589
...after the so-called Mexican War,
then secedes to join...

356
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,873
...the Confederacy in 1861.
The Confederacy is beaten...

357
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,829
...and the Reformation period here
is marked by range wars...

358
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,990
...and race wars and all this...

359
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,430
...paralleled by the constant battles...

360
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,239
...between the Mexican
and anglo settlers...

361
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,876
...and the various Indian nations.
What are we seeing here, Chet?

362
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,995
Everybody's killing everybody else?

363
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,676
I always wondered what you mayors do...

364
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,512
...when you're not cutting ribbons.

365
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,789
Sam!

366
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,509
Partner.

367
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,197
You caught me playing hooky.

368
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,360
Floating around out here,
playing hell with them bass.

369
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,271
Sounds great! Where do I sign up?

370
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,309
You been by your old place lately?

371
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,669
No.

372
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,796
New people painted it some awful color.

373
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,752
We found a body out
by Fort McKenzie yesterday.

374
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,878
It'd been there a long time.

375
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,269
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

376
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,958
You recall if Charlie Wade was a Mason?

377
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,755
Charlie?

378
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,710
I believe he used to go for Lodge meetings
over to Laredo.

379
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,519
What's Charlie Wade got to do
with your body?

380
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,158
All he was wearing was
a big old Masonic ring...

381
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,350
...and a Rio County sheriff's badge.

382
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,472
You remember anything else
from the last night you saw him?

383
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,199
I told the story enough times.

384
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,439
We were in the car. He was stewing about
his fight with Buddy as we drove over...

385
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,272
...to Roderick Bledsoe's.

386
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,589
Bledsoe?

387
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,950
He owned the colored roadhouse
before Otis.

388
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,075
He's still living?

389
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,435
No.

390
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,159
I think his widow's still in their place
in Darktown, though.

391
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,114
You think it was Charlie Wade, huh?

392
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,876
Forensics people are sure of it.

393
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,600
You got any idea
who might have put him there?

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,877
Besides my father, I mean.

395
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,430
There's no call for that, Sam.

396
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,998
Wade made himself a pile of enemies
over the years.

397
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,193
- Buddy was one of them.
- The dedication's tomorrow.

398
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,834
It's a hell of a time
to bring up old business.

399
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,393
People have made this whole big thing
around my father. If it's built on a crime...

400
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,072
...they deserve to know.

401
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,512
I understand why you might want
to believe he couldn't do it.

402
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,592
I understand why you might want
to think he could.

403
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,196
Thanks for your time, Hollis.

404
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,194
Look at all this.

405
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,439
Tackle, boat...

406
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,750
All just to catch a little old fish...

407
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,991
...minding his own business
down at the bottom of the lake.

408
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,073
Hardly seems worth the effort,
does it, Sam?

409
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,476
You knew this young man before?

410
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,912
From back in Houston.
We both come up off the street.

411
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,997
Did you know he'd be there last night?

412
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,719
If I had, I wouldn't have gone in.

413
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,355
And you and Private Graves were...

414
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,232
We were just dancing.

415
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,157
We're not running a dating service.

416
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,753
I know that, Sergeant.

417
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,276
We were just dancing.
There was a bunch of us there.

418
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,956
Shadow... just come down
looking for trouble.

419
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,391
I don't like to get involved
with soldiers' personal lives...

420
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,795
...but when it interferes with training...

421
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,189
Shadow just gets crazy.

422
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,878
Sergeant, how is Ritchie doing?
Private Graves?

423
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,589
He'll live.

424
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,637
He'll be transferred to Fort Sam...

425
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,073
...as soon as he's stabilized.

426
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,754
He'll probably be getting
a medical discharge.

427
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,911
Will this go on my record?

428
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,270
The incident will be noted.

429
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,472
If it happened the way you say...

430
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,430
...there hasn't been an infraction.

431
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,993
Thank you, Sergeant.

432
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,395
You're dismissed.

433
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,038
Thank you, Sergeant.

434
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,671
You spoil them, Cliff.

435
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,471
- You don't believe her?
- That wasn't much of an interrogation.

436
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,199
I'm in charge of her sorry ass and frankly...

437
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,636
I won't give her the third-degree
because her ex-boyfriend's a thug.

438
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,393
She's pulled herself out
of a rough neighborhood.

439
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,995
And if she isn't careful,
she's gonna slide right back into it.

440
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,033
Mrs. Bledsoe?

441
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,395
That's me.

442
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,238
I'm Sheriff Deeds.

443
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,917
Sheriff Deeds is dead, honey.
You're just Sheriff Junior.

444
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,750
Yeah, that's the story of my life.

445
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,038
You ever play one of these?

446
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,519
Yeah, I've seen them.

447
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,195
Don't ever start up on them, because...

448
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,430
...once you do, you can't stop.

449
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,238
I tell myself I'll just play
three little games after breakfast...

450
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,312
...and here I am...

451
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,116
...with half the day gone.

452
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,193
May I ask you a few questions
about your husband?

453
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,114
Roderick.

454
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,754
I ain't gonna say nothing bad
about the man...

455
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,757
...but you can ask away.

456
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,516
He had the club on Old Trail Road.

457
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,154
We run that club for over 20 years.

458
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,950
Give it over to Otis Payne...

459
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,949
...in 1967, April.

460
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,271
You must remember Sheriff Wade.

461
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,874
Them days...

462
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,513
...you deal with Sheriff Wade
or you didn't deal.

463
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,189
First of the month, every month...

464
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,748
...he'd remind you
who you really working for.

465
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,071
So, he squeezed money out of you?

466
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,316
It wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass
back then, unless you was a club, see?

467
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,838
Roderick used to say:

468
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,879
"Buy yourself a glass,
get a free membership. "

469
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,829
Sheriff Wade...

470
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,350
...he could close you down anytime.

471
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,758
And my father?

472
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,231
Sheriff Buddy was a different story.

473
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,393
As long as Roderick throw his weight
the right way at election day...

474
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,554
...make sure all the colored come to vote,
throw a barbecue for the right folks...

475
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,949
Sheriff Buddy kept to his word.

476
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,437
That Sheriff Wade, though...

477
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,158
...he could get ugly.

478
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,078
People didn't complain?

479
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,270
Not if you was colored or Mexican.

480
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,550
Not if you wanted to keep breathing.

481
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,997
I remember the last time I seen him
before he gone missing.

482
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,275
He come fussing around our place.

483
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,194
He used to come in
whilst we was in full swing.

484
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,070
<i>Making everybody nervous.</i>

485
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,198
<i>Had him a smile like the Grim Reaper.</i>

486
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,632
<i>He used to sit there
with his hand on his old gun...</i>

487
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,359
<i>...acting the kingfish with everybody.</i>

488
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,428
<i>Otis Payne come...</i>

489
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,670
<i>...to work for us about that time...</i>

490
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,310
<i>...and that boy had him some attitude.</i>

491
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,475
Pour it.

492
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,875
What?

493
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,475
Pour it.

494
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,475
I know you?

495
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,754
Name's Otis.

496
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,914
Otis what?

497
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,549
Payne.

498
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,873
They call me "O."

499
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,632
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

500
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,390
I sent your daddy to the farm once.

501
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,399
Yeah, I know that.

502
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,432
Why you think that was?

503
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,391
Some crop needed picking
and the man was short-handed.

504
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,036
As I remember, it was 'cause
he had a sassy mouth on him.

505
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,599
Must run in the family.

506
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,194
You wouldn't be running numbers
out of this club?

507
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,196
Running numbers is illegal, sir.

508
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,513
Running numbers without I knowin'
about it is both illegal and unhealthy.

509
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,233
You remember that.

510
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,998
Son, you're not finished.

511
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,309
Pour his.

512
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,319
I prefer it in the bottle.

513
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,719
Shut up, Hollis.

514
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,432
How come you don't look familiar?

515
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,917
I've been away, up in Houston.

516
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,709
Houston?

517
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,394
I hear they let you boys run wild up there.

518
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,838
Look what you've done now.

519
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,395
Better get something to wipe it up, son.

520
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,234
You spilled it.
Maybe you should wipe it up.

521
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,913
I told you to do something. Will you hop
to it or will we have a problem?

522
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,113
You don't want to turn tail
in front of your people?

523
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,519
I understand.

524
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,670
Come on, Houston, give it a try.

525
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,354
Come to Papa.

526
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,868
Don't mind him.

527
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,555
He's a bit slow, is all.
He don't mean nothing by it.

528
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,193
That the problem, son?

529
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,469
You slow?

530
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,156
Otis!

531
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,479
Apologize to the sheriff.

532
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,439
Sheriff, you got him too scared to peep.

533
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,151
Maybe if you'd put that gun up.

534
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,073
You telling me what to do?

535
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,878
No, Sheriff, I'm just...

536
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,592
Is that whisky in them glasses?

537
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,712
I'll have to cite you
for violation of a state law.

538
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,589
This is a club, Sheriff. You've been here.

539
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,560
You people better clear out of here now!

540
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,996
Learn how to act your place, son.

541
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,039
This isn't Houston.

542
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,909
'Course, I was young...

543
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,791
...and full of beans back then.

544
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,993
I didn't understand the spot
I was putting Roderick in.

545
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,953
And that was the last time you saw him?

546
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,160
I think he came in one more time...

547
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,152
...with Hollis and...

548
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,836
No, no, your daddy wasn't with him.

549
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,150
Made their monthly pickup.

550
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,152
Roderick wasn't in, so I kept my mouth
shut and handed over that envelope.

551
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,078
That was the night he disappeared?

552
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,714
Could have been.

553
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,348
You own a gun?

554
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,356
Back then?

555
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,275
No.

556
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,715
How about Roderick?

557
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,748
Oh, he kept...

558
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,432
...a big old piece back behind the bar,
just so folks knew it was there.

559
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,311
I don't keep one here now.

560
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,797
Don't much care for them.

561
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,271
And when my father was sheriff?

562
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,549
What about him?

563
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,472
What was your deal with him?

564
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,119
Buddy was more part of the big picture:

565
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,436
County political machine...

566
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,680
...Chamber of Commerce, Zoning Board...

567
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,955
If I kept those people happy,
he was pretty much on my side.

568
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,076
When somebody thought of starting up
a new bar for the black folks, they'd be...

569
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,712
How should I say this?

570
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,475
They'd be officially discouraged.

571
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,031
He ever accept cash for a favor?

572
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,910
I don't recall a prisoner ever died...

573
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,231
...in your daddy's custody.

574
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,875
I don't recall a man in this county...

575
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,116
...black, white, Mexican...

576
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,429
...who'd hesitate for a minute...

577
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,589
...before they'd call on Buddy Deeds
to solve a problem.

578
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,353
More than that...

579
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,712
...I wouldn't care to say.

580
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,397
I'm supposed to tell my friends
they're too low-class to hang with?

581
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,833
Come on, Amado.

582
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,191
- 'Cause I'm not like Miss Honor Roll?
- Leave your sister out of it.

583
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,271
You and those teachers in that dump...

584
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,635
Your story's over, so nobody can have fun.

585
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,630
You jerk.

586
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,551
You have no friends.

587
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,631
<i>Who'd be friends with a pachuco wannabe?</i>

588
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,549
- I don't pretend I came on the Mayflower.
- And those stupid girls.

589
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,675
Shut up.

590
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,356
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school
she's in love with Santo Guerra.

591
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,316
So?

592
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,868
You can't be desperately in love
when you're 14.

593
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,876
Not if you have half a brain in your head.

594
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,552
Of course, you can.

595
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,036
What?

596
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,119
It's got nothing to do with being smart.

597
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,508
It's ancient goddamn history, Danny.

598
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,355
1963, they dam up the north branch
to make Lake Pescadero...

599
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,351
...and a whole town disappears.

600
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,634
A squatter's town!

601
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,032
People lived in Perdido for over 100 years!
Mexicans and Chicanos are deported...

602
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,829
...forcibly evicted by our local hero,
Buddy Deeds, and his department.

603
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,116
There was a bill from the state legislature.

604
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,317
Families were split apart!
A whole community was destroyed!

605
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,592
And who gets Lakefront property
bought for a fraction of the market price?

606
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,754
Buddy Deeds, Sheriff of Rio County,
and his Chief Deputy, Hollis Pogue.

607
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,839
Are you finished?

608
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,037
Look, I'm not after you, Sam.

609
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,910
I just think people ought to know
the full story on Buddy Deeds.

610
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,759
That makes two of us.

611
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,838
What's the big deal? Go back over,
talk to the man, and bury the hatchet.

612
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,151
Why me? He's had almost 40 years
and I haven't heard from him.

613
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,639
He was probably embarrassed.

614
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,871
Otis Payne was never embarrassed
about a thing in his life.

615
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,917
You were 8 when he left.

616
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,232
He moved three houses down
with my mother's best friend.

617
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,795
Dad.

618
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,630
"Delmore, where's your daddy?"

619
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,275
Godforsaken town.
Everybody in everybody else's business.

620
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,152
Everybody loved Otis. Big "O."

621
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,357
Always there with a smile or a loan...

622
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,238
...or a free drink.
- Dad, can I talk to you about track?

623
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,275
People change.

624
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,989
Not that much.

625
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,035
I talked to the coach.

626
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,315
I told you. Next year,
if your grades are high.

627
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,594
I have a B average!

628
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,353
How many B students do you think
they take at West Point?

629
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,829
We'll be here for three years.
We'll have to see him.

630
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,879
No, we don't.

631
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,152
Get off the phone.
We've got a big wedding.

632
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,435
Mommy...

633
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,715
They are getting stupider every year.

634
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,115
Maybe you're getting less patient.

635
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,877
If they're going to survive,
they have to know how to work.

636
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,708
You hire illegals, what do you expect?

637
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,191
Nobody's illegal in my cafe!

638
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,996
They've got green cards,
relatives who were born here.

639
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,153
If they only had a little common sense,
I'd be happy.

640
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,232
If you took more time training them,
you wouldn't have to...

641
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,676
Did you come here to teach me
how to run my business?

642
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,476
Do you want to take a trip...

643
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,033
...down south with us?

644
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,111
Maybe see where you grew up?

645
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,393
- Why would I want to go there?
- You must be curious...

646
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,234
<i>...how it's changed. Amado is
into this big tejano- roots thing...</i>

647
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,274
...and I've never been further
than Ciudad León.

648
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,118
You want to see Mexicans?

649
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,316
Open your eyes and look around you.

650
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,477
We're up to our ears in them.

651
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,754
Mommy...

652
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,194
...how old were you when my father died?

653
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,439
He was killed.

654
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,758
Right, when he was killed.

655
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,908
A little older than Paloma is now.

656
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,631
How come you never remarried?

657
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,151
It just didn't happen.

658
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,954
There must have been...

659
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,155
...somebody.

660
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,959
I was too busy.

661
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,391
Nobody is too busy.

662
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,035
Maybe now.

663
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,356
It was different back then.

664
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,718
I had to do all the shopping,
all the cooking...

665
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,874
<i>What do I need some chulo with grease
under his nails to drink up the profit?</i>

666
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,876
Thank you.

667
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,388
I don't mean Fernando.

668
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,280
When I brought him home,
those were your exact words:

669
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,351
<i>"A chulo with grease under his nails. "</i>

670
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,555
I never said that.

671
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,359
You made it pretty damn clear.
You thought he was nobody.

672
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,236
I thought you could do better.

673
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,833
What? What?

674
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,510
Become a nun? You didn't even want me
to go out with anglos.

675
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,034
I never said that. Just that boy.

676
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,434
"That boy. "

677
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,790
Say his name, for Christ's sake.

678
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,149
You people are stealing from me.

679
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,195
<i>Is she your mother?</i>

680
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,755
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

681
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,040
Now, I'm as liberal as the next guy.

682
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,476
If the next guy is a redneck.

683
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,679
But I got to say...

684
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,391
...I think there's something
to this cold-climate business.

685
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,149
I mean, you go to the beach...

686
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,919
...what do you do?

687
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,709
Drink a few beers, wait for that fish
to flop up on the sand.

688
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,838
You can't build no civilization that way.

689
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,995
But you got a cold winter coming on...

690
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,838
...you got to plan ahead.

691
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,434
That gives your old cerebral cortex
a workout.

692
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,829
Good thing you were born down here then.

693
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,750
You joke about it, Sam,
but we are in a state of crisis.

694
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,993
The lines of demarcation are getting fuzzy.

695
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,034
To run a successful civilization, you've got
to have your lines of demarcation...

696
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,192
...between right and wrong,
this one and that one.

697
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,279
Your daddy understood that.

698
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,271
He was... What do you call it?

699
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,237
<i>The referee in this damn menudo
we got down here.</i>

700
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,470
He understood how most folks don't want
their salt and sugar in the same jar.

701
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,709
If you mixed drinks...

702
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,552
...as bad as you mix metaphors...

703
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,312
...you'd be out of a job.

704
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,393
You're the last white sheriff
this town will see.

705
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,559
Hollis retires next year.
Jorge Guerra will take over.

706
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,991
This is it, right here, Sam.

707
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,150
<i>This bar is the last stand.
Se habla American, goddamn it!</i>

708
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,868
And even in here, it's sliding away.

709
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,829
Take that pair over there in the corner.

710
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,393
A place like this, 20 years ago...

711
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,790
...Buddy'd been on them.
He'd have went over there...

712
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,632
...and given them a warning.

713
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,634
Not that he had it in for the colored,
but just as a kind of a safety tip.

714
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,278
Yeah, bet he would.

715
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,032
The day that man died...

716
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,709
...they broke the goddamn mold.

717
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,196
- Seriously.
- Seriously?

718
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,351
I think we should get married.

719
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,192
We've been through this before.

720
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,633
We should just do it.

721
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,269
And if I get transferred to another post?
Germany or Korea?

722
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,159
I'd ask for a transfer too.

723
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,151
Which they'd most likely turn down.

724
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,470
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.

725
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,712
You know, you are something.

726
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,749
Man's going to retire in two years
and he offers to quit.

727
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,518
Big goddamn deal.

728
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,269
Excuse me.

729
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,555
Sheriff.

730
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,753
This is Sergeant...

731
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,957
This is Priscilla Worth.

732
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,038
Sheriff Deeds was with us
on our archeological find.

733
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,111
They're building a shopping mall there?

734
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,156
If certain people have their way,
it's gonna be a new jail.

735
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,752
They're closing down military
and putting up jails...

736
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,239
...like 7-11 stores.

737
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,033
Do either of you have any idea
when they stopped using that site...

738
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,553
...as a rifle range?

739
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,270
Fort McKenzie stopped training infantry...

740
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,875
...there in the late '50s. It was just
a playground for the jackrabbits...

741
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,634
...till they gave it to the county last year.

742
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,878
You know who it was they dug up?

743
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,753
Not for sure yet.

744
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,991
But I kind of wish they hadn't.

745
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,516
In English, Enrique.
This is the United States.

746
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,353
We speak English.

747
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,951
Is very beautiful, your car.

748
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,398
<i>- Good night, Enrique.
- Buenas noches, seòora.</i>

749
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,069
Carolyn...

750
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,348
Knock that off.

751
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,199
Black Seminoles?

752
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,119
Hobby of mine.

753
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,193
A few artifacts...

754
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,712
...couple of pieces one of your men
out on the base made.

755
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,719
Admission's free.

756
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,998
This is where he was shot?

757
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,119
He fell right by the door.

758
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,679
You get much of that here?

759
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,594
It's a bar.

760
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,312
Folks come together...

761
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,753
...drink, fall in love, fall out of love...

762
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,672
...hear their grudges out.

763
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,991
Deal drugs in the bathroom.

764
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,831
If I thought it would do any good...

765
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,354
...I'd put up a sign telling them not to...

766
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,116
...right next to the one about
the employees washing their hands.

767
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,119
This here is Carolyn.

768
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,070
Honey...

769
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,720
...this is my son, Delmore.

770
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,912
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

771
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,839
I'll be in the back waiting for that delivery.

772
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,315
So?

773
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,075
So.

774
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,318
Tell me why I shouldn't make
this place off-limits.

775
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,071
This is an official visit then.

776
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,391
I assume most of your business
is with our people.

777
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,193
Your boys are cooped up together.
They need a place to let the steam out.

778
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,309
If they're black, there's not
but one spot in this county...

779
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,118
...where they feel welcome.

780
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,992
It's been that way...

781
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,111
...since before you were born.

782
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,589
We have an enlisted man's club
at the post.

783
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,229
You the man out there now, ain't you?

784
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,548
It's your call.

785
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,594
That's right.

786
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,599
I've been hearing about
this new command out there...

787
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,557
...for a couple of weeks now.

788
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,439
The boys say they hear he's a hard case...

789
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,110
...a real spit-and-polish man.

790
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,274
Full bird colonel by the name of Payne.

791
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,315
Bet you never figured
you'd end up back here.

792
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,479
When the Army offers you a command,
you go...

793
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,919
...wherever it is.

794
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,074
Right.

795
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,389
I hear things too.

796
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,072
They call you...

797
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,557
...the mayor of Darktown.

798
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,435
Over the years this is the one place
that's always been there.

799
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,116
I loan a little money out,
I've settled a few arguments.

800
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,958
I got a cot in the back. Folks get scared
to go home, they spend the night.

801
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,238
There's not enough of us
to run anything in this town.

802
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,991
It's the Holiness Church...

803
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,594
...or Big O's.

804
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,117
And the people make a choice.

805
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,436
Most of them choose both.

806
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,629
It's not like there's a borderline...

807
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,355
...between the good people
and the bad people.

808
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,388
You're not on either...

809
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,879
...one side or the other.

810
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,309
Right.

811
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,592
Will I meet that family of yours?

812
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,471
Why would you want to do that?

813
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,629
Because I'm your father.

814
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,596
You'll get official notification
when I make my decision.

815
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,553
So, that's him.

816
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,473
Yeah, that's him.

817
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,831
Historic occasion, ain't it?

818
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,115
Seems like we have another one
every week.

819
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,239
Jorge and the boys down at the Chamber
of Commerce got to keep things humming.

820
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,952
Building up tourism, Sam.

821
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,477
Most people come here to catch bass and
get laid at the Boy's Town in Ciudad León.

822
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,078
You ought to put up a banner, "Frontera,
Texas - Gateway to Inexpensive Pussy. "

823
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,230
That kind of talk doesn't help.

824
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,152
I'd rather have that
than a 10-foot-high catfish statue.

825
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,959
<i>Eddie Richter at the Sentinel
will kill that story.</i>

826
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,473
The Perdido thing?

827
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,716
He agreed it wasn't exactly news.

828
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,750
Danny will be out for blood the next time.

829
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,594
That's why we need to talk to you
about the new jail.

830
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,830
Come on, we don't need a new jail.

831
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,678
That's a matter of opinion.

832
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,513
We're already renting cells to the Feds
for their overflow.

833
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,750
It wouldn't be your construction company
who'd get the bid on building this thing?

834
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,274
And, Jorge...

835
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,073
You wouldn't be thinking
about a couple dozen new jobs...

836
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,550
...to dangle by the voters when you run
for mayor next election?

837
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,598
Damn it, Sam! The people
are concerned about crime.

838
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,553
I'm not gonna campaign
against your deal here.

839
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,239
But if anybody asks...

840
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,995
...I've got to tell them the truth.
We don't need a new jail.

841
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,389
We backed you...

842
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,278
When you backed me,
you needed somebody named Deeds...

843
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,715
...to bump the other fella out of office.

844
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,955
- Hey, folks.
- Fenton, what's up, buddy?

845
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
- How you doing?
- Let's get this thing over with.

846
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,430
I never thought I'd see a buddy of mine
dating a woman...

847
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,596
...with three bars on her shoulder.

848
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,557
It's beyond what you'd call dating.

849
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,358
You're going to get married?

850
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,395
Maybe.

851
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,913
You met her family?

852
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,554
They gonna be cool
about you being a white guy?

853
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,395
Priscilla says they think a woman over 30
who's not married must be a lesbian.

854
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,309
She figures they'll be so relieved
I'm a man...

855
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,279
It's always heartwarming to see
a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.

856
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,995
But marriage, man, I don't know.

857
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,869
Let's see...

858
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,799
I did two tours of duty in Southeast Asia...

859
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,190
...and I was married for five years.

860
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,875
I couldn't tell you
which experience was worse.

861
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,631
Mikey?

862
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,439
I knew she was Japanese,
but she didn't tell me...

863
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,318
...the Ninja-assassin part.

864
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,712
Parents acted like I'd blow my nose
on their curtains.

865
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,190
If I stayed out past 10:00,
she'd do a Madam Butterfly routine.

866
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,992
Mikey, look at this.

867
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,549
What?

868
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,756
It's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets.

869
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,114
It's a. 45.

870
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,278
This is the stuff we picked up
the other day, right?

871
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,677
- Rest of this is all. 30 caliber.
- They used M-1s.

872
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,430
So what's a pistol slug doing
on a rifle range?

873
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,877
We'd better call that sheriff.

874
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,754
Back in the early '70s...

875
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,911
...a reporter from a national magazine
asked the governor of our Lone Star state:

876
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,275
"Governor...

877
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,273
"... what's your ideal...

878
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,874
"... of what a real Texan ought to be?"

879
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,308
Governor said:

880
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,238
"Son, that's easy.

881
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,948
"Just go down to...

882
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,837
"... Rio County and look at...

883
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,797
"... Sheriff Buddy Deeds. "

884
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,675
Thank you.

885
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,269
There's...

886
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,319
...one more person
we ought to hear from and...

887
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,635
...I think he's somebody that knew Buddy
better than any of us.

888
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,195
Sam...

889
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,754
Say a few words?

890
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,238
Well, you folks who remember my father...

891
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,392
...knew him as sheriff.

892
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,077
But at home he was also judge, jury...

893
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,919
...and executioner.

894
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,119
This is a real honor you're doing him today.

895
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,556
If Buddy was around, I know his hat size
would be getting bigger every minute.

896
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,597
I used to think there wasn't a place here
you could hide from my old man.

897
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,958
And now I'm sure of it.

898
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,711
I do appreciate it, though.

899
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,792
And wherever he is, Buddy's putting
the beer on ice for you. So, thank you.

900
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,112
And now, my favorite council member...

901
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,399
...and one of Frontera's
most respected businesswomen...

902
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,916
...Mrs. Mercedes Cruz...

903
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,873
...will do the honors.

904
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,236
It does look kind of like Buddy.

905
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,199
I think he'll run that Mexican kid in
for loitering.

906
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,191
Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.

907
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,633
Field trip?

908
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,074
Lunch hour.

909
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,470
My next class isn't until 1:30.

910
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,478
You want to take a walk?

911
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,632
They cooked the whole thing up
without asking me.

912
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,592
People liked him.

913
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,432
Most people did, yeah.

914
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,830
I remember him watching me once...

915
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,118
...when I was little...

916
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,873
...before you and I...

917
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,072
I was in the playground
with all the other kids.

918
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,995
I thought he was only looking at me.

919
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,714
I was afraid he was going to arrest me.

920
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,876
He had those eyes, and that...

921
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,149
Yeah.

922
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,030
It's weird what you remember.

923
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,394
Your boy there.

924
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,156
Amado.

925
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,309
Nice looking kid.

926
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,515
He hates me.

927
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,470
No.

928
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:10,356
With Paloma, it's like she pities
and tolerates me, totally age-appropriate.

929
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,278
But with Amado...

930
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,594
...you know, he's always had
difficulty reading and me...

931
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,596
...being a teacher and caring
about those things, it's like a betrayal.

932
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,352
But Fernando did okay.

933
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,754
He dropped out.

934
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,231
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody.
He just wanted to fix their cars.

935
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,950
I spent my first 15 years
trying to be just like Buddy.

936
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,079
The next 15 trying
to give him a heart attack.

937
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,949
So, why did you come back here, Sam?

938
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,918
I got divorced...

939
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,558
...and I wouldn't work
for my father-in-law anymore.

940
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,751
And the fellas down here...

941
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,511
...they said they'd back me.

942
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,751
You don't want to be sheriff.

943
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,474
I got to admit,
it's not what I thought it'd be.

944
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,356
Back when Buddy had it...

945
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,471
Hell, I'm just a jailer.

946
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,552
Run a 60-room hotel
with bars on the windows.

947
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,193
Do you remember this?

948
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,912
I ought to head back.

949
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,752
It looks real bad
if a teacher's late for class.

950
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,674
It's real nice to talk with you, Sam.

951
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,398
Are you going to tell her?

952
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,193
Are you going to tell him?

953
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,077
He doesn't need to know my business.

954
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,638
He's going to find out.

955
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,876
What is he going to do, arrest us?

956
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,316
It's supposed to be a big sin
even if you love each other.

957
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,193
Do you believe that?

958
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,995
No.

959
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,954
Me neither.

960
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,273
Private Johnson!

961
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,236
Report to the sergeant
in the orderly's room.

962
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,072
The doctor will have a look at you.

963
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,639
No, I'm feeling okay.

964
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,354
I'm happy to hear it.

965
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,149
You go put some pee-pee in the cup
for Dr. Innis and I'll feel okay too.

966
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,311
You testing me?

967
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:22,435
You and 119 other fortunate individuals.
Put it in gear.

968
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,590
- Take this shit off now.
- You've been talking so much trash today!

969
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,473
You better be good, boy.

970
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,677
"Boy"? You're the good boy.
The man say "fetch" and you fetch.

971
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,079
Just doing my job.

972
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,355
White man's using you
to keep the black man down.

973
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,399
This isn't Houston. We run things now.
Our good day has come.

974
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,199
You chumps haven't had a good day
since the Alamo.

975
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,589
Lupe...

976
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,120
Can you get me Ben Wetzel up in Austin?

977
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,273
Wetbacks again.

978
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,793
Border Patrol?

979
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,275
Mom?

980
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,349
Yeah.

981
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,919
You staying out here?

982
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,548
For a while.

983
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,592
What's she singing about?

984
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,193
What do you think?

985
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,437
Hey, 'morning, sir!

986
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,272
Hey, Pete. How's it going?

987
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,512
Time marches on.

988
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,874
How much you got left?

989
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,359
Three months.

990
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,229
Stop growing that locoweed at your place,
you'd see more daylight.

991
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,709
It was for personal consumption.

992
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,953
You going to smoke an acre and a half
of marijuana?

993
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,712
I got a bad stomach. It helps me to digest.

994
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,075
Your father never bothered me about it.

995
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,592
Leastways not till the drug people
got on his case in the late '60s.

996
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,840
I thought he busted you a couple of times.

997
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,955
No.

998
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,839
Different charge.

999
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,793
I had a still.

1000
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,317
Made my own mescal.
That's how come I ruined my stomach.

1001
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,070
I'm surprised he bothered with it.

1002
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,276
He was afraid I'd poison somebody.

1003
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,629
Your father tried to do good for people.

1004
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,712
- So I've heard.
- And your mother...

1005
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,199
...she was a saint.

1006
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,268
Remember that summer I built that patio
at your house?

1007
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,555
She made me lunch every day.

1008
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,153
You were working there.

1009
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,993
It could have been another box lunch
from the jail.

1010
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,157
So you built our patio
while you were on the county?

1011
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:42,394
Out in the fresh air?
Nice gringo lady making you pies?

1012
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,516
Who'd sit in that jail cell all day?

1013
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,675
<i>Sheriff Buddy, man.
There's no one like him.</i>

1014
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,274
<i>After that cabrón, Charlie Wade.</i>

1015
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,828
I heard Wade was a bit tough
on the Mexicans.

1016
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,631
He murdered Eladio Cruz.
Is that tough enough for you?

1017
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,154
Murdered him?

1018
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,039
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes.

1019
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,158
Shot him in cold blood.

1020
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,310
<i>Charlie Wade was a big asshole.</i>

1021
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,630
Sam...

1022
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,429
Wait up.

1023
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,154
You're out early.

1024
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,473
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.

1025
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,790
Well, I'm working on a few things.

1026
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,749
I'm going over to the other side.

1027
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,948
Republicans?

1028
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,593
No, Mexico.

1029
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,318
Got to talk to someone.

1030
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,552
They got telephones.

1031
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,630
No.

1032
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,632
It's got to be in person.

1033
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,759
The Committee...

1034
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,709
Jorge and Fenton and all, they...

1035
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,599
...they've asked me-

1036
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,035
They want you to stand for sheriff
next election.

1037
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,555
Yeah.

1038
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,553
You'd do a good job.

1039
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,029
Thanks.

1040
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,508
What about you?

1041
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,031
I don't know if I'll still want it.

1042
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,109
I just didn't want to go around your back.

1043
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,958
I appreciate you telling me.

1044
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,753
You think we need a new jail?

1045
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,519
Well, Sam...

1046
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,670
It's a complicated issue.

1047
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,915
Yeah, Ray.

1048
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,231
You'd be a hell of a sheriff.

1049
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,755
Down here...

1050
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,718
...we don't throw everything away
like you gringos do.

1051
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,273
Recycling, right?

1052
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,473
We invented that.

1053
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,993
The government doesn't have
to tell people to do it.

1054
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,277
You own this place, huh?

1055
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,399
This place...

1056
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,591
...the one across the street...

1057
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,948
...three or four others in Ciudad León.

1058
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,958
"King of the Tires. "

1059
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,714
A lot of your people rolling over that bridge
on my rubber.

1060
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,276
You lived in the States for a while?

1061
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,115
Fifteen years.

1062
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,632
Made some money, came back here?

1063
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:23,714
Something like that.

1064
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,156
Hey, you ever know
a fella named Eladio Cruz?

1065
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,469
You're the sheriff of Rio County, right?

1066
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,078
Step across this line.

1067
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,714
You're not the sheriff of nothing anymore.

1068
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,798
<i>Just some tejano with a lot of questions
I don't have to answer.</i>

1069
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,313
A bird flying south...

1070
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,071
...you think he sees this line?

1071
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,830
<i>Rattlesnake,jabalina...</i>

1072
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,233
...whatever you got.

1073
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,675
You think halfway across that line
they start thinking different?

1074
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,798
Why should a man?

1075
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,712
Your government's been pretty happy
to have that line.

1076
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,989
The question's just been where to draw it.

1077
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,913
My government can go fuck itself
and so can yours.

1078
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,910
I'm talking about people here.

1079
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,069
Men.

1080
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,639
Eladio Cruz...

1081
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,995
<i>...is giving his friends a lift one day
in his camión.</i>

1082
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:56,676
<i>But since they're on one side
of this invisible line and not the other...</i>

1083
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,479
<i>...they got to hide
in the back como criminales.</i>

1084
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:03,395
<i>And because over there
he's just another Mex bracero...</i>

1085
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,716
<i>...any man with a badge is his jefe.</i>

1086
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,234
What's in the back?

1087
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,834
<i>Not much,jefe. Some watermelons.</i>

1088
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,316
I'm driving them up to the market.

1089
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,277
They could bring a good price.

1090
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,478
I heard somebody's been hauling wets
on this road.

1091
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,030
I haven't seen anybody doing that.

1092
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,915
That person's been bragging
all over the county...

1093
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,276
...how he doesn't have to cut
that gringo sheriff in on it.

1094
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,675
Run his own operation without any help.

1095
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,434
<i>What's your name?</i>

1096
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,308
Eladio Cruz.

1097
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,073
You know this road's got a bad reputation.

1098
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:52,874
Reputation?

1099
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,632
<i>Bandidos, Injuns.</i>

1100
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,515
Many an unfortunate soul
has been ambushed out on this stretch.

1101
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,830
I hope you're carrying some protection.

1102
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,268
Protection?

1103
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,476
You carrying a firearm, son?

1104
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,273
Don't lie to me now.

1105
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,389
Just a shotgun.

1106
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,554
Just a shotgun.

1107
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,196
Then let me have a look at that.

1108
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,436
Little greaser son of a bitch is running
a goddamn bus service.

1109
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,034
Thinks he can make a fool
out of Charlie Wade.

1110
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,356
Get them wets out of the back.

1111
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,839
See what we've got.

1112
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,633
You killed him!

1113
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,914
You got a talent
for stating the obvious, son.

1114
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:19,749
Steve called for you.

1115
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,795
Steve?

1116
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,755
Steve. Board of Education Steve,
who likes you.

1117
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,950
He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls,
I can tell.

1118
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,760
Spanish. My mother would have
a heart attack.

1119
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,917
Your mother's family is Spanish?

1120
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,718
They go back to Cortés.

1121
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,952
When he was riding by they were squatting
in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.

1122
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:43,710
You've got to be interested in somebody.
All you do is work.

1123
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,952
All my mother does is work.
It's how you get to be Spanish.

1124
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,678
How about this sheriff?

1125
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,115
Sheriff?

1126
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,435
The old high-school heartthrob sheriff?

1127
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,636
I thought you were crazy about each other.

1128
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,950
He's available. You're available.

1129
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,229
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.

1130
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,960
You told me one time it was true love.

1131
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,594
Nobody stays in love for 23 years.

1132
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,555
Let's go.

1133
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,509
Goddamn it.

1134
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,148
Come here. Come on.

1135
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,471
- What the hell are you doing, asshole?
- How old is that girl?

1136
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,516
Get your clothes in order, missy.

1137
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,079
Where's your goddamn sense?

1138
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,674
You got no fucking right!
Stay out of my life!

1139
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,193
Give me the goddamn car keys.

1140
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,633
What should I do with her?

1141
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:08,439
Drive her home. Tell her mother
where we found her.

1142
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,949
- Leave her alone!
- Move it, boy!

1143
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,550
Don't tell my mother. She'll kill me.

1144
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,595
Pilar!

1145
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,273
Don't eye me.

1146
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,395
Git!

1147
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,189
Follow me.

1148
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,279
We thought we were something, didn't we?

1149
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,309
Yeah.

1150
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,874
And I look at my kids in school...

1151
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,830
...10th, 11th-graders.

1152
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,510
That's who we were. Children.

1153
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,395
I mean, what did we know about anything?

1154
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,995
Nothing.

1155
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:12,358
When Nando died...

1156
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,072
...it was so sudden...

1157
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,708
...I kind of went into shock for a while...

1158
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,549
...and then I woke up and...

1159
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:29,831
...there was the rest of my life
and I had no idea what to do with it.

1160
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,909
You know, the other day you asked...

1161
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,958
...why I came back.

1162
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,635
Yeah?

1163
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,670
I came back 'cause you were here.

1164
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,997
My mother hasn't changed a song
since I was 10.

1165
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,710
How come it feels the same?

1166
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,399
I don't know.

1167
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,952
It just feels good.

1168
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,754
Always did.

1169
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:05,395
So...

1170
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,514
What are we going to do about this?

1171
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,029
More...

1172
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,309
...I hope.

1173
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,716
How long have you lived here?

1174
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,869
Two years.

1175
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,030
There's nothing on the walls.

1176
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:03,959
No pictures.

1177
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,953
I don't have kids.

1178
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,673
Other pictures...

1179
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,193
I don't know. It's nothing I want
to look back on.

1180
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,157
Like your story's over.

1181
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,272
I've felt that way...

1182
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:25,876
...yeah.

1183
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,589
It isn't.

1184
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,595
Not by a long shot.

1185
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,308
Pilar...

1186
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,711
What was your father's name?

1187
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,669
Eladio.

1188
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,914
Eladio Cruz.

1189
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,833
That's John Horse.

1190
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,229
The Spanish down in Florida call him...

1191
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,753
..."Juan Caballo. "

1192
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,394
John Horse.

1193
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,958
He a black man or an Indian?

1194
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,029
Both.

1195
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,791
He was part of the Seminole nation.

1196
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,395
Got pushed down into the Florida
Everglades back in pioneer days.

1197
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,993
African people run off from slaveholders...

1198
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,873
...hooked up with them...

1199
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,030
...married up, had children.

1200
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,879
When the Spanish gave up Florida...

1201
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:11,396
...the U.S. Army come down
to move all the Indian people to Oklahoma.

1202
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,033
A couple of them held out.

1203
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,470
That man, John Horse...

1204
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,949
...his friend, Wildcat, another fella named...

1205
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,314
...Osceola...

1206
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,112
...formed a fighting band...

1207
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:24,033
...held out for another 10, 15 years...

1208
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:28,234
...and beat Zach Taylor and 1,000 troops
at Lake Okeechobee.

1209
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,638
So they stayed in Florida?

1210
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:34,632
One night they packed up,
rode out to Mexico.

1211
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,792
Men went to work
for General Santa Anna down there.

1212
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,518
After the Civil War they came north
to Texas, put up at Fort Duncan...

1213
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:49,072
...and the men joined what was called
the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts.

1214
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,435
The best trackers...

1215
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:54,149
...on either side of the border.
They chased after bandits...

1216
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:58,230
...rustlers, Texas rednecks,
Kiowas, Comanches...

1217
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,916
They fought against the Indians?

1218
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,513
Just like they did in Mexico.

1219
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,318
But they were Indians themselves.

1220
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,872
They were in the Army...

1221
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,553
...like your father.

1222
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,112
You know who I am?

1223
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,871
I got a pretty good guess.

1224
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,028
That guy who got shot.

1225
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,754
You didn't go telling your father
you were here?

1226
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,194
Are you kidding?

1227
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,432
And face a court-martial?

1228
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,114
Pretty tough old man.

1229
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,432
Every time he moves up a rank...

1230
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:35,398
...he tightens the screws a little more.
Just 'cause...

1231
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,312
You know, he didn't have...

1232
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:41,918
Didn't have a father.

1233
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,431
He's still pissed off about it.

1234
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,232
When you're his age...

1235
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:53,160
...you'll still be pissed off about him.

1236
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,918
How come you got into this?

1237
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,432
These are our people.

1238
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:07,749
There are Paynes in Florida,
Oklahoma, Piedras Negras-

1239
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,788
So I'm part Indian?

1240
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,872
By blood you are.

1241
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,111
But blood only means what you let it.

1242
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,594
My father says from the day you're born
you start from scratch.

1243
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,350
No breaks.

1244
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,509
No excuses.

1245
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,670
You got to pull yourself up on your own.

1246
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,830
He's living proof of that, son.

1247
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:33,353
Living proof.

1248
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,633
'Morning, Hollis.

1249
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:43,789
Sam!

1250
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:45,108
Sit down.

1251
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,271
Big to-do the other day.

1252
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,835
Meant a lot to folks you said something.

1253
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,596
You thought anymore about our murder?

1254
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:00,109
I wish I could tell you I remembered
something new, but I can't.

1255
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,590
Well, I got an idea what happened.

1256
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:06,949
You do?

1257
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:13,399
I think somewhere between
Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house...

1258
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,550
...Wade ran into Buddy Deeds.

1259
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,550
I think Buddy put a bullet in him.

1260
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,236
Waited for him to die,
threw him in the trunk of the sheriff's car...

1261
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,675
...and drove him out by Fort McKenzie.

1262
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,954
I think he buried him under four feet
of sand and never looked back.

1263
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,635
You lived in the man's house, how long?

1264
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,352
17, 18 years...

1265
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,598
...but didn't get to know him
any better than that.

1266
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,393
I got to go see somebody
up in San Antonio.

1267
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,790
Now, your memory gets any better...

1268
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,911
...I'll be back tonight.

1269
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,038
She finally got up.

1270
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,713
It's Saturday.

1271
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,918
You got in late last night.

1272
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,673
I had some...

1273
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,357
...some school business.

1274
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,034
Could I get this?

1275
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,755
Paloma.

1276
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,156
Nobody really wears that stuff.

1277
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,557
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school
and wore a uniform.

1278
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,870
I only went for my last two years.

1279
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,594
How come?

1280
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,234
My mother wanted
to keep me away from...

1281
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,074
...from boys.

1282
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,234
Did it work?

1283
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,992
Longhorns go for 10 times the price.

1284
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,039
But longhorns are hard
to come by these days.

1285
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,439
Sell much out here?

1286
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,833
How am I going to sell things?
Nobody comes around.

1287
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,832
This stretch of road...

1288
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:06,115
...runs between Nowhere and...

1289
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:08,239
...Not Much Else.

1290
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,070
A hell of a spot to put a business.

1291
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,876
Don't see much competition, do you?

1292
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,395
Used to sell these things like hotcakes.

1293
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:18,595
Now...

1294
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,197
...if it can't play those disks,
they won't look at it.

1295
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:24,913
I like it here.

1296
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,479
Once I tried going
onto the reservation to live.

1297
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:30,278
Couldn't take the politics.

1298
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:33,079
Damn Indians will drive you crazy
with that.

1299
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,231
Now, your father,
this wasn't what he had in mind.

1300
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,112
He come out of Korea...

1301
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,959
...bought a Chevy with too much engine.

1302
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,996
Used to come roaring up and down
this road all hours of the day and night...

1303
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,231
...looking for somebody to race.

1304
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,475
Here.

1305
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,318
Buffalo chips.

1306
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,558
A fella down in Santa Fe told me...

1307
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:07,235
...he sells these as fast
as a buffalo can squeeze them out.

1308
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,520
You think he killed anybody in Korea?

1309
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:20,395
They don't hand those medals out
for hiding in your foxhole.

1310
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:24,559
Would you buy this?

1311
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,710
No.

1312
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,791
Yeah, neither would I.

1313
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,154
If he hadn't found the deputy's job...

1314
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:40,597
...I believe Buddy might've gone down
the other path, got into serious trouble.

1315
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,798
It settled him right down.

1316
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,552
That and your mother.

1317
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,835
Of course, he had that other one later.

1318
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,593
He had another woman?

1319
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,154
Your mother was not one
to be chased off her patch.

1320
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,189
Half the damn county knew about it.

1321
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,231
Nobody thought the worse of her
for seeing it through.

1322
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,878
You know who it was?

1323
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,874
The other one?

1324
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,430
At my age...

1325
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,273
...you learn a new name...

1326
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,271
...you got to forget an old one.

1327
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,715
Here.

1328
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,429
This big fella was sleeping
in a crate at Cisco's junkyard.

1329
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:33,957
When I was going to open
to see what was in her...

1330
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:36,310
...jumped right at my face.

1331
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:40,596
Scared me so bad I had to kill him
without thinking.

1332
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:44,709
Be careful where you go poking.
Who knows what you'll find.

1333
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:23,633
Private Johnson...

1334
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,356
...are you unhappy...

1335
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,269
...in the Army?

1336
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,549
No, sir.

1337
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,036
Then how would you explain...

1338
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,356
...that out of 120 people...

1339
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,311
...you were the only one...

1340
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,595
...who tested positive for drugs?

1341
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,159
I'm sorry, sir.

1342
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:48,119
When you were given
the opportunity to enlist...

1343
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,677
...a kind of contract was agreed upon.

1344
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,479
I think the Army has honored its part...

1345
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,794
...of that agreement.

1346
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:56,835
Yes, sir.

1347
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,520
Do you believe in
what we do in here, Private?

1348
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,917
I can do the job, sir.

1349
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:12,036
What exactly do you think your job is?

1350
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,469
Follow orders, do whatever they say.

1351
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,829
Who's "they"?

1352
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,399
The officers.

1353
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,959
And that's the job?

1354
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,035
Nothing about serving your country?

1355
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,519
These are not trick questions,
Private Johnson.

1356
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,319
You'll get an Article 15...

1357
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,472
...and we'll go through the process
one way or another.

1358
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,389
I'm just trying to understand...

1359
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:41,950
...how someone like you thinks.

1360
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,798
You really want to know?

1361
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:45,915
Please.

1362
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:52,154
It's their country. This is one
of the best deals they offer.

1363
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,790
How do you think I got to be a colonel?

1364
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,628
Being good at your job.
Doing what they tell you.

1365
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,073
Do what they tell you?

1366
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:03,116
I mean, follow orders, sir.

1367
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,630
With your attitude, Private...

1368
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,795
...I'm surprised you want to stay
in the service.

1369
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,469
I do, sir.

1370
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,474
Because it's a job?

1371
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,109
Outside it's such a mess. It's...

1372
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:26,590
Chaos.

1373
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,199
Why do you think...

1374
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,390
...they let us in on the deal?

1375
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,351
'Cause they got people to fight:
Arabs, yellow people, whatever.

1376
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,158
Might as well use us.

1377
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,391
It works like this, Private.

1378
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,510
Every soldier in the war
doesn't have to believe...

1379
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,791
...in what he's fighting for.

1380
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:05,838
Most of them fight just to back up
the other soldiers in their squad.

1381
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,951
You try not to get them killed.

1382
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,349
You try not to get them extra duty.

1383
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:14,035
You try not embarrass yourself...

1384
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,233
...in front of them.

1385
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:31,631
Why don't you start with that?

1386
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,635
Yes, sir.

1387
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:38,915
Dismissed.

1388
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,079
Thank you, sir.

1389
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,112
<i>This time, Fred Zenito for Pager
and the Aggies jump to a 14-point lead.</i>

1390
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:23,470
<i>Sooners back to punt on their own 27.</i>

1391
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:29,237
Longhorns are going to kick some serious
butt this Saturday. You just watch.

1392
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,473
We got a kid, a tailback from
down your way, out of El Indio-

1393
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,479
That's in Maverick County.

1394
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,473
Right, and you're in?

1395
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:38,549
In Rio.

1396
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,552
This kid, Hosea Brown...

1397
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,073
...he does the 40 in 3.4.

1398
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,799
Soft hands, lateral movement,
the whole package.

1399
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,348
- Only a sophomore.
- Still go to all the home games?

1400
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:51,274
Daddy's got his box in the stadium
and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games.

1401
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:54,075
And Friday nights there's high school.

1402
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:57,675
Churchill's got this boy, 6 foot 6,
310, moves like a cat.

1403
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,230
High school, we're talking.
Guess how much he can bench-press?

1404
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,954
Bunny, you...

1405
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,278
You on that same medication?

1406
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,272
- Why, do I seem jumpy?
- No.

1407
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,750
You look good. I was just wondering.

1408
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:13,749
Last year was awful with Mama passing on
and this business with O.J.

1409
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,671
It's not Don Meredith or...

1410
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,718
...one of our boys,
but it kind of threw me for a loop.

1411
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,188
You look good.

1412
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,234
Then that squeaker,
the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma.

1413
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:27,279
That son of a bitch stepped in some
lucky shit before he kicked that goal.

1414
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:31,269
If they hadn't pulled me off that woman,
I'd have jerked a knot in her.

1415
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,359
Were you in a fight?

1416
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,515
Daddy calls it an altercation.

1417
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:40,475
How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.

1418
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,594
No, I'm the same weight I always was.

1419
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,912
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job.
Says so himself:

1420
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:51,192
"Even my son-in-law was better
than this pinhead I got now. "

1421
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,349
Bunny...

1422
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,068
That stuff I left in the garage still there?

1423
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:02,069
Least he never called me that.
With me it was always "high-strung. "

1424
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,630
"Bunny would've done something
with her life if she wasn't so high-strung. "

1425
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,278
Or "tightly wound. "

1426
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,314
You haven't had one of your fires,
have you?

1427
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:15,149
The stuff I left in the garage,
some of it was my father's.

1428
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,797
Did you watch the draft this year?

1429
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:22,471
Of course not. Idiot question.
They try to make it dramatic...

1430
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,358
...like it's a surprise who picks who
in the first round...

1431
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,592
...but they went over it for months
with their experts, computers...

1432
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,678
...doctor's reports, coach's evaluations...

1433
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:36,116
...highlight reels, psychological profiles...

1434
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:41,470
I wouldn't be surprised if they collected
stool samples on them, had them analyzed.

1435
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,993
All that to pick...

1436
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:45,196
...a football player for your squad.

1437
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:50,198
Compared to that, what you know about
a person when you get married to them...

1438
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,635
...doesn't amount to diddly, does it?

1439
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:56,998
No, I suppose not.

1440
01:43:57,480 --> 01:44:00,950
You kind of bought yourself
a pig in a poke, didn't you?

1441
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:06,670
The whole time we were seeing each other,
you didn't know that I was tightly wound.

1442
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,951
It wasn't just you, Bunny.

1443
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:11,712
No, it wasn't, was it?

1444
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,476
You didn't exactly throw yourself
into it heart and soul.

1445
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:22,836
Your shit's still in the garage,
if that's what you came for.

1446
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,511
Three hundred and fifty pounds.

1447
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:44,029
That boy Churchill's got.
He plays tackle both ways.

1448
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,590
Bench-presses 350 pounds.

1449
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:54,158
Imagine having that much weight on you,
pressing down.

1450
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:56,800
Be hard to breathe, hard to swallow.

1451
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:01,874
I think they have another fella there
to keep it off your chest.

1452
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:04,955
A spotter.

1453
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,356
"I only got my little girl now," he says.

1454
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,198
"She's my lifeline. "

1455
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,788
Then he says I can't sit in the box anymore
if I don't control myself.

1456
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,269
Son of a bitch!

1457
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,318
He doesn't even watch the games,
just sits there drinking.

1458
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:22,992
Looks up at the TV now and then.

1459
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:26,629
I'd be better off in the cheap seats
with some real football people.

1460
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,072
You look good, Bunny.

1461
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,158
It was nice to see you.

1462
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,675
Thanks.

1463
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:39,869
I like it when you say that, Sam.

1464
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,713
"Dearest Buddy. "

1465
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,918
Hey, it's the general.

1466
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,755
Colonel. Is Otis in?

1467
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,512
- Come on in.
- If it's too late-

1468
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,794
Come on in.

1469
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:37,232
Otis is sitting up with some people
at the club. I don't think he'll be long.

1470
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,998
His hot sauce recipe
won a contest last year.

1471
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,072
They're selling it as far away...

1472
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,479
...as San Antonio.

1473
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,874
You've been in this house for a while?

1474
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:59,798
I've been here with him eight years.
He built it when he was with Leora.

1475
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:02,039
Never met her.

1476
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:05,070
There's a bunch of them you never met.

1477
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:06,832
Well, me neither.

1478
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,830
Let me show you around.

1479
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,591
He got into this cowboys-and-Indians stuff
a while back.

1480
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,359
Spent half his time poking...

1481
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,749
...around the library, way up to Austin.

1482
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,676
Kind of like a shrine, isn't it?

1483
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,716
Where did he get all this stuff?

1484
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,757
Your mother's got a brother, Alphonse.

1485
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,430
Uncle Al.

1486
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:06,195
Otis stood on good terms with him.
Whenever you make the news...

1487
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,639
...he sends it on.

1488
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,157
When they made you general...

1489
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:13,033
...Otis almost drove away
our customers going on about it.

1490
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:14,394
I'm a colonel.

1491
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:15,915
I know.

1492
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,313
The man made me memorize
the whole Army chain of command...

1493
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:21,038
...before he'd marry me.

1494
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,639
My mother said that
he never asked about me.

1495
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,592
He never asked her.

1496
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,313
Tell him I stopped by?

1497
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:43,955
Thanks.

1498
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,508
Catch you later...

1499
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,395
...Colonel.

1500
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,432
<i>Seòora Cruz.</i>

1501
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:28,869
Who is it?

1502
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:35,318
What are you doing out here?
Are you crazy?

1503
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,080
In English. We're in the United States.

1504
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:45,915
I have some friends
and they have had an accident.

1505
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:49,549
- You have somebody else out there?
- We was...

1506
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:53,235
...by the river and I heard my friend
calling for help...

1507
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,079
...and I look...

1508
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,431
...and she has fallen in the water.

1509
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,431
Don't tell me lies. What happened?

1510
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,110
We was crossing the river.

1511
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,311
What are you doing out there?

1512
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,715
Wait. Who are they?
Why bring them here?

1513
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,439
<i>I need help, seòora.</i>

1514
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,752
I'll call Border Patrol.
They'll get her to the hospital.

1515
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,589
You think you're doing
these people a favor?

1516
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:29,319
What are they going to do?
They get on welfare...

1517
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,152
...or they become criminals.

1518
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,117
This girl is a friend of yours?

1519
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,473
I thought you were married.

1520
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:05,719
I am married to the cousin of a friend
but only to live here.

1521
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,878
This is the mother of my child.

1522
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,629
Typical.

1523
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:21,675
Homework?

1524
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:24,879
I finished that.

1525
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:26,752
I'm just messing around.

1526
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:31,829
Tanks, huh?

1527
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:33,754
Yeah, well...

1528
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:37,715
If you've got to be in the Army,
better to have something slick to drive.

1529
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:38,755
So...

1530
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,632
You're going in the Army?

1531
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,316
That's the general plan, isn't it?

1532
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:52,953
That's up to you.

1533
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,950
The Army isn't for everybody.

1534
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,639
It's not that I think
you wouldn't be good at it.

1535
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:10,235
You know...

1536
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:16,672
I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided
to do something else with your life.

1537
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:20,309
You wouldn't?

1538
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:23,590
No.

1539
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,271
How's your room shaping up?

1540
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:39,910
It's fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

1541
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,115
Good.

1542
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,117
Are we ever going to see your father?

1543
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,755
My father?

1544
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:51,274
He lives here, right?

1545
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,475
Yes, he does.

1546
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,473
Maybe we'll...

1547
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:03,918
We'll fix that thing out back and have...

1548
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,309
...a barbecue.

1549
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,592
We could invite him and...

1550
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:09,272
...and his wife over.

1551
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,112
He makes his own sauce.

1552
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,753
<i>Let's go! Hurry up!</i>

1553
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,031
Everybody in the world will see.

1554
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,832
He was a doctor on the other side.

1555
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:22,829
Don't worry about it.

1556
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:26,192
He owes me a few favors.

1557
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,473
In English, Enrique. In English!

1558
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,749
Hollis!

1559
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:46,715
Hollis!

1560
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,359
You in there?

1561
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:15,115
Fellas.

1562
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,233
You're open late.

1563
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,599
I'm not open. We're just talking.

1564
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,871
So, Hollis probably told you.

1565
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,277
We found Charlie Wade.

1566
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:41,633
Is that right?

1567
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:46,030
Start digging holes in this county,
no telling what'll come up.

1568
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:49,751
You two saw it, didn't you?

1569
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,949
You two saw it when Buddy killed him.

1570
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,189
I'm going to find out one way or the other.

1571
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,712
Your father had the finest sense
of justice...

1572
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,757
...of any man I've ever known.

1573
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:09,151
And my mother was a saint.

1574
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,919
For 15 years the whole damn town...

1575
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,800
...knew he had another woman on the side.

1576
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:22,834
He stole $10,000
and set her up in business...

1577
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,632
...but hell, what's that?

1578
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:27,590
You got a problem, old Buddy'll fix it.

1579
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:30,196
You facing some time in jail?

1580
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,313
Buddy'll knock half of it off,
if you do what he says when he says.

1581
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,034
You got some business
that's not exactly legal?

1582
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,269
Just talk to Buddy.

1583
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:40,349
Buddy Deeds-

1584
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,192
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.

1585
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,479
That night at the cafe...

1586
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,877
...he didn't stay long after you left,
did he, Hollis?

1587
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:52,992
Maybe he'd decided
he'd gone too far with Wade.

1588
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:56,356
He figured he'd better not wait
for the sheriff to get behind him.

1589
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:58,954
So he stepped out to see
if he could catch up...

1590
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,669
...and you were here that night...

1591
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:06,878
...weren't you, "O"?

1592
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:09,948
I was here.

1593
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:16,517
I'd been running a game
on the side after hours.

1594
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:19,474
Craps.

1595
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:22,310
Draw poker on the weekends.

1596
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,870
Roderick didn't know about it.

1597
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,153
More important...

1598
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:31,280
...Charlie Wade didn't know about it...

1599
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:34,518
...'cause I didn't want to cut him in on it.

1600
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:39,237
I was pretty full of myself
back in those days.

1601
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:44,029
Hell, I just didn't expect the man so early.

1602
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:50,830
Wade!

1603
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:38,469
Sheriff Charlie was the whip hand
for old Judge Tibbs...

1604
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:41,593
...who pretty much owned
this county back then.

1605
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:44,431
If the truth came out...

1606
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:47,600
...he wasn't going to go easy on Hollis.

1607
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:52,679
I don't know why I trusted Buddy with it...

1608
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:56,076
...don't know why he trusted me.

1609
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:01,072
The first time I talked with him...

1610
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:03,116
...was right there and then...

1611
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:07,914
...with a dead white man leaking blood
on the floor between us.

1612
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:12,228
The three of us cleaned up
and took him out by the post...

1613
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,399
...and put him under.

1614
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:17,511
I can't say I was much help.

1615
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,792
And the $10,000?

1616
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:22,193
Widow's benefits.

1617
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,599
He figured it'd make
the disappearance look better.

1618
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:29,349
And Mercedes was scraping by
after Charlie killed her man.

1619
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:31,994
Buddy and her...

1620
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:34,196
...didn't get hooked up until later.

1621
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,792
Time went on...

1622
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:38,871
...people liked the story we told...

1623
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:41,474
...better than what the truth
might have been.

1624
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:44,232
It's your call, Sam.

1625
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:49,038
I don't think the Rangers are likely to...

1626
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:52,199
...find out any more
than they already know.

1627
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:56,752
And as for me...

1628
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:02,799
...it's just one of your unsolved mysteries.

1629
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:14,035
Word gets out who the body was...

1630
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,116
...people'll think Buddy done it.

1631
02:02:20,280 --> 02:02:22,191
Buddy's a goddamn legend.

1632
02:02:23,960 --> 02:02:25,518
He can handle it.

1633
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:32,873
'Night, fellas.

1634
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:01,591
When does the picture start?

1635
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:07,996
Are you going to tell your mother
we've been seeing each other?

1636
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,516
She'll find out sooner or later.

1637
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:14,150
I don't have to ask permission anymore,
if that's what you mean.

1638
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,394
You have any idea when your father died?

1639
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:23,435
Eladio?

1640
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:26,915
Couple of months before I was born.

1641
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,391
Try a year and half.

1642
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:54,199
Buddy bought the cafe for her
with money he took from the county.

1643
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,756
They can't pull this on me.

1644
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,193
It's not fair.

1645
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:08,833
I don't believe this.

1646
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,718
He paid the hospital bill
when you were born.

1647
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,188
Your mother...

1648
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:25,951
...she always called you...

1649
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,152
..."a beautiful daughter"...

1650
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:31,356
...in the letters she wrote to him.

1651
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,919
From the first time I saw you at school...

1652
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:53,869
...all those years we were married
to other people, I always felt...

1653
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:56,751
...like we were connected.

1654
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:03,152
I remember thinking...

1655
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:07,035
...you were the one part of my life...

1656
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:09,996
...that Buddy didn't have a piece of.

1657
02:05:11,120 --> 02:05:13,315
I can't have any more children.

1658
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:16,110
After Amado, I had complications.

1659
02:05:16,200 --> 02:05:19,636
I can't get pregnant anymore,
if that's what the rule is about.

1660
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,834
So that's it?

1661
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:29,469
You won't want to be with me anymore?

1662
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:34,359
If I met you...

1663
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:38,076
...for the first time today...

1664
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:41,311
...I'd still want to be with you.

1665
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:48,472
Start from scratch?

1666
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:50,790
Yeah.

1667
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:55,193
All that other stuff and all that history...

1668
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:57,798
...the hell with it, right?

1669
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:05,073
Forget the Alamo.
