a haven before...

a peaceful summer...

00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,804
I was writing a poem.

628
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,639
LOLITA:
Mm-hm?

629
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,183
What's it about?

630
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,976
It's about people.

631
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,436
LOLITA:
Hmm.

632
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,605
That's a novel subject.

633
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:23,360
You know, it's funny, it sort of looked
like a diary when I came in.

634
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:28,615
I always write my poems in a diary.
It's one of my little idiosyncrasies.

635
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,949
LOLITA:
Mm.

636
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,997
Afraid somebody's gonna steal your ideas
and sell them to Hollywood?

637
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,459
Perhaps. Would you like me
to read you some poetry?

638
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,544
Sure, why not?

639
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,048
This is my favorite poet.

640
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,885
- It was...
- Who's the poet?

641
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,929
The divine Edgar.

642
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,056
Who's the divine Edgar? Edgar who?

643
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,266
- Edgar Allan Poe, of course.
- Mm.

644
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,894
It was night in the lonesome October

645
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,647
Of my most immemorial year

646
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,316
Notice how he emphasizes this word.

647
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,444
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber

648
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,239
In the misty mid region of Weir

649
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,118
You see, he takes a word like "dim"
in one line and twists it, you see?

650
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,079
And it comes back as
"mid region of Weir."

651
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,707
"Mid region," and twists it to "dim."

652
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,377
That's pretty good, pretty clever.

653
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,797
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her

654
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,967
And conquered her scruples and gloom

655
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,803
And we passed to the end of the vista

656
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,431
But were stopped by the door of a tomb

657
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,267
And I said,
"What is written, sweet sister?"

658
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,563
She replied, "Ulalume, Ulalume"

659
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,650
Well, I think it's a little corny,
to tell you the truth.

660
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,652
What do you object to?

661
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,948
Well, the "vista-sister,"
that's like "Lolita-sweeter."

662
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,868
That's very true.
That's a very acute observation.

663
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:58,288
If you were in my class
I would give you an A-plus.

664

Tell me, was Mona Farlow annoyed
when you left her party last night?

665
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,464
Mona? Annoyed? Heh, heh.

666
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,884

You were absolutely right
when you warned me...

...that I was getting too liberal
with her about boys.

that isolation from boys...

01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:13,828
What's the routine,
are we going home now or what?

1104
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:18,041
No, dear. We should be in Briceland
by dinnertime and I've no doubt that...

1105
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:22,003
...we shall find some comfortable hotel
to spend the night...

1106
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:26,174
...and then tomorrow morning
we'll press on towards Lepingsville.

1107
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:31,596
Did you have a marvelous summer?

1108
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,515
Yeah, I guess so.

1109
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:36,392
Were you sorry to leave?

1110
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,894
Not exactly.

1111
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,908
You know, I've missed you terribly.

1112
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:56,788
I haven't missed you. In fact,
I've been revoltingly unfaithful to you.

1113
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,122
Oh?

1114
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:01,667
But it doesn't matter a bit,
because you've stopped caring anyway.

1115
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,213
What makes you say
I've stopped caring for you?

1116
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,633
You haven't even kissed me yet,
have you?

1117
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:22,563
Hello, Mr. Swine.

1118
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:26,609
Hello, Mr. Quilty. Good evening, ma'am.
Did you get any good pictures today?

1119
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,945
Yeah, great. I'm having a swell vacation.

1120
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:30,321
Good.

1121
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,741
Mr. Swine, would you mind
if I asked you a personal question?

1122
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,368
Sure, go ahead.

1123
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:38,913
What is a guy like you
doing in a job like this?

1124
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,623
What do you mean?

1125
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,000
Well, you just don't seem to be the type.

1126
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:44,710
[CHUCKLES]

1127
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:47,797
Well, as a matter of fact, I was an actor.

1128
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,799
I knew it. Didn't I say to you?

1129
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,509
When I first saw you, you had...

1130
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,303
...a sort of aura that all actors
and actresses have.

1131
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:59,225
Well, since you're a playwright, uh,
maybe you could use me sometime.

1132
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:02,687
Yeah, maybe I could use you sometime.

1133
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,272
Mr. Swine...

1134
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,649
...what does an actor-manager...

1135
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,819
...do with his spare time
in a small town like this?

1136
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,613
Well, I don't have much spare time...

1137
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,367
...but I swim, play tennis, lift weights.

1138
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:18,703
Gets rid of the excess energy.

1139
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,956
What do you do
with your excess energy?

1140
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,126
Well, we do a lot of things
with my excess energy.

1141
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,503
One of the things we do a lot of is judo.

1142
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:29,839
- Did you ever hear about that?
- Judo?

1143
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,216
- Yes, I've heard about it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1144
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:34,010
You do judo with the lady?

1145
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:38,389
Yes, she's a yellow belt, I'm a green belt,
that's the way nature made it.

1146
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,184
What happens is she throws me
all over the place.

1147
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:42,518
She throws you?

1148
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:46,731
What she does, she gets me in a sort
of thing called a sweeping-ankle throw.

1149
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,566
She sweeps my ankles from under me.

1150
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:51,235
- I go down with one hell of a bang.
- Doesn't it hurt?

1151
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:54,071
I lay there in pain but I love it.
I really love it.

1152
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:58,409
I lay hovering between consciousness
and unconsciousness. It's the greatest.

1153
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,332
Wow.

1154
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,083
This looks swank.

1155
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,590
- See you later.
- Okay.

1156
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:17,053
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir. Can I help you?

1157
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,431
Yes, I'd like a room with a bath,
or, rather, two rooms with baths.

1158
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,433
Did you have a reservation, Mr...?

1159
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,936
Humbert is the name.
No, I have no reservation.

1160
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,939
Well, I'm afraid it'll be impossible
to accommodate you.

1161
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:29,815
This convention's got us
tied up in knots.

1162
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:32,151
- Oh.
- ls it just you and the girl?

1163
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,446
Yes. I would like you to accommodate us
because we're very tired.

1164
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,864
Mr. Potts.

1165
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:38,449
Yes, Mr. Swine?

1166
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,952
What about Captain Love?
Has he called?

1167
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,912
He's canceled his reservation.

1168
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,582
Well, I could give you 242.
Uh, it's a lovely room...

1169
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:49,335
...but it's only got one bed.

1170
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:53,673
Well, perhaps you can find a folding bed
or a camp bed.

1171
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,508
Potts, do we have any cots?

1172
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,677
No, the troopers have
snapped them all up.

1173
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:01,806
I'm sure you'd find one room satisfactory.
Our double beds are really triple.

1174
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,100
One night we had three ladies
sleeping in one.

1175
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,393
I'm sure we'll manage.

1176
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:09,146
Even if my wife joins me later,
we'll manage even then, I'm sure.

1177
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:12,275
- Good. Would you mind registering?
- Certainly.

1178
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,905
By the way, what sort of a convention
are you holding here?

1179
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:22,785
We are very proud to have the overflow
of the State Police Convention.

[CHUCKLES]

Perhaps if you just left them on the floor
that would be all right.

1182
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:49,687
Oh, oh....

1183
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,648
Well, you can just....

1184
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:54,191
Yes, that's fine.

1185
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:57,737
Thank you very much.

1186
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,072
Thank you, sir.

1187
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,080
Well?

1188
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,833
Is, uh, this it?

1189
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,627
You mean, uh...?

1190
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,713
Yeah.

1191
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,633
Yes.

1192
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:24,472
But you see, I'm quite sure
that they'll manage to find a cot for us.

1193
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,516
I asked them downstairs in the lobby
to find a cot.

1194
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,561
- A cot?
- Yes.

1195
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,605
You're crazy.

1196
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,482
Why, my darling?

1197
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:38,069
Because, my darling,
when my darling mother finds out...

1198
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:41,238
...she's going to divorce you
and strangle me.

1199
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,035
Yes. Now, look, Lo.

1200
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:49,497
I have a great feeling of...

1201
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,957
...tenderness for you.

1202
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,920
While your mother is ill,
I'm responsible for your welfare.

We're not rich, and while we travel
we shall be obliged....

We shall be thrown
a good deal together.

inevitably enter into a kind of...

...how shall I say, a kind of, um....

You're addressing me.

I thought perhaps
there was someone with you.

1215

No, I'm not really with someone.
I'm with you. Ha, ha.

1216
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,182
I didn't mean that as an insult.

1217
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,477
What I meant was that
I'm with the state police here, and...

1218
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:37,938
...when I'm with them, I'm with someone,
but right now I'm on my own.

1219
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:40,441
I mean, I'm not with a lot of people,
just you. Heh.

1220
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:44,862
Well, I wouldn't like to disturb you.
I'll, uh, leave you alone if you prefer it.

1221
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:49,325
You don't really have to go at all.
I like it. I don't know what it is.

1222
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:52,703
I get the impression you want to leave
but you don't like to leave...

1223
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:56,999
...because you think I'd think it looks
suspicious, me being a policeman and all.

1224
01:19:57,167 --> 01:20:00,795
You don't have to think that because
I haven't got a suspicious mind at all.

1225
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:05,299
A lot of people think I'm suspicious,
especially when I stand on street corners.

1226
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,051
One of our boys picked me up once.

1227
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,346
He thought that I was too suspicious
standing on the street corner.

1228
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,724
Tell me, I couldn't help noticing
when you checked in tonight...

1229
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:16,393
It's part of my job,
I notice human individuals...

1230
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,020
...and I noticed your face.

1231
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,855
I said to myself when I saw you...

1232
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:23,526
...there's a guy with the most
normal-looking face I ever saw in my life.

1233
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:24,944
That's very nice of you.

1234
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:28,322
Not a bit. It's great to see a normal face,
because I'm a normal guy.

1235
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,949
Be great for two normal guys...

1236
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:33,244
...to get together and talk about
world events, in a normal way.

1237
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:37,039
There's nothing I would like better
than that, but I don't have much time.

1238
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,750
It's a pity, because, uh, may I say
one other thing to you?

1239
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,752
I've been thinking about it a lot.

1240
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,422
I noticed when you was checking in
you had a lovely little girl with you.

1241
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:46,590
She was really lovely.

1242
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:49,844
She wasn't so little, come to think of it.
She was fairly tall....

1243
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:53,097
Taller than little, you know,
but, uh, she was really lovely.

1244
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:56,267
I wish I had a pretty, tall,
lovely little girl like that...

1245
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:57,601
That was my daughter.

1246
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:00,396
Your daughter?
Isn't it great to have a lovely, tall...

1247
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,107
...pretty little daughter like that?
It's wonderful.

1248
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,360
I don't have any children or boys
or little tall girls.

1249
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:07,987
I'm not even... Are you married?

1250
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,906
Yes, I'm expecting my wife,

from your wife.

I'd take every opportunity to get away.

that my wife won't join me...

she was not well.

Aw, gee. What was the matter
with your wife?

Is she coming later, or something?

...Mr. George Swine, who I happen
to know as a personal friend...

have a word with George Swine.

a word in his ear...

what things could happen.

He'd probably turn some troopers out,
so you could have a lovely room...

for you and your lovely girl.

It's his job to fix you up
with something nice.

He gets paid for doing that thing...

1281

...and when he sees a guy like you,
all normal...

1282
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:40,371
...with a lovely girl,
he should say to himself:

1283
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:44,333
"I gotta give that guy a lovely sort of
comfortable, foamy bed to sleep in."

1284
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:48,545
I don't like to hear things like that,
because I could go take a swipe at him...

1285
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:52,174
...for not giving you a lovely, comfortable,
sleepy, movie-star bed.

and take it in for a second...

George Swine? It would be simple.

perhaps we won't make it this evening.

1403
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:25,432
We got off to rather a slow start,
remember?

1404
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,602
Mm. Can we go to a movie tonight?

1405
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:30,687
If that's what you'd like.

1406
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,188
I would.

1407
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:38,695
Have you ever seen any of those...
You know, those, um, foreign films?

1408
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:40,655
Yes, frequently.

1409
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,366
- I don't like them.
- Oh?

LOLITA:
Mm-mm.

Will you stop at the next gas station?

1412
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,334
All right.

1413
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:57,005
- You're feeling all right, aren't you?
- Mm-hm.

1414
01:33:57,173 --> 01:34:00,425
I feel fine.
I want to call Mother at that hospital.

1415
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,302
What's the number?

1416
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,351
Well, don't you know the number?

1417
01:34:11,395 --> 01:34:15,815
I think it will be just as well if you wait
until we get to Lepingsville.

1418
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:18,902
Why? What difference does it make?
I wanna call her.

1419
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,571
I just don't think it'd be
a very good idea.

1420
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:24,324
Why can't I call my mother if I want to?

1421
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:27,035
Because you can't.

1422
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:28,453
Why?

1423
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,708
Because...

1424
01:34:35,878 --> 01:34:37,212
...your mother is dead.

Come on now, cut it out.
Why can't I call her?

Everything's going to be all right.

Nothing will ever be all right.

I'm sure that we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

But everything has changed
all of a sudden.

We'll do things. We'll go places.

But there's no place to go back to.

1438

We'll find a new home.

Where?

1440
01:36:43,422 --> 01:36:44,923
Beardsley.

- Beardsley?
- My lectureship starts in September.

It's in Ohio. You'll like it there.

I'll hate it. I know I will.

No, you won't. It's a wonderful place.

But what about all my things
back in Ramsdale?

And the house?

We'll take care of all those things.

What things do you want specially?

My record player and my records.

We'll send for them, but in the meantime,
I can buy you new ones...

Oh. Yeah, well, we stopped there
for a malt afterwards.

What difference does it make?

You were sitting at a table
with two boys.

1491
01:39:51,777 --> 01:39:54,237
Roy and Rex just happened
to sit down with us.

Roy and Rex?

What do you mean, no dates?
They just sat down at our table.

I don't want you around them.
They're nasty-minded boys.

Ho, ho. You're a fine one to talk
about someone else's mind.

1498
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:14,757
Don't avoid the issue.
I told you no dates.

1499
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,677
- It wasn't a date.
- It was a date.

- It was not a date.
- It was a date.

It wasn't a date.

Your piano lesson?
I thought that was on Wednesday.

"Ask Michele,"
that's what you always say.

1512

Well, now for a change, I'm going
to ask you something about Michele.

1513
01:40:50,294 --> 01:40:53,546
Heh, heh. You can't have her.
She belongs to a Marine.

1514
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:56,382
I will ignore that idiotic joke.

1515
01:40:57,259 --> 01:41:01,220
Why does she give me searching looks
whenever she comes to the house?

1516
01:41:01,388 --> 01:41:02,764
How should I know?

1517
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:04,932
Have you told her anything about us?

1518
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:06,768
No, have you?

1519
01:41:06,935 --> 01:41:09,854
- You've told her nothing?
- Do you think I'm crazy?

1520
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:14,817
You spend too much time with that girl.
I don't want you to see her so often.

1521
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:19,530
Come on, she's the only friend I've got
in this stinking world.

1522
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:21,866
You never let me have any fun.

No fun? You have all the fun in the world.
We have fun together, don't we?

Whenever you want something
I buy it for you automatically.

I take you to concerts,
to museums, to movies.

Still love me?

Completely. You know that.

1533
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:13,584
You know what I want more
than anything else in the world?

1534
01:42:13,752 --> 01:42:15,628
No. What do you want?

1535
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:18,840
I want you to be proud of me.

1536
01:42:19,174 --> 01:42:21,384
But I am proud of you, Lolita.

1537
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:24,303
No, I mean really proud of me.

1538
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:26,889
They want me for the lead
in the school play.

1539
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:28,641
Isn't that fantastic?

1540
01:42:28,892 --> 01:42:31,602
I have to have a letter from you,
giving your permission.

1541

Who wants you?

1542
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:37,942
Well, Edusa Gold, the drama teacher,
Clare Quilty and Vivian Darkbloom.

1543
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:39,193
And who might they be?

1544

The authors. They're here
to supervise the production.

1545
01:42:42,364 --> 01:42:43,865
But you've never acted before.

1546
01:42:44,032 --> 01:42:46,033
They say I have a unique and rare talent.

1547
01:42:46,201 --> 01:42:47,577
And how do they know that?

1548
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:50,580
We had readings and I was chosen
over 30 other girls.

1549
01:42:50,747 --> 01:42:52,915
That's the first I've heard about it.

1550
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,418
I know, I wanted to surprise you.

1551
01:42:55,586 --> 01:42:58,588
And I suppose that Roy has a part
in this production?

1552
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:00,423
Roy? What's he got to do with this?

1553
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:03,759
Roy and Rex, naturally,
I suppose they're in it.

1554
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:06,262
Well, how do I know?
I only met them yesterday.

are an actress. It's out of the question.

- I don't want you in that atmosphere.

with those boys.

the door to me...

...on the way to her piano lesson...

until your arrival.

1587
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:05,965
Dr. Humbert, would you mind
if I am putting to you the blunt question?

1588
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:08,509
No, by all means do so.

instructed Lolita in the facts of life?

You see, Lolita is a sweet little child...

1592
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:23,941
...but the onset of maturity seems
to be giving her...

1593
01:45:24,109 --> 01:45:26,360
...a certain amount of trouble.

01:45:27,654 --> 01:45:30,406

the little girl what is cradled in the arms...

...and she has got the curvatures
which they take a lot of notice of.

You and I, what are we?

We are symbols of power,
sitting in our offices.

But if we cast our minds back....

1606

Yesterday, Dr. Humbert...

1607
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:09,487
...you and I were little High School Jim...

1608
01:46:09,654 --> 01:46:12,239
...and we were carrying
High School Jane's schoolbooks.

1609

You remember those days?

I am a lecturer in French literature.

I would like to put to you, Dr. Humbert.

or she has no control at all."

We cannot decide which.

Added to that, just yesterday,
uh, Dr. Humbert...

...she wrote a most obscene word

...on the health pamphlet.

from acute repression of the libido...

and the successful child rearing.

I am suggesting...

1639
01:47:56,511 --> 01:48:01,140
...that Dr. Cudler, who is the district
psychologist to the Board of Education...

1640
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:05,478
...should visit you in the home with
his three-member board of psychologists...

1641
01:48:05,645 --> 01:48:09,190
...and once they are in the home
they can investigate thoroughly...

...in the home situation,
with all four of them.

Mm. The... ? The home situation?

1644
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:23,037
So that they can get straight
at the source of the repression.

1645
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:25,956
But she's not being repressed,
Dr. Zemph.

1646

from this which is quite clear:

01:51:38,441 --> 01:51:41,944
I know what you mean,
but weren't the boys and girls charming?

1705
01:51:42,112 --> 01:51:45,114
They were, weren't they?
And particularly little Lolita.

1706
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:48,117
She was quite perfect.
You must be awfully proud of her.

1707
01:51:48,284 --> 01:51:51,745
Yes, I am. You know, her performance
took me completely by surprise.

1708
01:51:51,913 --> 01:51:54,456
She made me promise not to watch
any of the rehearsals.

1709
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,417
They're so intense at that age.

1710
01:51:56,584 --> 01:51:58,377
She must have worked awfully hard.

1711
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:00,921
No wonder you decided
to suspend her piano lessons.

1712

After all, there are only...

"suspend her piano lessons"?

Yes.

1715
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:09,388
- Do you play, Dr. Humbert?
- Well, hardly at all now.

1716
01:52:09,556 --> 01:52:11,765
Didn't she have a lesson with you
last Saturday?

1717
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:14,351
- No.
- Nor the preceding Saturday?

1718
01:52:14,519 --> 01:52:16,812
No. She called to say
she was busy rehearsing.

1719
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:18,272
Busy rehearsing?

1720
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:21,567
As a matter of fact,
she hasn't had a lesson for...

...let me see, four weeks.

I hope I haven't spoken out of turn.

No, no, not at all.
I must have misunderstood, that's all.

1724
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:33,620
By the way, Dr. Humbert,
there's so few people in Beardsley...

1725
01:52:33,788 --> 01:52:36,415
...who appreciate music,
I was wondering, sometime...

1726
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:39,501
...if you'd like to come by
and I could play something for you.

1727

Yes, of course, certainly I will.
Thank you. Excuse me now.

- How did you like it?

1730
01:52:52,849 --> 01:52:54,683
There's a party for the cast and author.

1731
01:52:54,851 --> 01:52:57,519
- Everybody's invited.
- I must take Lolita home.

1732

- Our starlet's had enough excitement.

It's really gonna be fun.

I wouldn't want you to miss
any more piano lessons.

How do you think I know?

She told me. I saw her tonight.

Yeah.

these afternoons?

I must say I wouldn't blame you
if you were.

2152
02:20:42,725 --> 02:20:45,269
A fine thing, me dropping out of sight
for so long...

2153
02:20:45,437 --> 02:20:47,354
...and then writing you for a handout.

2154
02:20:47,522 --> 02:20:49,940
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you...

2155
02:20:50,108 --> 02:20:51,733
Or a drink, maybe?

2156
02:20:52,026 --> 02:20:53,068
No.

2157
02:20:53,528 --> 02:20:56,363
Ugh. I won't be able to do that
in another month.

2158
02:20:56,531 --> 02:20:57,698
Is that him?

2159
02:20:58,491 --> 02:20:59,616
The one facing us.

2160
02:20:59,784 --> 02:21:01,368
Yes, that's Dick.

2161
02:21:03,163 --> 02:21:05,122
He doesn't know a thing
about you and me...

2162
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:06,748
...so please watch what you say.

2163
02:21:06,916 --> 02:21:10,043
That's ridiculous. You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

2164
02:21:10,211 --> 02:21:13,172
Why not?
You don't think I'd tell him, do you?

2165
02:21:13,465 --> 02:21:15,591
Who does he think that I am?

2166
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:17,217
My stepfather.

2167
02:21:21,931 --> 02:21:24,725
Then this isn't the man who took you
from the hospital?

2168
02:21:24,893 --> 02:21:26,059
No, of course not.

2169
02:21:28,188 --> 02:21:30,022
How long have you known him?

2170
02:21:30,190 --> 02:21:34,151
About a year. I met him in Phoenix.
I was working as a waitress.

2171
02:21:34,944 --> 02:21:37,237
Who is the man that I'm looking for?

2172
02:21:37,405 --> 02:21:40,782
There's no point in going into that.
It's all over.

2173
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:42,659
Lolita, I have to know.

2174
02:21:43,286 --> 02:21:45,078
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

2175
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,082
Lolita, I have a perfect right
to know this.

2176
02:21:50,251 --> 02:21:53,212
Criminy! I should never
have written to you.

2177
02:21:54,339 --> 02:21:57,049
You wouldn't have written
if you hadn't needed the money.

2178
02:21:57,217 --> 02:21:59,134
Now, if you're a sensible girl...

2179
02:21:59,302 --> 02:22:01,595
...and if you want
what I've come to give you...

2180
02:22:01,763 --> 02:22:03,847
...you'll tell me what I want to know.

2181
02:22:09,437 --> 02:22:11,605
Do you remember Dr. Zemph?

2182
02:22:12,357 --> 02:22:13,899
Dr. Zemph?

2183
02:22:14,275 --> 02:22:17,903
That German psychologist
that came to see you at Beardsley.

2184
02:22:18,571 --> 02:22:20,113
Was it him?

2185
02:22:20,281 --> 02:22:21,281
Not exactly.

2186
02:22:21,449 --> 02:22:24,034
I didn't come here
to play guessing games.

2187
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:25,661
Tell me who it was.

2188
02:22:25,828 --> 02:22:27,621
Well, give me a chance to explain.

2189
02:22:27,789 --> 02:22:28,997
All right.

2190
02:22:29,958 --> 02:22:32,417
You remember that car
that used to follow us around?

2191
02:22:32,794 --> 02:22:34,920
I'm not likely to forget that in a hurry.

2192
02:22:36,881 --> 02:22:39,883
Do you remember Mother's old flame
at the school dance?

2193
02:22:40,051 --> 02:22:42,469
No, you probably wouldn't
remember him.

2194
02:22:43,555 --> 02:22:47,683
You remember the guy that you talked to
at that hotel on the way back from camp?

2195
02:22:47,850 --> 02:22:50,769
He pretended he was part
of that police convention.

2196
02:22:50,937 --> 02:22:52,813
Vaguely, yes.

2197
02:22:55,066 --> 02:22:58,151
And do you remember that guy
who called you at the motel?

2198
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:00,195
The night you disappeared?

2199
02:23:00,697 --> 02:23:02,447
Yes, I remember him very well.

2200
02:23:03,408 --> 02:23:05,617
And yet, you still haven't guessed?

2201
02:23:06,578 --> 02:23:09,663
I told you that I'm not
playing games with you.

2202
02:23:09,956 --> 02:23:10,998
Tell me who it was.

2203
02:23:12,417 --> 02:23:14,668
It was Clare Quilty.

2204
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:17,296
Who was Clare Quilty?

2205
02:23:17,839 --> 02:23:19,298
All of them, of course.

2206
02:23:20,425 --> 02:23:22,843
You mean, Dr. Zemph,
he was Clare Quilty?

2207
02:23:23,011 --> 02:23:24,678
Well, congratulations.

2208
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:29,683
I don't suppose it ever occurred to you
that when you moved into our house...

2209
02:23:29,851 --> 02:23:32,769
...my whole world didn't revolve
around you.

2210
02:23:33,855 --> 02:23:35,981
I'd had a crush on him
ever since the times...

2211
02:23:36,149 --> 02:23:38,317
...that he used to come and visit Mother.

2212
02:23:38,484 --> 02:23:40,235
He wasn't like you and me.

2213
02:23:40,987 --> 02:23:42,821
He wasn't a normal person.

2214
02:23:43,489 --> 02:23:45,032
He was a genius.

2215
02:23:46,117 --> 02:23:47,618
He had a kind of...

2216
02:23:47,952 --> 02:23:52,205
...beautiful Japanese,
Oriental philosophy of life.

2217
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:56,376
You know that hotel we stopped at
on the way back from camp?

2218
02:23:56,544 --> 02:23:59,046
It was just by accident
that he was staying there...

2219
02:23:59,213 --> 02:24:02,966
...but it didn't take him long to figure out
what was going on between us.

2220
02:24:03,134 --> 02:24:06,219
From that moment on he was up
to every trick he could think of.

2221
02:24:06,512 --> 02:24:09,890
And he did all these brilliant tricks
for the sheer fun of tormenting me?

2222
02:24:10,391 --> 02:24:14,478
Well, sometimes he had to,
like the German psychologist bit.

2223
02:24:14,896 --> 02:24:17,814
He had to trick you into letting me
be in his play...

2224
02:24:17,982 --> 02:24:19,858
...otherwise how would I ever see him?

2225
02:24:20,026 --> 02:24:22,194
So that's why you wanted
to be in the play?

2226
02:24:22,654 --> 02:24:23,654
That's right.

2227
02:24:23,821 --> 02:24:26,448
The times you were
supposed to be practicing the piano...

2228
02:24:26,616 --> 02:24:28,742
- ...you were actually with this man?
- Mm-hm.

2229
02:24:29,243 --> 02:24:32,412
I guess he was the only guy
I was ever really crazy about.

2230
02:24:34,707 --> 02:24:36,249
Aren't you forgetting something?

2231
02:24:38,169 --> 02:24:39,920
Oh, Dick.

2232
02:24:40,672 --> 02:24:42,422
Dick's very sweet...

2233
02:24:42,757 --> 02:24:44,758
...and we're very happy together...

2234
02:24:44,926 --> 02:24:47,552
...but I guess it's just not the same thing.

2235
02:24:48,638 --> 02:24:51,598
And I? I suppose I never counted,
of course.

2236
02:24:52,016 --> 02:24:56,812
You have no right to say that.
After all, the past is the past.

2237
02:25:00,525 --> 02:25:03,735
What happened to
this Oriental-minded genius?

2238
02:25:03,986 --> 02:25:07,948
Look, don't make fun of me.
I don't have to tell you a blasted thing.

2239
02:25:08,116 --> 02:25:09,408
I'm not making fun of you.

2240
02:25:09,575 --> 02:25:11,910
I'm merely trying to find out
what happened.

2241
02:25:12,078 --> 02:25:14,621
When you left the hospital,
where did he take you?

2242
02:25:14,789 --> 02:25:15,831
To New Mexico.

2243
02:25:15,998 --> 02:25:17,457
Whereabouts in New Mexico?

2244
02:25:17,625 --> 02:25:19,418
To a dude ranch near Santa Fe.

2245
02:25:20,211 --> 02:25:24,047
The only problem with it was,
he had a bunch of weird friends there.

2246
02:25:24,215 --> 02:25:27,134
- What kind of weird friends?
- Weird.

2247
02:25:27,301 --> 02:25:30,846
Painters, nudists, writers, weightlifters.

2248
02:25:31,013 --> 02:25:33,390
I figured I could take anything
for a few weeks...

2249
02:25:33,558 --> 02:25:35,976
...because I loved him.
He was going to Hollywood...

2250
02:25:36,144 --> 02:25:37,978
...to write one of those spectaculars...

2251
02:25:38,146 --> 02:25:40,689
...and he promised to get me
a studio contract...

2252
02:25:40,982 --> 02:25:42,691
...but it never turned out that way.

2253
02:25:42,859 --> 02:25:45,318
Instead he wanted me
to cooperate with the others...

2254
02:25:45,486 --> 02:25:47,988
...in making some kind of....
You know, an art movie.

2255
02:25:49,490 --> 02:25:51,283
An art movie.

2256
02:25:51,909 --> 02:25:53,160
Yeah.

2257
02:25:53,578 --> 02:25:54,953
And you did it?

2258
02:25:55,121 --> 02:25:57,330
No, I didn't do it.

2259
02:25:57,957 --> 02:25:59,750
And so he kicked me out.

2260
02:26:01,252 --> 02:26:03,211
You could have come back to me.

2261
02:26:10,511 --> 02:26:13,013
Excuse me, sweetheart,
Bill's cut his thumb.

2262
02:26:13,181 --> 02:26:14,389
It's just a scratch.

2263
02:26:14,557 --> 02:26:18,018
Dick, this is my stepfather,
Professor Humbert.

2264
02:26:18,436 --> 02:26:20,812
- How do you do, professor?
- How do you do?

2265
02:26:20,980 --> 02:26:23,190
This is our neighbor, Bill Crest.

2266
02:26:23,357 --> 02:26:25,984
- Glad to meet you, professor.
- How do you do?

2267
02:26:26,402 --> 02:26:30,280
Gee, uh, Lo's told me so much about you.

2268
02:26:32,784 --> 02:26:35,786
Well, uh, I guess we might as well
fix that thumb.

2269
02:26:37,205 --> 02:26:39,414
This is a grand surprise, professor.

2270
02:26:39,957 --> 02:26:43,043
When you didn't answer the letter
we were afraid that you were...

2271
02:26:43,211 --> 02:26:45,462
...still sore at Lo for having run away
from home.

2272
02:26:45,630 --> 02:26:47,047
Oh.

2273
02:26:47,924 --> 02:26:49,382
Yes.

2274
02:26:50,468 --> 02:26:53,136
- How about a beer?
- No, thank you.

2275
02:26:53,304 --> 02:26:55,931
I'll bet you're dry after that long drive.

2276
02:26:56,182 --> 02:26:58,850
This is some of that foreign beer.
You'll like it.

2277
02:26:59,018 --> 02:27:00,227
No beer, thank you.

2278
02:27:00,394 --> 02:27:01,436
Bandages are upstairs.

2279
02:27:01,604 --> 02:27:03,480
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

2280
02:27:04,524 --> 02:27:07,609
- Can I get you anything else? You hungry?
- Nothing, thank you.

2281
02:27:07,777 --> 02:27:09,528
How are you two getting along?

2282
02:27:09,695 --> 02:27:10,904
Just fine.

2283
02:27:11,906 --> 02:27:13,573
Speak up. His phone's on the blink.

2284
02:27:13,741 --> 02:27:14,950
One of those for me?

2285
02:27:15,117 --> 02:27:16,409
Sure, hon.

2286
02:27:20,248 --> 02:27:22,207
I hope you're planning
on staying a while.

2287
02:27:22,834 --> 02:27:26,378
You caught us a little unprepared
but we'll try and make you feel at home.

2288
02:27:26,546 --> 02:27:28,588
I shall have to be on my way, I'm afraid.

2289
02:27:29,048 --> 02:27:30,882
You can have the bed upstairs.

2290
02:27:31,050 --> 02:27:33,510
We sleep down here because
Lo likes to watch the TV.

2291
02:27:33,678 --> 02:27:35,136
He can't stay, Dick.

2292
02:27:35,304 --> 02:27:38,056
Oh. What a shame. I wish you could.

2293
02:27:40,142 --> 02:27:42,769
Why don't you tell him about Alaska?

2294
02:27:43,020 --> 02:27:46,106
Yeah. Uh, I guess Lo explained to you
about going to Alaska...

2295
02:27:46,274 --> 02:27:48,108
...and all that, in the letter.

2296
02:27:48,276 --> 02:27:50,068
It's a marvelous opportunity up there.

2297
02:27:50,236 --> 02:27:53,613
An opportunity for a guy like me
to get in on the ground floor.

2298
02:27:53,781 --> 02:27:55,490
Industry's opening up...

2299
02:27:55,658 --> 02:27:57,868
...and if we can scrape together
enough money...

2300
02:27:58,035 --> 02:28:00,954
...with maybe your help, heh,
well, we can go.

2301
02:28:01,205 --> 02:28:04,624
We've got a few back debts,
we kind of overextended ourselves.

2302
02:28:06,043 --> 02:28:07,544
How are the Farlows?

2303
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:12,090
Oh. John Farlow's all right. It was he
who gave me your letter, of course.

2304
02:28:12,258 --> 02:28:15,010
She's sure a swell kid, Professor Haze.
She sure is.

2305
02:28:15,177 --> 02:28:20,056
DICK: She's just nuts about dogs and kids.
She's gonna make a swell mother too.

2306
02:28:20,766 --> 02:28:25,186
Alaska's a great place for kids, you know.
Lots of room for them to run around.

2307
02:28:26,898 --> 02:28:28,940
Well, it's as good as new.

2308
02:28:29,317 --> 02:28:33,987
Well, we'd better get back to work, Bill.
I guess you two have a lot to talk about.

2309
02:28:34,947 --> 02:28:37,574
- Been a pleasure meeting you, professor.
- Thank you.

2310
02:28:37,742 --> 02:28:41,119
When you've finished, Dad...
I hope you don't mind me calling you that.

2311
02:28:41,287 --> 02:28:44,289
... come out back and I'll show you
what I'm making for the kid.

2312
02:28:44,457 --> 02:28:45,540
Thank you.

2313
02:28:45,750 --> 02:28:48,877
Just holler, sweetheart,
if you want me for KP.

2314
02:28:53,674 --> 02:28:55,967
Dick's awfully sweet, isn't he?

2315
02:28:57,845 --> 02:29:00,388
- Come here.
- What's going on?

2316
02:29:01,349 --> 02:29:02,474
What are you doing?

2317
02:29:02,642 --> 02:29:05,352
This may be neither here nor there
but I've got to say it.

2318
02:29:05,519 --> 02:29:07,270
Life is very short.

2319
02:29:07,605 --> 02:29:10,190
Between here and that old car outside
are 25 paces.

2320
02:29:10,358 --> 02:29:13,026
Make them, now, right now.

2321
02:29:13,194 --> 02:29:14,235
What?

2322
02:29:14,403 --> 02:29:17,030
Come away with me now, just as you are.

2323
02:29:17,365 --> 02:29:20,659
You mean you'll give us the money
only if I go to a hotel with you?

2324
02:29:20,826 --> 02:29:22,452
No, you've got it all wrong.

2325
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:25,205
I want you to leave your husband
and this awful house.

2326
02:29:25,373 --> 02:29:29,376
I want you to live with me and die with me
and everything with me.

2327
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:31,294
You must be crazy.

2328
02:29:31,462 --> 02:29:35,382
No, I'm perfectly serious, Lo.
I've never been less crazy in all my life.

2329
02:29:35,549 --> 02:29:38,635
We'll start afresh. We can forget
everything that has happened.

2330
02:29:38,803 --> 02:29:41,054
- No, it's too late.
- No, it's not too late.

2331
02:29:41,222 --> 02:29:42,222
Keep your voice down.

2332
02:29:42,390 --> 02:29:44,683
Don't tell me it's too late,
because it's not.

2333
02:29:44,850 --> 02:29:46,977
If you want time to think,
that's all right...

2334
02:29:47,144 --> 02:29:50,230
...because I've waited already
for three years and I can wait...

2335
02:29:50,398 --> 02:29:52,524
...for the rest of my life if necessary.

2336
02:29:52,692 --> 02:29:55,735
You're not giving anything up,
there's nothing here to keep you.

2337
02:29:55,903 --> 02:29:59,239
All right, this man is married to you,
but that's purely incidental.

2338
02:29:59,407 --> 02:30:02,409
It was an accident that you met him
in the first place.

2339
02:30:02,576 --> 02:30:05,161
You're not bound to him,
whereas you are bound to me...

2340
02:30:05,329 --> 02:30:09,040
...by everything that we have
lived through together, you and I.

2341
02:30:09,208 --> 02:30:12,085
I'm going to have his baby
in three months.

2342
02:30:13,671 --> 02:30:14,921
I know.

2343
02:30:15,506 --> 02:30:20,093
I've ruined too many things in my life.
I can't do that to him, he needs me.

2344
02:30:23,222 --> 02:30:25,265
Come on now, don't make a scene.

2345
02:30:25,433 --> 02:30:28,518
Stop crying! He could walk in here
at any minute.

2346
02:30:29,645 --> 02:30:32,605
Will you please stop crying?

2347
02:30:42,158 --> 02:30:44,492
There are no strings attached.

2348
02:30:46,412 --> 02:30:48,329
It's your money anyway.

2349
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:52,000
It comes from the rent of the house.

2350
02:30:53,335 --> 02:30:55,128
There's $400 in cash.

2351
02:30:55,838 --> 02:30:57,797
Four hundred dollars.

2352
02:30:58,382 --> 02:31:02,010
I've made out a check here for $2500.

2353
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:05,263
Two thousand, five hundred....

2354
02:31:05,890 --> 02:31:07,307
There's someone in Ramsdale...

2355
02:31:07,475 --> 02:31:11,186
...who's prepared to take care
of the mortgages on the house...

2356
02:31:11,353 --> 02:31:14,606
...and make a down payment of $10,000.

2357
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:18,068
There's the papers.

2358
02:31:19,737 --> 02:31:22,363
You mean we're getting $13,000?

2359
02:31:23,824 --> 02:31:25,450
That's wonderful.

2360
02:31:25,659 --> 02:31:27,577
Come on now, don't cry.

2361
02:31:27,828 --> 02:31:29,829

2362
02:31:31,707 --> 02:31:33,333
I'm sorry.

2363
02:31:33,876 --> 02:31:35,627
Try to understand.

2364
02:31:38,756 --> 02:31:41,633
I'm really sorry that I cheated so much...

2365
02:31:42,134 --> 02:31:45,345
...but I guess that's just
the way things are.

2366
02:31:49,975 --> 02:31:51,768
Where are you going?

2367
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:58,900
Hey, listen. Let's keep in touch.

2368
02:31:59,068 --> 02:32:01,569
I'll write to you when we get to Alaska.
