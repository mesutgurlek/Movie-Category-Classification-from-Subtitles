frequent deposits through my companies

fly right under the radar of the Feds.

I'm a married man.

Bob, you're undercover.

You gotta do
whatever the fuck you gotta do, man.

You should have fucked that stripper,

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,565
fucking do a line of coke,
anything to stay alive, man.

You got the best fucking job in the world.

I can't believe
I have to talk you into this shit.

Bob, I know these people, man.

You gotta play with them, you gotta
drink with them, you gotta fuck with them.

That's the way you get their trust.

Oh, my God, you're a piece of work, Bob.

You're a fucking piece of work.

487
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,051
I mean, why are you even doing this, Bob?
Why do you even bother?

488
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,963
I mean, I heard about
the retirement they offered you.

- She's with him, yeah.

How about that, huh?
Hey, I don't know if you know this,

Thank you.

No, tell them the truth. I'm your asshole.

mine better hop straight to it.

I'd do anything for my cousin. All right?

my business to enhance yours.

And when I do, I need a promise from you
that you will make it your business

to let the right people know my name.

to a client like Southern Air Transport,
which has no cover,

And so are you. And you, and you.

who runs Southern Air Transport

He has sugar in his blood.

- That's...
- Wow. No, listen,

574
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,010
actually Ospina's nickname
is La Mina, you know.

It means two things in Spanish.
Gold mine or land mine.

But, my friend, a condition of
doing business with us is doing Ospina.

you want me to fuck Ospina?

589
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,804
- He came on to me...
- Did you know about this?

590
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,042
He came on to me, too. Fucking maricón.

But the cartel loves him.

He is the favorite son, Mr. Bob.

593
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,525
So, even if you see him fucking a goat,
which you might,

594
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,490
you must say,
"That's a fucking nice-looking goat, man."

he'll kill your fucking wife,

I see your accounts are quite active.

- Is that a problem?
- No, no, quite the opposite.

But we do have a problem
with two of your checks.

on the phone, I wonder if you can help me.

Is there anyone on your team
who can help me here, in the States?

to keep the money flow to a minimum.

There's a Senate investigation into Noriega.

Are you listening to me?

Hey, hey. You know what Alcaino said?

"That's not an answer
that keeps you alive, my friend."

No. Wait a second, hold on.
Did he threaten you?

- No.
- Did he put your neck in a noose?

1257
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,961
Yeah, and he's squeezing.

1258
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,611
No, he didn't. Roberto didn't say that.
He wouldn't say that.

Wait a second.

if his money doesn't come through?

ALCAINO: (ON TAPE) Don Pablo is not happy

he's frozen all Panamanian accounts
in an effort...

That is not an answer that keeps you alive.

Daddy?

1272
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,205
You should work this out
before Don Pablo does.

Mr. Chinoy, Mr. Javier Ospina.

- Nice to meet you, sir.

My friend, what a great pleasure
to meet you.

1394
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,967
- I've heard beautiful things about you.
- Thank you.

1395

how handsome you are.

ask you something very quickly.

This guy is the creep we gave our money to?

Where do you think
this guy parked his camel?

1400

Okay, sit down. Yeah. Sit down.

1401

Tell me I'm not telling the truth.
Am I right?

MAZUR: Have a seat. Have a seat.

We have 30 million
parked in Charleston, South Carolina.

1404
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,364
The Bible Belt? A good place to hide money.

1405
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,209
It's where the Baby Jesus hides.

1406
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:49,201
He only comes out at night
so he can watch the money, protect it.

1407
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,567
We could have 100 million more.

1408
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,640
But such amounts need to be concealed
to everyone but a select few.

guarantee that the funds cannot be traced?

1414
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,606
CHINOY: (DISTORTED) Let me put it this way.

1415
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,121
We have a protocol.

1416
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:18,964
All we need from you is a signature.
And don't you worry about a thing.

That's what they are.
Their penises are crooked.

1424

You know, you were right.

1703
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,166
Of course, I'm always right.

1704
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,721
The informant.

1705
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,921
Okay, all right, I'm 99% right.

1706
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,250
I loved Bob Musella.

1707
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,247
Me, too. Me, too.

1708
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,001
Hey, Bob.

1709
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,768
Not all your friends
went to jail today, all right?

1710
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,286
- Hey.
- MAZUR: Hey.

1711
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,765
So, Customs is letting me keep the dress,
but not the pearls.

1712
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,887
Too bad you got jilted, you look so hot.

1713
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,410
- (ALL CHUCKLING)
- (PHONE RINGING)

1714
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,805
Did you get him to talk?
I'm sorry. I'll catch you guys later.

1715
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:09,646
You wanna help me?

1716
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,761
Yeah.

1717
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:38,044
Well, it's still a pretty good ending.

1718
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,281
It was, wasn't it?

1719
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,166
Go home, Bob.

1720
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,846
EVELYN: You okay there?

1721
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,491
Harley, you're up next.

1722
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:36,805
Here, catch.

1723
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,364
- EVELYN: Hey.
- MAZUR: Hi.
