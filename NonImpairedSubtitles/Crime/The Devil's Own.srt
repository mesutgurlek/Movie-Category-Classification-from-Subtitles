1
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,431
- How was your day?
- It was a bit cold.

2
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,993
- How did Frankie do?
- Frankie was tremendous.

3
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,720
Are you hungry?

4
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,997
I won't give you too much.

5
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,237
Bless us, Lord, for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

6
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,596
No!

7
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,673
<i>A gunman broke into a house
in a remote coasta/ area -</i>

8
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,755
<i>- and shot to death a man be/ieved
to be a Repub/ican sympathizer.</i>

9
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,917
<i>/t is the /atrst of many ki//ings
since the peace ta/ks broke down.</i>

10
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,630
Here's your target. Frankie Maguire.

11
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,873
<i>He's responsible for the deaths
of 11 regular Army lads -</i>

12
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,478
- 7 RUC officers and
uncounted numbers of loyalist paras.

13
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,874
He's never seen a jail cell.
I'd like to change that.

14
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,438
This is it. Lads.

15
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,433
Mind how you go.

16
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,793
Stand by.

17
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,796
Move it!

18
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,676
- Seanie?
- I'm fine. Half the Army's here.

19
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,515
Bloody English!

20
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,869
Keep your heads down.

21
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,519
Seanie!

22
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,950
I'm fucked. Frank.

23
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,512
- Frankie, let's get out of here.
- Go on.

24
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,995
- We have to go now.
- Go!

25
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,077
Desmond.

26
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,198
Where's Frankie Maguire?

27
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,512
Up your fucking arse.

28
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,233
<i>/n a routine security operation,
so/diers /ooking for an /RA gunman -</i>

29
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,359
<i>- found themse/vrs
in an unexpected firefight.</i>

30
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,479
<i>The /RA denounced the attack as

31
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,397
<i>The Army put fu// rrsponsibi/ity

32
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,314

33
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,077
<i>But the vio/ence casts further
doubts on future peace initiativrs.</i>

34
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,834
Frankie?

35
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,037
It's Martin.

36
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,077
- For fuck's sake. Frankie.
- You had me shaking there.

37
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,357
How are you doing?

38
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,988
Grand.

39
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,759
- Are you hungry?
- Cheers.

40
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,790
A present from the lads.
They send their best.

41
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,751
Good to see you.

42
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,675
- You're looking well.
- Fuck you, you cunt.

43
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,828
There was a big turnout for
Dessie's funeral. Which was good.

44
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,876
The cabinet was talking peace.
The SAS was waiting to take us out.

45
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,554
A setup.

46
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,794
- One of our own?
- We still don't know who.

47
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,273
The Northern Ireland Office
are spouting the same old shite.

48
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,430
They say the word peace,
but all they want is surrender.

49
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,677
Those fucking things...!

50
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,315
If we could take them out.
They'd have to listen.

51
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,550
Right.

52
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,440
Stinger missiles. Then they'll talk
peace... but it's gonna need you.

53
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,511
- You're a judge, are you?
- State Court.

54
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,993
I don't know too many judges...
socially speaking.

55
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:45,838
We'd raise more money if people
understood what goes on over there.

56
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,269
They say if you're not confused,
you don't know what's going on.

57
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,437
That's it. Isn't it?

58
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,837
It's fantastic.

59
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,711
- Home sweet home.
- We'll need the money quickly.

60
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,952
This is the construction company
where you work.

61
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,272
- You're a friend of the family.
- Are they connected?

62
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,309
Not in the least.
Tom O'Meara served under my father.

63
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,153
- In the Army?
- Police.

64
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,474
- A cop?
- Safest place in the city.

65
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,554
Daddy!

66
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,992
- Mr. O'Meara?
- Tom. Come on in. That's Annie.

67
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,951
How was your trip?
It's a long one, isn't it?

68
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,554
This is Morgie.

69
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,554
Morgan...

70
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,999
Say hi to Rory.
Sheila's in here.

71
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,238
- Sheila, Rory's here.
- Hi. I'm the mother.

72
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,918
- Nice to meet you.
- Bridget's on the phone.

73
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,756
The kids were supposed
to get this crap out of the hallway.

74
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,438
It's not much.
But it's dry and it's warm.

75
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,232
The bed's over here.
There's a bath and shower here.

76
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,030
You've got to jiggle this.
It runs.

77
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,432
- Did Fitz find you a job?
- I start in couple of days.

78
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,755
- The TV's here. What are you doing?
- On a building site.

79
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,951
- If there's anything you need...
- No, thanks for putting me up.

80
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,955
- Don't thank us. Thank Fitz.
- Dinner.

81
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,399
Besides, it's good to have somebody
around here that pees standing up.

82
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,232
For food and clothes -

83
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,109
- for family, too,
dear God, thank you...

84
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,674
I hope Rory likes his basement,
because I don't.

85
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,550
- I like the basement a lot.
- Pass the vegetables.

86
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,439
May I serve you?

87
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,754
Say when.

88
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,473
- That looks delicious. What is it?
- It's corned beef and cabbage.

89
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,709
- Don't you have that in Ireland?
- I've never had it.

90
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,839
- But you have this over there?
- We do have that.

91
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,639
In fact I was baptized in it.

92
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,271
- You were baptized in beer?
- That's a joke, honey.

93
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,833
- Have some more vegetables.
- Eat your dinner.

94
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,632
- Why do you always pick on me?
- Pass the mustard.

95
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,754
- What part of Ireland are you from?
- Cookstown. In the north.

96
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,559
On the shore of Lough Neagh.

97
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,555
- Do you have a girlfriend there?
- Come on, guys.

98
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,589
- That's a personal question.
- Leave the guy alone.

99
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,231
- Bridget has a boyfriend.
- Will you guys knock it off?

100
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,189
- Rory, welcome to America.
- Thanks.

101
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,833
Sector David. 2746. 13:30 meal.
Diaz, you're with me again.

102
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,230
Others, same as yesterday.

103
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,471
- Everybody's laughing at me.
- Why?

104
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,670
I'm supposed to drive the car.
You're supposed to sit next to me.

105
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,638
You've got the stripes.

106
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,158
The guy who rides with the sergeant
is the chauffeur.

107
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,348
- So, when am I gonna drive?
- I don't know. Tomorrow.

108
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,954
You've said that for three years!

109
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,518
- What's the time, goldilocks?
- That's my sister, you bastard.

110
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,958
- Frankie!
- It's Rory now, you cunt.

111
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,829
- What's that?
- It's a high five. This is the USA.

112
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,118
- Look at the state of you.
- It's called style.

113
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,319
- Calvin Klein.
- Circus clown. Look at that one.

114
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,871
- Sorry! He did it.
- I didn't.

115
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,271
Look at us two Fenian bastards!

116
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,958
- Jesus Christ. Mind the car.
- That's yours?

117
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,070
She's a beaut. Isn't she?
Bought and nearly paid for.

118
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,038
Fuck, I left the door open!

119
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,716
Frankie, are we gonna
go through with this?

120
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,989
I've got a foot pursuit.
Northbound. Male black.

121
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,994
Sarge! The car's blocked.

122
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,755
This is 35 Sergeant.
205 and Post.

123
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,355
Heading westbound toward the park.

124
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,796
Stop!

125
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,077
Towards the park.

126
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,836
Move! Damn!

127
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,190
Wait.

128
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,356
35 Sergeant.
They're going through the park.

129
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,557
<i>That's a copy, 35 Sergeant.</i>

130
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,669
You're gonna be sorry.

131
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,717
- Don't lose him.
- I'm on him.

132
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,073
God damn it! Come here.
Let me see your hands.

133
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,437
He's my collar.

134
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,553
Don't run away from the police.
You'll get yourself shot that way.

135
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,950
What have you got?

136
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,511
He robbed this.
I saw him put it in his pocket.

137
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,310
- You witnessed it?
- Yeah.

138
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,718
- How old are you, son?
- 15. sir.

139
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,031
Stand him up.

140
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,034
That's old enough to know
not to run away from the police.

141
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,634
What's your story?

142
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,239
I was too embarrassed to bring
the condoms to the cash register.

143
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,994
Turn him around.
Stand still.

144
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,437
Turn around. Give me your hand.

145
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,639
- I'll never do this again.
- Take a hike.

146
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,949
Why don't you cuff the rookie?

147
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,633
Here it is.
The Irish Republican Navy.

148
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,916
What do you think?

149
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,270
The pitch is off.
It'll give us a half a knot.

150
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,351
For fuck's sake!
It's pissing antifreeze.

151
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,991
- I knew it.
- Pull it.

152
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,353
We've got the prop work,
the caulking and the pipes, -

153
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,514
- the transducer, the bilge pump,
and timing the engine out.

154
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,959
A dozen 55-gallon drums of fuel.
Why don't we Fed-Ex the gear home?

155
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,631
The two of us crossing the Atlantic
with a hold full of missiles...

156
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,397
- It's crazy.
- Aye, it's fucking mad.

157
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,878
When I get my pension,
you know what I'm gonna do?

158
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,558
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna raise pot-bellied pigs.

159
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:22,034
I saw it on TV.
This guy was making a fortune.

160
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,509
Pigs?

161
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,875
Hi, girls.

162
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,956
- Last week it was a bakery.
- I could never get up that early.

163
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,159
<i>We have a 1052
at 42 Wrst 135th Street.</i>

164
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,155
<i>Fema/e ca//ed to say
her husband's getting vio/ent.</i>

165
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,157
Police.

166
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,198
<i>Po/ice, open up.</i>

167
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,193
Police, open the door.

168
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,668
- Hi, has Mummy called the police?
- Yes.

169
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,878
Mummy...

170
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,995
<i>- You whore, come here!
- Put that gun down, man.</i>

171
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,359
<i>- No!
- Let's ta/k to her.</i>

172
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,636
<i>No!</i>

173
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,356
<i>- /'m going to ta/k to her.
- Let's ta/k about it.</i>

174
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,035
Take it easy.

175
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,671
Fucking guns, man.

176
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,758
- The john's downstairs.
- I'm collecting for Irish Relief.

177
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,957
Eddie.

178
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,278
Irish Relief?

179
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,718
- Billy Burke.
- Rory Devaney. Martin sent me.

180
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,519
He's a good man.

181
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:49,073
- How do you like America?
- Fine, the land of opportunity.

182
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,631
14 years old, I was sleeping
in the back of a saloon.

183
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,873
- Today I've got three of my own.
- You've done well.

184
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,077
I've done well with you lads, too.
Drink?

185
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,629
Sit down.

186
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:11,031
- When can we take possession?
- These ain't egg rolls.

187
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,432
Stingers jacked the Russians
out of Afghanistan. It'll take time.

188
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,991
- How much time?
- 6- 8 weeks.

189
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,351
- Can I put you up?
- I'm sorted out. Thanks.

190
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,876
- Where are you staying?
- Across the river.

191
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,273
- Where? Brooklyn?
- Something like that.

192
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,912
- How do I get in touch with you?
- Ask for Sean.

193
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,789
This is a Manhattan number.

194
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,398
- About the money...
- Get the gear, it's no problem.

195
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,517
Cheers.

196
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,073
Rory...

197
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,438
Are you Belfast boys
all born such hard-ons?

198
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,993
Are you asleep, honey.

199
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,756
- You faker.
- I'm not tired.

200
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,278
I'll give you a mummy tuck.
Where's ducky?

201
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,079
He's a sleepy ducky.

202
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,911
It's kind of funny seeing my sister
getting all worked up.

203
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,632
He is cute. But it's not like
she'd have a chance.

204
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,270
- Get off the phone.
- Wait a minute.

205
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,194
- How long have you been talking?
- Not that long.

206
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,158
- Who is it?
- A friend.

207
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,710
- Three minutes.
- Five minutes, please?

208
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,271
You have to press D-l-R. Return.

209
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,353
- What did you just press?
- DIR.

210
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,991
And then enter.
What does CLS do?

211
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,674
No. Don't do it.

212
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,196
We're out of milk.

213
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,830
I don't want to close it.

214
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,478
I'm going to get some milk.

215
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,430
You want to take a little walk?
I'll buy you a beer. It's not far.

216
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,480
It's very peaceful here. Quiet.

217
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,792
- Do you know your neighbours?
- Yeah. Most of them.

218
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,318
- Do you like 'em?
- We get along pretty well.

219
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,358
What's it like over there?

220
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,150
It's violent. People are fed up.

221
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,429
- Doesn't seem to be a point to it.
- It depends where you stand.

222
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,036
I just try to keep out of it.

223
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,911
- These houses are fantastic.
- They're pretty old, around 1900.

224
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,514
Our new ones are older than that.

225
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,355
- Tony.
- Hey, O'Meara.

226
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:37,548
- This is Rory Devaney.
- Another friggin' mick.

227
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,917
I'm an immigration agent.

228
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,313
He runs a pet shop down the street.
He's the Prince of the Poodles.

229
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,999
Those are fighting words.
You know what this is?

230
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,711
- That's an Italian love muscle.
- That's why it's in your hand.

231
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,156
Let's find out
what you can do with one of these.

232
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,156
You and the sergeant. Me and Joey.
Italians versus Irish.

233
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,390
Throw the milk in the cooler, Joey.

234
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,710
Lovely.

235
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,311
- You're a wonderful man.
- Unbelievable. Isn't he?

236
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,115
I don't know if I can shoot.

237
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,239
You hear about the Irish guy
who tried to blow up a car?

238
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,030
He burnt his lips on the tailpipe.

239
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,870
Scratch.

240
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,311
- That'll be mine.
- You're up, Irish.

241
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,910
- What is this?
- The luck of the Irish.

242
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,550
Let me check your green card.

243
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,874
There you go.

244
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,831
- Have you got money? Clean hanky?
- I'll see you for dinner.

245
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,315
- Leave it out.
- Take that, you Fenian bastard.

246
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,394
- Come on.
- I'll get you back.

247
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,431
No surrender.

248
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,957
Burke called.
He wants to talk to you.

249
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,511
Everything's set up for next week.
He needs the money.

250
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,028
One. Two. Three.

251
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,953
Snip, snip, snip...

252
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,398
- A delivery for Mr. Fitzsimmons.
- I'll take that.

253
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,358
Do you need me to sign for it?

254
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,277
No... that's fine.

255
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,113
Isn't it lovely, the way they glide
like that? Not a care in the world.

256
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,393
Are you from Belfast?

257
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,477
You don't know who I am?

258
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,430
- I'm Michael's sister. Megan.
- Michael Doherty?

259
00:37:55,360 --> 00:38:01,356
- How's your mother?
- Bad. Since they killed Michael.

260
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,148
- Will I be off then?
- I best be getting on with it.

261
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,792
- Watch yourself, Frankie.
- You as well. Iove.

262
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,909
What I wouldn't have given for that
when I was 13.

263
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,229
Rory, Mom said dinner's ready.

264
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:16,356
- That's a lovely dress.
- It's for Morgan's confirmation.

265
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,918
- Are you married?
- No.

266
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,313
- Will you marry me?
- I'll have to ask your da.

267
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,875
What are you doing in there?
I need a shower.

268
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,431
- Wake up, lazybones.
- Sheila!

269
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,276
- Get out!
- It's my confirmation today.

270
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,309
You're not going to look any better.
You might as well give up.

271
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,235
Mom, Morgan just gave me the finger.
Tell her not to do that.

272
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,836
She has to get out of the bathroom.
She only listens to you.

273
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
Oh. No! Dad!

274
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,235
There's something wrong
with this family.

275
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,398
In the name of the Father. The Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

276
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,473
You have already been baptized.

277
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:38,318
You will now receive
the power of the Lord's spirit.

278
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,597
You must be witnesses
before the world -

279
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,276
- to his death, his suffering,
his resurrection.

280
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,151
Your life must at all times
reflect the goodness of Christ.

281
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,031
Now that you've come of age, I ask
that you renew your baptismal vows.

282
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,553
- Do you renounce Satan?
- I do.

283
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,508
- All his earthly works?
- I do.

284
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,468
- His empty promises?
- I do.

285
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,952
Do you believe in
the Holy Catholic Church?

286
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,353
The forgiveness of sins,
and the resurrection of the body?

287
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,273
- I do.
- Amen.

288
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,912
- Hi. Aunt Birdie.
- He said hello.

289
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,512
- Rory, this is my friend Brooke.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

290
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,477
Stop it!

291
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,435
I'll be back in a second.

292
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,718
- You acted like such a dork.
- I did not.

293
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,751
Coming through. Hot plate. Lasagne.

294
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,277
Is the corkscrew there?

295
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,276
You must be the faithful sidekick.
I live beneath the stairs.

296
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,955
- Don't I look Irish to you?
- Eddie, how are you?

297
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,476
I'm gonna have a pop.

298
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,200
Come here.

299
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,471
I love these guys.

300
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,519
Telephone.

301
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,514
In the kitchen.

302
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,958
<i>- Hello.
- Martin's dead. They got him.</i>

303
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,353
<i>We don't know how much they know.
You can't go through with this.</i>

304
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,111
This way.

305
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,877
The Cloisters is a series
of monasteries transported here...

306
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,031
- Where's the judge?
- He's scared.

307
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,397
He think's they're on to him, too.

308
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,678
- He says he wants no part of it.
- And the money?

309
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,834
He said to hold on to it
until you hear word from Belfast.

310
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,032
<i>Is that it? is it finished?</i>

311
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,478
By no means is it finished.

312
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,193
- I'll have to go to Belfast.
- You can't show your face there.

313
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,954
I won't show my face.

314
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,720
Tell me who to see and what to say.
I'll go.

315
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,433
Given the particular situation,
we're going to have to postpone.

316
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,310
Make the payment now.
I'll stockpile the stuff for you.

317
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:23,555
I can't do that. I'm to sit tight
till things get worked out at home.

318
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,118
Hey, Mike.

319
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,351
I'm sorry about Martin, but these
are not soda cans you asked me for.

320
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,913
These are no deposit, no return
items, and I'm out of pocket.

321
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,234
- You're putting me in a tight spot.
- That's the way it has to be.

322
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,594
- If that's the way it has to be...
- It's the way it has to be.

323
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,796
I have to fly to Dublin,
and visit my mother in Belfast.

324
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,868
I tell them the three ports
that you might come in at.

325
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,068
That's it. Lovely.
There you have it.

326
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,670
Grand.

327
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,919
But it isn't just a message.

328
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,992
I mean like...

329
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,029
...do you ever
feel guilty about it?

330
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,952
Of course there's guilt.

331
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,554
I have sleepless nights
about some things.

332
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,950
No one's innocent.

333
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,350
Everyone has their ghosts.

334
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,390
- Are you all right?
- Aye...

335
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,994
Are you sure?

336
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,114
Paddy!

337
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,037
Beautiful! All you need now
is a house, kids and a dog.

338
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,633
Look at this.

339
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,158
Wait till I get around.
Take the radio.

340
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,552
35 sergeant.
We've got a 1032 in progress.

341
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,230
He's got a gun!

342
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,836
Police! Freeze!

343
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,795
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I got the fucker!

344
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,748
Stop, damn it!

345
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,918
Toss it!

346
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,709
Don't make me shoot you.

347
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,437
Asshole!

348
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,033
Eddie!

349
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,397
Are you okay?

350
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,354
He was getting away.

351
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,389
He's dead. Man.
Half his face is gone.

352
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,189
- What happened?
- He was getting away.

353
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,115
- He turned with a gun in his hand.
- You shot him in the back.

354
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,718
Here's his gun.
He tossed it around the corner.

355
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,351
He shot at us, Tommy!
He shot at us!

356
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,633
Thanks. Ted.

357
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,837
- You did good, Tom.
- Grand jury?

358
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,357
- Yeah. Have you talked to Sheila?
- I'll wait till I get home.

359
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,672
- You want a lift?
- No, I'm okay.

360
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,632
- You're Diaz, right?
- Yeah. That mutt shot at me...

361
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,793
- Is this your PBA rep?
- Yes. He is.

362
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:43,114
Didn't he tell you you don't have
to make a statement for 48 hours?

363
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,398
- Yes. He did.
- Take his advice. Tommy.

364
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,039
- How did it go in there?
- Fine.

365
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,034
What does that mean. Fine?

366
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,998
You shot him in the back.

367
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,950
- He was running away.
- He shot at us!

368
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,355
We're in the police business,
not the revenge business.

369
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,150
Did you cover for me?

370
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,360
I'm fine. I just had a few drinks.
I didn't want to drive.

371
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:33,229
I'm fine. I just had a few drinks.
I didn't want to drive.

372
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:41,033
He's here now.
We'll be a half hour or so. Okay.

373
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,277
Are you all right there, Tommy?

374
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,234
There was a shooting today.
Eddie killed a guy.

375
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,674
- Killed the bad guy?
- Not that bad. I saw his sheet.

376
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,355
A couple of punk things, but...

377
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,878
Poor Eddie.

378
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,275
Pull over.
I'm gonna be sick.

379
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,633
- Are you okay then?
- Just give me a minute.

380
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,872
You've got "The Exorcist" here.

381
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,235
New York's finest.

382
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,279
- Sorry...
- It's all right.

383
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,431
Can I ask you something?

384
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,388
Have you ever shot anyone?

385
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,833
No, I've never shot anyone.

386
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,436
I've fired my gun four times
on the street.

387
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,272
Four times in 23 years.

388
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,714
If you pick up a gun, sooner
or later someone gets a bullet.

389
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,994
- Big boys' rules.
- And what do you know about that?

390
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,596
Common knowledge, I suppose.

391
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,757
Did you ever shoot anybody?

392
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:36,953
When I was eight, this man came
into the house and killed my da.

393
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,275
He killed my da in front of us.

394
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,714
Let's go, please.

395
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,990
I'm sorry about your dad.

396
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,715
- Did they get the fuckers?
- They are the fuckers.

397
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,917
Don't look for happy endings, Tom.

398
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,436
It's not an American story.

399
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,592
It's an Irish one.

400
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,320
What is it?

401
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,679
Lopez didn't have a gun in his hand
when he was shot. He tossed it.

402
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,472
Eddie didn't see him toss it.
I had the gun when Eddie shot him.

403
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,030
It was a bad call.

404
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,318
- You covered for him.
- I lied about how it went down.

405
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,237
I've thought it through.

406
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,313
I'm going to take my pension.
Retire.

407
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:50,633
In 23 years you never took a bribe.
You never abused your power.

408
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,315
- You treat everyone fairly.
- Not the dead guy.

409
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,359
- He shot at you!
- He was stealing radios.

410
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,672
- He didn't deserve to be killed.
- It's terrible.

411
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:08,312
But cops make mistakes. Besides,
it was Eddie who made the mistake.

412
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,109
I lied! Don't you understand?

413
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,909
- I said I'd never do that.
- You did it once. Tom.

414
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:26,553
What about next time?
I can't do the job this way.

415
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:33,432
- I'm done with being a cop.
- But you love being a cop.

416
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:38,276
I love you. I love the kids.
I love what we've got.

417
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:43,878
I don't love being a cop...
anymore.

418
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,436
I never told you this...

419
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:00,675
I was the only Irish girl in town
who didn't want to marry a cop.

420
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,470
I don't want to go back to work.

421
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,234
The kids won't be home
for two hours.

422
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,995
Hell. I'm retired...

423
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,113
Tom!

424
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,600
Sheila!

425
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,351
Officer needs help.
We're at 87 Cornelia Avenue.

426
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,792
They're armed.

427
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,913
87 Cornelia Avenue.

428
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,031
Sheila!

429
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,238
Get out!

430
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,835
- Get off of him. Man.
- Tom...

431
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,309
Get up. Now!

432
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:46,918
- Easy, man.
- Get up there against the wall.

433
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:52,313
- What do you want?
- Shut your mouth, man!

434
01:02:53,040 --> 01:03:00,071
If they get here, it gets
complicated. Walk away now.

435
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,198
Damn it!

436
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,756
Get out of here. Man.
Let 'em go.

437
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,469
- Sheila....
- Stay right where you are.

438
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,553
Don't you fucking move!

439
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,159
Sheila...

440
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:35,750
- Let 'em go.
- I'm not going.

441
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,151
They're leaving.

442
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,756
It's okay. Nobody got hurt.

443
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,111
Are you all right?

444
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,598
Jesus. Man.

445
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,715
About 240. 6'4" or so.

446
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,555
The other one was medium.
All/b>l white guys.

447
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:19,110
- Wearing masks?
- Yeah.

448
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:29,155
What do you think you're doing?

449
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,559
Get him out of here.

450
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,193
You're a stupid man, Mr. Burke.

451
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,478
You're only seeing me
standing between you and the money.

452
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:59,431
You're forgetting the thousand
other men standing behind me.

453
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,433
That's a mistake.

454
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,556
Are you with me there, love?

455
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,714
Rory...

456
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,599
You might want to talk to Sean
about this.

457
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:26,676
- Maybe I'll give him a call.
- You could if he was home.

458
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,912
But he's not home.

459
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:36,349
Do you want to see him?
I know he wants to see you.

460
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,149
My pearls are still there,
and the cash wallet.

461
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:46,917
The TV, the VCR, the computer.
Nothing's missing.

462
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:52,632
- Call me from your sister's.
- Yeah.

463
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,997
You got a rain check.

464
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,391
I owe you one.

465
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,717
I'll have the girls call tonight.

466
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,676
Go get the money.

467
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,799
There's a warehouse
at 12th and Hudson.

468
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:54,988
Please. Don't fuck around.
Or I'll kill your friend.

469
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,509
Stupid man.

470
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,430
Jesus!

471
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,951
I'll explain when you get here.

472
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,509
I need you, Eddie.

473
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,036
Who are you?

474
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,748
Did you bring this into my house?

475
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:19,593
- Aye.
- Where have you just been?

476
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:28,553
I went to make sure
it wouldn't happen again.

477
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:34,478
It was all lies. wasn't it?
Everything you told us.

478
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:41,915
Except for how I feel about you
and your family. That wasn't a lie.

479
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,677
I'm sorry.
I never meant for this to happen.

480
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,274
I just...

481
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:57,754
I don't have time to explain.
I'll get my gear and I'll clear out.

482
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,236
What's the money for?

483
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,632
I was thinking guns.
I was thinking IRA.

484
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,031
- I need that money, Tom!
- Why?

485
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,311
So other eight-year-olds can
watch their fathers be gunned down?

486
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,830
If this money leaves here,
more people will die.

487
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,390
Can you tell me that won't happen?

488
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,199
What if tonight everything you
had was burned down around you?

489
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,389
What if you and yours walked out
on the street and were spat on?

490
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,632
Told you were nothing. No good.

491
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:58,633
What if it was one of yours
cut down by a plastic bullet?

492
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,153
Would you just sit back
and say, "Oh well..."

493
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,872
"Remember Annie. She was sweet."

494
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,157
"God bless her."

495
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:34,349
You've got to try and
make some sense out of all of it.

496
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,272
You look around and you realize -

497
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:44,275
- you're dealing with a government
that's fooled everyone.

498
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,759
All sides.

499
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:55,716
Normal people in a normal situation
find it disgusting.

500
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:01,193
But you can't understand it
because you haven't lived it.

501
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,875
I'm sorry
it's going badly between us.

502
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,710
You're a good man.

503
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,509
But understand, I have to go!

504
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:23,195
I'm also a cop,
and I can't let you go.

505
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,193
I'm going, Tom.

506
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,080
Tommy?

507
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,031
Come on. Eddie. Cuff him.

508
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,036
You drive.

509
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,473
Jesus. Iook at this.

510
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,072
It's the trash thing.

511
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,713
I'm a police officer.
You have to move this vehicle.

512
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:55,796
- I can't do it.
- Move the truck.

513
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,036
You move it!

514
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,596
Move. Move. Move!

515
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,677
Don't!

516
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,517
- What kind of animal is this?
- A bear.

517
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,240
What kind of noise does a bear make?

518
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,879
- What kind of animal is this?
- An owl.

519
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,237
What kind of noise does an owl make?

520
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:48,910
- When do owls come out?
- In the night-time.

521
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,751
Something terrible has happened.

522
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,913
Tommy.

523
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,639
There's some people here to see you.
FBI.

524
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,556
- This is Sergeant O'Meara.
- Stanley and Fisher. FBI.

525
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:53,192
We'd like to ask you about your
association with Frankie Maguire.

526
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:59,310
- Who's Frankie Maguire?
- Francis Austin Maguire.

527
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:04,235
Born July 27, 1964.
Belfast. Northern Ireland.

528
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,676
From December 1985
he was a unit commander.

529
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:13,790
Falls Road Active Service Unit.
Belfast Brigade, IRA.

530
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:19,555
Wanted for the crime of murder.
13 British soldiers.

531
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,030
11 police officers.

532
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,556
One thing I'm not clear about...

533
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:32,635
What is your relationship
to this terrorist?

534
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:44,197
- Who are you?
- Harry Sloan, British Intelligence.

535
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:48,717
- You are Irish...
- So is Cardinal O'Connor.

536
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:57,231
I've been tracking these bastards
for two years. He's the last one.

537
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,153
A month ago
he came to New York.

538
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:06,591
I have the authority
to use any means necessary -

539
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,991
- to bring closure to this issue.

540
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,030
You want to talk to me again...

541
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,237
...you read me my rights.

542
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,549
Cooperate with these people.

543
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,156
Don't piss your career away
over this.

544
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,759
They're not gonna bring him in.

545
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,953
They're gonna kill him.

546
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,917
The money, the missiles.

547
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,072
Where's Sean?

548
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,191
I have to see him.

549
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:39,798
Do you think you're gonna fuck
with me, you bog-Irish hick!

550
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,270
Fuck with me?

551
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,309
I think not.

552
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,472
You're on your own here, laddie.

553
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:55,030
You know it... I know it...

554
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:01,630
...and I guarantee you
Sean knows it.

555
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,268
Get him.

556
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,712
Give us the money.

557
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,876
You're a stupid man, Mr. Burke.

558
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,920
Sweet dreams.

559
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,354
Frankie!

560
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:32,594
My mind's been racing,
but I've got a plan.

561
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:38,835
My sister lives with her husband in
San Francisco. They'll sort you out.

562
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,992
- There's no sorting me out.
- There is.

563
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,630
- I killed a cop.
- That's why you've got to go there.

564
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,678
I leave tonight.

565
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,233
- I'm going back home.
- We've got enough martyrs.

566
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,636
I'll ram that boat up their arse.
You have to tell them I'm coming.

567
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:05,636
You don't have to give it up.
Just lie low for a while.

568
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,510
If you want to fight,
you have to stay alive.

569
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,513
Sean's dead.

570
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,474
I leave tonight.

571
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,032
Is the boss in? Police business.

572
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:55,791
- Tom, how are you?
- Not so good.

573
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:02,195
- I had no idea. I tried to call.
- I was at the hospital with Eddie.

574
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,352
I'm so sorry about Eddie.

575
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,748
I sponsor dozens of these kids.
I should've checked his background.

576
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,912
I just can't put it together.

577
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:20,033
What's it for? The money?

578
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:26,150
- What was all that money for?
- What are you talking about?

579
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:32,873
I'm racking my brain. The only
thing I can think of is guns.

580
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,749
Like the one
my wife had jammed in her face.

581
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,878
Guys with guns came to my house.

582
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,832
Did you know that?

583
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,995
Why don't you go home...

584
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,797
Get some rest.

585
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,798
I'm sorry, Peter...

586
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:07,188
I will go home. I'm tired.

587
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:19,714
As soon as I lock him up.

588
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:23,429
Do me one more favour. Tell me...

589
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:29,791
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

590
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:36,631
Where is he? I'll put your head
right through this fucking wall.

591
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,317
Stop! I just want to talk to you.

592
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,357
Come here.

593
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,634
Open the door!

594
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,276
I just want to talk!

595
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:32,434
- Where is he?
- He's not here.

596
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:43,638
Don't you touch him!

597
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,838
- Rory!
- Keep away from me, Tom.

598
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:35,717
- What's your name?
- Megan Doherty.

599
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,714
He's away, Megan.

600
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:53,190
I'm Tom O'Meara.
Rory's been staying with us.

601
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,399
Did he tell you?

602
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:14,197
I understand
why he's doing what he's doing.

603
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:17,670
If I'd endured what he's endured...

604
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,274
If I'd seen my father gunned down
in front of my family...

605
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:30,436
...I'd be carrying a gun, too,
but I wouldn't be wearing a badge.

606
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:37,195
I'm not going to lie to you.
I'm here to bring him in.

607
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,998
He killed a cop.

608
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:47,192
The FBI is after him.

609
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:53,514
The guys he was doing
business with here are after him.

610
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,478
There's an SAS agent -

611
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:01,430
- who has tracked down and killed
every other member of his unit.

612
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,637
He doesn't have to die.

613
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:16,200
If you want to see him again,
you've got to help me find him.

614
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:22,438
I promise you I'll do everything
I can to bring him in alive.

615
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,035
Mr. O'Meara!

616
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:15,711
Hold it! Let me see your hands!

617
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,630
- I've got to bring you in, son.
- I'm not going back.

618
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:27,557
- The killing's got to stop.
- You'll have to kill to stop it.

619
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:31,030
It gets a bit complicated,
doesn't it?

620
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:34,715
Nobody has to get killed.

621
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:40,079
- Go home to your family, Tom.
- Don't move!

622
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:42,595
I'm not going back.

623
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,433
I told you. I warned you.

624
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:12,676
Did I tell you
my da was a fisherman?

625
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,878
He loved the rocking of the sea.

626
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:33,714
He said there was no more
peaceful way of going to sleep.

627
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,872
You're a good man, Tom.

628
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:03,195
Hang on, Rory.
I'll get you to shore.

629
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,638
- Hang on, kid.
- I told you...

630
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:13,112
It's not an American story.

631
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:19,472
It's an Irish one.

632
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:48,029
We never had a choice...

633
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,753
...you and I.

634
