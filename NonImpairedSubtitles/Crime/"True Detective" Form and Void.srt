Nah, I don't mean like that.

654
00:48:56,354 --> 00:48:58,888
It's something else.

655
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:03,093
Well, so...
talk to me, Rust.

656
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:08,599
[Sighs]

657
00:49:10,502 --> 00:49:12,936
There was a moment--

658
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:15,472
I know when I was
under in the dark

659
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:17,942
that something...

660
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:20,110
whatever I'd been reduced to,

661
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:22,179
you know, not even
consciousness.

662
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:26,149
It was a vague awareness
in the dark,

663
00:49:26,183 --> 00:49:29,119
and I could--

664
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:32,656
I could feel my definitions

665
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,158
fading.

666
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:38,729
And beneath that...
darkness, there was another kind.

667
00:49:38,763 --> 00:49:41,698
It was-- it was deeper,

668
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:45,869
warm, you know,
like a substance.

669
00:49:47,272 --> 00:49:50,206
I could feel, man,

670
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:54,245
and I knew, I knew my daughter

671
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:56,647
waited for me there.

672
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,649
So clear.

673
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:01,785
I could feel her.

674
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:05,622
[Voice trembling]
I could feel...

675
00:50:05,657 --> 00:50:10,294
I could feel a piece
of my-- my pop, too.

676
00:50:12,163 --> 00:50:14,631
It was like I was
a part of everything

677
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:18,635
that I ever loved,
and we were all...

678
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:23,307
the 3 of us, just--
just fadin' out.

679
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:30,680
And all I had to do
was let go...

680
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:33,317
and I did.

681
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:38,322
I said, "Darkness,
yeah, yeah."

682
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,326
And I disappeared.

683
00:50:43,695 --> 00:50:47,698
But I could--
I could still feel

684
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:50,467
her love there,

685
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:53,603
even more than before.

686
00:50:55,373 --> 00:50:57,474
Nothing...

687
00:51:00,845 --> 00:51:03,847
There was nothing
but that love.

688

[Sobbing]

689
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:19,296

didn't you tell me
one time at dinner

694
00:51:37,682 --> 00:51:41,618
once, maybe,
about you used to...

695
00:51:41,652 --> 00:51:45,356
you used to make up
stories about the stars?

[Sniffles]
Yeah, that was--

697
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,728
that was, um,

698
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:54,164
in A-Alaska,

699
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:56,366
under the-- under
the night skies.

700
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:59,903
Yeah, you used to lay
there and look up,

701
00:51:59,937 --> 00:52:02,539
yeah, at the stars?

702
00:52:03,908 --> 00:52:05,876
Yeah, and you remember I...

703
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,378
I never watched
a TV till I was 17,

704
00:52:08,413 --> 00:52:10,880
so there wasn't much
to fuckin' do out there

705
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:13,417
besides walk around
and explore and--

706
00:52:13,451 --> 00:52:15,386
And...

707
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,423
and look up at the stars
and make up stories.

Like what?

709
00:52:23,093 --> 00:52:27,097
[Sighs] I tell you, Marty,
I've been up in that room

710
00:52:27,132 --> 00:52:31,268
looking out those windows every
night here and just thinking...

711

It's just one story.

The oldest.

00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,283
What's that?

714
00:52:49,186 --> 00:52:52,489
Light versus dark.

715
00:52:55,393 --> 00:52:57,327
Well,

716
00:52:57,362 --> 00:53:01,298
I know we ain't
in Alaska, but...

717
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:06,070
appears to me that the dark
has a lot more territory.

718
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:11,908
Yeah.

719
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:15,145
You're right about that.

Why don't you point me in the
direction of the car, man?

I've spent enough of my

Jesus. Oh.
You know what?

I'd protest,

but it occurs to me
that you're unkillable.

728

You want to go back,
get clothes or anything?

No, anything I left back
there, I don't need.

there was only dark.
