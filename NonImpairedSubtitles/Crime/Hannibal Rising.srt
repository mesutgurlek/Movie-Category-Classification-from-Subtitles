00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,620
M. For Mischa.

00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,521
Come on, come on let's go

3
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,008
Castle Lecter,
Lithuania 1944.

4
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:39,276
The bowl, Lothar.

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,916
Hurry now. give me the bath-tub.

6
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,298
Hannibal, Mischa.
Where have you been?

7
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,115
Hurry now.

8
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:54,505
Hannibal, come here.

9
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:03,607
Come on.

10
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:06,285
Darling, The cart is packed.

11
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,207
Everything is ready.

12
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:20,248
Colonel Timka says 
the fighting will be close to the roads.

13
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:25,075
But will not last more than a few days.
We will be safe at the lodge.

14
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:27,622
We are almost there.

15
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:38,223
In you come.
- Messieur Batton.

16
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,352
Ah, hand me the the bath-tub but.
- I take care of it.

17
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:43,084
No No that's fine but let's hurry

18
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:46,163
The cook will have finished packing
the kitchen by the time you get back

19
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,705
Hannibal give them here. 
Mamma's pearls.

20
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,582
Pearls are for swine.

21
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,348
Mischa, come.

22
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:43,365
Shut up, shut up , the major is here.

23
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,122
You are a Jew.

24
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,127
How could l eat your cooking. Despose of him.

25
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,468
How do you deal with locals?
Beeing locals yourselves?

26
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:03,403
You say you want to be SS.
 Let's see you earn it.

27
00:04:05,883 --> 00:04:09,156
   Kill the Jew.
Bring me the peasant.

28
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,378
Move move.

29
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,866
Are you a gypsy?
- No sir.

30
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:35,467
Are you a Jew?

31
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:38,676
No sir.

32
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,175
Good job.

33
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:46,230
Why don't you show us your dick?

34
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:52,217
Major, Russian tanks
moving west.

35
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:54,798
Put all their food on the truck, move it.

36
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:03,855
What is that?

37
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:13,584
A tank, a Russian tank.
- Get away from the window.

38
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:15,296
Lothar, Russians.

39
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,217
Everybody out of the house

40
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,255
We only want water.

41
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:46,058
The children can stay in the home

42
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,803
Get them inside.
- Mischa in here.

43
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:51,650
Start the pump.

44
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,972
Wait here.

45
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,149
Mamma.

46
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,425
How much longer with the pump

47
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,537
Stuka.

48
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:23,699
Shoot shoot.

49
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:28,958
Get down.

50
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,011
Pappa.

51
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:48,247
No, no.    Mischa.

52
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,349
Mischa, Mischa go back.

53
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,986
Go back Mischa!
- Mamma.

54
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,835
No, Mischa go back.

55
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:11,357
Come on Grentz.

56
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:14,626
Kolnas, come on.

57
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,352
Hurry.

58
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,670
Come on.

59
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,504
Get into the truck

60
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,236
Start your engine.

61
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,939
Holy Christus, we're going to die.

62
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:33,755
Relax. Well be fine.

63
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:41,716
Isn't that the SS major?

64
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,005
Major,  Kill a few gypsies you said.

65
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:52,013
Kill a few Jews, and we make you SS.

66
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:54,824
If you had kept your word…

67
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:57,245
I would be saying yes sir to you now.

68
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:02,830
But now, I am in business for myself.

69
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:13,530
Russians.

70
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,485
Go go go.

71
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,926
They're shooting looters.

72
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:13,826
Stop and black out.

73
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,943
Put it down.
- Drop it, now.

74
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,733
Put it down…

75
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,631
Or we shoot her.

76
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:56,684
Give me that.
- Get the radio Kolnas.

77
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,396
Mamma.

78
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:10,529
We are lucky. Only kids.

79
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:14,519
If a patrol comes by…

80
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:16,719
We saved them…

81
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,627
and their family stuff.

82
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:24,712
Grentz, check the door.

83
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,172
Check upstairs.

84
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,122
Find some food.

85
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,577
Only rotten potatoes.

86
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,670
It is information, you idiot.
This is no toy.

87
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:03,230
Wait, l have found something 
on a Russian frequency.

88
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,144
Roadblocks

89
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:15,609
Every five kilometer from here to Vilnius.

90
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,597
So, we're stuck for now.

91
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:41,170
Did you get something?
- It's freezing out there.

92
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,552
Open it.

93
00:12:45,543 --> 00:12:47,888
Do you think these are pepper corns?

94
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,111
These are frozen maggots.

95
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:52,461
This was rotten before it froze.

96
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:04,984
I put this in your head.
- Stop it

97
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,480
The boy is Hannibal Lecter…

98
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:31,494
and the little girl is Mischa.

99
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:04,900
We eat
or die.

100
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,334
Eight years later.

101
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,880
Let's hear you little master

102
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,978
He is mute.
- He's not mute at night.

103
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:11,540
He can screem well enough and he'll sing.

104
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:16,947
This is not your fathers house anymore.
It's the people's orphanage…

105
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:19,450
and you're just one more orphan.

106
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,242
Gunter

107
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,471
I see you in my office.

108
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:35,588
Hannibal

109
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:41,369
You do not honour the human pecking order.
You're always hurting the bullies.

110
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:48,133
I know.
This was your mothers room.

111
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:51,787
It must be difficult for you
to live in this house.

112
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,042
Go to bed.

113
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:59,241
Go To Bed

114
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:34,406
Mischa

115
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,152
Get up.

116
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,430
Now screem all you please

117
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:56,055
Everyday you'll pay for this.

118
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:59,448
Everyday for the rest 
of your short and nasty live

119
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,644
Lecter.

120
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,919
SING

121
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:51,109
Mr the earl Robert Lecter
Castle Vigo, Etampes, France.

122
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:50,394
Who is there?

123
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:52,924
Some help you are, Shoo, go.

124
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:00,719
What is it Serge?
- A boy, Madame.

125
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,225
He has pictures of you and your husband.

126
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,352
Your uncle would have
loved to see you again.

127
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:44,165
It has been almost a year since he died.

128
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,260
Only you and l are left.

129
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,921
Mischa, Mischa.

130
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:31,526
Mischa, Mischa.
- Hannibal

131
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:34,180
Mischa.
- Hannibal, Hannibal 

132
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,388
Hannibal, wake up

133
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,416
It's alright, it's alright.

134
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,274
When you sleep, do you remember?

135
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,540
Do you remember what happened to Mischa?

136
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,409
You look like your uncle Hannibal.

137
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:22,468
Would you like to try?

138
00:23:22,826 --> 00:23:24,176
Use this

139
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,204
Speak to me.

140
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,540
Thank you.

141
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:28,168
Hannibal.

142
00:25:40,136 --> 00:25:42,575
Here is where l pray to my ancestors,

143
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,665
for strenght and courage

144
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:53,901
I have the honor.
Only on my ancestors birthday…

145
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:57,836
to polish his armour with oil of clove

146
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:16,103
This is after the fight
for Osaka castle.

147
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:27,595
The Samurai displayed the head of their enemies

148
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:31,700
There are more suitable parchments,
that will interest you

149
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:37,500
Be gentle Hannibal and be brave…

150
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:41,331
Like your father

151
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,690
And like him.

152
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,705
You must be ready for anything.

153
00:26:57,956 --> 00:26:58,838
Come.

154
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,340
Again.

155
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,106
Again.

156
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:16,860
Well. Again.

157
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,928
Hé, Japonese.

158
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:05,122
Hé, Japonese.

159
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:07,175
Messieur please

160
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:10,896
Is that it?
- Yes.

161
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,689
Hé, Japonese tell me the truth.…

162
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:16,938
Does your pussy run crossways?

163
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:19,713
Full of  straight hairs that will explode.

164
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,518
Hannibal

165
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:32,305
Don't move

166
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:56,024
If you pissed in my fueltank, 
l'll twist your head of.

167
00:30:56,182 --> 00:30:58,296
Paul Momund, the butcher.

168
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:02,757
You owe a certain lady
 an apology.

169
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:05,388
Apologise to la Japonese?

170
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:09,118
Boy must be crazy to come here. 
I throw you in the river…

171
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:12,938
or maybe l slit your pants
and give you something you don't want,

172
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,436
where you don't want it.

173
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:18,751
You inquired about her... pussy.

174
00:31:19,232 --> 00:31:22,184
You speculated it went, which way?

175
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,786
Jap pussy runs crossways.

176
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:28,099
You should fuck the Jap
and see for yourself.

177
00:31:29,193 --> 00:31:31,154
Crossways like that?

178
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:46,713
Or more tangential?

179
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:05,093
You see how you now stains the air?

180
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:08,377
I should add that to my drawing.

181
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:10,890
Would you like to see it?

182
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:01,336
Wait for me.

183
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,370
This here was done by a single blade.

184
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:11,050
Ah inspector Popil, 
l am very happy you could come.

185
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:13,324
You won't remember me but l was with the cause

186
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,375
- You delivered the rait to Nuerenburg
l sat behind you

187
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:19,242
I saw you bring the evidence

188
00:33:19,717 --> 00:33:21,690
It's an honor sir.

189
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:26,008
What do we have here?
- Paul Momund, or   most of it.

190
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:29,138
You have his dossier.
- Yes.

191
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:34,184
Fat and ugly.
He shipped Jews for Marseille.

192
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,210
He fought recently.

193
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:38,411
And often.

194
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:41,679
Last saturdaynight a barfight.
He had many enemies.

195
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,175
A list please, his recent opponents

196
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:49,532
You have done nothing to this body?
- No, no, no sir.

197
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,610
The chief specifficaly…
- The odour, it's eh …

198
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,488
It's not of anything you use here?

199
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:56,599
It smells like a toothpain remedy

200
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,823
Yes, oil of cloves.

201
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:01,221
Let's see the pharmasist

202
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,231
Look.

203
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:08,211
The most exquiset bits
of the fish are the cheeks

204
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,212
This is true for many creatures

205
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:14,161
When carving at the table,
you one give cheek to madame…

206
00:34:14,312 --> 00:34:16,941
the other to the guest of honour.
- Did you hear?

207
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:21,217
They haven't found that butcher's
damned ugly head yet.

208
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,956
Good evening, milady.

209
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:52,895
I hope you don't mind.

210
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,928
I would have used a butcher's-knife,
but the sword seems appropriate.

211
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:11,510
Not a knick in the blade, l promise you

212
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:15,859
The butcher was like butter.

213
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,400
You didn't need to do this for me

214
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,474
Rudeness is epidemic, milady

215
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,721
Police.

216
00:36:57,777 --> 00:36:59,987
They will call it a murder.

217
00:37:00,864 --> 00:37:03,141
It was the crime of passion.

218
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:11,102
Wash your hands, quickly.  Go.

219
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:18,200
Inspector Popjil?
- Popil, Madame.

220
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:19,822
Popil.

221
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:24,389
Hannibal Lecter?

222
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:27,462
Good evening.

223
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:30,766
You fought with the butcher,
Paul Momund, in the market.

224
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:33,790
Now he is dead.

225
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:36,841
I must ask you to come along with me.

226
00:37:40,107 --> 00:37:41,859
Is your name Hannibal Lecter?

227
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:45,290
Yes.

228
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:51,386
Do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of Paul Momund?

229
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,448
Guilty knowledge?
- Limit your responses to yes or no.

230
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:00,165
No.

231
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:09,389
It's funny la. 
He reacts to nothing.

232
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:14,136
Monstrous.

233
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:20,959
The butcher had been fishing.

234
00:38:21,463 --> 00:38:24,816
Blood and scales on his knife, 
but no fish.

235
00:38:24,817 --> 00:38:27,474
The tape tells you all that?

236
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:29,413
Remarkable.

237
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:32,760
No.

238
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:37,398
The chef told me, 
you brought a splendid fish in for dinner.

239
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:41,497
Where did you get that fish?
- By fishing, inspector.

240
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:45,066
We keep a baited line in the water
behind the boathouse

241
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,713
I show you if you like.

242
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,608
My speciality
is warcrimes.

243
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:55,038
And I know 
they do not end with the war

244
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:59,047
You lost your entire family.
So did I.

245
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:04,412
For you your beautiful aunt came and… 
made up for it all.

246
00:39:04,954 --> 00:39:08,762
The very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp

247
00:39:08,863 --> 00:39:12,355
So
when Paul the butcher spewed filth at her

248
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,430
I can understand if you killed him.

249
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:18,091
Tell me what happened, Hannibal.

250
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:20,662
Together we could show a court.

251
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:24,983
The very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp

252
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:30,982
Do you compose verse inspector,
and keep it under your pillow?

253
00:39:50,677 --> 00:39:54,767
Now tell me inspector,
did you choose warcrimes

254
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:58,768
because your lost family in the war?
- Yes.

255
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:00,763
How?

256
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:05,126
Some in combat, some were shipped east

257
00:40:05,227 --> 00:40:06,803
Did you catch who did it?

258
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,485
No.

259
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,761
But they were Vichy, men like the butcher?

260
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:13,093
Yes.

261
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:17,306
Then we are both suspects.

262
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:20,700
I can say you were fishing with me
if you like.

263
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:26,281
Inspector, you must see this.

264
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:30,652
I told you to keep these people away.

265
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:40,146
Is that the butcher?
- Yes, Mr.

266
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:43,235
How long?
- Ten minutes, no longer.

267
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,315
Father… mother…

268
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:34,233
I am the youngest student
they've ever admitted into medical school.

269
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,129
It's a work scolarship.
I think you would be pleased.

270
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:44,500
Heavy duties on my uncles estate

271
00:41:44,764 --> 00:41:47,795
have finally forced the sell of the chateau.

272
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:51,748
Lady Murasaki will leave for Paris with me.

273
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:54,936
The residency in France is 
now a doghouse.

274
00:41:55,537 --> 00:41:59,200
Medical institute Saint Marie - Paris.

275
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,738
This work-scolarship 

276
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:06,038
Means  l must spend much of my sparetime
preparing bodies for the anatomyclass

277
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:14,339
My studies are fascinating 
and absorb me completely.

278
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:21,985
Yet I still find myself
thinking about my sister

279
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:24,274
and to the men who her from me.

280
00:42:24,317 --> 00:42:25,617
Hannibal.

281
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:33,811
Do you suppose god intended to eat Isaac?

282
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:37,994
That's why he told Abraham to kill him.

283
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:41,514
Eat him? Of course not.

284
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,177
The angel intervenes in time.

285
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:49,510
Not always.

286
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:58,228
I have to know about Mischa.

287
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,928
I see their faces in my dreams…

288
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:08,473
but l can't remember what they called 
each other with their blooded mouths.

289
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:12,294
I would give anything to remember

290
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:17,876
Hannibal,

291
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:25,439
memory is a knife,
it hurts you.

292
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:48,117
I want to stay here with you.

293
00:43:49,141 --> 00:43:51,570
No, you must stay at school.

294
00:44:12,224 --> 00:44:14,282
Louis I need you to remember

295
00:44:14,732 --> 00:44:18,387
Who told the nazis
where the children were hidden?

296
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:20,697
You must remember.

297
00:44:22,136 --> 00:44:25,214
I can't bear to think about it

298
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,300
This will help you remember.

299
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:33,287
Hannibal Lecter.
What are you doing here?

300
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:37,768
The body,
I am a medical student now.

301
00:44:38,498 --> 00:44:41,546
Yes I know,
I have followed your progress.

302
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:44,934
You repeat nothing you hear in this room.

303
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:49,263
Please, Louis.

304
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:52,231
Klaus Barbie shipped
the children to Auswitch.

305
00:44:52,431 --> 00:44:56,454
Who told him where the children where hidden?
Did you tell him?

306
00:44:58,602 --> 00:45:03,219
When they broke my fingers,
I gave them Pardou.

307
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:08,216
Pardou knew where
children were hidden.

308
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:15,235
He's mayor of Belleville now.

309
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,855
Thank you, Louis.
- Inspector.

310
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:23,993
Yes.
- Where were the police?

311
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:43,390
No no no, no no no please please.

312
00:46:02,168 --> 00:46:04,130
You knew at-once what Louis wanted,
didn't you.

313
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:08,225
His crucifix to remain with his brain,
not his heart.

314
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:11,917
He answered your question,
but you didn't answer his.

315
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:17,776
Where were the police when the nazis
threw the children into the trucks?

316
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,911
Come and play

317
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:14,619
One little cheek, two little cheeks.

318
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:16,780
Cough.

319
00:48:18,743 --> 00:48:20,565
She has pneumonia.

320
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:22,354
Let's take her

321
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:25,386
She's going to die anyway

322
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,300
Come on

323
00:48:56,445 --> 00:48:58,571
Get out.
- Grutas, wait.

324
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,928
the dogtags

325
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:06,742
Potwatch,
Hurry

326
00:50:35,404 --> 00:50:37,808
Your tickets, please.

327
00:50:52,254 --> 00:50:57,640
Medininkai, Soviet border.

328
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:12,619
Passport.

329
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:28,261
Student?
- Yes.

330
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,129
