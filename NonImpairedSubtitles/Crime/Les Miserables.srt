1
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,072
You can't sleep here.

2
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,846
- Get away from me.
- Why don't you go to an inn?

3
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,447
- Why do you think?
- Did you knock on doors and ask people?

4
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,048
l asked everywhere. Leave me alone.

5
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,786
You didn't ask there.

6
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,800
Knock on that door.

7
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,541
Who can that be?

8
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,446
Do you have food?

9
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,250
- Come in.
- Look, l'm a convict.

10
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,726
My name is Jean Valjean.
I've served 19 years' hard Iabor.

11
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,490
They let me out four days ago.
l'm on parole.

12
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,499
l have to go to Dijon to report Monday,
or they'll send me back to prison.

13
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,833
Here's my passport. I can't read, but
l know what it says. ''He's dangerous.''

14
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,430
Monsieur, you're welcome
to eat with us as my guest.

15
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:05,443
l'm a convict. You saw my passport.

16
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,503
l know who you are.

17
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,607
You're gonna let me inside your house?

18
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,729
What crime did you commit?

19
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,701
Maybe l killed someone.

20
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,035
How do you know
l'm not going to murder you?

21
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:42,138
How do you know
l'm not going to murder you?

22
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,580
A joke?

23
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,483
l suppose
we'll have to trust each other.

24
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,623
l didn't kill anyone.

25
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:56,753
l'm a thief. l stole food.

26
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,595
l stole, but l paid for it.
Nineteen years in chains.

27
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,602
So they let me out,
and they give me a yelIow passport.

28
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,070
What can l do with a yellow passport?

29
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,075
I have to go to my parole officer in
Dijon, and then what? Starve to death?

30
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,646
Nineteen years,
and now the real punishment begins.

31
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,651
- Men can be unjust.
- Men? Not God?

32
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,819
All right.
Whoever you are, thank you.

33
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,986
A meal and a bed to sleep in.

34
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,156
A real bed.

35
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,631
And in the morning, I'll be a new man.

36
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,933
Swine.

37
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,415
ls anybody there?

38
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:45,555
So we'Il use wooden spoons. l don't want
to hear anything more about it.

39
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,932
- l'm sorry to disturb you.
- You caught him!

40
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,267
l had my eye on this man.

41
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank God.

42
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,508
l'm very angry with you, Jean Valjean.

43
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,602
What happened to your eye, monseigneur?

44
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,876
- Didn't he teIl you he was our guest?
- Oh, yes.

45
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,352
After we searched his knapsack
and found all this silver...

46
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,411
he claimed...

47
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,650
that you gave it to him.

48
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,353
Yes. Of course
l gave him the silverware.

49
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,955
But why didn't you take
the candlesticks? That was very foolish.

50
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,194
Mme Gilot, fetch
the silver candlesticks.

51
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,726
They're worth at least 2,000 francs.
Why did you leave them? Hurry!

52
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,172
M. Valjean has to get going.

53
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,541
He's lost a lot of time.

54
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,546
Did you forget to take them?

55
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,380
- Are you saying he told us the truth?
- Of course.

56
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,681
Thank you for bringing him back.
l'm very relieved.

57
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,550
Release him.

58
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,357
You're letting me go?

59
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,393
Didn't you understand the bishop?

60
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:54,592
Mme Gilot, offer these men some wine.
They must be thirsty.

61
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:56,960
Thanks.

62
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,279
And don't forget--

63
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,344
don't ever forget
you've promised to become a new man.

64
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,720
Promise.

65
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,259
Why are you doing this?

66
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,195
Jean Valjean, my brother,
you no longer belong to evil.

67
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:30,630
With this silver, l've bought your soul.

68
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,638
l've ransomed you from fear and hatred.

69
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,641
Now l give you back to God.

70
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,562
Good afternoon, Captain.
l'm Javert, the new police inspector.

71
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,067
Here are my orders
from the Paris prefect.

72
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,933
Oh, yes. Hello, lnspector Javert.

73
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,940
l've been expecting you.
l'm Captain Beauvais.

74
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,535
- How was your journey?
- You haven't Iooked at my orders.

75
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,671
Oh, l'm sure they're all right.
Have you eaten?

76
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,081
- Or wouId you--
- l'd like you to foIlow procedure.

77
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,988
Well, everything seems...

78
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,223
to be in order, lnspector.

79
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,163
You are now in charge
of the Vigau police.

80
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,497
ln Paris, things are miserable.

81
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,661
Crime is rampant.

82
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:15,867
The streets are filthy.
Conditions here are much better.

83
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,432
Yes. Life in Vigau
has never been better.

84
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,139
Shall l take you to our brick f actory?

85
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,477
- That's our biggest business.
- Very well.

86
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,982
This way.

87
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,578
- Who owns the factory?
- The mayor.

88
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,623
He was one of the workers.

89
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,684
But when it went bankrupt five years
ago-- incredible to think of now--

90
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,787
he bought the whole works
for Iess than 500 francs.

91
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,890
l shouId report to the mayor
as soon as possible.

92
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,901
- Let's do that first.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,871
The mayor seems to be the force behind
everything. Must be a man of genius.

94
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,570
He is extraordinary. But I should
warn you, he is also a little eccentric.

95
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,775
- Eccentric? ln what way?
- Well, he's shy. Lives Iike a hermit.

96
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,783
Didn't even want to be mayor.

97
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,184
Tried to refuse the honor,
but the town fathers insisted.

98
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,586
Not ambitious, yet he's this successful.

99
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,923
He's a mystery. Some people think
he's crazy, but l like him.

100
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:13,658
- l like him, and l feel sorry for him.
- You feel sorry for the mayor?

101
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,702
Because he's lonely. Here we are.

102
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,704
- He lives here?
- Strange, isn't it?

103
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,935
Little better than a worker's house.

104
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,080
Good afternoon, Monsieur Ie Maire.
The new inspector has arrived.

105
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,711
- He wants to report.
- That's all right. He doesn't have to.

106
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:39,224
But Monsieur le Maire, if you don't
permit the inspector to report...

107
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,226
I think he will burst into tears.

108
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,026
Monsieur le Maire, l'm Inspector Javert.

109
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,664
l have the honor of reporting
to my post as your prefect of police.

110
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,938
- l'm sorry. What's your name?
- lnspector Javert.

111
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,815
- You were expecting me. Paris should--
- You have papers?

112
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,084
Yes, l apologize. l should
have presented them immediately.

113
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,819
Good. Thank you for coming.

114
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,556
Captain, make sure
the inspector is settled comfortably.

115
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,564
- Yes.
- Good day.

116
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,658
- The men and women work separately?
- Yes.

117
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:28,833
Monsieur le maire redesigned the factory
in order to keep the sexes apart.

118
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,776
- l told you he's eccentric.
- Not eccentric, Captain. No.

119
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:37,373
He cares about honest working women
and wants to protect their virtue.

120
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,077
Very proper. Very wise.

121
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,914
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

122
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,357
You've ruined another one!
They're going to dock my wages.

123
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,952
AIl right! Enough.
Fantine, get your things.

124
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,294
- l'm gonna move your place.
- Good riddance!

125
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,925
An unforgettable experience,
but l'll forget it anyway!

126
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,664
Let's go. Back to work! Come on.

127
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,504
The fun's over. Come on. Back to work.

128
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,060
WelI, l'd feel safer
if you had an escort.

129
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,397
Don't worry. l can look after myself.
l haven't much time. l must leave.

130
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,870
l hope this urgency
does not imply distress.

131
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,204
May l ask why you are withdrawing
your entire fortune?

132
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,734
l trust that you are aware that
this institution is at your service--

133
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:17,407
Thank you. But this is
a business opportunity. No crisis.

134
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,548
I'll be back tomorrow.

135
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:24,020
l have received disturbing information
about one of the girls.

136
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,788
l haven't questioned her, but l believe
she has a chiId and is not married.

137
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,887
- What? ls she a whore?
- l don't hire--

138
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:36,458
-l don't hire women who sell themselves.
-Of course you don't. I apoIogize.

139
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,027
lt's just, l don't want our ladies
to be exposed to corruption.

140
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,096
l suggest dismissal.

141
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,768
- I trust your judgment.
- Thank you.

142
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,274
Fantine, come with me, please. Come on.

143
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,416
She's caught the tart.

144
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,787
Please don't let me go now, madame.
My little girl is sick.

145
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,793
You read it in that Ietter
from the people who take care of her.

146
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,352
They write that she's got
the military fever.

147
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,524
They need 40 francs for medicine,
or she'lI die in a week.

148
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,502
Who are these people, the Thénardiers?
Are they relatives?

149
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,505
No, not reIatives.

150
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,872
You deliberately left your child
with strangers to conceal her?

151
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,877
You're dismissing me
for having a chiId--

152
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,879
Not for having a child...

153
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,212
but for having a child out of wedlock
and pretending to be an honest woman.

154
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,274
I have to earn money to feed her.

155
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,583
How can l work and take care of her?
l have to lie.

156
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,215
You make it sound
as though your lie is my fault.

157
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,921
No. l'm sorry. l'm upset.
l don't mean to argue, madame.

158
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,625
My Cosette is a sweet littIe girl,
an innocent little girl.

159
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,431
Don't punish her for my sin.
l was stupid. l fell in love--

160
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,529
''ln love.'' That is always the excuse.

161
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,871
Yes, you're right. I'm bad.
I'm a bad person.

162
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,002
But the Thénardiers are good people.
They have two daughters of their own.

163
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,048
My Cosette can play with them.
She won't be so lonely.

164
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:34,882
She's better off with them. Only l have
to make money to pay for her medicine.

165
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:40,220
- Please. Just a month. l'll work hard.
- Monsieur cares about his workers.

166
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:44,285
He cannot have women of questionable
morals influencing the girIs.

167
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,024
l'm sorry.

168
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,092
What's going on?

169
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,868
Five sous for the chair.
Nice doing business with you.

170
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,172
- Are you skipping out?
- l sold it for extra money.

171
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,270
- You owe me a month's rent.
- Not till next week.

172
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:06,147
Pay now, or you're out. l've got people
who want the room. Thirty francs.

173
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,676
- You got 50 in your hand.
- l'll give you 15. The rest next week.

174
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,382
How? They fired you.

175
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,051
Who told you l was fired?

176
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:18,153
- This is stilI a smalI town.
- l have a job.

177
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,596
- Don't lie.
- l start next week.

178
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,635
Everybody knows your story.
You've got a bastard kid.

179
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,636
Nobody's gonna give you work.

180
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,905
Please take haIf. l'll get you the rest.

181
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,446
Don't look so worried.

182
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,448
Things aren't that bad.

183
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,845
You've stilI got a bed.

184
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:03,968
Yes. Good hair quality. Ten francs.

185
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,814
Dear Reverend Mother...

186
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,911
the bishop of Digne,
may he rest in peace...

187
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,423
often told me of your convent
and its good works.

188
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,553
ln his memory, l would like to give a--

189
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,221
Or ''l should Iike''?

190
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,458
''Should'' is preferable.

191
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,400
And ''endow'' is less brutal than ''give.''

192
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:34,599
- l should like to endow--
- Monsieur, there's been an accident!

193
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,267
One of the workers, Lafitte!

194
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,278
Breaking my-- Get me out!

195
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,837
- l can't breathe!
- Stand back. Let me through.

196
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:48,376
Help us. We need leverage.
Come on! Move! Quickly now!

197
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,990
Get me out! lt's breaking my ribs!

198
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,998
- Get ready.
- Come on. Push! AlI together!

199
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,899
Come on.

200
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,437
- Marla, where's Claudette tonight?
- Good evening.

201
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,943
Oh, she's--

202
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,378
There are more than ever.

203
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,509
Oh. lnspector, you startled me.

204
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,576
Yes, l've counted four new girls.

205
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,715
You see, Captain, when a town grows,
crime grows with it.

206
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,952
Shall l get the men? We'll make arrests.

207
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,053
- No. Did you check off the regulars?
- Yes.

208
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,589
- And l've noted the new girls.
- Good work.

209
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:17,107
- ls it 10:00? l didn't hear it ring.
- l'm early. l was restless.

210
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,769
- You heard about Lafitte and the cart?
- Heard nothing else.

211
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:23,645
lncredible feat. Has the mayor
always been that strong?

212
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:27,811
Well, he's a big man.
But I didn't know he was that strong.

213
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:32,255
- Didn't he show it when he was young?
- l didn't know him when he was young.

214
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,782
Oh, that's right. He moved here.
Where's he from?

215
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:39,854
He came here from Paris, but that's
not where he was born. l think he told--

216
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:43,662
Didn't you check his papers
when he arrived?

217
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,295
l suppose l did. Don't remember.

218
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,305
Perhaps you didn't.

219
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,307
Why should you?

220
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,313
What about her?

221
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,580
- Who are you? Push off !
- Yeah, clear off.

222
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,382
Please.

223
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,082
Hi, dearie.

224
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,352
Yes, yes.

225
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,859
She's new.

226
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,944
Who is it?

227
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,184
l'm buying your horse and cart.

228
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:39,622
The doctor says your kneecap's broken.
You won't be able to do your old job.

229
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,252
l've taken the liberty of writing
to the Sainte Marie Convent in Paris.

230
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,922
The sisters need
a new caretaker and gardener.

231
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,569
l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.

232
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,503
Sorry for what?

233
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,806
Monsieur, l used to--

234
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,312
l was angry at you...

235
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:06,681
because when you came here,
you were a worker like me...

236
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,381
and you grew rich while l had troubles.

237
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:14,687
We've all had troubles, Lafitte,
and we alI need help from time to time.

238
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,287
Rest, and l'lI let you know
when l've word from the convent.

239
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:29,002
''Thank you...

240
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,475
for our...

241
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,536
new c--''

242
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:39,983
C-A-R-E--

243
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,918
- Caretaker. That's it. Caretaker.
- Excuse me.

244
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,616
lnspector Javert is here to see you.

245
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,624
Tell him to wait.

246
00:23:56,568 --> 00:24:00,629
l have exciting news, Monsieur le Maire.
Paris is interested in my plan.

247
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,365
- What plan is that?
- lt's in the letter.

248
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,877
Why don't you telI me?
You said it's your plan.

249
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,576
l forgot. l apologize.

250
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:16,314
- Apologize for what?
- l forgot, you don't read.

251
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,549
Your clerk mentioned it.

252
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,183
Neglected your education
to make your fortune, l suppose.

253
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,989
What is Paris interested in?
l'm all ears.

254
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,198
Because of Vigau's extraordinary growth
during the past five years...

255
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,235
l've proposed that we make
a detailed census.

256
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,262
Well, that would be interesting.
But how is it a police matter?

257
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,334
Modern law enforcement demands modern
methods, and that means information.

258
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:44,007
For example: How many peopIe
have moved here in the last decade?

259
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:47,813
Where did they come from?
What's their background?

260
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,720
ls our criminal population homegrown,
or are they outsiders?

261
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,022
Without information we cannot know
how to control the dangerous elements.

262
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:03,793
- You might be making a mistake.
- What mistake is that?

263
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,636
Sometimes peopIe move to a new town
to start with a clean slate.

264
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:12,143
You might be doing more harm than good
by prying into their private lives.

265
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,145
An honest man has nothing to fear
from the truth.

266
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,147
For exampIe, Paris knows...

267
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,206
that my father was a thief...

268
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,014
and my mother, a prostitute.

269
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:25,545
If my mother or father
were to move here to Vigau...

270
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,956
I would want everyone to know
who and what they are.

271
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,725
- Even if they had reformed themselves?
- Reform is a discredited fantasy.

272
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,597
Modern science telIs us that people are
by nature Iawbreakers or law abiders.

273
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:39,569
A wolf can wear sheep's clothing...

274
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,572
but he's still a wolf.

275
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,910
l was just thinking, lnspector,
that you have been unlucky.

276
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,108
Unlucky? l don't understand.

277
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:55,084
Unfortunately,
you've been assigned to a dull post.

278
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,087
You'd be happier in Paris...

279
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:00,249
where everyone, either by nature
or experience, is dishonest.

280
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,658
lndeed. But l'll see if l prefer Paris.

281
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:07,994
They've asked me to report to the deputy
prefect to further explain my idea.

282
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,694
l'll be gone for four days.

283
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,602
We'll miss you. Good luck.

284
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,732
Thank you. And good-bye.

285
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,306
lnspector, one moment.

286
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,548
Please.

287
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,155
A f arewell gift.

288
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,452
You're offering me a gift?

289
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,425
Yes, lnspector. My papers.

290
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,897
Baptism certificate.

291
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,991
Passport.

292
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,162
Working papers
from the Marseilles docks.

293
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:50,401
l want to get your census off
on the right foot.

294
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,409
Pleasant journey, lnspector.

295
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,852
Move on. Have your papers ready.
lt is Paris. We don't waste time here.

296
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:12,090
- lnspector Javert. Let me through.
- Papers. Move on.

297
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:28,642
Inspector Javerf, fhe prefecf
was impressed by your proposal.

298
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,672
I expect him to approve a budget
for your census within the month.

299
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,447
Thank you, sir. That's excellent news.

300
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,886
You are known in Paris now.

301
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,618
Your future is bright.

302
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,990
So l suggest you drop...

303
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,861
this request for an investigation
of the mayor.

304
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:51,664
Sir, l was a guard for a year
in the quarries of Toulon.

305
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:56,366
l saw Jean Valjean perform the same feat
of strength the mayor did with the cart.

306
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,535
The hard labor
makes them incredibly strong.

307
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,545
Once l made the connection...

308
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:07,074
once I was no longer dazzled by his
wealth, I've grown more certain daily.

309
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:12,522
Now l recognize his f ace and voice,
l'm amazed l didn't know him right away.

310
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,491
- Well, Javert, l don't doubt that--
- Sir.

311
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,721
l'm prepared to denounce him.

312
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,857
Denounce him? Without proof?

313
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:28,903
lf l force a trial,
the evidence will be found.

314
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,601
lf he showed you papers,
and they were in order--

315
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,009
l checked the baptism certificate.
lt's a copy.

316
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,709
Eleven years ago there was a fire
at the parish.

317
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:42,776
The original records were destroyed. AlI
his documents are based on that copy.

318
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,415
Your identification alone is not enough
to subject the mayor of Vigau...

319
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,550
to a triaI.

320
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,255
File a report,
and l'll recommend we investigate.

321
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,356
Sir, Jean Valjean is a thief.

322
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,493
lt makes a mockery of our institutions
to have a corrupt and depraved man...

323
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,504
in charge
of our industry and government.

324
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,132
l said file a report.

325
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:07,372
I'll investigate
on this end, discreetly.

326
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,777
Do not denounce him without proof.

327
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,215
Be patient.

328
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,548
He's not going anywhere, is he?

329
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,162
''Madame...

330
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,539
the ten francs a month
we agreed on is no longer enough.

331
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,135
Cosette grows bigger by the minute.

332
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,875
She enjoyed her sixth birthday party
and the new doIl we bought her.

333
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,816
We love her, so we won't charge
for her present.

334
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:51,845
But she needs a new coat and shoes.
We can't afford to pay for them.

335
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,949
And she eats more than both
our daughters put together.

336
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,325
Beginning right away
you must send 20 francs a month...

337
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,330
or you'll have to fetch her.

338
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,492
Sincerely, Thénardier.''

339
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,577
- So what's your answer?
- l can't move.

340
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,706
l don't have money
to pay in advance for a room.

341
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:21,650
Am l a charity?
You haven't paid me in four months.

342
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:25,211
- l paid you.
- l have bills. l can't spread my Iegs.

343
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,693
Besides, it's not good business to rent
to a whore. What about your necklace?

344
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:34,027
- That's worth something.
- No, not this. lt's for my daughter.

345
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:37,898
You better come up with something.
l want ten francs, or you're out!

346
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,546
This time l want cash.

347
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,719
Good evening, monsieur.

348
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,789
My God, you're hideous.

349
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,558
- Well, how much?
- A franc.

350
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,561
- You're joking.
- Fifty sous.

351
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,526
- To screw a corpse?
- Come here.

352
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,536
She hasn't got a drop of blood
in her veins!

353
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:17,166
Mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle, how about a sous?

354
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:21,474
I have a sous.
l have a sous to spend on you.

355
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,779
Let's give your tits a bit of color.

356
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,284
Now...

357
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,345
how about something...

358
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,855
to drink!

359
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,891
Something to drink!

360
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,099
Now down you go, tart.

361
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,329
Oh, she's mad!

362
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,338
She's attacking him!

363
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,875
Sir, this is a disturbance.

364
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,638
May l?

365
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,645
l'll take care of this.

366
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,611
That's enough!

367
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,622
lt's not my fault! They started--

368
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,058
Go home!

369
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,561
- Be quick about it!
- Let's go.

370
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:41,917
Captain.

371
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,928
You asked me to tell you
if he went too far.

372
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:48,124
Well, l've kept my mouth shut
long enough.

373
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,435
Have her taken to the prison.
You'll get six months.

374
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:58,703
Six months? What about Cosette?
What'll happen to her?

375
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,301
- Who is Cosette?
- My daughter.

376
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,678
lf l don't send the Thénardiers money,
they'll turn her out.

377
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:07,616
- ls your daughter here in Vigau?
- No, sir. She lives with--

378
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,016
Then she's not my concern.

379
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:15,054
lnspector!
lnspector, please listen to my side.

380
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:19,028
l know l hit the gentleman.
l know l was wrong.

381
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,930
But do they have the right
to put snow down my dress...

382
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,027
especially when it's the only one
l have, and l need it for work?

383
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,437
l'm sorry. l don't mean to argue.

384
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,909
lt won't happen again.

385
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,911
lnspector, please.

386
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,948
- Please be merciful.
- All right.

387
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,145
l've listened to your side.
You're still getting six months.

388
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,417
- The eternal fire can't change that.
- One moment.

389
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:53,255
lt's you. You did this to me!
You fired me.

390
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,923
Slut! Come here!

391
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,366
- Let her go.
- What?

392
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:04,899
Let me explain. l was crossing
the square when you arrested her.

393
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:09,037
l asked people, and they said it was
the fauIt of the men who'd attacked her.

394
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,843
ln f act, they should be under arrest.

395
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,714
Now that you've heard this new evidence,
l want you to release her.

396
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,847
He said l can go.
He is the mayor, isn't he?

397
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,584
l'll be going.

398
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,061
- l won't be any bother to anyone.
- Sergeant, who said she could go?

399
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,791
- l did.
- No, you don't.

400
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:31,392
l'm the final judicial authority
in Vigau. She's innocent.

401
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,605
- She spat on you.
- She was upset. l forgive her.

402
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,972
She insuIted you.
ln front of my men, she defiled you.

403
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,012
- That's my concern, lnspector.
- No, sir. You are wrong.

404
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,378
You are the personification of order...

405
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,316
morality, government--
in fact, the whole of society.

406
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,013
You don't have the right to forgive her
for debasing all of us.

407
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,113
You don't have the authority
to destroy justice.

408
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,782
l do.

409
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:57,259
Under Articles 9 and 11 of the criminal
code, l can order her release.

410
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,558
Sergeant, she is free to go.

411
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,225
l cannot alIow that, monsieur.
l was there. She attacked a man.

412
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:07,863
- The decision is mine. She is free.
- Not while l am in charge of this post!

413
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,000
Under Article 66, you are relieved
of command until tomorrow morning.

414
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,807
You are dismissed, lnspector! Leave!

415
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,313
Now!

416
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,822
You're free to go.

417
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,595
Water.

418
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,283
I doubt she'll survive.

419
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,979
She talks continually about Cosette.
Who's that?

420
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:59,750
- Her daughter.
- She needs will to fight the infection.

421
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,349
Perhaps if the girl were with her--

422
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,519
l understand. Thank you, Doctor.

423
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:08,622
You'll need nurses. l can't arrange for
them till morning. What about tonight?

424
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,861
l'lI take care of her tonight.

425
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,873
Keep her body warm and her head cool.
Good night.

426
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,640
Why did the gossip bother you?

427
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,910
- You didn't have to fire me.
- Your cIothes are damp.

428
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,846
- l have to get you some dry--
- lt's all right.

429
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:07,857
There'll be no charge. You deserve it.

430
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:19,632
But l don't understand
why you're being so kind.

431
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:23,640
l was preoccupied. l didn't know.

432
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,745
lf you'd come straight to me,
none of this--

433
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,317
You need to rest.

434
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,921
- You don't want a kiss?
- l want you to rest.

435
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,562
And don't worry.
l'll bring your daughter to you.

436
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,622
- You're going to the Thénardiers?
- No. l can't.

437
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,002
l'll send the money
to bring Cosette here.

438
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,635
- She can't live with me.
- Of course she can.

439
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,505
She will.

440
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:03,206
She'll attend the school,
and you won't have any more worries.

441
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,582
When you're better
l'lI find work for you.

442
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,917
But you don't understand.

443
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,754
l'm a whore, and Cosette has no father.

444
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,123
She has the Lord.

445
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,128
He is her Father.

446
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,498
And you are His creation.

447
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,637
ln His eyes you have never been anything
but an innocent...

448
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,634
and beautiful woman.

449
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,894
- You look better every day.
- Liar.

450
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,600
- Please.
- Thank you.

451
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,300
Fantine, look.

452
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,608
ls that Thénardier's handwriting?

453
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,978
- Yes.
- ls something wrong?

454
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,985
- Read it.
- l don't know how.

455
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:21,722
- Would you read it to me?
- Well, l'm-- l'm learning, myself.

456
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,056
We're a fine pair.

457
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:31,533
My clerk tells me this man can't bring
Cosette because you owe him money.

458
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,730
- l don't. l paid him.
- l've sent him money as well.

459
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,535
lt's an obvious lie. He could've
brought Cosette and been paid in person.

460
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,542
Then l'Il go get her.

461
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,738
No, wait. Stay where you are.
lt's all right.

462
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,873
There's no need.
He thinks you've come into money.

463
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,078
He's become a little greedy, that's all.

464
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,350
l've sent him what he's asked for,
and extra, to bring Cosette.

465
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,358
She should be here in a few days.

466
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,028
How wonderful to see her.

467
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,530
- You must eat.
- Have your lunch.

468
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,035
What about you? Don't you eat?

469
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,259
'Our litfle lark, our darling Cosetfe...

470
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,528
is eager to be with her mother,
but she has a cough.

471
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,002
'Like my mummy's,'
the sweet angel said.

472
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:19,634
The physician advises
she's not well enough to travel now.

473
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,644
l'll bring her when she's stronger.

474
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,237
Meanwhile, the medicine is expensive...

475
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,977
and the doctor's bills are criminal.

476
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,383
Fantine owes us another 50 francs.''

477
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,388
- All right. l've heard enough.
- Do you want to dictate a reply?

478
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,321
No.

479
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,985
lnstead, write this note
for Fantine to sign:

480
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,791
''M. Thénardier...

481
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,197
you will hand Cosette over
to the bearer.

482
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,635
Regards.''

483
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,540
l'll be leaving right away.

484
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,010
- Javert.
- I need to see you immediateIy.

485
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,642
- Alone.
- Thank you, Pierre.

486
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,594
l'm in a hurry, lnspector.

487
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:20,203
A serious-- A grave violation
of the public trust has been committed.

488
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,638
An inferior has shown a complete
lack of respect for the law.

489
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,938
- He must be exposed and punished.
- Who is the offender?

490
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,104
I am.

491
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:37,119
l slandered you, monsieur. l'm here
to ask that you demand my dismissal.

492
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,917
lnspector, what are you talking about?

493
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,857
Resignation is honorable,
and l don't deserve it.

494
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,187
I must be punished.

495
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:50,927
You treated me unjustly over the--
about the woman.

496
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:54,459
This time you must treat me justly.
You must dismiss me.

497
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,130
For what?

498
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:02,271
l denounced you
to the Paris prefect of police.

499
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:06,214
- l swore that you were a convict.
- You said l was what?

500
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,877
A convict.

501
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:12,389
l had no proof.

502
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:17,655
Only a memory of this man, Jean Valjean,
whom l guarded 20 years ago in prison.

503
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,730
l denounced you
without a shred of evidence.

504
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,097
- You denounced me?
- Yes.

505
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,467
l was a fool. They told me l was wrong.

506
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,769
They said you couldn't be
Jean Valjean, and they were right.

507
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:34,902
l've just returned from Arras,
where l saw the real Jean VaIjean.

508
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,345
- The real Valjean?
- Yes.

509
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:42,477
Two weeks ago, a man called Carnot
was arrested for poaching apples.

510
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:48,181
At the prison, a convict took one look
at him and said, ''l know this man.

511
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,227
We were in prison in Toulon
20 years ago.

512
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:55,595
He's Jean Valjean.'' l didn't believe it.

513
00:43:55,666 --> 00:44:00,535
l went there to see for myself.
Well, there's no question.

514
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,538
Carnot is Valjean.

515
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,037
l apologize, monsieur.

516
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:10,205
l Iook at you now,
and it's obvious you're not a convict.

517
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,344
You don't think I'm a convict?

518
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,980
Of course l don't.
l've seen Valjean with my own eyes.

519
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:22,389
l must've been out of my mind to think a
great man like you could be a criminaI.

520
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:27,226
- This man-- He admits to being Valjean?
- Of course not.

521
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,357
He pretends to be a half-wit
who can't understand the charges.

522
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,631
Valjean has broken parole.

523
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,638
That calls for life imprisonment.

524
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,241
- When is the trial?
- Tomorrow.

525
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,572
- How long will it take?
- No more than an afternoon.

526
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,242
- Tomorrow.
- The evidence is overwheIming.

527
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:51,481
l returned so you could dismiss me
and press charges for slander.

528
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,558
l must consider.

529
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,319
l was just on my way home.
Walk with me.

530
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,889
You are a stern man.

531
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:06,936
But you're honorabIe.
I want you to remain prefect.

532
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:10,531
- Monsieur le Maire, that's impossible.
- You've exaggerated your offense.

533
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,768
l've not exaggerated, monsieur.

534
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:16,609
l resented you.
l chafed at your authority.

535
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,478
And out of revenge l slandered you.

536
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,850
lf a subordinate of mine had done that
l would have broken him.

537
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:28,221
You must punish me, monsieur,
or my life will have been meaningless.

538
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,123
Blame me.

539
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:35,228
- You, Monsieur le Maire?
- l order you to forgive yourself.

540
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,324
Blame me for that mercy.

541
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,336
You will remain prefect.
Those are my orders.

542
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,130
Will you go get her today?

543
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,429
Yes. Tonight.

544
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,397
ls something wrong?

545
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,145
l'm going to do my best.

546
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,619
l'm going to get better for my girl.

547
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:37,058
But if He chooses to take me, will you
look after Cosette? l have no right--

548
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:42,155
You and Cosette
will aIways be safe with me.

549
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,234
l swear it.

550
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,476
- ls this the courthouse?
- Yes, sir.

551
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:28,977
Thank you.

552
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,912
- May l go in?
- l can't let you in. lt's full.

553
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,578
lt's full? There are no seats?

554
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,211
Jammed.

555
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:42,384
- We got two great cases.
- So l can't get in?

556
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,290
Not a chance.

557
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,329
Unless-- UnIess monsieur
is a public official.

558
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,769
There's a seat reserved for them
right beside the judge.

559
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,775
Best seats in the house.

560
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,672
l'm the mayor of Vigau.

561
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,684
Gentlemen, will you be so kind
as to remain seated...

562
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:12,188
while m'lords, the judges,
reexamine the prisoner's records.

563
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,858
Prisoner to remain standing at the bar.

564
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,129
- Monsieur le President.
- lt is an honor.

565
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,865
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

566
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,266
Continue the examination.

567
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,277
You pretend to be simple.

568
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:38,542
So l give you a simple question
to answer.

569
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:41,709
Are you or are you not
the convict Jean Valjean?

570
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,820
ln the first place--

571
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,120
- What was the first place?
- Answer the question.

572
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,719
You're wicked!
That's what l was going to say.

573
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,730
Only l forgot your name.

574
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,829
l'm a man who--

575
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,032
Oh, what's the word for it?

576
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,304
l'm one of those
who doesn't eat every day.

577
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,141
l'm-- l'm hungry.

578
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,511
That's the word.

579
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:16,313
You've already been found guiIty
of poaching.

580
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,354
Answer the prosecutor's question.

581
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,584
Did he ask a question?

582
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:25,651
Are you or are you not Jean Valjean?

583
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,789
You say l was born in Faverolles.

584
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:32,357
That's very clever,
telIing me where l come from.

585
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,997
That's more than l know.
My-- My parents were tramps.

586
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,001
ln view of
the shrewdly contrived denials...

587
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:45,447
of the accused, who is trying
to pass himself off as an idiot...

588
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,847
l call the witness Brevet
to the stand.

589
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,647
So ordered.

590
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,218
Brevet, l remind you...

591
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,526
that what you say
may destroy a man's life.

592
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,465
You must be absolutely certain
of your testimony.

593
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:08,834
My memory is good.
The best thing l have.

594
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,066
The accused will rise.

595
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,837
- Do you recognize this man?
- Yeah.

596
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,936
l was the first to recognize him,
so l ought to get credit.

597
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,744
Never mind who was first. Who is he?

598
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:24,515
That's Jean VaIjean. We served
19 years together in prison.

599
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:30,086
He looks older, of course.
Looks stupider too.

600
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,321
That's probably age.

601
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:36,696
- l call the convict Lombard to stand.
- You may step down.

602
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,497
The accused should remain standing.

603
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:47,873
l repeat my warning. A man's life
can be destroyed by your answer.

604
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,310
Do you recognize the accused?

605
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,315
l can't help but recognize him.

606
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,944
We did five years on one chain.

607
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,956
What's the matter with you, eh?
No ''Hello''?

608
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,925
Eh? Did you miss me, eh?

609
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,588
Hello.

610
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,830
l call Bertin to the stand.

611
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:18,338
l warn you as well.
Your answer can ruin a man.

612
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,968
Do you recognize the accused?

613
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,473
Yeah. He's Jean Valjean.

614
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,509
May l address the court?

615
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:59,345
Yes, sir. Yes, certainly,
Monsieur le Maire.

616
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:07,320
Look at me. Do you recognize me?

617
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:13,158
l recognize you. You were an informer in
Toulon, and l see you're still a snitch.

618
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:18,564
Hello, Brevet. And you, Lombard.

619
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:23,629
Don't look at my f ancy clothes,
at my scraped chin. Look at my eyes.

620
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:27,199
You called yourseIf ''Godless'', right?

621
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,211
You've got a scar on your left shoulder.

622
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,180
l gave it to you the night you tried
to kill me, remember?

623
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,717
- When l pinned you over the stove.
- It is you.

624
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,718
Show the court your scar.

625
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:48,757
Bertin, in the hollow of your left arm,
there's a date tattooed, 1789.

626
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,800
The year of the Revolution.
Show them.

627
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:05,741
l know these men, Monsieur le President,
and they know me.

628
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:08,943
l am the man you want.

629
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,681
l am Jean Valjean.

630
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,121
- It's him!
- Oh, my God!

631
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:23,496
Monsieur le Maire, l know you to be
a kind man, but this--

632
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,091
A kind man?

633
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:29,264
When l was in prison, l was as ignorant,
mean and devious as these men. Not kind.

634
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:34,743
And l wish l couId keep my mouth shut
and let this poor wretch suffer for me.

635
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:39,680
But-- Continue with
the investigation, monsieur.

636
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:43,116
You will find further proof
that l am Valjean.

637
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,190
l need you in the office right away.

638
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,991
- You're back.
- l don't have the child yet.

639
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:33,433
-l'll be leaving in an hour. How is she?
-Cough's much worse.

640
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,165
There's more blood now. She's--

641
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,174
l think she's just holding on
to see her daughter.

642
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:56,091
- Wait.
- l've an urgent message for Javert.

643
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,457
- l'll take it up.
- To be delivered by hand.

644
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,930
This is a special warrant from Arras.

645
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,600
l knew it.

646
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:20,875
Monsieur, you're back.

647
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,317
lf something were--

648
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:26,218
l was just dreaming...

649
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:28,983
about you.

650
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,027
- Don't excite yourself.
- And me.

651
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,959
And Cosette.

652
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:36,897
We were at her confirmation...

653
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,993
and she looked so beautiful.

654
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,238
- Fantine, if something were--
- But then she didn't know me.

655
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,502
And l was crying.

656
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,342
I have to tell you something.

657
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,247
- l know...
- l won't be able--

658
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,377
l'm not going to live long.

659
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,621
Would you give this to her?

660
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:08,492
- l saved it for her.
- Yes.

661
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:13,067
- Could you give it to her, please?
- I'Il give it to her.

662
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:25,073
She can come stay with you, can't she?

663
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:28,345
You wilI raise her, won't you?

664
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,885
Yes.

665
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,581
- l'Il raise her.
- Promise me, monsieur.

666
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:35,419
l promise.

667
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:39,724
He lies so well, doesn't he?
He's had a lot of practice.

668
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,264
A lifetime of lies.

669
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,527
- Save me!
- lt's all right.

670
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,535
He's not here for you.

671
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,462
Monsieur le Maire--

672
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,473
He isn't mayor anymore.

673
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,271
- Let me talk to you in private.
- Speak up. Don't mumble!

674
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,141
- l need a f avor.
- Come on! Speak up!

675
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,375
- Give me two days to fetch her child.
- Are you joking?

676
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,940
- l'll pay anything you want.
- Do you think l'm that stupid?

677
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,576
l think you do.

678
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,986
You must have laughed when
you forgave me, generous and kind Mayor.

679
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,718
-l beg you--
-You'll not fetch things for your whore!

680
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,956
You're going back where you belong,
and this bitch is going to jail.

681
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:16,294
Listen to me! You'll never see your
daughter again! You're going to prison!

682
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,061
He can't save you.
He's a criminal.

683
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:20,261
Scum of the earth!

684
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,271
Get up!

685
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,340
lt's a pleasure to see you again,
Valjean.

686
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,971
You killed her.

687
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:02,440
Where wilI you go, Valjean?
You don't have papers.

688
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,440
l'lI find you.

689
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,985
She repented, didn't she?

690
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,622
- She made her peace with God.
- Yes, monsieur.

691
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,678
Are you a convict?
ls that true?

692
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,415
Yes.

693
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:50,522
- Where's the inspector?
- lnside.

694
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:51,855
Did you kill him?

695
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,030
That's a pity.

696
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:03,438
You'd better hit me hard enough
to make a lump.

697
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,357
- Where is he?
- He left half an hour ago.

698
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,017
- On foot?
- On the wagon.

699
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,186
- Which way?
- The southern route.

700
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:27,820
- Commandeer the mail coach.
- Yes, sir.

701
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,092
Not you, Beauvais.
You two, go!

702
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:33,363
- Ask anybody. Everybody saw him leave.
- How much money did he take?

703
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,597
- He didn't take any.
- Show me the book.

704
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:48,208
l don't understand.
He transferred ownership.

705
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:49,717
To all the employees.

706
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,583
Shares have been apportioned
by seniority.

707
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,884
He withdrew nothing for himself.

708
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,807
Quickly!

709
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:39,359
Faster! Come on!
Drive them there!

710
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:48,666
Whoa.

711
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,771
- Morning, Monsieur le Maire.
- Good morning.

712
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,943
- Whoa!
- Don't slow down. Give me the reins.

713
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,981
Come on!

714
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:05,861
We're going too fast, sir!

715
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:09,856
Hold on!

716
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,414
You're--

717
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,852
You're under arrest--

718
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,863
The whore-- who did she write to?
The address-- give it to me!

719
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:03,252
There you are, you little sIut.
What took you so long?

720
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,619
- It's heavy.
- Don't let me hear you complaining.

721
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,887
You don't bring a sou.
The least you can do is clean the rooms!

722
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,723
l feed your greedy little mouth.

723
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,161
Do l get thanks?
No, I get smart answers.

724
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,064
Now get to work!

725
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:20,932
Finish those stockings or you'Il get
no supper. You have to earn your keep!

726
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,970
What do you want?

727
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:29,409
- A room, please.
- A room costs 20 sou.

728
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,037
l'll pay in advance.

729
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,575
Oh. Very well, monsieur.

730
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,515
My dear, my sweet, my precious--

731
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,249
- You've forgotten, haven't you?
- l've forgotten.

732
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:43,053
l do that, don't l?
l forget things.

733
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,959
- What have l forgotten?
- We've rented the regular room.

734
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,553
We've only got the wedding chamber left.

735
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,758
l'm sorry, monsieur,
but that costs 40 sou.

736
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:56,263
- You want a meal?
- Bread and cheese.

737
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,739
Is that all?
There's rabbit stew.

738
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,835
- What's she knitting?
- Who?

739
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:06,313
Oh. She's making stockings
for my daughters.

740
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,646
- She's not your daughter?
- Not that creature. No.

741
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:13,286
Why? Does she interest you?

742
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,517
Perhaps.

743
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,424
- What's her name?
- Cosette.

744
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:22,328
- What are they worth?
- The girl?

745
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:26,300
- The stockings.
- The stockings-- l don't know.

746
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,929
- You can buy the stockings.
- Probably 30 sou.

747
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,101
l'll buy them.
l'm paying for her time.

748
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,837
I want her to play.

749
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,971
Of course, you understand,
l meant 30 sou for each stocking.

750
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:41,380
Cosette, get up. Come on.
Get out of there.

751
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:45,110
Get out of there!

752
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,122
Get out!

753
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:54,122
You're working for me now.
You can rest or you can play.

754
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:56,358
What would you like?

755
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,469
Madame, is it true?
Am l allowed to play?

756
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,596
You heard, didn't you?
You must play!

757
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,800
Hurry up! Start playing.

758
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:18,351
Perhaps monsieur would like
Cosette to play on his lap?

759
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,088
l'm heading to Paris.

760
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,424
- Is there a mail carriage l can take?
- It's gone already.

761
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,554
Next coach to Paris arrives at dawn.

762
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,445
- You Iike our Cosette?
- l want to take her with me.

763
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:51,213
Monsieur, l have to telI you the truth.
l adore that child.

764
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:53,380
- You adore her.
- Yes, it's true.

765
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:58,416
l'm not rich. l've had to pay
over 400 francs for her medicine.

766
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:01,952
But I'm a stupid man.
l have no sense, just a heart.

767
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,130
- A big heart.
- You paid over 400 francs.

768
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,636
Five hundred.

769
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:16,271
All right.
I want to leave right away.

770
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:20,543
l'm sorry, monsieur. But her mother
gave her to us to protect.

771
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,380
- l can't let a stranger take her--
- How much?

772
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,943
This isn't a question of money.

773
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,115
- What right do you have to the girl?
- You don't want money?

774
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,283
Of course not.
I mean--

775
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:34,159
Even if you offered 1000 or 1200 francs.
l couldn't give her to you.

776
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,598
True, l owe 1500 francs.

777
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,999
My whole life would be solved
if only l had 1500 francs, but--

778
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,431
l can't think about money.

779
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,567
It's a question of law.
All that matters is:

780
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,510
- Who has a right to the child.
- That's a relief.

781
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,773
Here's a letter from Cosette's mother
authorizing me to take her.

782
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,466
Cosette, quick!

783
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:35,790
Do we have to walk all the way to Paris?

784
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:38,827
- Yes. Are you tired?
- No, monsieur. l'm all right.

785
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:41,692
Cosette, best not to call me ''monsieur.''

786
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,698
People will think we're strangers.

787
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,200
Then what shall l caIl you, monsieur?

788
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:49,362
Well, what about ''papa''?

789
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:52,532
But you're not my father, monsieur.
Are you?

790
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,536
Want me to carry you?

791
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:03,044
l can reach the branches!

792
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,783
You're the tallest lady in France.

793
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,790
- l'm the queen of France.
- That's right.

794
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,122
You're the queen of France.

795
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,491
You're the queen, Cosette.

796
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,994
Have your papers out
and ready to be inspected.

797
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:24,937
Wake up. This is Paris.

798
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,602
Form an orderly queue
and have your papers ready!

799
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,119
You! Keep in line back there!

800
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,518
Have your papers out
and ready for inspection!

801
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,693
Let these carriages through.

802
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,787
We must get here.

803
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,369
Have your papers out
and ready for inspection.

804
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,074
Listen. Wait here.

805
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,201
l won't be long. All right?

806
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,769
Have your papers out
and ready for inspection.

807
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,246
Don't leave me!

808
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:14,816
You have to be quiet.
l'm just having a look at the waIl.

809
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,882
- l'm not leaving you.
- Are we gonna climb that wall?

810
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,894
Yes.

811
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,554
All right?

812
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:29,899
Papa! But you told me to call you papa.

813
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:32,338
You! Where are your documents?

814
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,673
- No luck yet.
- He's on foot.

815
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,678
The little girl would slow him down.

816
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,776
WelI, Javert...

817
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,943
you said he was Valjean,
and we ignored you.

818
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,488
Rather than apologize...

819
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:51,959
l want you to know that l've asked
the prefect to transfer you to Paris...

820
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,961
to work as my deputy.

821
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,893
Monsieur, l'm honored.

822
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,766
Thank you.

823
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:05,500
Meanwhile, these men are
at your disposal to find Valjean.

824
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,747
All right, Cosette.
Give me your doll.

825
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,151
Now, climb on my back.

826
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:22,088
Come on. Here.

827
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,648
Put your foot here.

828
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:26,718
That's it. Big jump.
That's a girl. All right.

829
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,838
- Papa, I'm frightened.
- Don't look down.

830
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,882
- Of course he won't.
- Pardon me?

831
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,323
- He won't what?
- Have your papers ready.

832
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,295
l want three of you in each direction
to walk around the waIl.

833
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,627
Look for a narrow gap
where someone could jump onto a roof.

834
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,224
- Go!
- l don't understand.

835
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,169
He has no proper papers, sir.
He won't come through here.

836
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,879
- Watch here.
- Yes, sir.

837
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,055
Stay down!

838
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,704
We'Il have to cross here.

839
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:59,246
Shut up! Do you want to get us killed?

840
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,881
l'm sorry. It's all right.

841
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:04,551
l'm sorry.
But we have to be quiet.

842
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:07,152
This is the only place we can get over.

843
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:12,461
Listen to me. We have to jump.

844
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:34,586
Come on. Take my hand.

845
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,169
- What's on the other side of this wall?
- lt's a convent.

846
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:04,785
l'm not going to wake up
a building full of nuns...

847
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:07,447
who are terrified of men
and search their beds!

848
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:10,583
- lt's for their protection.
- This is a strict order.

849
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,957
They're not permitted to look at a man
much less speak to him!

850
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,223
lt's a boarding school for girls.
They must be protected.

851
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:17,322
The girls are daughters
of the aristocracy...

852
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:19,333
whose parents will kiss your feet
if you are right...

853
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,335
and have you guillotined
if you are wrong!

854
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,462
l know he's in there.

855
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,975
What? Who are you?

856
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,143
Now l'm trapped under the cart,
Lafitte.

857
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:41,814
lf you would collect all the nuns and
schoolgirls and take them to the chapel.

858
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,017
Then my men could search everywhere
and you wouldn't be in danger.

859
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:47,290
We're not afraid of men.
We're here to adore Christ.

860
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,729
- l can't protect you out here.
- A search of our grounds...

861
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:52,426
our school or our convent
is impossible.

862
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,435
l'm sorry, lnspector.

863
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:11,553
I've told the Mother Superior
you're my brother.

864
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,554
- You'll be the new gardener.
- Good.

865
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,180
Thank you.

866
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:18,420
Tomorrow can you arrange
for her to go to school here?

867
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:20,553
- l can pay.
- Who is she?

868
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,396
She's an orphan.

869
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,060
She'll be with me now.

870
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:34,927
- Pity.
- What?

871
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:39,733
l was thinking of next year,
when it will be Cosette's turn.

872
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,776
ls it a pity
to be devoted to Christ?

873
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,276
A beautiful nun is a tragic waste.

874
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,777
Well, even though Cosette
will be stuck here...

875
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,979
at least you can see the world.

876
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,921
Or Paris anyway.

877
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,220
Aren't you curious?

878
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:00,261
You haven't been outside now
in how many years?

879
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,160
The world never changes.

880
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:04,222
lt is changing.

881
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:07,166
You shouId have a look for yourseIf.

882
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,170
You'll be surprised.

883
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:29,555
- What are you looking at?
- l'm just watching the people go by.

884
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:37,730
- l don't want to take my vows.
- Your promised the Mother Superior.

885
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:40,290
- l want to leave. PIease.
- But we're safe here.

886
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,167
- Safe from what?
- We have everything we need.

887
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,001
l can work here.
I can be near you.

888
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,906
- We have a good life here.
- Please, Papa.

889
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:52,039
l'll think about it.

890
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:57,449
l'm very grateful for everything
you've done for us, Reverend Mother.

891
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,545
But my daughter's happiness
is what's most important to me.

892
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:04,285
Naturally, I'm disappointed
Cosette has changed her mind.

893
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:07,021
But l, too, want to see her happy.

894
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,562
Thank you.

895
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,690
We shall leave
as soon as I can find a suitable home.

896
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,530
l was wondering--

897
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:16,867
l don't know anyone in Paris.

898
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:20,204
lf you could help me find a house
in a decent area--

899
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,300
Lafitte, how could you afford
such a house?

900
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,574
Before we came here, l had money--

901
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:29,139
family money-- that l saved...

902
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,447
to help provide for us.

903
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,421
Well, l hope you're certain
that you've made the right decision.

904
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,249
l am.

905
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:47,667
Look, Papa.

906
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:08,379
- l shan't be long.
- l'll wait here.

907
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,688
- All right. But don't leave the cab.
- l'll stay put.

908
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,374
l'll be back soon.

909
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,550
Ma'am, have you got any money?

910
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:51,399
Why not?
Because it's against the law to strike.

911
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:54,162
The king has declared
that everything is a crime.

912
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,670
Writing is a crime.

913
01:17:56,738 --> 01:18:00,037
Two weeks ago police destroyed
the Égalité-- the workers' newspaper.

914
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,406
They smashed the press.

915
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:04,138
That man making the speech--

916
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:07,181
He's the leader of the A.B.C. Society--

917
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:11,345
the largest and most dangerous
of the student groups.

918
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:15,879
They want the king out.
They want suffrage without limitation.

919
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:19,484
l don't care what they want.
I want to know who they are.

920
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,553
- Speaking out is a crime.
- Marius Pontmercy.

921
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:27,193
- Rents a room above the Cafe Musain.
- Being poor is the worst crime of all.

922
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,761
lf you commit these crimes,
you are condemned for life.

923
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,704
Concentrate on him.

924
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,265
Our government has no mercy,
no pity, no forgiveness.

925
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:38,210
- And it has no work for us!
- And there's no work.

926
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,772
And because there is no work
our children are starving.

927
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,843
Tell me, why are we powerless
to save the people we love?

928
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,252
TeIl me why!

929
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,654
- The king lied!
- The king betrayed us.

930
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,592
We were promised the vote.
Do we have the vote?

931
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,392
Where is the repubIic
our f athers died for?

932
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,456
- Where?
- Here!

933
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:04,566
lt's here, my brothers.

934
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:06,163
lt lives here in our heads.

935
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,106
But most of alI...

936
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,644
best of all...

937
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:13,408
it lives in our hearts.

938
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,145
We are the republic!

939
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,799
Where have you been?
l told you not to leave the cab.

940
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:09,132
l was just going out for some air.

941
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,367
- Who's that?
- l don't know.

942
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:15,272
- He was making a speech in the street.
- Come.

943
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:17,208
We're going home.

944
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:09,896
Thank you.

945
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,933
Thank you.

946
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,809
You again. l looked this time.
l'm sure you weren't at mass.

947
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,611
l was, Father!

948
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:31,675
- Get out of the line!
- MademoiseIle, they won't let us in.

949
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:33,345
lt's all right, Father.
Let them through.

950
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,753
- We made extra today.
- How are you, Gavroche?

951
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:39,157
Thank you. No one is as kind
and beautiful as you--

952
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:42,424
Gavroche, you're such a convincing liar.
l fear for your mortal soul.

953
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:46,433
- Who are your little friends?
- Not friends. Theses are my babies.

954
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:49,937
l found them wandering the street.
Don't l make a good f ather?

955
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:52,701
You'd make a better f ather, Gavroche,
with a real coat.

956
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,140
Wait a moment.

957
01:21:56,511 --> 01:22:00,072
My friend wants to know if you'll take
a walk in the park with him.

958
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:18,057
Here you are. Bring your babies back
tomorrow and I'll give them jackets.

959
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,067
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

960
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,073
He never leaves her alone.

961
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:27,836
He's not a f ather. He's a jailer.

962
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,069
Go on. Here they come.

963
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,842
- Go.
- Come on, boys. Hurry up.

964
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:54,768
Let's go home.

965
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:58,272
May we go for a walk?
lt's so sunny and mild.

966
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:01,366
l'm tired.
Would you read to me in the garden?

967
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,673
Why don't you go lie down?
l'll go for a walk.

968
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:06,737
- Alone?
- l'm going have to waIk alone someday.

969
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,248
Someday, not today.

970
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:11,342
- Why don't you sit in the fiacre--
- Stop playing games!

971
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:13,819
- l'm not playing games.
- Are you disobeying me?

972
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,482
l'm your father! Get in.

973
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,375
lt's Thursday.

974
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:42,814
Madame Toussaint made
your f avorite dessert.

975
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,944
What do you say, Cosette?

976
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:56,163
Strangers can be dangerous.

977
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:05,807
WiIl that be all?

978
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:08,139
WiIl that be all?

979
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,143
Yes, thank you, Toussaint.

980
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:24,347
- You're not, you know.
- Pardon?

981
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:26,189
You're not my father.

982
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:30,527
That is, you never said you were
until you became so angry today.

983
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:34,191
That was the very first time
you said it.

984
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:37,397
- Yes. You're right.
- Well?

985
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:40,473
Are you my f ather?

986
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:45,979
l promised your mother
l'd take care of you.

987
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:48,242
l know you think l worry too much.

988
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,943
- But strangers can be--
- All right!

989
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:53,510
-What's the matter?
-l don't want to hear that speech again!

990
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,818
l know there's something shameful.
lt must be me.

991
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,120
- My child, no!
- Or you!

992
01:24:58,193 --> 01:24:59,990
You're the shameful secret.

993
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:03,895
Maybe both of us. It doesn't matter.
l can't go out or talk to people--

994
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:06,297
- Stop this, Cosette.
- l think you're lying.

995
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:07,857
l know the secret.

996
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,564
You want me here with you all the time--
night and day...

997
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,902
because you're lonely,
and you want me to be alone forever!

998
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:34,487
You're right. l'm not a f ather.
l don't--

999
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:37,958
l just want to protect you,
that's all.

1000
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:41,559
The world isn't a safe place,
believe me.

1001
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,298
You're the only person l have.

1002
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,137
This is the only way
l know how to do it. l'm sorry.

1003
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:55,981
- It's all right.
- Come. Have your meal.

1004
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:58,450
- l won't be long.
- Fine.

1005
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,681
Toussaint will save it.

1006
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,547
- HelIo.
- Hello.

1007
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:34,955
- What's your name?
- Marius.

1008
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:39,388
- And yours?
- l'm Cosette.

1009
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,226
l have something for you.

1010
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,100
Thank you.

1011
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,849
l can warm up your soup.

1012
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:06,511
l'm coming.

1013
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,624
l'll be here...

1014
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:15,857
tomorrow night, outside.

1015
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:19,199
See you tomorrow.

1016
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:46,221
Any guns?

1017
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:57,270
- Maybe this is moving too f ast.
- Revolutions should always be rushed.

1018
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:59,067
Progress doesn't have time to waste.

1019
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,166
But this is pathetic.
Two weeks, what have we got?

1020
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:04,074
Barely enough guns for ourseIves.

1021
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:06,079
Then we'lI do what revolutionaries
have always done:

1022
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:09,810
- Tear up the streets and throw stones.
- Come on, Marius! Throw stones?

1023
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:11,408
They won't attack with sticks!

1024
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:13,584
Well?

1025
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:17,989
We have two kegs of gunpowder stored in
the back room. Guns are another story.

1026
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:22,086
- ls there a plan?
- No one can agree when to make a move.

1027
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,188
They argue about
whether the peopIe are ready.

1028
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:27,462
- But the truth is, they're scared.
- These puppies seem harmless.

1029
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:29,765
We should move you to another group.

1030
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:30,769
Thank you.

1031
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:33,033
What about this Marius?
Anything on him?

1032
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:35,234
He's in love. But he has to go
to the square...

1033
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,278
to the food tent,
to get a glimpse of his beloved.

1034
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:40,405
- Who is the father?
- l know you like me to be thorough.

1035
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:43,314
So l checked.
He's behind the charity.

1036
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:45,944
l didn't find out much,
only his name:

1037
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,954
Lafitte.

1038
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,320
You know him?

1039
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,325
l don't think so.

1040
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,485
Aren't we going for our walk?

1041
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,825
Not tonight, Papa.
l want to finish my book.

1042
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:02,131
But we missed it last night,
and you've been in all day.

1043
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:04,433
- You need your exercise, my dear.
- l'm too tired.

1044
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:08,498
- Are you all right?
- Yes, of course.

1045
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:11,067
l have my book, and Toussaint is here.

1046
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,979
Good night, my dear.

1047
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,053
Your letter was beautiful.

1048
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,853
lt was really beautiful.

1049
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:09,694
- Tell my everything.
- Everything? About what?

1050
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:11,204
About you.

1051
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:15,436
There's nothing to tell.

1052
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:19,211
I'm a very simple girl.

1053
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,214
l live a very simple life.

1054
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:26,817
l grew up in a convent
with other girls, of course.

1055
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:31,489
My father lived there too.

1056
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:33,789
My f ather's a very good man.

1057
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:35,920
l grew up in his love.

1058
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:38,898
His love was my home,
if you know what l mean.

1059
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:40,866
And then l met you.

1060
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:43,732
And what about you?

1061
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,469
- You're a genius, aren't you?
- Genius.

1062
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:50,340
l'm a poor student...

1063
01:30:50,411 --> 01:30:52,470
no brighter or smarter
than anyone else.

1064
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,640
Your speech was wonderful.

1065
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:56,979
l didn't breathe while you talked.

1066
01:30:57,051 --> 01:31:00,043
l was afraid l'd miss a word.

1067
01:32:27,742 --> 01:32:29,767
This week was the same as last--
every night?

1068
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:32,677
lnspector, they're in love.

1069
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:34,908
lt's perfectly nauseating.

1070
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:38,247
She sneaks out the door,
and they're together tilI dawn.

1071
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:41,755
They even stay out there
when it rains.

1072
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:47,285
l haven't caught the gun supplier.
l've caught pneumonia.

1073
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:51,297
- And the father knows nothing?
- This, too, isn't a surprise.

1074
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:54,528
I admit the whole experience
has disillusioned me.

1075
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:57,002
l certainly don't plan
on having any children.

1076
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,301
EspeciaIly not a daughter.

1077
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:04,104
Can l be reassigned?

1078
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:08,911
Perhaps l could infiltrate
some nice anarchists.

1079
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:11,781
- With a roof over their heads.
- Yes, I'Il handle this.

1080
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:14,616
You're relieved.
Take two days off and report to me.

1081
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,214
- You'll be reassigned.
- Thank you.

1082
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:20,658
Just out of curiosity, sir,
what are you going to do?

1083
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:23,959
From what you've said, M. Lafitte
is respectable and well-off.

1084
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:26,022
- Yes.
- A little softhearted perhaps.

1085
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,660
But a churchgoer--
Ioving f ather and so on.

1086
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:30,727
Absolutely. The whole neighborhood
speaks well of him.

1087
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:34,798
He deserves to know his daughter's been
seduced by a dangerous radical.

1088
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:49,388
Toussaint, leave your cooking,
and come sit in the garden.

1089
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,015
lt's a glorious day.

1090
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:53,959
- There's someone here to see you.
- Who is it?

1091
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:55,757
- lnsp--
- lt doesn't matter.

1092
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:58,663
lnspector Javert, from the police.

1093
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:22,280
- Could you w--
- l'lI wait.

1094
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:29,562
- Who was that?
- That wa--

1095
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:33,327
- Yes?
- Was a gardener.

1096
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:37,527
- But why say you're away?
- There's no time to explain.

1097
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:40,165
Tell him l've gone away for a week.

1098
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:42,368
lf he asks questions about your past...

1099
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:45,003
say you have a headache
and excuse yourself.

1100
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:47,309
- All right? No details.
- You're frightened.

1101
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:49,508
No. Please, just go.

1102
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:53,044
Try not to be nervous.
He'll sense it.

1103
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,088
Stay caIm and composed.

1104
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:05,499
My father instructed Madame Toussaint
to say he's out when he's on a trip...

1105
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:09,525
so no one will know when there's
two helpless women here by ourselves.

1106
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:14,540
Isn't it ridiculous that he worried
about it with you-- a police inspector?

1107
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:18,544
- When will he return?
- Oh, a week.

1108
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:20,546
Hard to say.

1109
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:22,946
l'm going to leave him this note.
Do you have an envelope?

1110
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:24,507
Right here.

1111
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:43,435
l knew a Lafitte.
Where did your people come from?

1112
01:35:44,772 --> 01:35:46,205
Here. Paris.

1113
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:51,135
Probably no relation.

1114
01:35:54,215 --> 01:35:56,046
This is for your f ather's eyes alone.

1115
01:35:56,117 --> 01:35:58,551
And l'd appreciate it
if you gave him the letter yourself.

1116
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:17,099
What a horrible man.
How do you know him?

1117
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:20,368
- There's no feeling in his eyes.
- What does this mean?

1118
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,909
''Your daughter has been seduced...

1119
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:26,777
by a dangerous radical
named Marius Pontmercy.

1120
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:29,315
She betrays you every night!''

1121
01:36:29,383 --> 01:36:32,011
- l don't know.
- Don't lie to me!

1122
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:34,987
Have you given yourself
to this person? ls it true?

1123
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:37,683
- Do you see him every night?
- Go ahead! Hit me!

1124
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:39,692
ls that why l should tell you--
because you'll hit me?

1125
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,057
Tell me the truth!

1126
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:43,926
How dare you ask for the truth
when you only tell me lies?

1127
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:48,125
Why does a policeman frighten you
out of your wits?

1128
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:51,103
Who is he? Who are you?

1129
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:54,503
You don't understand.

1130
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:58,711
You've ruined me.
You've ruined us.

1131
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:01,680
You're right. l don't understand.

1132
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:04,582
How can l when you won't
tell me the truth?

1133
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:08,944
What is it?
Who are you?

1134
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:14,660
All right. l'm not going to lie.

1135
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:18,061
lt's true. l love Marius.
l'm not ashamed.

1136
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:22,765
l only have a corner of a bench
to be with him.

1137
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:25,328
But that corner is mine.

1138
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:27,465
lt's my life.

1139
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:29,236
ls that what's going to ruin us?

1140
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:37,242
Please tell me what this
is all about, Papa.

1141
01:37:37,318 --> 01:37:39,479
Please.

1142
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:42,716
Please tell me what is it.

1143
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,223
Please.

1144
01:37:47,795 --> 01:37:49,695
What is it?

1145
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:54,559
l--

1146
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:56,432
l am a convict.

1147
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:06,706
When l was young...

1148
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,714
just your age...

1149
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:13,620
l was very poor.
l was starving.

1150
01:38:13,687 --> 01:38:17,487
One day l stood in front of a window.

1151
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:19,958
A window fulI of bread.

1152
01:38:20,027 --> 01:38:23,019
There was just glass between me...

1153
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:26,099
and not being hungry anymore.

1154
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:30,935
lt was so easy.

1155
01:38:31,005 --> 01:38:33,200
So l broke it...

1156
01:38:33,274 --> 01:38:35,299
and took what l wanted.

1157
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:38,868
Then they caught me...

1158
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:42,609
and put me in chains
for aImost 20 years.

1159
01:38:44,485 --> 01:38:47,648
They did things to me--

1160
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:52,358
l can't tell you about it.

1161
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:57,030
And l did things, there in jail.

1162
01:38:57,097 --> 01:38:59,258
Terrible things.

1163
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:03,062
l became an animal.

1164
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:07,073
They took my dignity.

1165
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:13,873
They took everything from me.

1166
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:23,421
lnspector, where do you
want me tomorrow?

1167
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:25,617
Should l go back to the Cafe Musain?

1168
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:27,627
Not right away.

1169
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:29,526
Mingle with the crowd at the square.

1170
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:31,894
- See where it takes you.
- All right.

1171
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,201
Lafitte-- the softhearted gentleman--
did you find out about his background?

1172
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:40,001
Yes, sir.
He's from Vigau, born and raised.

1173
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:43,703
Lafitte and his daughter Cosette
lived there until ten years ago.

1174
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:48,440
- You didn't say her name was Cosette!
- You didn't ask.

1175
01:39:52,386 --> 01:39:55,617
- No one here, sir.
- The place is empty, sir.

1176
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:59,816
No one and nothing.
Clean as a whistle.

1177
01:40:01,061 --> 01:40:03,689
He moves fast.

1178
01:40:03,764 --> 01:40:06,164
Yes, he does.

1179
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:09,327
But there's a way to find him.

1180
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:13,163
- Marius, have you seen my babies?
- Not now.

1181
01:40:14,241 --> 01:40:16,732
Not tonight. We have to plan
tomorrow's action.

1182
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:19,005
Tomorrow we're not having an action.
We're having a revolution.

1183
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:23,311
We can't tolerate this! We can't aIlow
the king to bury Lamarque as his hero!

1184
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:26,581
- l promise. One hour.
- No!

1185
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:28,587
Marius, this is not a game!

1186
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:30,088
- Tomorrow you have to mean it!
- l mean it.

1187
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:33,183
- Do you?
- Yes. We'll plan tactics when l return.

1188
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:36,229
When these bastards try to bury Lamarque
we'll bury them instead.

1189
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:40,257
You hurry back.

1190
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:42,495
After tomorrow you can make love to her
as a free man.

1191
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:45,367
Maybe.

1192
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:26,611
''Go to 18 Rue De l'Ouest.''

1193
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:50,093
Why?

1194
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:52,570
He has to leave,
and l have to go with him.

1195
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,904
- What's wrong?
- His life is at stake.

1196
01:41:55,976 --> 01:41:59,503
- His life? How?
- lt's a secret.

1197
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:03,277
I can't give it away.
l was an orphan. He saved me.

1198
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:05,147
He gave me everything l have.
l can't leave him right now.

1199
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:07,585
- That means l'll never see you again.
- Listen!

1200
01:42:07,654 --> 01:42:09,849
l know what we can do.
We'lI talk to him.

1201
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:11,982
He'll understand. He'll agree.
You can come with us to England!

1202
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:14,687
England? Cosette, are you crazy?

1203
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:18,230
Tomorrow we're going to fight!

1204
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:20,289
We're going to restore the republic!

1205
01:42:20,367 --> 01:42:22,301
l can't run away now!

1206
01:42:22,369 --> 01:42:25,429
Why do you have to go to EngIand?
Why now?

1207
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:28,100
Why do you have to go now?

1208
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:31,702
He needs me.
He took care of me, and now he needs me.

1209
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:43,251
l understand.

1210
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,894
Marius, please.

1211
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:51,055
Don't be sad.

1212
01:43:01,942 --> 01:43:03,637
When do you Ieave?

1213
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:10,376
Tomorrow. We can leave Paris
because of Lamarque's funeral.

1214
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:13,078
He's not sure. He said
we might leave the next day.

1215
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:18,920
l'll be here tomorrow night.

1216
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:22,787
Promise me you'll meet me here.

1217
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:46,411
Well, it's obvious
we have them outnumbered.

1218
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:48,545
There are 24, 000 troops in the city...

1219
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:51,853
and they can be reinforced
by another 30,000 in two days.

1220
01:43:51,925 --> 01:43:54,587
So the question is where to deploy them.

1221
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:56,788
My informers tell me
the most criticaI moment...

1222
01:43:56,863 --> 01:43:59,388
is when Lamarque's funeraI procession
passes through the square.

1223
01:43:59,466 --> 01:44:01,764
That's where they'll start the fighting.

1224
01:44:01,835 --> 01:44:04,895
WeIl, we won't fight them
for every inch.

1225
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:07,941
We'll surround them.

1226
01:44:11,044 --> 01:44:15,208
lt's frightening, Papa.
Why are they so angry about this?

1227
01:44:15,282 --> 01:44:18,410
Because Lamarque was a hero
who fought for the republic.

1228
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:21,716
Why is the king giving Lamarque
a state funeral?

1229
01:44:21,788 --> 01:44:24,518
He's trying to claim Lamarque
as his own hero.

1230
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:27,287
lt's a lie.
lt's the final insult.

1231
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:29,556
That's why they're angry.

1232
01:45:21,548 --> 01:45:24,483
Long live the repubIic!

1233
01:45:37,597 --> 01:45:40,566
- Lamarque is ours!
- Jump on!

1234
01:45:52,212 --> 01:45:53,975
Lamarque is our hero!

1235
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:56,845
Come on, everybody! Pull!

1236
01:46:04,891 --> 01:46:08,292
Long live the republic!

1237
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:22,371
To the barricades!

1238
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:51,633
Get out!

1239
01:47:03,884 --> 01:47:07,843
Javert, your information
is as good as gold.

1240
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:09,513
But the idiots of the municipaI guard...

1241
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:13,116
ignored your advice
about the arsenal.

1242
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:17,730
Javert, why are you dressed like that?

1243
01:47:17,798 --> 01:47:20,767
Because l'm on the trail
of someone who's very dangerous.

1244
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:22,768
lt will be an important arrest, sir.

1245
01:47:22,836 --> 01:47:25,270
Possibly the most important
of my career.

1246
01:47:25,338 --> 01:47:27,863
lndeed. Who is it?

1247
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:29,772
l'd rather not say
until l've got him.

1248
01:47:29,843 --> 01:47:32,277
Well, at the very least,
show me where you're going.

1249
01:47:32,345 --> 01:47:35,473
Past the perimeter. Here.

1250
01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:38,609
There are dozens of barricades
in this part of the city.

1251
01:47:38,685 --> 01:47:42,815
Anything could happen.
We have no control in this area.

1252
01:47:42,889 --> 01:47:44,823
lt's under control, sir.

1253
01:47:51,498 --> 01:47:55,161
As soon as it's dark we'll go through
the barrier. Hundreds are fleeing.

1254
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:59,001
Police don't care who leaves. They're
more concerned about people coming in.

1255
01:47:59,072 --> 01:48:02,098
So it's a perfect opportunity.
Cosette, please!

1256
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:05,707
How bad is the fighting?

1257
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:08,373
l didn't go anywhere near it.
l went the other way.

1258
01:48:09,883 --> 01:48:13,717
- What are they saying?
- No one really knows what's happening.

1259
01:48:13,787 --> 01:48:17,188
The streets are full of barricades,
and everyone says something different.

1260
01:48:17,257 --> 01:48:20,852
Whatever the truth is,
a lot of people will die tonight.

1261
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:23,555
ls it too dangerous
for us to wait here until the morning?

1262
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:37,309
You saw the barricades.

1263
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:41,272
l promised l'd wait.

1264
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:43,714
Even if he can't come,
l have to wait.

1265
01:48:43,783 --> 01:48:47,344
- lt hurts this much?
- l'm sorry.

1266
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:50,480
l've known him for only a few weeks.
That's what you're thinking.

1267
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:53,185
That l'm only a silly girl, that he's
little more than a stranger.

1268
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:55,194
But that's not how l feel.

1269
01:48:56,263 --> 01:48:57,924
l understand.

1270
01:48:58,999 --> 01:49:00,626
l do.

1271
01:49:09,576 --> 01:49:11,100
Papers.

1272
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:15,541
Right.

1273
01:49:55,455 --> 01:49:57,047
Marius, not tonight.

1274
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:02,118
One hour. l'll be gone one hour.

1275
01:50:07,968 --> 01:50:09,799
- l found my boys!
- WeIl done, Gavroche.

1276
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:40,156
The law is here
to protect you, Cosette...

1277
01:50:40,233 --> 01:50:42,929
from criminals like this scum.

1278
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:49,438
ls VaIjean here? ls he alone?

1279
01:50:49,509 --> 01:50:51,306
l'll never tell you anything.

1280
01:50:51,378 --> 01:50:53,505
Do you know who and what
you're protecting?

1281
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:56,378
Didn't he tell you he's really
just a common thief?

1282
01:50:56,449 --> 01:51:00,249
- l know who he is.
- Oh, yes? Did he tell you who you are?

1283
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,720
Did he teIl you you're a bastard child?

1284
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:05,383
Did he tell you
your mother was a whore?

1285
01:51:12,232 --> 01:51:14,894
Give it to me. You'll be breaking
the law. There'lI be no turning back.

1286
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:21,366
Who are you?

1287
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:27,345
Chief lnspector Javert.

1288
01:51:27,414 --> 01:51:29,848
lf you surrender now,
things will go better for you and her.

1289
01:51:29,916 --> 01:51:33,477
Surrender? l'm taking you
to f ace the people's justice.

1290
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:39,017
At the barricades?

1291
01:51:40,393 --> 01:51:44,090
You fool. Don't you know
your revolution has no chance?

1292
01:51:44,164 --> 01:51:47,600
lf we die, you die with us.

1293
01:51:49,169 --> 01:51:51,000
Good-bye, Marius.

1294
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:55,166
l love you, Cosette.

1295
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:01,206
Go on!

1296
01:52:07,887 --> 01:52:10,048
He came to say good-bye.

1297
01:52:11,124 --> 01:52:13,615
He loves me, Papa.

1298
01:52:30,810 --> 01:52:33,711
Take her to our old house.

1299
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:36,840
lt's going to be alI right.
l promise you.

1300
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:48,143
So here we are.

1301
01:53:48,221 --> 01:53:50,280
l was right.

1302
01:53:51,858 --> 01:53:53,621
You know him?

1303
01:53:53,693 --> 01:53:56,321
When we have a spare bulIet,
we're going to kilI him.

1304
01:54:15,481 --> 01:54:18,541
What are you doing here?
Where's Cosette?

1305
01:54:18,618 --> 01:54:21,678
Waiting for you in the house
where you fell in love.

1306
01:54:22,789 --> 01:54:24,552
- Go to her.
- l can't.

1307
01:54:24,624 --> 01:54:26,489
- Go to her.
- Not now.

1308
01:54:26,559 --> 01:54:28,493
She's your future.

1309
01:54:28,561 --> 01:54:30,859
lf we can't win here,
then none of us have a future.

1310
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:35,594
You have love.
That's the only future God gives us.

1311
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:39,304
Go.

1312
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:43,998
Gavroche! Get back!

1313
01:54:46,212 --> 01:54:49,340
- l need bullets!
- Gavroche! Get back here!

1314
01:54:51,017 --> 01:54:52,678
Come back!

1315
01:54:52,752 --> 01:54:56,210
- Get back here!
- Gavroche! Come back!

1316
01:55:13,273 --> 01:55:14,205
Papa!

1317
01:55:23,316 --> 01:55:26,217
- Let's do it now.
- You proud of your work?

1318
01:55:26,286 --> 01:55:28,117
You're next.

1319
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:34,392
Let me do it.

1320
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:40,161
You kilI him in the aIley.

1321
01:55:40,233 --> 01:55:42,064
We don't want his blood in here
with ours.

1322
01:55:55,248 --> 01:55:58,445
A knife. That's right.

1323
01:55:58,518 --> 01:56:00,349
- lt suits you better.
- Why, Javert?

1324
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:03,480
Why couldn't you leave me alone?
l'm nothing! l'm no one!

1325
01:56:03,556 --> 01:56:06,252
Yes. But you've managed to beat me.

1326
01:56:06,326 --> 01:56:08,021
I'm not trying to beat you!

1327
01:56:08,094 --> 01:56:10,790
- l want to live in peace!
- Then hurry up and do it.

1328
01:56:10,863 --> 01:56:13,525
Your friends need you.

1329
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:32,577
That way, through the gate.

1330
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:34,643
You'll be safe.

1331
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:38,157
- You're going to shoot me in the back.
- l'm letting you go.

1332
01:56:39,225 --> 01:56:42,126
You'd better hurry.
They won't be merciful.

1333
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:46,392
Go on.

1334
01:56:47,467 --> 01:56:49,731
You should kill me.

1335
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:53,434
l won't stop.

1336
01:56:53,506 --> 01:56:55,497
Understand?

1337
01:56:55,575 --> 01:56:57,634
l won't let you go.

1338
01:56:59,212 --> 01:57:01,305
You should end this.

1339
01:57:06,185 --> 01:57:07,777
Kill me.

1340
01:57:17,964 --> 01:57:19,932
You're dead, Javert.

1341
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:34,711
- Everybody, get back!
- Move it on through!

1342
01:57:43,356 --> 01:57:46,291
On the back wall there!

1343
01:58:05,278 --> 01:58:07,041
Surrender, men!

1344
01:58:12,185 --> 01:58:14,881
- Surrender!
- Surrender or be shot!

1345
01:58:20,393 --> 01:58:21,826
Stand.

1346
01:58:26,299 --> 01:58:27,926
Turn and follow me!

1347
01:58:40,646 --> 01:58:43,206
You men in there, take that doorway!

1348
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:50,054
Come on. Do it! Jump!

1349
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:01,396
Let's be quick about it!

1350
01:59:02,602 --> 01:59:04,797
Long live the republic!

1351
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:29,828
- You two, look on the roof.
- Yes, sir.

1352
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:38,231
Get some ladders. Hurry!

1353
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:59,986
- This way.
- He's smarter than that.

1354
02:00:00,059 --> 02:00:01,993
He'lI go downhilI to the river.
Come on.

1355
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:25,275
lt's all right.
lt's all right. Come on.

1356
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:39,063
Come on. Help me.
You must help me.

1357
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:42,192
Push.

1358
02:01:31,484 --> 02:01:33,714
ls he alive?

1359
02:01:54,106 --> 02:01:55,539
Careful.

1360
02:02:03,616 --> 02:02:06,551
-He needs a doctor.
-To make him healthy for a firing squad?

1361
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:08,644
Come on, Javert. You know
there'll be an amnesty in a few days.

1362
02:02:09,855 --> 02:02:11,846
- lt's me you want.
- Yes.

1363
02:02:11,924 --> 02:02:14,051
Arrest me. Let him go.

1364
02:02:18,631 --> 02:02:21,122
- ls that all you care about?
- You've caught me.

1365
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:23,225
That's what you care about.

1366
02:02:30,943 --> 02:02:34,538
Let him take the boy where he wants.
Then bring him back here to me.

1367
02:03:08,714 --> 02:03:10,238
He'll live. Toussaint--

1368
02:03:10,316 --> 02:03:12,546
- Find a doctor.
- Yes, monsieur.

1369
02:03:13,619 --> 02:03:16,144
Take some money.
Promise him any amount he wants.

1370
02:03:16,222 --> 02:03:18,452
- Yes, monsieur.
- Go!

1371
02:03:33,639 --> 02:03:35,573
l promised l would give you this.

1372
02:03:42,214 --> 02:03:43,647
lt was your mother's.

1373
02:03:54,326 --> 02:03:57,989
She was a good woman.
l Ioved her, Cosette.

1374
02:04:05,871 --> 02:04:09,307
l've told you everything.
Take care of him. Live a happy life.

1375
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:12,344
l made an arrangement, my dear.

1376
02:04:12,411 --> 02:04:14,675
l have to go.

1377
02:04:14,747 --> 02:04:18,683
- Promise me you'lI be happy.
- No! Not like this, Papa!

1378
02:04:18,751 --> 02:04:22,585
This is right, my dear.
l stole something. l did.

1379
02:04:22,655 --> 02:04:25,123
l stole happiness with you.

1380
02:04:26,192 --> 02:04:28,490
Go to him.
He's your life now.

1381
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:30,354
Bring him here.

1382
02:05:36,061 --> 02:05:38,962
That is an important memo
for the prefect.

1383
02:05:39,031 --> 02:05:41,226
lt will explain what l've done
with the prisoner.

1384
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:43,165
Make sure he sees it before breakf ast.

1385
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:51,200
l'm gIad l had time to myself.

1386
02:05:52,278 --> 02:05:54,178
l needed to think...

1387
02:05:54,246 --> 02:05:56,180
about what you deserve.

1388
02:05:57,816 --> 02:05:59,579
You're a difficuIt problem.

1389
02:06:02,988 --> 02:06:06,355
- Move to the edge.
- Why aren't you taking me in?

1390
02:06:06,425 --> 02:06:08,620
You're my prisoner.
Do what l tell you!

1391
02:06:08,694 --> 02:06:11,185
You don't understand
the importance of the Iaw.

1392
02:06:12,264 --> 02:06:15,529
l've given you an order.
Obey it.

1393
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:27,270
Why didn't you kiIl me?

1394
02:06:28,447 --> 02:06:31,075
l don't have the right to kill you.

1395
02:06:31,150 --> 02:06:33,812
But you hate me.

1396
02:06:33,886 --> 02:06:35,581
l don't hate you.

1397
02:06:37,489 --> 02:06:40,356
l don't feel anything.

1398
02:06:40,426 --> 02:06:43,293
You don't want to go back
to the quarries, do you?

1399
02:06:54,707 --> 02:06:57,175
Then for once we agree.

1400
02:06:58,077 --> 02:07:01,808
l'm going to spare you
from a life in prison, Jean Valjean.

1401
02:07:03,482 --> 02:07:07,111
lt's a pity the rules
don't allow me to be merciful.

1402
02:07:17,329 --> 02:07:21,663
l've tried to live my life
without breaking a single rule.

1403
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,933
You're free.

1404
02:13:48,053 --> 02:13:52,490
