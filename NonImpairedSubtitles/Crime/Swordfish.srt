1
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:40,213
You know the problem with Hollywood?

2
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,656
They make shit. Unbelievable,
unremarkable shit.

3
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:47,490
I'm not some wannabe filmmaker...

4
00:00:47,697 --> 00:00:51,531
...searching for existentialism through
a haze of bong smoke.

5
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:55,228
No, it's easy to pick apart bad acting,
shortsighted directing...

6
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:59,364
...and a moronic stringing together
of words the studios term as prose.

7
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:03,638
No, I'm talking about
the lack of realism. Realism.

8
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:07,806
Not a pervasive element
in modern American cinematic vision.

9
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:13,815
Take <i>Dog Day Afternoon,</i> for example.
Arguably Pacino's best work.

10
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,684
Short of <i>Scarface</i> and
<i>Godfather Part I,</i> of course.

11
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:22,298
Masterpiece of directing,
easily Lumet's best.

12
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,797
The cinematography, the acting,
the screenplay, all topnotch. But...

13
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,580
...they didn't push the envelope.

14
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,552
What if, in <i>Dog Day</i> Sonny wanted to
get away with it? Really wanted that.

15
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:51,286
Now this is the tricky part. What if
he started killing hostages right away?

16
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:53,326
No mercy, no quarter.

17
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:59,563
"Meet our demands or the pretty blond
gets it in the head." Bam, splat.

18
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:02,465
What, still no bus? Come on.

19
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:06,435
How many innocent victims would it take
for the city...

20
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,043
...to reverse its policy
on hostages?

21
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:14,544
And this is 1976. There's no CNN.
There's no CNBC. There's no Internet.

22
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,512
Fast-forward to today.
Present time, same situation.

23
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,387
How quickly would the media
make a frenzy? In hours.

24
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:28,429
It would be the biggest story from
Boston to Budapest.

25
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,399
Ten hostages die.

26
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,732
Twenty, thirty.

27
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,906
Relentless. Bam, bim.
One after another.

28
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:43,970
All on hi-def, computer-enhanced.
You can almost taste the brain matter.

29
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:47,010
All for what? A bus, a plane?

30
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:50,915
A couple million dollars
that's federally insured?

31
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,692
I don't think so, but...

32
00:02:57,994 --> 00:02:59,859
...just a thought.

33
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:02,528
I mean, it's not...

34
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:06,934
...within the realm of
conventional cinema, but...

35
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,397
...what if?

36
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,610
- There's a problem with that movie.
- Really?

37
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,908
- It wouldn't work.
- How come?

38
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:26,315
- Audiences love happy endings.
- Pacino escapes with the money.

39
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,448
Boyfriend gets a sex change.
Live happily ever after.

40
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,628
- No?
- No.

41
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,655
Homophobia.

42
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,767
Bad guy can't win.
It's a morality tale.

43
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:42,098
One way or the other,
he's gotta go down.

44
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:49,037
Well, life is stranger
than fiction sometimes.

45
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:59,154
You know, guys, I gotta go.

46
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,121
Gotta jet.

47
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:03,820
Thanks for the coffee.

48
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:17,733
Stan. Time to go to work.
You coming?

49
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:24,838
Move. I won't say it again.

50
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,053
<i>I have a clear shot.</i>

51
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,452
<i>Shooters, stand by.</i>

52
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,518
Okay. Now what?

53
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:17,222
Don't worry, folks, it's almost over.
Is she done?

54
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,467
- She's done.
- Move her out.

55
00:05:21,871 --> 00:05:26,706
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
You'll be back before you know it.

56
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,548
Turn the fuck around.

57
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:37,777
Rescue team, let's go.
Who's on the roof?

58
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:41,184
<i>All shooters, you are holding</i>
<i>for command.</i>

59
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:49,127
You're doing good. Behave yourself.
Look over there, and there.

60
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,023
<i>All prepare their shot.</i>

61
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,259
- What are you doing?
- I'm handling this!

62
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:57,731
Don't fuck with this guy!
You'll get these people killed!

63
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:01,570
We got two teams on the roof.
We got a team over there.

64
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:04,645
Double this team up.
That's your best angle.

65
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:06,907
Don't talk. Just listen.

66
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:12,077
Each of the 22 hostages is wrapped
with 20 pounds of C-4 explosives.

67
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:16,657
They're also taped with 15 pounds
of stainless steel ball bearings.

68
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:20,125
Which makes them the world's
largest claymore mines.

69
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,264
They got the green light.

70
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:24,828
I got this guy on the phone!

71
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,731
I'm done playing with this asshole!

72
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:33,131
Around their necks are radio-frequency
electronic dog collars.

73
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:37,741
<i>Dog walks out of the yard, gets the</i>
<i>shit shocked out of him. Same here.</i>

74
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:41,145
This bank is their yard,
so don't fuck with me.

75
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:45,544
Johnson, you and your partner move up
between those vehicles.

76
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:51,090
- Stand down!
- Get back!

77
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,751
- Get back!
- Officer, stand down now!

78
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,998
He's gonna shoot!
He's gonna shoot!

79
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:04,897
Shit.

80
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:08,567
Get her!

81
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:09,802
Go!

82
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,172
No! Release the hostage!

83
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,778
No! Release the hostage!

84
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,349
She's gone. Take cover!

85
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,116
No, no! Let her go!
Let her go!

86
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,625
Release the hostage!

87
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:30,356
Help me!

88
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,898
Let her go. Let her go!

89
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:38,073
- Jesus.
- Shit! You guys, come on!

90
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,969
- How long will you be here?
- One week.

91
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:53,377
- Business or pleasure?
- Hopefully both.

92
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:57,174
- What type of work do you do?
- I'm a consultant.

93
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:02,422
Excuse me.

94
00:09:02,758 --> 00:09:07,320
Could you be careful with that?
That's expensive equipment.

95
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,215
- How long will this take?
- A few minutes.

96
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:32,115
Sit down, relax.
I'll be right back.

97
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,153
A few minutes, huh?

98
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,289
Hey, where's he going?

99
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:14,025
It's going up. Stairs.

100
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:42,219
Sir, could you please...?

101
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,461
Easy, easy.

102
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,894
This better be important.

103
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,899
Wouldn't have asked you
otherwise, senator.

104
00:10:56,505 --> 00:11:01,772
We just received word that Axl Torvalds
was intercepted entering the U.S.

105
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:05,072
- When was this?
- Within the last two hours.

106
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:09,411
According to my FBI source,
he was nabbed in customs at LAX.

107
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,315
- They know he's working for us?
- It's unlikely.

108
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:16,288
It was a routine check.
Torvalds freaked out. They got lucky.

109
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:19,052
This ain't good.
What do the feds know?

110
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,992
Nothing yet.
He's refusing to speak English.

111
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:25,395
The Finnish consulate has contacted
the State Department.

112
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:30,938
- So we haven't been compromised?
- I'm not sure. I'm working on that.

113
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,976
You better get sure because someone's
cock will end up on the block...

114
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:38,136
...and it won't be mine.

115
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:41,574
I understand, senator.

116
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:44,513
There you go.

117
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:26,020
Well, well, well.

118
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,999
Who are you supposed to be?

119
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,997
- I'm Ginger.
- Ginger, huh?

120
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,539
Where's Gilligan?

121
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:50,447
For someone the NSA once listed as the
most dangerous hacker in America...

122
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:53,452
...you sure don't look like much.

123
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:55,283
Surprised?

124
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,050
I know everything about you, Stan.

125
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,625
What are you selling again?

126
00:13:07,303 --> 00:13:09,669
My employer wants to meet you.

127
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:13,673
- Shit.
- You're not too good at golf.

128
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:16,169
You're fucking up my chi.

129
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,578
Let me have that.

130
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:49,508
This is not a nice place
you got here, Stan.

131
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:58,244
Here 5 minutes, and I already
feel sorry for myself.

132
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:03,320
You're wasting your time. I touch
a computer, I go back to Leavenworth.

133
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,325
Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

134
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:15,299
If I knew you were coming,
I might have cleaned up.

135
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:19,074
I'm not here to suck
your dick, Stanley.

136
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:31,618
He'll pay you just to meet you.

137
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:41,995
I gotta go to work.

138
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,625
Right.

139
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,026
Great work greasing pump jacks.

140
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,303
So...

141
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:57,539
...spoke to Holly lately?

142
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:06,586
Shit!

143
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:24,728
Hello?

144
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,401
Melissa. Is Holly home?

145
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:34,206
Why are you calling here?

146
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:40,288
- I just want to talk with Holly.
<i>- It's Saturday. She's at soccer.</i>

147
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:45,254
It's illegal for you to talk to her.

148
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:49,420
Don't do this, Mel.
It's not good for Holly.

149
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:53,134
How would you know
what's good for my daughter?

150
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:56,169
You spent the last two years
in prison.

151
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:59,796
- Mel.
<i>- Stop calling me that, Stanley.</i>

152
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:03,838
Look, I just...
I just want to see my baby.

153
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,239
Well, she doesn't want
to see you, Stanley.

154
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,385
And I swear, if you try
to contact her...

155
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:14,522
...l'll have you thrown
in a hole so dark...

156
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:17,521
...Leavenworth will seem like
two weeks in Vegas...

157
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,228
...during which I will personally...

158
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,332
...pay two skinheads to
make a playground out of your ass.

159
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,593
<i>You can take the girl out of</i>
<i>the trailer park...</i>

160
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:29,260
...but can't take the trailer park
out of the girl.

161
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:33,397
I will not let myself be manipulated
by you, Stanley.

162
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:35,807
Larry's her father now.

163
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:38,803
Larry's the porn king of
Southern Calif...

164
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,810
Larry is a film financier.

165
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:46,747
The films he chooses are for profit
and none of your business.

166
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:51,791
Get help. Get into a program,
get a therapist, get a dog.

167
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:55,187
But whatever you do,
stay away from my child.

168
00:16:55,364 --> 00:17:00,631
- Your child? She's our child.
<i>- She will never be your child.</i>

169
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,703
Forget Holly.

170
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:13,908
What are you still doing here?

171
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:19,279
Look, I'm beginning to
lose my sense of humor.

172
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,286
Then I'll cut to the chase.

173
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,949
If you want your daughter back,
you better listen up.

174
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:29,764
Unless you want to stay here
in this loser existence...

175
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:35,666
...while your daughter grows up to be a
fluffer in her new daddy's videos.

176
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:40,933
Please don't confuse your own childhood
with my daughter's.

177
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,506
And look at your situation, Stanley.

178
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,673
For the past 20 months, you've
been in and out of court 6 times?

179
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:51,648
Each time your case was thrown out.

180
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,416
Situation doesn't
look good, sweetheart.

181
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:03,864
How much money would it cost to hire
the best family lawyer in the country?

182
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,195
A lot. Come here.

183
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:08,493
Come here.

184
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,328
Judas.

185
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,211
That should get you started.

186
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,581
Hundred grand.

187
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:32,655
What do you got to lose?
He just wants to meet you.

188
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,592
One time.
You don't like the situation...

189
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,526
...walk away.

190
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:44,598
- And that's it?
- That's it. And you keep the money.

191
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:54,738
What did he say?

192
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:59,244
All right, look, look.

193
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,287
Your client is wanted on 24 counts of
electronic crimes...

194
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,552
...in 7 different countries.

195
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:08,627
He has a Finnish passport.

196
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:14,292
These allegations are not recognized
as crimes. Your laws don't apply.

197
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,907
Do you see a Finnish flag hanging
on the wall, llKEA boy?

198
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,813
- What did he say?
- He said llKEA is Swedish.

199
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,082
He understands English, huh?

200
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,753
- Let me talk to him.
- He's all yours.

201
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,053
You're fucked up now, Hamlet.

202
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:48,732
The thing is, they have you put
the furniture together yourself.

203
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:53,998
My client has reserved his right
not to answer any questions.

204
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,709
Why would the best hacker
in the world...

205
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:01,077
...risk life imprisonment by coming
into the continental U.S.?

206
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:05,653
Okay, what did he just say?

207
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:08,881
He never misses an episode
of <i>Survivor.</i>

208
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,386
Did he really say that?

209
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:17,595
You're funny.

210
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:23,668
- How much do you weigh?
- How much do I weigh?

211
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,444
We'll call you if we need you.

212
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,643
Eat a dick.

213
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,825
Wipe that smile off your face.

214
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,541
A year ago, I was head of the largest
cyber-criminal task force in the world.

215
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,545
But I burned out.

216
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:12,514
I snapped.

217
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,688
I shot a suspect in the hand.

218
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:23,193
You know how difficult it is to work
a keyboard with one hand?

219
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:29,594
You don't understand. Whatever you
want to do to me, he'll do worse.

220
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,870
I'm already dead.

221
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,702
My only chance is back in Europe.
I have friends there.

222
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,048
Tell me what I want to know.

223
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,981
You'll be on the first thing smoking.
First class.

224
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:46,713
Courtesy of the U.S. Government.

225
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,647
Who is he?

226
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:55,095
- I don't know his name.
- You work for him. You don't know?

227
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:59,059
Tell me something.

228
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,897
I'll tell you what I know.

229
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:17,016
He exists in a world
beyond your world.

230
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:30,590
<i>What we only fantasize, he does.</i>

231
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:34,661
<i>He lives a life</i>
<i>where nothing is beyond him.</i>

232
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:47,110
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>It's all a façade.</i>

233
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:54,153
<i>For all his charm and charisma,</i>
<i>his wealth, his expensive toys...</i>

234
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:59,586
<i>... he is a driven, unflinching,</i>
<i>calculating machine.</i>

235
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:03,926
<i>He takes what he wants,</i>
<i>when he wants...</i>

236
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,296
<i>... and disappears.</i>

237
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:10,204
So how do I find him?

238
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,736
You don't find him. He finds you.

239
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:18,012
<i>Here's how it works.</i>

240
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,947
<i>His people pick me up.</i>
<i>Take me to him.</i>

241
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,845
<i>He tells me what he wants me to do.</i>

242
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:26,846
<i>I do the job right there.</i>

243
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:30,016
<i>I get paid, and I leave.</i>

244
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:39,623
That's a really nice story, but you
haven't told me shit, have you?

245
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:44,800
- Excuse me, sir. You have a call.
- Take a message.

246
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:49,000
It's assistant director Joy.
He said it's important.

247
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:57,784
I can only tell you
what I've done for him.

248
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,615
Well, that's a start.

249
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,987
Thank you. You've just
let my client go free.

250
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:10,689
- You denied his right to counsel...
- Excuse me.

251
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:14,329
Yeah, and you eat the dick!

252
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:36,888
Yes, I got a call from A.D. Joy.
This is Roberts.

253
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,591
Hold for just one moment, sir.

254
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,930
- Joy.
- Yeah, Roberts. You needed me.

255
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,206
You didn't call?

256
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:39,283
No, Roberts. What do you want?

257
00:25:53,668 --> 00:25:56,796
You should've let me
buy you a suit, Stanley.

258
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:59,839
I'm happy with what I'm wearing.

259
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,935
Ignorance is bliss.

260
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:41,512
Miss me?

261
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,313
- Stanley, Gabriel.
- Big Stan.

262
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,421
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.

263
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:51,889
- They say the clothes make the man.
- You buy it?

264
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,260
Hope not. Drink?

265
00:26:56,231 --> 00:27:00,827
I flew 1500 miles for this meeting.
How about we get to the point?

266
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:05,234
No. Actually, you flew 1500 miles
for 100 grand.

267
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:09,741
But that's not the point.
Helga. Meet Stanley.

268
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:14,213
- Hello, Stanley.
- Helga.

269
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:17,952
Look, I don't have
a lot of patience, Gabriel.

270
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,779
Maybe you can help me with something.

271
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,384
Take a look at this.

272
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,228
You know I can't touch that.

273
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,461
Do you like tequila, Stanley?

274
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:51,580
This is bullshit.

275
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:54,979
You want something from me,
and I from you.

276
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:58,956
DOD d-base, 128-bit encryption.
What do you think?

277
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,424
- Impossible?
- Nothing's impossible.

278
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:05,425
Good. Maybe slide in
a Trojan horse hiding a worm?

279
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,967
- Is this an interview?
- Sort of. Marco.

280
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,839
Give him some incentive.

281
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,600
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Relax, Stanley.

282
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:29,383
I have been told that
the best crackers in the world...

283
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:31,923
...can do this in 60 minutes.

284
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:35,594
Unfortunately, I need someone
to do it in 60 seconds.

285
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,056
You're kidding.

286
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:39,428
Afraid not. Go.

287
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,160
Get up, get up!

288
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:46,400
- Fifty-five.
- Get on with it.

289
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:51,273
- What the hell is this?
- Time's a-wasting, big guy.

290
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,943
Oh, Jesus.

291
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:58,915
Forty-five seconds.

292
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,459
Oh, she's good, isn't she?

293
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:17,270
What's going on here?
Jesus Christ.

294
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,077
- More time, more time!
- Come on, Stan!

295
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,481
Twenty. Nineteen.

296
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:37,183
Fifteen.

297
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,291
Come on.

298
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:44,658
Ten. Nine.

299
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:55,700
Three.

300
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,035
Two. One.

301
00:29:59,514 --> 00:30:02,244
- Too bad. You gotta die.
- No, wait!

302
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:11,255
I was just fucking with you, Stan.

303
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:36,079
That's our guy.

304
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:53,364
- Get away from me.
- I really want to help you, Stan.

305
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,971
Like you helped me in there?

306
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,436
- That was a test, Stan.
- A test.

307
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:03,702
And you passed.

308
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:07,105
I don't know why I let you
talk me into this.

309
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,146
You're saving your daughter.

310
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,980
I'd do anything for her, but if
I end up in a box or in jail...

311
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:16,316
...then I really can't help her.

312
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:19,551
I'm taking my money
and going back to court!

313
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:21,786
With your little $100,000?

314
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:25,394
Melissa will throw $500,000
back at you. Think!

315
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,299
I'm thinking that you'll put a gun
to my head just to see if I can...

316
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:37,034
I can't pee in front of an audience.

317
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:54,287
Let me break it down to you, Stanley,
one last time.

318
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,463
You live in a trailer.

319
00:31:56,631 --> 00:32:00,158
You're a felon.
You work a dead-end job.

320
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,498
And you desperately want
your daughter back.

321
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:06,833
Gabriel is your only shot.

322
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,070
Take it.

323
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:15,648
- I'm concerned about our new friend.
- Oh, now, don't be jealous.

324
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:20,118
I don't see him dragging his sorry arse
over the finish line.

325
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:23,519
- Thought we lost you.
- Tell me what the deal is.

326
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:28,094
The deal is that we're having
a little gathering at the house.

327
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:31,197
Come and I'll explain it to you there.

328
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:38,561
Gentlemen, if it's not good news,
don't say it.

329
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:43,403
Actually, we have a ray of hope
in the darkness of your life.

330
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:48,538
When we grabbed Torvalds at the
airport, these two guys were there.

331
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,377
Check this out.

332
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:54,686
Recognize those two same guys,
a few hours later.

333
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:56,619
And then...

334
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,556
...guess who shows up.

335
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:02,195
Stanley Jobson.

336
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:05,855
<i>Wired</i> magazine's 1996
Man of the Year.

337
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:09,395
A burnout now, but the
hacker Zeitgeist then.

338
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,403
Yeah, I know Jobson, I arrested him.

339
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,208
Why are you in L.A., Stan?

340
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:22,241
His ex-wife and daughter
live in Malibu.

341
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,752
The new husband owns Backdoor Films,
a shady porn production house.

342
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,449
The production value's good,
considering that they shoot on video.

343
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:36,427
- His wife is in some of the videos.
- I know. She's like an actress.

344
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,225
That's great. Are you done?

345
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,161
Who's the girl?

346
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,633
Actually, sir, we don't know yet.

347
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:52,438
- She's a serious piece of talent.
- Man, she's way out of his league.

348
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:56,215
Find out who she is.

349
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,286
- Sit on the ex-wife's house.
- You got it.

350
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,723
Stanley, you want to get wet?

351
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,664
- I don't have a suit.
- You don't need one.

352
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:17,862
- Come on, Stan.
- Later.

353
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:23,805
- Some view. Let's get a drink.
<i>- Pool lights on.</i>

354
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,622
- So how did you do it?
- Do what?

355
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,988
Break the code.

356
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,991
I dropped a logic bomb
through the trap door.

357
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,927
No, you didn't.
You didn't have time.

358
00:34:48,703 --> 00:34:50,762
- What'll you have?
- Scotch.

359
00:34:50,972 --> 00:34:54,965
- You can do better than that.
- I used a password sniffer.

360
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,469
How did you do it?

361
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:03,410
I don't know exactly. I see the code
in my head. I can't explain it.

362
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,348
Let me show you something.

363
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,025
Pretty impressive, huh?

364
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,404
So, what we need from you is a worm.
A hydra, actually.

365
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:35,277
A multiheaded worm to sniff out digital
footprints across an encrypted network.

366
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:39,481
- What kind of cipher?
- A Vernam encryption.

367
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,353
The key code is destroyed
upon implementation.

368
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:46,254
And it's a true 128-bit encryption.

369
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:49,726
Well, actually,
we're talking a 512-bit.

370
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:56,268
- That's definitely not possible.
- What if I give you 10 million dollars?

371
00:35:57,672 --> 00:36:00,664
That would cover all your problems.
Yes?

372
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:04,334
Unless, of course, it's not possible.

373
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:07,413
But you think about it.

374
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:19,552
It won't bite you. I promise.

375
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:31,398
This is not just a multi-screen system.
It has a DS-3 connection.

376
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:34,939
We can access 7 different networks
simultaneously.

377
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:43,983
It has a central encryption you
have to crack to utilize the system.

378
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:45,307
Try it.

379
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:48,353
It'll be hard without a gun
to my head.

380
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:50,922
Maybe I should put a gun to your head.

381
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,697
I thought you were Gabriel's.

382
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:01,926
- I'm not what you think I am.
- Ginger.

383
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:14,746
You surprised that a girl with
an IQ over 70 can give you a hard-on?

384
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,352
So is it impossible?

385
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,917
Nothing's impossible.

386
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,087
Good. So we have a deal.

387
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:07,526
- Morning.
- You mean afternoon?

388
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:18,445
Can I borrow your car for something?

389
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:20,145
Sure.

390
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,780
- There you go.
- Thank you.

391
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:27,782
Hey, Stan, if you're going
to see Holly...

392
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:31,516
...I suggest you re-evaluate
the way you look.

393
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,057
Just a thought.

394
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,228
Just a thought.

395
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:45,655
Come on, Mom, pick up.

396
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:51,527
- Mom late again?
- She'll be here in a minute.

397
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:03,514
Hi. Can I have the phone number for
Yellow Cab?

398
00:40:03,684 --> 00:40:04,981
Need a lift?

399
00:40:07,254 --> 00:40:08,812
Daddy!

400
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,784
Oh, what are you doing here?

401
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:19,329
- I missed you so much.
- Oh, I missed you too, baby.

402
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:24,604
- I brought you something.
- Oh, my gosh. It's so cute.

403
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:29,836
Oh, Dad. If Mom finds out,
she'll have you thrown in jail.

404
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,535
It's okay, baby.
You want a lift home?

405
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:36,240
- Of course I do.
- Come here. All right.

406
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,819
You are heavy.

407
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,289
- Nice car.
- Hey, thanks.

408
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:48,090
Is that Mommy's car?
Is she home?

409
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,858
That's my stepdad's car.

410
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,566
So listen to me.

411
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,235
I found a way for us to be together.

412
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,817
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

413
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:12,816
Everything's going to be fine.

414
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,681
Everything's going to be okay.
Just trust me.

415
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,059
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you. Come here.

416
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:26,861
Oh, God.

417
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:30,361
You go home. Okay? Bye.

418
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,104
- I miss you.
- I miss you too. Go.

419
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,742
Oh, sweetheart.

420
00:41:43,617 --> 00:41:44,811
Hey.

421
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:49,255
Come here.

422
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,155
It's okay. Go. Go.

423
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,188
Go.

424
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:19,782
Who the hell are you?

425
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,081
- A friend of a friend.
- Shit.

426
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:26,250
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

427
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:36,263
Hold it! Stanley!

428
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,777
Go!

429
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:22,715
Oh, fuck.

430
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:33,252
Oh, fuck!

431
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,369
Don't move!

432
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,796
Don't move.

433
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,473
Come here.

434
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:30,210
Look at this.

435
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:32,877
What were you running for?

436
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,818
You arresting me?

437
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:40,585
For violating your parole
by leaving Texas without permission?

438
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:45,797
Or evading an officer and almost
getting me killed in the process?!

439
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:50,268
No, I'm not arresting you.

440
00:44:51,038 --> 00:44:53,233
Then why are we talking?

441
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,307
- What are you doing in L.A.?
- Vacationing.

442
00:44:56,477 --> 00:44:58,206
Vacationing, right.

443
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,015
The judge is allowing you to
see your daughter?

444
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:05,117
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you? Oh?

445
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:10,416
You just want to get right down to it?
Okay, fine.

446
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,627
I can help you with your daughter.

447
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:18,829
You help me, I'll help you.

448
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:22,164
You'll have to forgive me.
The fact that...

449
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:25,430
...you put me in jail
doesn't inspire trust.

450
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:29,201
You put a virus in an FBI program
and set it back two years.

451
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:32,539
They were reading ISP subscribers'
e-mail. It was illegal.

452
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:36,849
- I did what the judges wouldn't do!
- You broke the law!

453
00:45:37,017 --> 00:45:42,421
We both did what we had to do.
And your program is back in full swing.

454
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:48,026
Nice trip down memory lane,
but if you aren't arresting me...

455
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,525
Not getting a lot of cooperation here.

456
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:59,596
I ran into your friend Torvalds
the other day.

457
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,965
He was vacationing too.

458
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:06,377
What are the odds of you
being in L.A. At the same time?

459
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,310
I'm just a sucker for Disneyland.

460
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,076
We done?

461
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:15,020
Good.

462
00:46:15,222 --> 00:46:17,622
Tell Torvalds I said hello.

463
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:21,951
You can tell him yourself
if you're not careful. He's dead.

464
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:24,993
Give me a card.

465
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:29,225
You think of anything to say,
call me.

466
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,370
Sorry about your nose.

467
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:41,240
- You're in way over your head.
- I know.

468
00:46:43,684 --> 00:46:47,245
- You want me to watch him?
- Yeah, set it up.

469
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,946
I've had a shitty day so far,
but I think it just got worse.

470
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,266
Either shoot me, or tell me why
you're wearing that wire.

471
00:47:37,638 --> 00:47:39,265
Can't do that.

472
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,267
Who are you, Ginger?

473
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:44,404
I can't tell you.

474
00:47:45,746 --> 00:47:48,340
Who are you?

475
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:51,275
He'll kill me if he finds out.

476
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,681
That's not my problem, is it?

477
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:59,090
You're asking for a lot of faith
without giving me any.

478
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:17,506
You brought me into this mess.

479
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:21,208
I deserve to know who's playing me.

480
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,717
Who are you?

481
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,055
I'm DEA, Stanley.

482
00:48:34,261 --> 00:48:35,455
Holy shit.

483
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:38,793
We're after Gabriel.
Give him the worm...

484
00:48:39,132 --> 00:48:42,693
...take the money and get out of here.
That's all.

485
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:49,370
This looks friendly.

486
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,776
You know me, I'm a friendly girl.

487
00:48:57,818 --> 00:49:00,719
Come on, Stanley. Let's get coffee.

488
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:23,474
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

489
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:26,678
- Ever heard of Operation Swordfish?
- No.

490
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:29,407
Then you'll appreciate the irony.

491
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:30,641
Triple espresso.

492
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,277
- Two.
- Okay.

493
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:38,848
In the '80s, the DEA set up a
network of dummy corporations...

494
00:49:39,192 --> 00:49:43,151
...as a front to launder drug money
and gather evidence.

495
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,296
But these companies
started to make a lot of money.

496
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:52,427
In 1986, when it was terminated,
$400 million was in these accounts.

497
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,540
Money that just sort of disappeared.

498
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,271
It didn't disappear.
It sat, earning interest.

499
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,213
That's 15 years ago. You know
how much money that is today?

500
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:09,521
Nine and a half billion.

501
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:17,719
This is a sweet deal. We go in over
the phone lines, pop the firewall...

502
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:21,163
...drop in the hydra
and wait for the money.

503
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:24,396
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

504
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:29,404
To access the cluster, you need a bank
on the backbone of the network.

505
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:34,843
- IKnow how long that'll take to find?
- Not a problem. Look behind you.

506
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:52,597
Cheers.

507
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:04,942
These fellows might wear Armani...

508
00:51:05,278 --> 00:51:08,679
...but they have the swagger
of ex-military.

509
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,317
Maybe bodyguards,
but they look like mercs to me.

510
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:18,481
Something's going on. They have two
DS-3 trucks. That's serious bandwidth.

511
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:22,685
Thermal scopes show a huge heat load.
Could be mainframes.

512
00:51:22,863 --> 00:51:26,264
The house was listed
by Celebrity Estates.

513
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:29,797
It was leased two weeks ago
by a blind corporation.

514
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:31,961
No other info on them yet.

515
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,370
Wait a minute, Joe.

516
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,936
Blue shirt, pinstripe.

517
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,377
Oh, yeah, that's him.

518
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,811
That's our man right there.

519
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:01,267
Just in time to watch Stanley
find our worm.

520
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:06,429
In college, I created the source code
for the worm I use.

521
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:14,811
In the basement is the only PDP-10
still active and on the Internet.

522
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:16,744
Not many people know it.

523
00:52:16,917 --> 00:52:20,648
It's an ITS machine,
kept online for historical sake.

524
00:52:20,821 --> 00:52:24,257
I hid my worm there,
where no one would ever look.

525
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:29,689
<i>Voila.</i>

526
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,806
Good man. Good man.

527
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:35,889
Senator, we have a problem.

528
00:53:39,866 --> 00:53:43,358
- Senator.
- Seems you're in a predicament.

529
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:44,628
<i>Is that right?</i>

530
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:48,069
- I don't follow.
<i>- Download your file.</i>

531
00:53:59,085 --> 00:54:01,986
- Senator...
- You know where I got these?

532
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:07,092
From the deputy director of the FBI.
He thought I might be interested.

533
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:13,399
Sir, do you think there is any aspect
of this operation I am not aware of?

534
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:16,933
We are aborting the operation.
Take a vacation.

535
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:20,072
A vacation?
Have I ever failed you, sir?

536
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:23,808
- That's not really the point, is it?
- It's my point.

537
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:26,605
<i>You're losing sight of our objective.</i>
