1
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:41,401
Stop.

2
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,366
Come on.

3
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,750
How are you?
- Good. And with you?

4
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,919
Legitimation, please.

5
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,338
Of course.

6
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,987
Give it here.

7
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:30,325
How many times I said now all
you do not throw the ball?

8
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,411
Are you trying to scare your sister?

9
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:34,079
She cries.
- Of course she's crying.

10
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:35,748
She is still a baby.

11
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,708
You've also been that.

12
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,125
Yes, Papa.

13
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:40,920
What is it?
- Nothing.

14
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,214
What is it, Juan Pablo?

15
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:46,425
I want her to die.

16
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:50,888
That you should never say.

17
00:01:52,138 --> 00:01:57,644
We are family
and should always take care of each other.

18
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:59,396
Do you hear me?

19
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:16,246
Hey?
- Poison shot some cops dead.

20
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:19,291
Well, how much?
- Two.

21
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:21,877
Two what? Brigadiers or agents?

22
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,921
Agents. You know Poison anyway.

23
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:27,800
Agents are a million each.
- Okay, so two million.

24
00:02:27,883 --> 00:02:30,970
I write it down.
- Well, I'll talk to you later.

25
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,429
Ok ?.

26
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:35,181
What was that about?

27
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:37,183
Just matters.

28
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,895
I want to be just such a businessman like you.

29
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:29,880
Pablo opted for all-out war.

30
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:35,010
He paid for every dead policeman.
There were more than 200 massacred.

31
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:39,389
There was a mortuary
to be built.

32
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:44,394
The police retaliated.

33
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:53,070
My name is Alba Borraga,
born in 1962, in Popay? n.

34
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:56,197
My father Sandoval, my mother Mar? A.
We have a large tobacco plantation.

35
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:00,953
I studied chemical engineering
at the University of Cauca.

36
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:02,871
Do it once more and look at me.

37
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:04,790
I did it all 17 times.

38
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:06,750
You engaged me and my wife here.

39
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,170
Sit down and do it again
for it is good.

40
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:15,300
My name is Alba Borraga,
Born in 1962 in Popay? n.

41
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:18,011
My father Sandoval, my mom Mar? A.
We have a large tobacco plantation.

42
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:23,683
I studied chemical engineering
at the University of Cauca.

43
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,561
What do I do with chemistry questions?

44
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,355
Hopefully you bluff well.

45
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,858
Sit down. Again.
It's going better.

46
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:38,406
We were protecting Elisha because they Escobar
could link to the Palace of Justice.

47
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,953
But we were protecting a communist.
That made us traitors.

48
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:44,370
Can you imagine.

49
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:49,644
We go.

50
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:53,314
Are you done?
- Yes.

51
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:57,736
Honey, thank you.

52
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,489
Make sure we get Escobar.
- I want him dead.

53
00:07:01,573 --> 00:07:03,033
We have no death squads.

54
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:05,618
You do not do the US
in Latin America.

55
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:09,206
What did you say?
- Honey, calm down.

56
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,933
You're angry,
but we must do this.

57
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:30,602
As if I had what to choose.

58
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,272
There is no other choice.

59
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:35,356
You may be thinking
to go back to Miami.

60
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,318
They sit in their car.
Wait a second.

61
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:41,238
I do perhaps.

62
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:43,198
Just get in.

63
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:51,539
They drive.
Forward.

64
00:07:59,464 --> 00:08:04,261
I had Connie never have to get here.
She is unsuitable.

65
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:08,098
He has that red bitch with him.
- Do not do anything stupid.

66
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,226
Keep your head down.
It's so over.

67
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,519
Cut him off. Here to the left.

68
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,571
Disembarking, Murphy.

69
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:25,282
Get out.

70
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,827
Away from the car.
- You followed me?

71
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,330
Get him away.
- Quiet.

72
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:34,207
Backwards, dammit.
- Keep your hands ...

73
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,960
Get your hands off me.
You spying on me?

74
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:39,045
Who do you think you are?

75
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:43,133
Where is she?

76
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:53,726
Backwards.

77
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:58,690
With whom did you speak?

78
00:08:58,773 --> 00:08:59,941
Pe? A.

79
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:02,319
I have problems with my wife.

80
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:05,780
Problems?

81
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:10,035
Your husband was smart
to let him follow.

82
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:11,744
I hope he's okay.

83
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:35,935
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you going?

84
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:39,814
Sorry, I'm American.
I do not speak spanish.

85
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,984
Do you speak Spanish?

86
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:44,277
Yes.

87
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,864
I asked where you are going.

88
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:50,242
Popay? N.

89
00:09:52,118 --> 00:09:53,828
Legitimation.

90
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,208
Mrs. Connie Murphy.

91
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:43,002
Alba Borraga.

92
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:45,755
Good trip.

93
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,383
Thank you.
- Be careful.

94
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,842
Thank you sir.

95
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:08,236
She is now in the orphanage.
Beautiful.

96
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,737
And Elisha is ok ?.

97
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,533
Glad you make it good.

98
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:16,286
Listen, enjoy yourself ...

99
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,037
... and call me every hour.

100
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:20,206
Call me every hour.

101
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,210
Yes I know.

102
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:26,171
I love you too.

103
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:28,548
I'm proud of you.
Day.

104
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:35,596
Now Connie was safe,
I could focus on C? sar Gaviria.

105
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:41,019
The only one who then ran more danger
a Colombian cop ...

106
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:44,022
... was the presidential candidate
Colombia.

107
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:08,004
Gaviria was for expulsion
the narco to the USA ...

108
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:11,383
... and we had an interest in
he would win the election.

109
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,758
But in order to win ...

110
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:14,927
... he had to get the election alive.

111
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:16,679
Se? Or Gaviria?

112
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:18,264
That door over there.

113
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:27,315
You must be Agent Murphy.

114
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,483
Nice to meet you.
- You too.

115
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:32,070
I am Eduardo Sandoval,
head of security for dr. Gaviria.

116
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:33,196
What can we do for you?

117
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,199
Maybe our agency
you give means ...

118
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:39,202
... for Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.

119
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:43,664
The DEA can not get better
on drug traffickers hunt?

120
00:12:43,748 --> 00:12:46,543
It is not separate from each other.
- Agent Murphy.

121
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:48,878
Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

122
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,838
Take a seat.

123
00:12:55,594 --> 00:13:00,515
Your Secret Service has informed us
about safety.

124
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:04,769
No meeting in the outdoors,
every day one different route home.

125
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:09,023
After the death of Lara and Gal? N
we knew that already.

126
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:10,358
Cut it out.
- Exactly.

127
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,984
These men do everything
to kill you.

128
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:16,448
I know.
We take all measures.

129
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:20,701
Your government has even
an armored Cadillac offered ...

130
00:13:20,785 --> 00:13:22,621
... that is created for your president.

131
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:26,374
But driving around in Bogot?
in an American tank ...

132
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,043
... makes us determined not to vote for.

133
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:35,007
We honestly do not know
how we should respond to it.

134
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:38,595
I say 'thank you' when I
a new Cadillac will be offered.

135
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,682
Thank you, then.

136
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:43,766
And this here?

137
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:48,521
What we need this?

138
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,983
A bullet-proof trousers.

139
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:55,236
I suggest that you are wearing it.

140
00:13:57,363 --> 00:14:00,575
Thank you for thinking.

141
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:03,077
We'll keep your advice in mind.

142
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:06,747
Thanks for your time.

143
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,671
WITH Gaviria IS FUTURE

144
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:16,591
The audience supported Gaviria
its position on extradition.

145
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:18,217
He became a target.

146
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:23,973
But our own target
Jos? Rodr? Guez Gacha ...

147
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:27,602
... we had detected
Cartagena, through an informant.

148
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:37,278
Have you ever
heard of a computer?

149
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:41,741
Someone wanted to sell me one.
No idea what it is.

150
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:47,205
What's up with you?
It's something technical, like new.

151
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:50,458
Already on sale?
- Yes, Daddy.

152
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:54,795
Day, baby.

153
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:59,967
You look beautiful today.

154
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:06,057
Calm down, girl.
We do not bite.

155
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:11,688
Would you like anything else?
- I want you.

156
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,567
No, thank you.
- All right, sir.

157
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:20,238
I want to fuck her.

158
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:24,367
There are now more important things,
my boy.

159
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,118
Understood?

160
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:29,830
Say it. What do you know?

161
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:32,709
Don Gonzalo, our men are everywhere
on the estate.

162
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,126
It's safe.

163
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,713
We also have men in the city.

164
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:42,176
What can you tell me about Medell? N?

165
00:15:43,636 --> 00:15:45,513
Same thing, boss.

166
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:49,684
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc
is looking to Pablo.

167
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:51,143
Thank you, Navegante.

168
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:54,606
At your service.
- Make sure we stay safe.

169
00:15:56,816 --> 00:15:58,234
Don Fredy.

170
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:04,073
Boy, I got a question for you.

171
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:08,411
Are we sheep or wolves?

172
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,873
Wolves.
- Yes, yes.

173
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:14,459
I like that.

174
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:20,840
They're in a house outside Cartagena.
Here, in this place.

175
00:16:20,923 --> 00:16:24,719
He is protected by many people.

176
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:29,932
Navegante, you work for many years
for Gacha.

177
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:33,936
During that period, you will have more deserved
we will pay you now.

178
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:37,649
Why do you want to betray him?

179
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:43,028
That motherfucker's crazy.

180
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:47,158
We go there all by him.

181
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:59,211
I believe him for a penny.

182
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:02,006
What do you care
why is he doing it?

183
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:07,219
There are 23 agents with obsolete weapons
finished in Barranquilla.

184
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:11,474
He has twice as many people
with brand new weapons.

185
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:13,267
And honestly ...

186
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:17,772
... I've had enough
for young men to hunt in death.

187
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:19,982
So we have to be smart.

188
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:24,153
We need to lure him into a trap.

189
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:26,823
If we catch him alive,
he gives us Escobar.

190
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:28,407
And Ochoa's.

191
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:32,244
The whole cartel.
- Does me no ass, Javier.

192
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,663
I want him dead.

193
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,874
Death does not bother him.

194
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:39,335
He's just afraid
to have to rot in the cell.

195
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:44,716
That is the real victory.
- I forgot you're a gringo.

196
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:49,261
What do you mean?
- What risk do you actually walk?

197
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:51,138
These are not your men.

198
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:53,725
You have no family here
you can lose.

199
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:56,143
If this goes wrong, you get
more widows and orphans.

200
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:59,397
That's on my shoulders up.

201
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,485
Well ...

202
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:07,154
... I trust his information.

203
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:12,201
And I trust you.

204
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:17,998
But if this goes wrong,
you'll have to live with it.

205
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:26,966
What do we have?

206
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:31,262
Guards at the airport
Poison saw there.

207
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,482
Who is this guy?

208
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:46,235
No idea, but as Poison
retrieves himself ...

209
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:48,070
... he is very important.

210
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:52,658
Here is your payment.

211
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:58,664
It comes with a freighter
to the coast of Spain.

212
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:02,084
Our trucks bring
from there to the Basque Country.

213
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,212
It's all settled.

214
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:11,302
5,000 kg, otherwise I pick
the first flight back to Spain.

215
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:17,224
How so?

216
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:21,479
You have an appointment with my cousin.

217
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,898
An appointment for this quantity.

218
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:25,858
What is this bullshit?

219
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:29,361
5 000 kilos or no deal.

220
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,239
Than not.

221
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:34,617
Who do you think you're talking to?

222
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:41,749
Sorry for my cousin.

223
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:50,090
5 000 kilos then.

224
00:19:58,349 --> 00:19:59,684
We should not go.

225
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:03,187
I want you to go to the US.

226
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,190
You'll be safe. Far away from here.

227
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:09,193
But if you ...
- Happens to me nothing.

228
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:11,821
We go.

229
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,418
Protect him, please.

230
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:30,464
Do not worry, that's good.
I walk along.

231
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:38,180
Day, Dad. I love you.

232
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,280
Gaviria's life was in danger ...

233
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:58,409
... my wife was with one fugitive ...

234
00:20:58,617 --> 00:21:01,161
... and my partner was in Cartagena.

235
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:03,831
He had his own mission,
with cops ...

236
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:08,086
... those friends and relatives
had seen dying by Gacha.

237
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:13,716
Trujillo example, whose father
and two brothers, all agents,

238
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,468
... were killed in firefights
with the cartel.

239
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:25,019
We wanted Gacha just as happy
as the narco's wanted Gaviria.

240
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:33,569
I hated
this guy to ask for help.

241
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:37,448
Su? Rez was as slippery as an eel,
but without the charm.

242
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:40,576
Hello, Su? Rez.
- Look who it is.

243
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:42,453
Golden Gringo.

244
00:21:42,536 --> 00:21:44,122
You do not call, do not write.

245
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:47,083
I called your office.

246
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:49,752
I only talk with Pe? A.

247
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:54,882
I need to know who this is.

248
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:56,258
I need to ...

249
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:57,760
Should ...

250
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:02,681
Must know who he is.

251
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:07,979
Do you "need to know who he is."

252
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:10,230
Give me, fagot.

253
00:22:11,149 --> 00:22:13,484
'Must know who he is. "

254
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:17,279
Back, damn it. Back.

255
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:24,829
You work for me, asshole.
Did you understand that?

256
00:22:25,037 --> 00:22:26,497
Clear?

257
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,250
Do you know who it is?
You tell me?

258
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:35,673
Su? Rez knew exactly who it was,
and he was not alone.

259
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:39,551
Jesus Christ.
- If you want to sew someone ...

260
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:40,719
... then you take them out.

261
00:22:40,803 --> 00:22:42,221
What is it?

262
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:44,056
It looks like it
that it Medell? nkartel ...

263
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,350
... an attack on Gaviria
has planned.

264
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:47,768
Since we know nothing about.

265
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:51,647
Do your work, then instead of
other agents spying.

266
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:56,110
What does he mean?
- Never mind, ambassador.

267
00:22:56,194 --> 00:22:58,362
The CIA has us
given these documents ...

268
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:01,782
... but 90 percent of it
defaced.

269
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:04,160
I have in the White House.

270
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:05,744
What is that?

271
00:23:05,953 --> 00:23:08,122
Dick did not.
I get those files.

272
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:11,250
You read too many spy novels.

273
00:23:13,836 --> 00:23:16,005
Have you read The Spaniard?

274
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:18,423
How did you get that?

275
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:20,342
Madam, he's been days in the country.

276
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,512
Together with one top-assassin
Pablo.

277
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:28,100
Let me see.
- The CIA has information about him.

278
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:33,647
I now get access or not?

279
00:23:37,943 --> 00:23:40,112
The chamber is, in fact, not white.

280
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,823
He's more ... bordeaux.

281
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,665
Agent Schroeder, you come along?

282
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:57,088
The White Room
was a secret repository ...

283
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:00,507
... to the deepest, darkest
Secrets of the CIA.

284
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:04,762
So secret that 's existence
has never been recognized.

285
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,728
Sit here.

286
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,690
Agent Schroeder keeps you
keep an eye on.

287
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:19,401
Where are the files?

288
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:35,042
I think it's still too soft.
- He is sometimes harder.

289
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:38,879
I do not know, Pablo.

290
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:41,632
We can surgery
better to postpone.

291
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:45,261
It's too risky.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.

292
00:24:46,845 --> 00:24:49,598
That's why you become bald.

293
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:52,935
Very funny, asshole.

294
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:57,356
Laugh.

295
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:01,986
How's our boy, mama?

296
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:05,281
He teaches, but with a heavy hand.

297
00:25:05,364 --> 00:25:07,325
How are you, aunt?
- You tell it.

298
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:12,704
That has to be able to mingle
among the sons of the oligarchs.

299
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:15,457
Yes sir.
- He can give us information.

300
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:18,294
And these clowns?

301
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:21,339
They are a bit nice to you?

302
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:24,091
More or less.

303
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:28,512
What do you mean 'more or less'?
We are kind to you.

304
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:31,515
Can we eat, Gustavo?

305
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:35,644
Would you like rice?

306
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:43,694
Thank you.

307
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:46,197
Jaimito.

308
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:50,492
Welcome to the family.

309
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:54,163
Thank you, boss.

310
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,793
Can you absolutely nothing to do?

311
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,087
No.

312
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:06,300
As long as we are at war,
we can do nothing.

313
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,761
What a bunch of crap.
Every day people come to ...

314
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:13,057
... and it is thought that my friends
make it happen.

315
00:26:15,184 --> 00:26:17,602
Let's talk about something else.

316
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,730
Yes.

317
00:26:20,772 --> 00:26:23,775
Eg escape on together.

318
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:25,903
Now you can.

319
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:31,658
"Together escape."
Listen to it.

320
00:26:37,748 --> 00:26:41,335
Why would you go off
with a criminal like me?

321
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:43,712
Why not?

322
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:48,467
Was it that easy.

323
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,178
I can not just leave.

324
00:26:51,262 --> 00:26:53,180
I know.

325
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,724
It's your wife.

326
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:58,269
My wife does not interest me.

327
00:26:59,228 --> 00:27:03,357
I mean other woman Pablo.

328
00:27:03,441 --> 00:27:05,692
Who is the woman in the relationship?

329
00:27:05,776 --> 00:27:07,194
Do you?

330
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:19,790
Gacha was always paranoid
when it was quiet.

331
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:23,877
He began to wonder things
about Navegante.

332
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,557
How is it, honey?

333
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:39,143
What are you doing?

334
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:42,229
I am married, sir.

335
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:44,356
No problem, I can so
Making widow.

336
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,858
Do not touch me.

337
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:49,445
Fredy, stay away from her.
Come here.

338
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:50,570
What is it?

339
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:54,199
The Search Bloc is here
not Medell? n.

340
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:56,034
Navegante but said that they were there.

341
00:27:56,118 --> 00:27:59,913
Navegante ...
That's a liar.

342
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:01,540
He would never betray you.

343
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:06,128
Fredy, think.

344
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:09,173
Everyone has a price.

345
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:13,010
Let's go.

346
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:16,430
If they want war,
they can get it.

347
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:32,488
Everyone was interested
in the Spaniard.

348
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:34,614
He was a member of ETA.

349
00:28:34,823 --> 00:28:36,700
Never heard of?

350
00:28:36,908 --> 00:28:39,619
Who made an art
bomb making.

351
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:47,044
It was a group of "freedom fighters"
Basque ...

352
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:49,588
... who wanted to separate from Spain.

353
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:54,134
Their specialty was murder
public figures.

354
00:28:56,845 --> 00:29:01,641
ETA was behind the murder
the Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco ...

355
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,019
... on the way home, after a wrong ...

356
00:29:05,854 --> 00:29:11,109
... and behind the assassination of Prime Rivera
with one remote-controlled car bomb.

357
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:17,199
The man behind these bombs?
You guessed it: the Spaniard.

358
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:20,911
His real name is Ephraim Gonzalez.

359
00:29:20,994 --> 00:29:23,414
He is now famous, and for rent.

360
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:25,374
Expensive, but the best.

361
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:28,877
Because Pablo hires only the best.

362
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:41,139
Pablo's plan was to blow Gaviria.

363
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:45,436
Only: where, when and how?

364
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:49,648
I appreciate your concern ...

365
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:53,652
... but to cancel the campaign
is not an option.

366
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,656
With the new information
the cop Murphy discovered ...

367
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,617
... reconsiders you hopefully.

368
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:03,787
He performs in Cali, Boyac?
and a dozen other cities.

369
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,705
You are everywhere a target.

370
00:30:05,914 --> 00:30:10,377
We have done everything
what your Secret Service ...

371
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:13,422
... and Spain's Guardia Civil
recommended.

372
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:17,635
We also bomhonden
each campaign site, so ...

373
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:18,677
... that's good.

374
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:21,138
The Spaniard would not know it?

375
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:24,600
I know.

376
00:30:24,683 --> 00:30:27,561
Tell me
how can he win the election ...

377
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:30,648
... if he's hiding
like a scared rabbit for all this violence?

378
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,316
What?

379
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,901
How can he win if he's dead?

380
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,655
I will not mention your wife
that you died on my watch.

381
00:30:37,862 --> 00:30:39,990
You're not responsible.

382
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,788
Thank you, Officer Murphy,
but Eduardo is right.

383
00:30:48,206 --> 00:30:50,041
I venture 't it.

384
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:58,300
His name is Steve Murphy.
He is of the DEA.

385
00:30:58,383 --> 00:31:00,969
Hopefully you pay for this information.

386
00:31:11,355 --> 00:31:14,525
Su? Rez talks with the DEA.

387
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:19,237
You know what to do.

388
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,022
He escaped.

389
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,984
They have slain the maid.

390
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:02,489
Colonel.

391
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:10,706
A message from the roadblock.

392
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:14,418
They stopped a car.
The driver seems to be a senator.

393
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:17,003
Can he identify himself?
- Everything seems to fit.

394
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:18,714
What's the problem?

395
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:22,133
There was a machine gun
in the trunk.

396
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:24,302
Come with me.

397
00:32:35,272 --> 00:32:37,107
Check my papers.

398
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,110
No, I do not know who Gacha.

399
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,905
Why is there a weapon
in your trunk?

400
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:51,079
You ask why a politician
a weapon in this country?

401
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:53,624
Please, say.

402
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:56,794
He's my bodyguard.
- Where's your bodyguard?

403
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:00,130
You were still in the car?

404
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:03,508
Listen, agents ...

405
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:08,221
... if you do not let me go right away,
you will regret it.

406
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:13,977
Thank you.

407
00:33:14,686 --> 00:33:17,314
Ogenblikje.
- Go ahead.

408
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:21,901
I do not believe him.

409
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:23,862
Me neither.

410
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,408
He can his papers
or bought.

411
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:31,995
What if he really
appears to be a senator?

412
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,831
Then we have a problem.

413
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:38,376
That's a risk I can not take.

414
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,295
That is true.

415
00:33:40,378 --> 00:33:42,088
Not you.

416
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:49,554
The next I shoot in your head.

417
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:51,389
Good.
- Talk, fagot.

418
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:53,558
I will talk.

419
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:59,063
I love you, sweetheart.
I love you.

420
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:02,150
You have a visitor.
It is Don Pablo.

421
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,696
Hello, Jaimito.

422
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,364
Don Pablo.
- Is this your house?

423
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:10,450
Your family?
- Yes, welcome.

424
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:11,827
Tell me about them.

425
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:14,538
This is my daughter Marcela.

426
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:16,915
What a sweet baby.

427
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:19,710
You must be very proud.
- Certainly.

428
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:21,712
Of course.

429
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:26,174
They can buy soon
what they want, Jaimito.

430
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:27,801
Thank you, boss.

431
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:29,803
Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.

432
00:34:29,887 --> 00:34:31,388
Thank you.

433
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:32,639
And now you.

434
00:34:32,723 --> 00:34:35,726
How are you?
- Well, you know.

435
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:37,728
Guys.

436
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:41,064
Well, Jaimito.

437
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,485
You wear it during your mission.

438
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:47,153
Thank you.

439
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:49,197
Really, Pablo?

440
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,990
Thank you.

441
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,159
What beautiful, say.

442
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:57,956
You must be careful
and may not be noticed.

443
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,251
Of course. I'll do anything you ask.

444
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:03,461
All right, boy.

445
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:05,004
Sit down.

446
00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:11,302
These guys are going to explain to you
what should be done.

447
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:14,431
Tomorrow morning you step
the plane to Cali.

448
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,642
You need to record a conversation.

449
00:35:17,726 --> 00:35:20,478
Quite simply.
Nothing to worry about.

450
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:23,440
Good.

451
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,739
How do you feel?
- I am very happy.

452
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:34,659
Thank you for this opportunity, Don Pablo.
And for the clothes.

453
00:35:34,743 --> 00:35:37,495
I consider it an honor
to work for you.

454
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:39,247
Thank you very much.

455
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:42,125
Do not mention it.

456
00:35:43,794 --> 00:35:45,253
Good.

457
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:47,672
Come here and hug me.

458
00:35:49,466 --> 00:35:51,342
Thank you, Don Pablo.

459
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,262
Thank you.

460
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:57,432
Good evening, madam.
- I wish you well.

461
00:35:57,515 --> 00:35:59,142
Thank you.

462
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,894
See you later, guys.

463
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:03,187
Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.

464
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:05,732
Look, sweetheart.

465
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:10,194
What a nice jacket, right?
- Beautiful. What did Pablo?

466
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:13,782
You know, we go higher.

467
00:36:15,158 --> 00:36:18,870
You, me and the baby come up higher.

468
00:36:18,954 --> 00:36:20,288
Thank you, my dear.

469
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:23,041
Look at that.
- Put on.

470
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:29,130
I have news about Gaviria.

471
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:31,967
They go to him en route to Cali
kill.

472
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:36,262
Did you say Cali?
Can I have an interpreter?

473
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:37,973
Su? Rez, listen.

474
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,349
I can interpret.

475
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:44,145
Wait, there's someone at the door.

476
00:36:44,354 --> 00:36:46,857
'Tu puerta?

477
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,817
That's the door.

478
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:01,997
Pablo does not like
if you talk to the DEA.

479
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,002
Su? Rez.

480
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:09,462
Talk to me, asshole.
Su? Rez, hello?

481
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:17,178
I want the recordings.
- Coming.

482
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:27,564
Carrillo and his men came to Tolu
to kill Gacha.

483
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:30,233
Pe? A hoped him alive
to tackle.

484
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:48,793
It was her fault, Dad.

485
00:37:48,877 --> 00:37:52,296
Do you still think that?
Let go, boy.

486
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,342
If she had said yes, I did it
not to shoot.

487
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:57,719
Be a man.

488
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:28,792
Damn, they found us.

489
00:38:51,106 --> 00:38:52,690
Come on, son.

490
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:37,944
Everything good?
- Nothing to worry about.

491
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:40,279
He tries to escape.
- That's him fail.

492
00:39:40,363 --> 00:39:42,115
Bring me a radio, fast.

493
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,282
Correal, one radio.

494
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:48,872
Come on, Dad. We go.
Hurry up.

495
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,917
Hurry up.

496
00:40:02,135 --> 00:40:03,136
Stop.

497
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:21,821
Pe? A, Gacha is in the red pickup.

498
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:30,496
What did I say? We have escaped.

499
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,208
I'm afraid.
- What?

500
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,126
You're a wolf?

501
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,295
Yes, I am a wolf.

502
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:48,932
It is a helicopter.
They're going to kill us.

503
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,392
Nobody is going to kill us.
Do not talk nonsense.

504
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:53,394
Take this.

505
00:40:57,648 --> 00:41:00,318
I see the pickup.
- Keep him on.

506
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:03,696
Do not let him escape.
Switch 's vehicle.

507
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:25,509
Did not work out.
We'll do it again.

508
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:28,429
Stop him. Anyway.

509
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:36,020
Do not leave me alone, Dad.
- Never, boy. Never.

510
00:41:36,104 --> 00:41:38,898
Take a breath.

511
00:41:38,982 --> 00:41:42,652
Would you like it, asshole? Here, take this.

512
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,614
We are being shot. We go to him
of approaching the other side.

513
00:41:46,823 --> 00:41:50,952
Do not worry, son.

514
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:54,622
Do not take chances.
He can not escape.

515
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:55,873
Understood.

516
00:41:58,001 --> 00:42:00,920
Look outside.

517
00:42:05,383 --> 00:42:08,178
What happens, Pe? A?

518
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:18,146
We got him stopped.
He does not move.

519
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:23,151
Fredy?

520
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:25,069
We go.

521
00:42:29,282 --> 00:42:31,075
Son.

522
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:39,583
You are a wolf.

523
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,381
Asshole.

524
00:42:47,591 --> 00:42:49,386
Fredy, wake up.

525
00:42:51,388 --> 00:42:53,181
Asshole. What do you want?

526
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,184
What do you want? Asshole.

527
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:57,727
What do you want?

528
00:43:02,065 --> 00:43:05,068
He has no more bullets.
We can catch him alive.

529
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:09,655
You decide.

530
00:43:18,456 --> 00:43:19,916
Shoot him at loggerheads.

531
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:44,815
Well, take position in
and patrol the area again.

532
00:43:58,162 --> 00:43:59,538
Everything good?

533
00:44:00,457 --> 00:44:02,375
I can sleep tonight.

534
00:44:07,922 --> 00:44:12,302
This was the first successful
major surgery of Search Bloc.

535
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:14,553
The country and the world now understood ...

536
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:18,557
... that the fight against the narco's
had reached new heights.

537
00:44:19,267 --> 00:44:22,312
We are in good shape,
according to recent polls.

538
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:25,898
We stand at a profit
in six districts of Cali.

539
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:29,444
That are important
in order to arrive in the lead.

540
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:32,530
The polls say nothing.
- I know.

541
00:44:32,613 --> 00:44:35,533
The last time we dropped by five percent.

542
00:44:35,616 --> 00:44:36,451
Yes.

543
00:44:36,534 --> 00:44:37,452
Dr. Gaviria.

544
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,162
Stop him.
You may not pass.

545
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,247
Quiet, let him through.

546
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:46,961
Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?

547
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,879
He can not leave.

548
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:50,923
How so?

549
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:55,636
There awaits a bomb on him.
If he goes, he will die.

550
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,680
What are you talking about?

551
00:44:57,888 --> 00:45:02,643
You decide.
But I know that something will happen.

552
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:04,312
Can you prove that?

553
00:45:05,355 --> 00:45:07,148
I just feel it.

554
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:09,817
You just feel it.

555
00:45:12,695 --> 00:45:15,990
And if you're wrong?
- I hope so huge.

556
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,617
But if I'm right?

557
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,751
Nervous?

558
00:45:27,835 --> 00:45:30,213
A little, but I'm fine.

559
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:32,173
Wait here.

560
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,384
You know what to do?

561
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:36,260
Yes sir.

562
00:45:39,763 --> 00:45:43,560
You should record the whole conversation.
Do not forget.

563
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:47,230
No sir.
- Good flight.

564
00:45:47,313 --> 00:45:49,232
Will not you come?

565
00:45:49,315 --> 00:45:54,612
No, I had to just
hither bring the boss.

566
00:45:54,695 --> 00:45:56,655
Do not worry.

567
00:45:56,739 --> 00:45:59,367
I'll come tomorrow that way.

568
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,580
Good then.
- Do not be nervous.

569
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:05,498
Flying is great fun.

570
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:08,042
Well?

571
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:11,588
Go ahead. The row is over there.

572
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,548
Good luck.

573
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:24,016
You tell me, Eduardo.

574
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,769
I lay me down to your decision.

575
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:31,857
Avianca, flight 203 to Cali ...

576
00:46:31,941 --> 00:46:34,402
... is ready for boarding at gate six.

577
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,909
I follow your instincts.

578
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:47,206
I rule that he get out of here.
Stay with him.

579
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:54,130
Well ...
You and I are not the only ones worried.

580
00:47:04,515 --> 00:47:06,725
Your belt, please.
