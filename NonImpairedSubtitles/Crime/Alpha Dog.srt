1
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,549
Do you want to know what this is all about?

2
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,540
You can say it's about drugs, or guns

3
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:11,438
disaffected youth or....

4
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:13,294
Whatever you like...

5
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,221
But this whole thing is about parenting.

6
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:18,465
It is about taking care of your children.

7
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,363
You take care of yours, I take care of mine.

8
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:25,227
I'm sorry I don't understand
What does that mean?

9
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:29,126
That's all I have to say about that subject.
Next question?

10
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,867
You're son was a drug dealer?

11
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:36,766
Drug dealer? No.
Did he/she sell a little weed? Yeah.

12
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:41,634
A little weed? He was a major supplier
in the San Gabriel valley.

13
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,627
I don't know anything about that.

14
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:47,497
What about the D. A. 's assertion that
your son got his marijuana from you...

15
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,577
and that you have tied to organized crime?

16
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:52,276
What is this amateur night bullshit?

17
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:55,234
That isn't an interrogation.  Alright?

18
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,257
I am a taxpayer and I'm a citizen.

19
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:01,274
And you are a jerk-off.
Did I tell you that?

20
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Crac

21
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,922
Come on Johnny, why don't I feed you behind

22
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:12,010
if you're busting hard work I'm fucking your
Mom and your sister....

23
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,733
ahh Shit! What's that Tiko?
What did you say?

24
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:17,632
I heard you say you want to suck my cock right?

25
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,715
Primero would have to grow.

26
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:22,544
Shit, mines got so big it's got a name

27
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,462
5 foot, 3 hung like a flea.

28
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:27,551
It's hot out there

29
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:31,450
-What you doing, Elvis? Is it dark outside?
-What?

30
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,195
I'm paying you for a full day right?

31
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:40,036
I've been here since 10 o'clock this morning.

32
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:42,181
I hate that shit.
I asked you a question.

33
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,197
D'you see the fucking moon, Elvis?

34
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:48,095
-It's definitely daylight.
-Hey! I'll show you my moon.

35
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,764
Johnny, I did everything that you say.

36
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:54,663
The house is clean. I went to the store.
There is food and beer in the fridge.

37
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,596
The wash is done. Adolf's fed.
The grass is cut.  It is all done, man.

38
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:02,563
Well, I guess you shouldn't finish so fast huh?.

39
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,581
Shut the fuck up!

40
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,565
-Hey, never mind that!
-Never mind that!

41
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:08,482
Get back to fucking work!

42
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:12,380
You want something to do. .
Go wash the floors, scrub out the toilets. .

43
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:16,156
or better yet pick up all the dog shit
that's in the back yard.

44
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:18,269
And if you finish too fast...

45
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,999
-dump it out and...
-Pick it back up again

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,088
-Shut the fuck up, bitch!

47
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,891
-Get you a pooper-scooper
-Touchy

48
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,688
-It's messed up, man.
-What?

49
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:34,586
When am I going to get my money, Elvis?
When?

50
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:36,670
I get my cheque on Thursday

51
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,491
Well, how much is the cheque?

52
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,441
I don't know. It depends on the hours.

53
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:42,457
Well, how many hours did you work, bitch?

54
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,441
I can't remember.

55
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:45,545
Fucking dead beat, man.

56
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:48,276
Go on! Get the fuck outta here!

57
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:51,366
The walk of shame...
The walk of shame, man.

58
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,381
-Robby?
-Hold up, bitch!

59
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,841
$8, 500

60
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:05,052
All of this, huh?

61
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:08,951
Surprise! Surprise!

62
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,001
-Yeah
-Okay

63
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,669
So?

64
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,651
So. . I've got this guy

65
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:19,549
He wants 5, plus my regular 2.

66
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:24,364
So, I figure I'm gonna need 7.

67
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,348
I don't know.

68
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:28,395
I don't like having that much shit out

69
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:32,294
I'll see my guy Monday and
I'll clear you right out, man.

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,538
He's good for it, Johnny

71
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,800
You don't need to tell him
I'm good for it, man.

72
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:43,361
I'm not looking for any fucking favours, JT

73
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,189
If it makes sense. Do it!

74
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,087
If no, fuck it.

75
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:56,983
Alright

76
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,910
We'll try it.

77
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:02,525
-Where you going, Ray?
-That's what I'm talking about

78
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:08,622
But come Friday....

79
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:10,520
I don't want to hear any fucking stories.

80
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,880
You won't.

81
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,857
Be ready, be ready.

82
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:32,485
Nice. Nice.
Its big league stuff right there, baby.

83
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:36,452
I will throw you a couple.

84
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,306
-Hey!
-Hey.

85
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:44,298
-What you say, Tarzan?
-I need 7.

86
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,191
-7? 7 to who?
-Bobby 911.

87
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:52,117
-That could be put together.
and when you're picked off.
-Alright

88
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:58,007
-Knows where he's been?
-Yeah... I know. . it feels good.

89
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:04,674
Alright.  It's on you anyway, right?

90
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,511
Always is, pop.

91
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:11,410
Look at this kid, how handsome he is.
Look at this!

92
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:13,565
You must be knocking them dead.
Are you knowing them dead?

93
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,681
No. Let go!

94
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:18,574
What you doing tonight?
Chasing tail?

95
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,623
No. I'm just chilling.

96
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,639
On Friday. night?

97
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,531
-Sonny?
-I know.

98
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:29,430
You make me wonder about you, kid.
You sound like half a fucking fag.

99
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,553
-I always had my suspicions.
-Just make the fucking call!

100
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,700
Wait a minute, ok?
Remember what I told you...

101
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:38,498
Men are not supposed to be 'monopulous'
It's in our nature to spread the seed.

102
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:41,396
Yeah, very poetic. Come on

103
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:46,107
Angela is a nice girl but you
gotta plough some fucking fields.

104
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,979
Do ya hear me ya fucking fruitcake

105
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,877
-He is a great kid.
-Yeah, he is

106
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:40,150
Hello? Hi.  I didn't expect to see you
Come on!

107
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:42,983
-Howard
-Yeah

108
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:46,881
There's plenty of food.

109
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:51,725
-I like your hair, Jakie.
-Thank you.

110
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,678
-You look handsome with a little hair
-Thank you.

111
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,384
-How is going on with the job?
-I had a lot of sales.

112
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:05,253
Busy, everything's going really... great

113
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,456
How is your mother?

114
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,252
Wonderful. Thank you.

115
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,170
-Tell her I said hello
-And Wanda?

116
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,023
She's fine and err...
could I talk to you for a second. . ?

117
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:19,104
Yeah.  Sure.

118
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,001
Excuse us.

119
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,276
I need to borrow money.

120
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:39,079
-I thought we'd talked about this.
-Yeah.

121
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,030
You haven't paid me back for the last time.

122
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,300
I know.  I'm sorry.

123
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,772
It's not the money,
you know that don't you, son?

124
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:49,446
I just can't keep bailing you
out all the time.

125
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,656
I know. Do you...

126
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:55,554
You think I would fucking be here is
this wasn't the last stop on earth?

127
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,133
How much?

128
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:06,032
$800.

129
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:10,131
-What is going on?
-Dec wants to borrow money.

130
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:12,894
How many times are we going to do this, Bud
The kid comes in here, stoned out of his mind

131
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:16,120
and you keep throwing money at him because
you don't want to deal with it.

132
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:19,269
I'm working.

133
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,065
I have a job
I'll pay you back.

134
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,992
No. No, I can't do it, son.

135
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:27,500
Right. Sorry. Go back to
your perfect little family.

136
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,314
-That that's not fair.
-Don't touch me

137
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,938
Hey. Can I come with you?

138
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:49,837
No, kid.  Not tonight.
I've got some shit to do.

139
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,627
Are you ok?
Are you alright?

140
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,545
Yeah.

141
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:58,380
Okay. Well, page me later.

142
00:12:58,814 --> 00:13:01,740
-Yeah. Yeah
-OK

143
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:05,638
-I love you.
-Yeah.

144
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,025
Punk ass bitches

145
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,116
Look at those fucking stupid fucks

146
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:27,855
With their fucking guns and
their fucking gold chains.

147
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:30,911
-They're nothing-Worthless
-Shit

148
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:35,590
The only thing those mother fuckers
are shooting are music videos, dog.

149
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:37,641
-That's what I am saying
-The same thing

150
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:41,540
-That's what I am saying, dog
-That's what I am talking about

151
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:47,424
-Now I am feeling it.
-Now you're feeling it?

152
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:52,235
-Now I am feeling it.
-No Shit!

153
00:13:53,117 --> 00:13:57,015
-Don't want that shit. No

154
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,901
Dance! Dance!

155
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:13,382
You wanna call me out?!
You wanna call me out?!

156
00:14:13,383 --> 00:14:15,364
-OK. I'll call you out
-Shit

157

163
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,674
You can't dance, bitch!

164
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:46,572
Come here.

165
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:02,018

166
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,066
Will ya get a beer?

167
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,212

168
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,200
Don't worry, Angie.

169
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:10,124

170
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,855
-Run, bitch!
-I'm thirsty

171
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:16,753
Look at that slave-ass mother-fucker
<i>"I got it, Johnny"</i>

172
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,740
He's like a spook, man.

00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,755

175
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,730
Mother-fucker!

176
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:29,628
Johnny, yeah I loves him a lot.

177
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:33,565
I owe him a lot.

178
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,352
I do.

179
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:37,433
No, no, no, no.
I don't mean like that.

180
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:41,140
I mean you fucking <i>looooove</i> him.

181
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,375
-You'd fucking do anything for him.

182
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,590
If he asked you to sucks his cock,
you probably would.

183
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:49,713
Shut the fuck up.

184
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,541
No, no, no.
Tell the truth, Elvis!

185
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:57,375
Tell me you wouldn't drop to your fucking
knees and suck Johnny's cock in two
seconds if he asked?

186
00:15:57,484 --> 00:16:01,222
You give it a kiss on the tip....

187
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:04,083
-No, I wouldn't.
-You wouldn't?

188
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,285
-Johnny? Come on.
-Ahh, you see that?

189
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:12,015
Full on, dick in the mouth, balls across
the nose, dildo up the ass...

190
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,024
You're a faggot!

191
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,916
100 percent

192
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:19,841
Don't talk to me anymore, ok?
I fuck bitches.  You're a homo.

193
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:21,768
Don't!.  That's it.

194
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,695
Shut the fuck up!

195
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:26,613
-Suck my fucking cock!

196
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:29,474
I'm dead serious.

197
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:31,588
Suck it, bitch.

198
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:33,113
-Suck my fucking cock!
-The fucking door!

199
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:34,456
I got it.

200
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:35,906
Come on do it!

201
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:39,355
-I got it, alright?
-Suck my cock!

202
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:42,394
Pretty soon it is gonna come out, Elvis.

203
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:46,293
-You're gonna come out, Elvis.
-That you're fucking gay.

204
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,181
What's up, Jake?

205
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:51,041
Try calling a mother-fucker before
you just show up, ok?

206
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:53,091
You Jews just don't have no respect.

207
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:56,017
Can I speak to you for a minute?

208
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:58,812
Yes, it is Friday.
Let's go in here.

209
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:00,748
So, what's going on homie?

210
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:04,354
You know that thing I told you I was going
to take care of for you down in San Diego?

211
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:07,214
-Yeah
-It's a wash out

212
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:09,066
Really? What Happened?

213
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,214
Well.  I go down there and put the screws on him
and tell him something bad is gonna happen to him unless

214
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:15,205
he comes up with your money
and like . .  FAST...

215
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:18,074
Which he doesn't because he is fucking tacked.

216
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:21,972
But he is scared so he rings round his neighbour and
I'm walking the guy for a hundred and fifty bubs

217
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,746
So?

218
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:28,867
So, the bubs are no good
The X was fucking punk.

219
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:32,792
And I had a line to take it all, man. We would
have made so much money on that shit.

220
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:37,512
But you said that you would take care of it.
You said it was your debt.

221
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:39,467
-Are ya coming here trying to nigger talk me?
-Now, what could I do.

222
00:17:39,468 --> 00:17:42,458
I couldn't exactly go back to the guy I
ripped off and say 'you're shit was no good'.

223
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,472
Okay, but I still gotta get paid.

224
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:49,085
No.  Come the fuck down.
I got $800 here and I thought...

225
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,990
-that we could split it
-You thought we could split it?

226
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:56,113
Fuck that. You pay me!
All of it.

227
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:57,152
-I'm trying.
-How?

00:17:57,153 --> 00:17:59,851

00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,965
-Be careful Johnny. I'm not fucking Elvis.

232
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,633

Shut up!

252
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,586
What's going on?

253
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,434
-Who's there?
-It's Zack.

254
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:12,332
-Who? It's fucking midnight.
-It's me, Zack.

255
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,520

Heil, sir.

259
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:39,771
-Do you want a drink?
-Yeah.

260
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:46,501
...and she is always telling
me what to do

261
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:50,373
...like, what clothes to wear and what girls
she thinks are pretty...

262
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,518
Like, I couldn't fucking figure
it out for myself.

263
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,218
That's you're Mom.
It's Olivia.

264
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:58,241
Come on.  She loves you
You're her baby.

265
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:00,255
Yeah. I know.

266
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:03,247
It's embarrassing

267
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:06,141
Do you know that we have
"home work parties"?

268
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:10,040
-What?
-Homework parties with little hats.

269
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,503

270
00:21:14,454 --> 00:21:16,373
Yeah.

271
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,111
Another thing...

272
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,200
I was sleeping, right...

273
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:25,911
...and she'll wake me up
by looking at me.

274
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,999
Like, I open my eyes and she'll be right there
looking at me, like...

275
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,356
Fucking 'A'

276
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:38,255
It's god damn creepy you know.
Like she is in love with me
and breathing on me

277
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:39,273
You're lucky, you know that?

278
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:43,171
I mean, my Ma she never...

279
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:49,084
...boohoo of me.

280
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, I know.

281
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:51,999
But...

282
00:21:52,954 --> 00:21:54,878
I would trade you.

283
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:56,869
I gotta get out.

284
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,768
I gotta smoke.

285
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:05,534
Well...

286
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:08,494
...look at the boy Zackie, all grown up.

287
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:12,392
Is that one header or stress weed?

288
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:17,269
Shut up.

289
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:29,915
Take a drink!

290
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:35,800
Like a pro.

291
00:22:57,163 --> 00:23:00,219
One minute.

292
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,079
-It is Olivia.
-No, no fucking...

293
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,977
Alright...

294
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:17,775
Yeah he's here.

295
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:19,570
No, we're talking.

296
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:21,489
I said we are talking.

297
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,387
Don't get you're panties all in a waddle
I'll drive him home later.

298
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:31,232
Yes, I do know what time it is.
Thank you.

299
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:31,233

300
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:35,396
Yeah, okay

301
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:38,289
Okay.  Alright!

302
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:42,187
You've gotta get home.

303
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,855
-No.
-Wait, stop.

304
00:23:45,703 --> 00:23:49,600
Tonight, we ride.

305
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:53,567
Shit.

306
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:56,000
Let's go.

307
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,880
Jake... hey, Jake.

308
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:01,805
-Am I fine?
-Yes sir

309
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,983
-Am I fine?
-You're the best.

310
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,706
-Yeah?
-hmmm.

311
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:07,592
No, you're the best.

312
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:15,493
You wanted him.
You got him.

313
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:17,443
Bye.

314
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:21,342
You're a real son of a bitch, you know that?

315
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:26,283
Let's go.

316
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,858
I was fucking my dog, and...

317
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,875
No, no, listen.

318
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:46,400
Look at the ass of that one

319
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,450
I could crack it open like a peach.

320
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:52,090
You fucking kidding me?

321
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,613
You are a fucking dinosaur , Cosmos.

322
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:59,512
Come on! You're dead.
You can't do anything.

323
00:25:00,394 --> 00:25:02,539
Ya balls are all wrinkled up.

324
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,230
What?

325
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,441
What? You deaf fucker
I said you're old.

326
00:25:06,442 --> 00:25:09,334
I'd knocked the bottom outta her.

327
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:13,231
You don't even know where the bottom is.
You don't know what to do.

328
00:25:14,017 --> 00:25:15,219
Hey, waitress.

329
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,117
-What can I do for you?
-What have you got in mind?

330
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:22,826
Just get another round of drinks.

331
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:25,654
-You haven't finished the last one.
-I didn't ask you that.

332
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:28,645
-Just get us some more fucking drinks.
-Get us some drinks, bitch

333
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,407
I pay. Hey, I got it.

334
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,464
-You got it hey?
-Yeah

335
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:42,362
It's a special occasion

336
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:49,095
-Come on, Cosmos, let's go.
-Come on!

337
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:52,994
Johnny, watch yourself.

338
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:57,870
-Say Jake that we stopped by.
-Oh! I will.

339
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:09,509
When I told Jake what happened he fucking
flipped out and I had to calm him down.

340
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:12,665
He's gonna kill Johnny. Jake's like that.
He is a very passionate person.

341
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:17,477
But I told him: if you're gonna do something
you've gotta fucking hit him where it hurts.

342
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:21,216
Johnny had a class storm
I mean two of the quantities

343
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:23,322
...he was trying to collect on
the insurance money...

344
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:28,109
Jake comes in. Salts the whole fucking deal.

345
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,133
Sharon's company catches wind of it

346
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:33,050
They don't pay out.

347
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,943
Cost Johnny 30, 000 dollars.

348
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:38,870
'cause Johnny had to retaliate...
It's fucking business.

349
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,706
Mr. Johansson wants to see you.

350
00:26:42,707 --> 00:26:44,730
Want to see me?

351
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,628
Sit down!

352
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:55,418
What's up Pete?

353
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,336
You're probation officer called.

354
00:26:57,337 --> 00:27:00,393
Mr. Lampington?
It thought he was out of town.

355
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:03,319
Yeah, well I talked to him.

356
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,048
He said you've been getting
into trouble again.

357
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:08,975
Breaking into houses. .
Using drugs... speed mainly.

358
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:09,113
It's not true.

359
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:11,563
-Yeah, it is.
-No, it's not.

360
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,860
Pete, I swear to God.

361
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:18,901
Dude. Dude!
It's.... .

362
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,450
I feel you.
I'm right here...

363
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,089
Don't look at me that way.
I'm telling you the fucking truth.

364
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,169
I'm totally fucking straight, man.

365
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,056
I mean I'm a litt...
Mr. Lampingtons' so full of shit...

366
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:32,954
He's outta fucking town
How would he know what I am doing?

367
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,891
You disappoint me.

368
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:40,789
Pete.

369
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,774
-Pete, I swear to fucking God
-Need you to take a drugs test.

370
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,522
Pete, come on...

371
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:49,504
I need the job.

372
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:52,301
-I really need this job.
-Fill it up.

373
00:27:52,302 --> 00:27:55,324
I need this fucking job.

374
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:56,429
Fuck you!

375
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,389
-Fuck off!
-No.

376
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,152
Get the fuck outta here.

377
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:05,923
You're fired
Get out!

378
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:08,069
Don't come back in here.

379
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,987
Get the fuck outta here.

380
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,791
I will take a gun to your fucking head.

381
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,689
I will take you to hell with me.

382
00:28:26,028 --> 00:28:28,075
Do you want to play some (?), Truelove?

383
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:31,974
Let's play some fucking games.

384
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:45,625
You called my PO (probation officer)
You called Mr. Lampington?

385
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:52,534
Mother-fucker!

00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:04,205

388
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,967
-Check the bathroom.

389
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:12,999
Jake.

390
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,982
Truelove.

391
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,868
-Shit, look at his fucking TV.
-Fuck the TV

392

<i>The neighbourhood is safe again</i>

00:30:36,672 --> 00:30:37,873
Ohh. What the fuck, dude?

-Moving?
-God damn right!

404
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:45,050
Too many assholes know where I live.

Did ya see this?

406

Holy Shit.

407
00:30:52,622 --> 00:30:55,515
Johnny, what happened, man?

408
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:59,414
Came home last night...
My windows busted and my TV's missing

409
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:01,679
-Fuck, right?

00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:03,663
Crac

Fucking crack head Mazursky took a

427
00:31:51,455 --> 00:31:54,348

There aren't even any fucking lights on.

00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:16,143
How can the lights be on?
It's the middle of the fucking day

447
00:33:19,008 --> 00:33:20,146
What the fuck are we doing?

448

449
00:33:35,654 --> 00:33:37,669
-What are you doing?
-I'm kidding.

450
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,594
Well stop fucking around.

Manny Ramirez, mother-fucker

456
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,000
You guys are fucking idiots.

457

Ooh, Jesus! Make more noise!

458
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:15,067
He's 15. Remember when you were 15?

459
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:18,025
For once in your life,
your tennis match will wait.

460
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:21,924
Why do you have to be such a fucking
pussy? What are you thinking?

461
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:24,722
-What are you getting crazy about?
-I am not crazy...

462
00:34:24,723 --> 00:34:26,746
If you were ever here, you
might notice that.

463
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:29,770
Great! Let's just let him turn
out like the other...

464
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:33,770
Like what, Olivia.  Like Who?
Say it! Like Jake?

465
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:37,512
Hey.  What's going on?

466
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:44,902
Come here.

467
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:54,508
Your Mother found this in your room.

468
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:54,998
It's a pipe

469
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:57,047
I know what it is. It's a bone.
Want to tell me about it?

470
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:58,770
-No
-You smoking pot?

471
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,753
-No
-Now look at me, we have to talk.

472
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:02,898
-I don't want to fucking talk.
-We that's too bad.  Sit down!

473
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:05,630
Dad! I just fucking woke up.

474
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:08,621
God Damn! Wait 'till I put
some fucking clothes on.

475
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:11,677
God! Fucking dick!

476
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,340
Yes, we should punish him.
Do something for God's sake.

477
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:29,981
You never do anything.

478
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:32,159
Zack come down here!

479
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,458
Zack.

480
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:01,540
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-What?
-That's his brother.

481
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:02,613
Pull over!

482
00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:07,376
Hey, what's up?
Come here!

483
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:09,359
Come here, fuck-face.

484
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,183
What the fuck are you running for?

485
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:18,049
Come on, let's go.

486
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,169
What the fuck you want?
I didn't do anything.

487
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,067
Shut the fuck up and get in, Bitch.

488
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,355
Fucking idiot.

489
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,364
Just take him to your place.

490
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:54,258
I can't take him to my place.
My Dad's there.

491
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:56,208
I thought you said he was cool?

492
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:59,167
Bitch, he is cool, but you didn't
tell me we would be bringing
along a fucking hostage.

493
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:01,832
He is not a hostage, alright?

494
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,076
I told you I don't know what I
am doing right now, alright?

495
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:06,974
-I'm thinking.
-Well, think!

496
00:37:08,889 --> 00:37:11,787
Hey, we've got to take him some place.

497
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:17,666
Alright.  I know somewhere we can go.

498
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,584
But you have got to be fucking cool.

499
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:33,033
What is there?

500
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,025
-Hey, what's up, man?
-Chucky

501
00:37:36,026 --> 00:37:38,820
-A lot of dudes, bro.
-I know that.

502
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:42,719
Bring 'em in.

503
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:44,770
Hey, Chuck.  This is Truelove;
the guy I was telling you about.

504
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:46,300
Hey, what's up, man?

505
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,880
Do you have a room we can use?

506
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:50,700
-A room?
-Yeah

507
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,756
Yeah, I've got one down to the left.

508
00:37:53,757 --> 00:37:56,655
Thanks

509
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:07,346
So, what's up, man?

510
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,231
We're just chilling, man.

511
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:13,130
-Getting high, getting ready to go to fiesta.
-Smoking weed.

512
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:14,600
Thanks, man.

513
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:19,500
So, how you been?

514
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:23,558
Been good. Chilling, ripping
waves, hanging out.

515
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,550
What the fuck is going on back there?

516
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:31,032
Do you want me to go check it out?

517
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:35,060
Yeah, I mean, 4 dudes I have never
met are in my fucking bedroom.

518
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,596
Give me the tape!

519
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:47,630
What the fuck are you doing, man?

520
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:54,440
Are you nuts, you can't do that.
You guys are out of your fucking mind.

521
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:55,991
-What the hell is this?
Who the fuck are you?
-Shut up

522
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:58,136
Hey Chucky, they got a kid tied
up in your room.

523
00:38:58,137 --> 00:39:00,021
-Calm down
-He's a kid

524
00:39:00,022 --> 00:39:02,981
-Johnny is just a little crazy right now.
-A little crazy right now?

525
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:05,939
We stole this kid...

526
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,857
I thought I told you to shut your mouth?

527
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:09,840
And you: Mind your fucking business.

528
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:12,669
Mind my business?
This is my fucking house.

529
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:16,567
Frankie, you better put your boy in check.
Tell him what fucking time it is.

530
00:39:16,636 --> 00:39:19,464
-Like that huh?
-Just like that, bitch.

531
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:22,357
I get it. Hey, Lump...
Let's get out of here.

532
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:24,340
I'm going to fucking fiesta...

533
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:28,239
when I get back, none of you
Mother-fucker better be here.

534
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:32,013
-Let's get out of here girls.
-Let's go!

535
00:39:32,014 --> 00:39:33,911
Fucking shit-head.

536
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:39,756
Chucky, man... I'm really sorry
about all this, bro.

537
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:55,519
What's going on?
Why aren't you guys ready.

538
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,535
What are we going to do with the kid, man?

539
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:59,257
Who cares.

540
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:03,316
Leave him in the fucking closet.
Pick him up then. I don't give a fuck.

541
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:08,166
Johnny, I have a date back in the valley.

542
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:11,027
I have to get back, man.

543
00:40:11,028 --> 00:40:12,197
Me too.

544
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:14,896
You've just remembered now, huh?

545
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:16,098
-Yeah
-Yeah, man.

546
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,960
My girl gets mad if I don't fuck her.

547
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:22,858
You pussies wanna go home?
Fine! Take the fucking van.

548
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:25,722
Listen! You don't have to do that.

549
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,615
You can put me in a fucking closet.
I'm not going to run anyway.

550
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:32,386
Do me a favour: Shut up, before I
shut you the fuck up.

551
00:40:32,387 --> 00:40:36,285
Why is this mother-fucker talking anyway?
I thought we taped him up?

552
00:40:36,354 --> 00:40:40,252
He couldn't breathe.

553
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:44,956
Just drop me off on the strip.
I'm going to fucking fiesta.

554
00:40:44,957 --> 00:40:47,100
I'm not going to let this little
mother-fucker spoil my weekend.

555
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:51,418
-What about me?
-No

556
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,466
-No, what?
-He stays with you.

557
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:56,458
-What?
-I said fucking queer as a deaf mother-fucker

558
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,474
-Why me, dude?
-Because I fucking said so.

559
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:00,424
Don't fuck around man.

560
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:03,123
I can't fucking take him to my
Dad's house like that.

561
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:06,016
Well then, untie him, genius!
You heard the kid...

562
00:41:06,017 --> 00:41:07,251
-You aren't running are you?
-What?

563
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:09,071
No.

564
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:14,320
Go home, tell Juergen that he's your new little
butt buddy and he is spending the night.

565
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,100
Meanwhile, I'll talk to Mazursky.

566
00:41:19,264 --> 00:41:21,561
He must be going crazy, right now.

567
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,106
Hey, what's going on?

568
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:31,064
It's a mad house.

569
00:41:31,065 --> 00:41:33,000
Your brother is scaring the shit
out of all of us.

570
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:34,546
Did they call the friends?

571
00:41:34,547 --> 00:41:37,244
Maybe he has a girl?

572
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,143
We tried everything. Friends,
cops, hospitals... nothing. .

573
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:44,234
Don't you think the kid is out
just fucking around?

574
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,192
I mean you can't keep the kid
locked in the house forever

575
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:50,184
Maybe, I don't know.

576
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:53,034
We did have an argument this morning.

577
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,050
OK, well that's what it is then, right?

578
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:56,371
I hope so.

579
00:41:56,372 --> 00:41:59,135
-Well, what do you think?
-I don't know.

580
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:01,247
But...

581
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:05,146
We can't rule anything out.

582
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:10,966
I'll have to ask you a few questions, ok?

583
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:15,650
Do you know anyone who
would want to hurt Zack?

584
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:18,739
-No.
-You?

585
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,509
-Me what?
-You've a beef with anyone
I oughta know about?

586
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,600
That person you owe money to?

587
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,861
You owe somebody money?

588
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:29,759
Jesus! Just tell me how much and
I will write the cheque.

589
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:32,753
-It is not really like that, Olivia.
-Really? What's it like?

590
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:36,652
Tell me what it's like, god damn you!

591
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,483
Fuck. Bring him back.
Please relax.

592
00:42:39,484 --> 00:42:43,382
Bring him back!

593
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:47,380
Back here!

594
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:50,439
I am going to find him.
I promise you.

595
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,308
I promise.

596
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:58,207
I will find him.

597
00:42:59,154 --> 00:43:00,650
Where are you going?

598
00:43:08,039 --> 00:43:08,950
Where's Johnny?

599
00:43:09,202 --> 00:43:11,185
Don't know Dog, is he here?

600
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:14,273
-That is what I am asking you <i>dog</i>
-Excuse me. We were talking.

601
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:17,980
Klemash, where the fucking kid?
I ain't seen him, dude.

602
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:20,500
What the fuck is that?. . Behind your back
when you turn away from me?

603
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:22,725
-What's the problem here?
-Shut your big ass

604
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,894
Don't touch her!

605
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:27,793
Asshole!

606
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:58,809
If anybody sees...
Johnny Truelove...

607
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,828
Tell him that Jake Mazursky
is looking for him.

608
00:44:05,718 --> 00:44:07,615
Thank you.

609
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,791
Back the fuck off me, man?
I am informing you.

610
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,690
-I want a beer. Do you want one?
-Yeah, sure.

611
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:03,097
Here you go.

612
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:06,210
-Cigarette?
-No. I don't smoke.

613
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:10,109
Fuck that! It's good for you.

614
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:28,708
Hey, man...

615
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:31,634
...what if I said; you could walk
over there right now...

616
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:35,437
...jump on a bus, catch a ride home...

617
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:38,461
I turned my back and tell Truelove...

618
00:45:38,462 --> 00:45:41,355
...you fucking ran away or something...

619
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:45,252
What do you think about that?

620
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,138
I don't know, Frankie.  I mean...

621
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:56,195
I don't wan to cause any problems
for my brother, you know?

622
00:45:56,196 --> 00:46:00,093
So I think; I'm just going to ride it out.
See what happens

623
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:03,836
Alright?

624
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:04,940
Alright.

625
00:46:04,941 --> 00:46:08,839
Right.

626
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:27,741
Dad.

627
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:34,503
Frankie?

628
00:46:35,514 --> 00:46:37,464
Good to see you, boy...

629
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:40,163
-My little son loves his dad.
-Don't.

630
00:46:45,462 --> 00:46:49,360
Let's go to bed.

631
00:46:50,177 --> 00:46:54,074
I love you.

632
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:11,496
-I want you to meet...
-Alright

633
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,292
-Hi.
-Hi.

634
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:17,153
Give the kid a kiss
Dad!

635
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:24,014
Dad, No...
Leave me be.

636
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:26,094
Come on, smoke with your old man.

637
00:47:26,095 --> 00:47:27,817
-Have a drink?
-No

638
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:29,768
Something?
No. Come on.

639
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:32,726
Who is your little friend?
Are you babysitting?

640
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:33,595
Fuck you.

641
00:47:36,596 --> 00:47:38,643
Use the sofa.

642
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,543
Wake up.

643
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,500
Come on you've got chores to do.
Let us go!

644
00:48:11,992 --> 00:48:14,085
-Hello
-I fucking hear you

645
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:17,464
There's coffee but Bessy got up late so
I need you to straighten up the house.

646
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:19,480
I'm supposed to clean up after your party?

647
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:22,503
I know I moan like a bitch.
Don't argue with me. I am in no mood.

648
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:26,177
Look, I came home yesterday and
your shit is all over the house.

649
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:29,233
We had a deal remember?
Get a job, pay rent...

650
00:48:29,234 --> 00:48:31,281
Alright! Fuck!
Get out of my room!

651
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:33,617
Nice fucking mouth.

652
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:37,880
Fucking dick.

653
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,779
Hey. Don't worry about it.
I'll help you with the work.

654
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:45,716
Juergen is botanical. He grows
everything we eat right here.

655
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:48,675
Tomato, cucumbers, corn.

656
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,503
Fucking spices and shit.

657
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:54,526
Fucker is a full blown alcoholic,
smokes like a chimney...

658
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,425
...but, Goddamn, if we don't eat healthy.

659
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,483
Look at this shit right here.

660
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:04,183
Daddy's pride and joy.

661
00:49:04,184 --> 00:49:08,081
Cause the greedy bastard will smoke 'em
all but it's Frankie's job to take care of them.

662
00:49:08,247 --> 00:49:12,051
Water them, throw some egg shells
on them every now and then.

663
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:13,156
Well fuck it

664
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:17,054
Let's get to work.

665
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:31,957
Shit. I'll be right back.

666
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:40,828
-Hey Girl!
-What's going on?
-Nothing. Working.

667
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:42,844
Are you guys coming over?
You got that shit?

668
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:44,762
You know I do.

669
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:45,867
Mom.  I'm going to Frankie's.

670
00:49:45,868 --> 00:49:48,631
-Did you talk to him?
-It's all good.

671
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:52,402
-When will you be home?
-I don't know. Late probably.

672
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:56,494
Darling, can you stay with Julie
and Sabrina tonight? It's your father
and my anniversary

673
00:49:57,344 --> 00:49:59,294
Anniversary!

674
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,156
-You gonna have a little sex or some...?
-That's disgusting.

675
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:04,106
Whatever! I'm interested.

676
00:50:04,107 --> 00:50:07,259
I mean, really, are you going to go down on him?

677
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,023
-Give him a little tube stick boogie?
-No!

678
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:12,169
Oh come on! Live a little.

679
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,899
You guys have been married what. .
...500 years?

680
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,005
Keith Straten! I will knock the
shit out of you, you little skunk!

681
00:50:18,867 --> 00:50:20,817
OK We're leaving.

682
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,716
Get your keys? Lets go get
Sabrina and Julie.

683
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,070
Yo! Youngblood.  Come here, man.

684
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:50,142
Ladies...

685
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:52,937
Dick Wad, Fuckweed

686
00:50:52,938 --> 00:50:53,946
Susan.
Hi.

687
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:56,710
Sabrina, Julie,

688
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:59,700
Dick Wad

689
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:01,781
OK.  OK, let's go smoke some
fucking weed, man!

690
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:04,512
But, hey, listen.
No-one messes up my shit, alright?

691
00:51:04,513 --> 00:51:08,410
This house ain't never been
so fucking clean

692
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,313
You fucking blow this game.

693
00:51:16,314 --> 00:51:18,427
I don't fucking blow. You just died, man.

694
00:51:18,428 --> 00:51:22,325
-I thought I was the other guy.
-That's me.

695
00:51:24,117 --> 00:51:26,099
I thought I was playing the other dude.

696
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:43,526
-Suck my balls!
-Fuck you. Suck my balls, man

697
00:51:43,527 --> 00:51:45,425
You suck it bitch.

698
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:49,410
So, how old are you?

699
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:51,096
How old do I look?

700
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:52,979
About 12.

701
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,178
Well, I am 17, but I do look really young.

702
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:01,111
I am going to kill your ass, kill your ass.

703
00:52:01,115 --> 00:52:03,400
-Stop the game.
-No! Go answer your phone.

704
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:05,756
Suck it!
Suck it!

705
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:07,641
Fuck you

706
00:52:07,642 --> 00:52:09,626
Yo Johnny! What's up?
Did you talk to anybody?

707
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,445
<i>-Not yet, why?</i>

708
00:52:11,446 --> 00:52:13,461
Look, man, I can't keep the
kid here much longer.

709
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:16,356
<i>-Why? What up?</i>
-Nothing, just having some people over.

710
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:18,370
<i>-Who?</i>
-Nobody. Shut up

711
00:52:18,371 --> 00:52:20,321
Nobody, just some people.

712
00:52:20,322 --> 00:52:23,246
Chill Out, dog!

713
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:26,076
<i>-Get them the fuck out of there. </i>

714
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:27,974
Alright, alright, I'll clear it up.

715
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,610
I need you to do a favour for me, bro.

716
00:52:33,345 --> 00:52:37,241
Johnny is coming and I need the house.
Will you watch the kid for me for a little while?

717
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:39,098
Watch him?
Keep an eye on him, no phones...

718
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:40,998
...and no leaving him alone.

719
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:43,304
No phones?

720
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:45,586
I don't get it.

721
00:52:46,537 --> 00:52:50,434
Alright, look, if I tell you something
can you keep your fucking mouth shut?

722
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:54,176
Yeah, 'course, man.
Yeah.

723
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:57,199
The kids brother owes Truelove money...

724
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,098
...and Johnny's holding him like a
marker or something until he gets paid
