1
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,682
Where are you?

2
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,620
Oh, yeah.
All right, all right, later.

3
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,053
You all right, Alisa?

4
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,783
You girls coming
to my party, yeah?

5
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,484
It's gonna be wicked,
everyone's gonna be there.

6
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,004
So, I was, like, Listen, yeah, brush
your teeth after you lick me out...

7
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,739
don't try and kiss me,
you get me?

8
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,707
- That's proper grimy.
- I know, proper ghetto.

9
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,034
Moony's buff, you know.

10
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,608
- Have you got a spare cigarette?
- No, I'm giving up.

11
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:24,246
Shaneek and Carleen are over there.
They're watching us.

12
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,579
Did you finish the coursework
for them?

13
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,845
No.

14
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,452
Katie!

15
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,592
You girls gotta come to my party.
It's gonna be heavy.

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,058
- Who's gonna be there?
- Everyone's coming.

17
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,823
Mum and dad are away,
so anything goes.

18
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,397
Anything.

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,527
- Please come.
- Safe, yeah?

20
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,197
Hey, pussyhole,
seen Claire around?

21
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,405
You like this,
isn't it, Charlotte?

22
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,313
Why you calling me that?
You know my name's Claire.

23
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,716
So that if anyone else hears, they don't
think that you're, you know, Sam's girl.

24
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,784
- You scared of him, Jay?
- Of Sam? No.

25
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,866
All right, girls.
Wanna come to my party?

26
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:24,399
Are you gonna come? Surely your mum
can low you, it's Friday night.

27
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,009
I don't know,
I'm not feeling too good.

28
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,771
And I ain't got nothing to wear.

29
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,352
Okay, if I score some money to get us
something to wear, will you come?

30
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,946
- Where you gonna get that much money?
- Don't watch that.

31
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,247
What go on, bitch?

32
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,085
- You seen Claire anywhere?
- No.

33
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,161
- What?
- No.

34
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,726
What the fuck you looking at,
you fat bitch? You know me?

35
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,990
Have you seen Claire?

36
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,228
Can't we kick, man?
I'm not your fucking security guard.

37
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,167
- Yes, Moony.
- Yo, Trife.

38
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,803
- Where you been, man?
- I had a couple things to do, man.

39
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:29,165
What's wrong with these batty holes,
man. Always fucking playing football.

40
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,468
Come in the class,
stinking it up afterwards.

41
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,543
Hey, just light the zoot, man.

42
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,539
Come on, Becky.
Let's go.

43
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,112
You know what? Them two girls
over there are fucking weird, blood.

44
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,191
I know. What the fuck
she's looking at, man?

45
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,221
How can you make her watch you
like that, blood?

46
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,223
See me now, if that was me,
I wouldn't have it.

47
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,991
You should spark
in her fucking face.

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,668
Yeah, you watch.
I'm gonna mash her up.

49
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,271
- Hey, come on, let's go, Jay.
- All right, man.

50
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,342
- Ring me tonight, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, course I will.

51
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,070
- Come on.
- Yes, man, there...

52
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,072
- and that Claire's pussy is live, man.
- You're gonna be late.

53
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,707
Let's get inside
before the second bell.

54
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,044
Come on.

55
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,520
Oi, Alisa's looking tit, boy.

56
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,019
Why you split up with her?

57
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,081
I don't know, man.
I dashed it, isn't it?

58
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,486
She just... I don't know.

59
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,753
- Boy, you're a fool, Trife man.
- Hey, fuck off, man.

60
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,329
You're brave, blood...
I would never leave that, man.

61
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,163
- I'd fuck that everyday.
- Everyday, blood, standard.

62
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,203
- What you talking about?
- Rub them titties all night, blood.

63
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,005
What you uniform pussyholes know about
titties and pussy and all them thing?

64
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,976
And what you doing chatting about Alisa?
I fucked that girl a few weeks ago, blood.

65
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,444
Everyday for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.

66
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,184
Think you're so bad, isn't it?

67
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,758
What did I tell you before, huh?
When I call you, you must come.

68
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,891
Beat her, Shaneek star.

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,869
- What did I tell you your name was?
- Big bird.

70
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,568
Leave me alone, please.

71
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,002
Get up.

72
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,567
Fucked her hard, blood,
you understand me?

73
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,405
Bareback, no rubber smutting.
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

74
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,945
- What you gonna do, man?
- Leave us alone, blood, man.

75
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,310
Who the fuck you talking to?
Hold this fool.

76
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,111
Low it, man, low it,
low it, low it, man.

77
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,288
What you got for me, blood?

78
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,653
- Got nothing, blood, man.
- What you got for me?

79
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,258
- Who you talking to?
- Got nothing man.

80
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,953
- Don't answer me back, bruv.
- Got nothing, man.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,923
Fuck you talking to, blood?

82
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,619
- Yeah, Tribal two.
- Hi, that's my sister's, blood, man.

83
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,924
Hey, leave him, blood.
Who told you to pick him up?

84
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,366
What you doing?

85
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,400
No-one fucking likes you,
virgin fool.

86
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,733
Didn't she tell you before?
Don't answer her back.

87
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,443
So what are you?
Slag then?

88
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,979
Go on, bitch,
tell everybody you're a virgin.

89
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,447
What?

90
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,012
Pick up my ring
and tell everyone you're a virgin.

91
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,747
Pick it up, man!

92
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,388
Well?

93
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,731
I'm a virgin.

94
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,136
You know what, blood. Hug him up like
the fucking batty hole you are.

95
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,364
Hug him up, blood!

96
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,404
Hey, what you doing, man?

97
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,540
What, you can't fuck with mans
your own age? You gotta trouble us?

98
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,306
Who the fuck you talking to?

99
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,848
Hey, where you going, blood?
Where you going?

100
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,112
Where you going?
Where?

101
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,189
Fucking idiot.

102
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,029
- Smack her up.
- Beat her up, Shaneek. Beat her!

103
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,071
Look at her just fucking
sitting there. Fool.

104
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,404
Go on, fuck off
and clean your duty self up, man.

105
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,479
And none of you lot better say nothing
or else you'll get the same...

106
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,538
as that bitch did
with her virgin self.

107
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,142
She ain't no virgin.

108
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,277
How the fuck would you know?

109
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,423
Because me and her fucked
the day I turned you down.

110
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,065
- Is there gonna be girls there, though?
- Yeah, Jay, everyone's coming.

111
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,106
Hey, don't be on no hype,
you know.

112
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,231
Trife.

113
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,777
- You reaching that?
- I don't know, man.

114
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,711
- Hey, what are you...
- Billy.

115
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,547
- Go on.
- What, you out of here, yeah?

116
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,248
- Safe.
- Bless, man.

117
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,739
Laters, Jay, man.
All right, Moon.

118
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,617
Hey, hey, wait up, wait up.

119
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,286
Don't say anything.
Hang on a minute.

120
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,387
- You all right?
- Yeah.

121
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,889
- Look, why aren't you speaking to me?
- I am, man.

122
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,559
You ain't chatted to me in, like,
three weeks.

123
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,433
I've been doing
better things, isn't?

124
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,267
- I need to speak to you about something.
- Come on, Alisa.

125
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:57,731
Call me later, yeah?

126
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,038
Listen, hear what, right.

127
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,708
If you say anything to your fucking dad,
I'll kill you, you understand?

128
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,039
I can make things so easy for you,
you know that?

129
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,017
- Hi, poppet.
- Hey.

130
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,472
Who's that boy you were with?

131
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,641
I thought maybe
it was the one from before.

132
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,279
No, I fell.
He was helping me up.

133
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,778
Oh, right. Only I saw him giving you
a peck on the cheek.

134
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,246
- I thought maybe it was him.
- No.

135
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,488
How was biology?

136
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,289
Katie?

137
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,522
Katie, what the hell's happened
to your face? Look at me.

138
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,857
I fell.

139
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,758
You all right?

140
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,566
Hello?
Yeah, I'm Dan Fineal.

141
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,004
Yeah, Arthur. No, you were supposed
to be there two hours ago, mate.

142
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,643
Trevor.

143
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,112
Get in.

144
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,092
School finish at four.
Why you take so long?

145
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,094
I had to chat to one girl,
isn't it?

146
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,598
This here is Andreas.

147
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:05,972
Nice to meet you, bruv.

148
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:09,271
- This is my nephew Trevor.
- Trife.

149
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,108
You have the thing?

150
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,115
You see...

151
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,659
if you don't drill
the replica good...

152
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,089
the bullet won't leave and pop!

153
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,465
Is it okay?

154
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,363
The last boy used to do this
for me, was shit.

155
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,466
Guns always used to blow up.

156
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,939
But this looks good.

157
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,443
But I will have to test it.
Saying?

158
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,719
So, listen, come see me
when you finish school tomorrow...

159
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,983
and we can discuss business,
all right?

160
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,486
- Cool.
- Yeah.

161
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,486
Now get out.

162
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,928
Me just a joke with you.

163
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,568
Me see you tomorrow, yeah?

164
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,134
- Don't be late, you know.
- I won't, I won't.

165
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,701
- Later.
- All right, Trevor.

166
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,009
My little gun driller.

167
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,612
Hi, Katie.

168
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,642
- Hi, love.
- Hi.

169
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,780
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's fine.

170
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,185
Oh, that.
She fell over at school.

171
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,663
Christ, Arthur's really fucked up
my day.

172
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,494
Under the seat.

173
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,481
Oh, shit.

174
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,092
Curtis, I've forgotten the change, man.
I've left it back at my place.

175
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,424
I'm really sorry. I'll bring it round
to yours later, yeah?

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,766
Fuck it, I fuck, I fucked up. Look,
take it back, we'll sort it out tomorrow.

177
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,803
Cool. Cool.

178
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,139
You sure?

179
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:25,837
Go on.

180
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,512
Cool. Cheers, man.

181
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,280
- See you tomorrow.
- Cool, man. Cheers.

182
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,292
I think she's being bullied
at school.

183
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,556
- Did she say that?
- No. But...

184
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,629
Well, don't worry about it.
She's a bright kid, she'd tell us.

185
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,058
Have you seen
my address book anywhere?

186
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,063
Don't worry about it?
What sort of thing is that to say?

187
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,394
Aren't you worried about
your own daughter?

188
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,629
Have you asked her?

189
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,669
There you go.
She's fine.

190
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,921
Lenny, could you get your sister
to turn that shit off, please.

191
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,186
- It's been playing for ages.
- Doesn't bother me.

192
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,255
Fine.

193
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,417
Katie! Katie!

194
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,564
Katie! Katie!

195
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,292
Kat¡e!

196
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,790
We are number one for h¡p-hop
and ¡n London.

197
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:30,387
And around the country, Sky D¡g¡tal,
Telewest and D¡g¡tal DAB Rad¡o.

198
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,963
B¡lly-Bob Thornton,
Angel¡na Jol¡e's ex-husband...

199
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,796
has sa¡d that she's not
that good ¡n bed.

200
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,562
Hey, mum, I got it, yeah.

201
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,604
- What go on, coz?
- Yes, blood.

202
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,211
- What's happening, man?
- Like the trim still, man.

203
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,542
- Hey, what you want, though?
- Hey, come say hello to my mum, blood.

204
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,952
- Morning, Jason.
- Morning, Mrs. Hector.

205
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,113
I hope you two boys use this day
to remember that poor girl...

206
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,349
and not for foolishness.

207
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,685
- Yes, mum.
- Course, Mrs. Hector.

208
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,193
Go on.

209
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,128
That's right, blood,
do what your mum says.

210
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,828
Shut up, man.

211
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,966
Yeah, blood...
school called here this morning.

212
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,702
Told my mum the whole year
had the day off.

213
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,444
- This is proper sad, man.
- I know, man.

214
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,842
I was just about to leave my yard,
like had my uniform on and everything.

215
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,053
Listen, blood, Sam and them girls
always picking on her.

216
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,189
Yeah, but Sam
troubles us too, blood...

217
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,248
and we ain't committing suicide
over it, are we?

218
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,089
If anyone should fucking die,
it's him man.

219
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,990
Can't believe someone
I pressed is dead.

220
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,357
So why didn't you tell me
then, man?

221
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,490
She asked me
not to say nothing, isn't it.

222
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,500
Thought people would call her
sket and thing.

223
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:46,431
Plus her dad caught us...
Hey, you got a zoot?

224
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,972
No, I got a roll up, though.
Jacked it off my mum.

225
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,975
Spark that, man.

226
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,249
Blood, weird thing is, though...

227
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,314
her dad came by late last night.

228
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,321
That's how I found out
she was dead.

229
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,860
In her suicide note, she said
something about Sam troubling her.

230
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,792
- But I was always nice to her.
- A note?

231
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,762
Well, did she mention me?

232
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,740
I never see you chat to her
anyway, man.

233
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,207
Blood, don't watch
what I do, man.

234
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,436
You ain't always with me, and
you never knew I pressed her either.

235
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,747
You come like some secret agent
or something, man.

236
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,237
Let me have two draw
of that, man.

237
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,511
Hey, listen bell Moony.
I wanna duck out quick.

238
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,085
The whole day?

239
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,213
Don't lie, blood.

240
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,992
Yeah, I'll have
to take a cab still.

241
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,897
Moons, just hurry up though, man.
All right, bless.

242
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,794
- Hey, blood, you see Katie, yeah?
- Yeah.

243
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,562
Do you reckon
she would have banged me, like?

244
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,034
No, man.

245
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,741
Why not?

246
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,577
I think I'm buff.

247
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,239
Blood, I beg you,
play the fucking game, man.

248
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,180
Oh, fuck's sake.

249
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,482
Hello?

250
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,052
- Yeah, who's that?
- It's me.

251
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,857
You didn't call me.

252
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,924
Did you hear?
Sad, isn't it?

253
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,936
- Look, what are you doing today?
- Gonna jam with Moons and Jay.

254
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,599
Might go up West End later.
Gotta check my uncle, why?

255
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,646
- No, just tell me now, man.
- I'd rather see you.

256
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,041
You don't need to see me,
you ain't my girl no more. What is it?

257
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,122
What the fuck do you mean
you're pregnant?

258
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,556
Oh, my days!

259
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,581
You can't be fucking pregnant. I thought
you'd get the morning after pill?

260
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,123
It's not just up
to the girls, you know.

261
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,226
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

262
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,991
I've been taking tests all week.

263
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,731
Look...

264
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,266
I want us to get back together.

265
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,235
Later, fuck that.
After you fucked Sam a few weeks ago?

266
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,673
Yeah, he told me he bare backed you.
That's even worse man.

267
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,813
- You never knew I knew that, did you?
- But we do know!

268
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,537
Hey, and don't bother trying
to explain, man.

269
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,550
You know what,
for all I know the baby's his.

270
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,618
Fact now that I think of it,
I know it is, and you know it too.

271
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,811
Yeah, blood, she's loose, man.
Cut her off, man.

272
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,353
What?
I slept with Katie last year.

273
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,927
Me and you weren't even together,
so fuck off!

274
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,725
Standard, blood. You get me. I told you
about that girl, man, she's a sket.

275
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,457
Pregnant, though.
It's a bit deep, still.

276
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,467
- So what you gonna do?
- I don't know, man.

277
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,230
Fuck it, it can't be mine.

278
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,275
I just don't need
this shit today.

279
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,578
So what, can man's come
and reach your uncle with you, blood?

280
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,813
No, I think he wants
to see me alone, still.

281
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,176
So, what did he say?

282
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,584
He said he's going out.

283
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,859
And that fucking Sam told him
we slept together.

284
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,754
So why didn't you tell him
what happened?

285
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,557
He didn't give me
a fucking chance.

286
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,361
You know what, yeah,
fuck him and this fucking baby.

287
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,604
- All right, girls?
- Mum, don't you knock?

288
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,295
Oi, none of your lip.

289
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,403
I know you're upset,
but that's no reason to be cheeky.

290
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,804
- Do you want a drink, Becky?
- No, thanks.

291
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,378
Right, I'm off to work.
Lis, I want you back by midnight.

292
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,550
- Oh, mum!
- One, then, on the dot.

293
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,886
And if you think you can't get back here
call your dad and he'll pick you up.

294
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,150
- All right?
- Okay.

295
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,114
Alis...

296
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,353
I know you're upset, but there's
nothing you could have done.

297
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,960
Now, I'm sad for
that other girl's parents...

298
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,829
but all that really matters
is that you're all right.

299
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,867
Are you all right?

300
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,571
I'm...

301
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,537
I'm fine.

302
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,572
Good.
See you later, darling.

303
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,282
- I love you, Lis.
- Love you.

304
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,181
Yo, D. Guess what, man,
I got the day off school.

305
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,518
And I'm going to that party
tonight as well.

306
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,562
Yeah, I know.
Your school belled a while ago.

307
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,024
Hi, Lenny.

308
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,160
I'm sorry about your sister, bro.

309
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,903
Tell your mate Trevor
I said thank you.

310
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:14,963
See you.

311
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,872
So, you gonna help me or what?

312
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,211
Yeah.

313
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,808
I still can't believe
Katie killed herself.

314
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,183
So, what do you wanna do?

315
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,721
You know what...

316
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,582
I wanna get fucked up.

317
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,056
I wanna go shopping for tonight,
that'll make me feel better.

318
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,752
And if Trife don't want me,
I'm sure someone else will.

319
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,898
I meant about the baby.

320
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,668
Lose it, if I'm lucky.

321
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,836
Well, at least
you're thinking straight.

322
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,738
We've got the whole day off,
we might as well do something...

323
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,407
constructive with ourselves.

324
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,534
I know where we can score
some wicked draw.

325
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,341
I'd get so fat if I kept this.

326
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,143
Taxi!

327
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,609
What the fuck, man?

328
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,560
What's fucking taking him
so long, man?

329
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,326
Taxi!

330
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,127
Fuck off!

331
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,936
Fucking hell, man!

332
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,402
Come on.

333
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,270
Fuck, man.

334
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,985
Look at this girl's pussy. Looks like
her guts are hanging out and shit.

335
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,614
Man, that's nasty, man.
I hate that shit, ugly pussy.

336
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,119
- Still poke it, though.
- No, that's not for me, star.

337
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,987
I won't fuck no girl, yeah,
unless she's got a DV?

338
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,625
DV?

339
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,933
Designer vagina, man.
Neat tucked in lips and shit.

340
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,161
It's the way forward, blood.

341
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,463
So, who's this guy again?

342
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,208
Rupert. I met him at some rave.
He gives me weed and shit for free.

343
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,903
Is it? Safe.

344
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,015
Finally.

345
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,712
Let's roll, man.

346
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,287
Yes, Jay, what's cooking, bruv?

347
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,154
- Yeah, like the trim, rude boy.
- Bye, mum.

348
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,199
- What took you so fucking long, man?
- There weren't no cabs, isn't it.

349
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,935
I've been hav¡ng a good week, actually.
Come on ¡n.

350
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,472
So, Rebecca,
who's your lovely friend?

351
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,740
- I'm Alisa.
- Alisa? What a pretty name.

352
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,120
Ladies, this is my friend
Hamish.

353
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,417
Hi.

354
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:47,046
Go and take a seat on the sofa, take
your coats off, make yourselves at home.

355
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,158
How much do you want this time?

356
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,490
- As much as you wanna give.
- Not a problem.

357
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,500
But I want some E's today
and maybe some coke.

358
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,206
The weed I can do for free, but,
coke and E's is gonna cost.

359
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,441
I haven't got no money on me.

360
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,617
Who needs money?

361
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,931
- Get your knickers off then.
- In your fucking dreams.

362
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,809
- What, you're not gonna let me fuck you?
- No.

363
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,278
- What about a blow-job then?
- Fuck off.

364
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,245
- Wank?
- Keep talking and you'll get a smack.

365
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,048
Oh, come on, Al,
we'll make dollars when we sell it.

366
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,447
Do you wanna shop or what?

367
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,655
- Yeah, but...
- Stop being such a boring bitch then.

368
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,258
But I'm not gonna suck it, okay?

369
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,640
What is that?

370
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,874
- How old are you?
- I'm old enough, blood.

371
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,246
"Blood", you're too young
to buy these beers.

372
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:26,616
- What? Oh, shut up, man.
- Oi, come back.

373
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,451
- Come back!
- Come back or what, man? Shut your mouth.

374
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,355
- I'll have you arrested!
- You ain't gonna do shit, man.

375
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:34,499
- Get out of my shop.
- What?

376
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,568
- You're banned!
- Man, I'll leave when I wanna leave, man.

377
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,762
What? Come.

378
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,735
- Dickhead.
- Fuck off.

379
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:43,804
Bastard!

380
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,407
I ain't fucking with her no more, man,
after she got banged by Sam.

381
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,171
Fuck that, you get me?
She's any girl to me now. Fuck her.

382
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,978
Bloods, I wouldn't care whose baby
it is, yeah, but I'd still bang that.

383
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,657
Hey, bloods, where's yours?

384
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,492
Had to dash it at that guy,
isn't it, man.

385
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,255
- He was shook, though.
- You're a bad man.

386
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,586
Let's dust, man.

387
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,559
I ain't standing on the corner like
a fucking rent boy all day.

388
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,492
- So what, which way are we going, bruv?
- Let's roll this way, isn't it.

389
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,432
What's wrong, man?
What are you looking at?

390
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,633
Sam lives over there.

391
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,772
- You wanna get your GameBoy back?
- Yeah.

392
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,884
Yeah that, I'm on that, man,
let's do it. Come, come.

393
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,818
Let's not be stupid, man.

394
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,822
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Sam's gonna be at school, blood, yeah?

395
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,426
Only our year's got the day off.

396
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,627
We'll just go up there,
say we're his friends...

397
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,495
and we're picking it up,
isn't it? Simple.

398
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,665
Or, we ding the bell,
get through the main door...

399
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,400
and boot down his fucking
front door, isn't it.

400
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,970
No, man.
That's some police shit.

401
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,471
Look, blood, there's three
of us alie...

402
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,905
we'll just go up there, yeah,
ask for it back.

403
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,338
And if he's gets brave, blood, we'll
handle it at school together, isn't it.

404
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,000
- Standard, let's roll.
- But he rolls deep, man!

405
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,508
- Hey, fuck it, man, let's do it.
- Oh, shit.

406
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,118
What the fuck is he doing at home,
man? He's gonna kill us.

407
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,159
- Hey, don't worry, man, he's gone.
- What if he comes back, though, like?

408
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:12,955
He won't, man. What's wrong with you?
What you scared for, man?

409
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,089
I'm not, man.
I think we should just duck, man.

410
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,234
- Just shut up, man, you're scared.
- I'm not.

411
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,796
- Hello.
- Hi.

412
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:25,199
We're Sam's friends. We've just come
here to pick something up.

413
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,503
Sam's not here.
He's just gone to the shop for me.

414
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,409
Yeah, we saw him downstairs, he told
us to come up and wait for him.

415
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,277
He just left, right?

416
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,184
Hey, that must be his room.

417
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,293
- That's where your GameBoy is.
- Is that my GameBoy, bloods?

418
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,469
Oh shit, shit, oh shit.

419
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,433
What if he comes back now?

420
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,106
What the fuck
are you lot doing here?

421
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,037
Sam jacked my sister's GameBoy,
yeah, I'm just here to take it back.

422
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,508
- Hold this boy.
- Hey, Moons, hold him. Hold him, man.

423
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,214
He told me he bought that,
he's such an arsehole.

424
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,650
Yo, what's out there?

425
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,914
Balcony, where he stashes
his weed and shit.

426
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,050
Come and take this boy
outside, man.

427
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,755
If he's such an arsehole,
why are you with him?

428
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,857
I don't know, he's older,
more mature.

429
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,152
Then why you cheat him?

430
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,232
- Blood, you can't take his weed, man.
- Fuck that, man.

431
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,496
- Hey, Jay, man, we got him.
- Just give me one minute, man.

432
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,806
I don't even know
why you're with that boy, man.

433
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,967
Look...
you could be my girlfriend.

434
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,769
It's just, he sa¡d ¡f I leave h¡m,
he'll tell everyone I was a sh¡t fuck.

435
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,843
No, no, I know you're not shit,
I bet you're cold in bed, man.

436
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,210
I don't know...

437
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,954
He says I'm not that good
and I've only slept with him, so...

438
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,556
Yeah, well, let me be the judge
of that then, isn't it.

439
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,580
What?

440
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,616
- What, has he got any rubbers in here?
- Yeah, in that drawer. Why?

441
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,988
Not now, Jay, man, his mum said
he only went down the road.

442
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,027
- Maybe you lot should go.
- You know what, don't watch that, man.

443
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,281
Oh, no, no, no, low it, man.

444
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,982
- I'm sorry, yeah, this don't normally...
- It's okay.

445
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,624
It's because you're so buff,
yeah, and like you're good, man.

446
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:24,162
In fact, yeah, you should leave
that pussyhole and be my girlfriend.

447
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,398
- What do you think, yeah?
- What if he beats me up or something?

448
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,195
No, he ain't gonna do that.
Look, you know what, darling.

449
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,494
- Come with me. Come.
- Are you done?

450
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,966
- One minute.
- You fucking know about it.

451
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,242
You let the side down!

452
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,344
What's up, man? You don't even know
about sex live, man.

453
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,642
What the fuck you lot doing
in my yard?

454
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,642
Look, blood, you took
my GameBoy, man, I just...

455
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,876
Are you dizzy, blood? You're gonna
come up here like you're bad.

456
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,180
You see, yeah,
I'm gonna fuck you up, blood.

457
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,950
And you, see, you, Claire, I'm gonna
shove this bat so far up your pussy...

458
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,449
Shit.

459
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,525
Hey, fuck you, you fucking prick.

460
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,128
- Fucking idiot!
- Hold on, hold on, man.

461
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,626
Oh, shit!

462
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,035
Come on, lets go.

463
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,777
Run, blood!

464
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,465
I can't believe
what you lot just done.

465
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,139
Hey, fuck him, man,
he deserved it.

466
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,606
Hey, you know
he fucked Alisa, isn't it?

467
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,037
No, I didn't.

468
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,346
Sam's gonna kill me.

469
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,246
He ain't gonna do shit to you, man.
You know why?

470
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,938
Because you're my girl now,
you get me?

471
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,515
Yeah, man, let him come, man.
You see my uncle I'm checking today?

472
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,846
He's a proper bad man. And if Sam
thinks about doing anything...

473
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,714
my uncle will murk him
on the spot, standard.

474
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,154
You keep talking about your uncle
that's gonna do this and that, yeah?

475
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,826
But we ain't even met him, man.
I mean, what...

476
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,563
are you sure my man
even exists, like?

477
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,365
He comes like the invisible man
or something, blood.

478
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,560
- Yeah. Hollow Man, rude boy.
- I'll slap you, you know that, Moons?

479
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,166
Just wait till we need him
and he'll be here.

480
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,201
If he's there, I'm there. I'll jook
some up, blood. I don't business.

481
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,203
Shut up, Moons man,
you ain't gonna do shit, man.

482
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,646
I can't believe you swallowed
that guy's spunk.

483
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:24,582
I hate it, it tastes like
salty egg whites.

484
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,846
Yuk, but what
if he's got something?

485
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:30,355
You can't catch nothing like that.
All the acids in your stomach kill it.

486
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,687
- Did you like wanking that guy?
- No.

487
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,448
Was you wet?

488
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,819
- Yeah, a little bit.
- A little bit?

489
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:40,361
- Yeah, but his thing's so small, man.
- I bet you was mad wet, I was.

490
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,267
Well then, why didn't you
just fuck that Rupert friend...

491
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,529
and I wouldn't have had
to wank him.

492
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:47,067
You just said you liked it.
Anyway only my man gets the pussy.

493
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,467
Unlike you, obviously.
You sure you know whose baby it is?

494
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,940
- Don't try it, Becky.
- Yeah, well, I couldn't have that in me.

495
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,338
If I was you, I'd want to rip it out
with a coat-hanger.

496
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,111
- Fucking hell, man!
- What, blood?

497
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,789
Didn't I tell them no onions?

498
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,814
Yeah, you did, man,
you did say no onions, blood, man.

499
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,130
Didn't I say no onions?

500
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,290
Fool.

501
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,122
- Oi, what's going on?
- We got money, relax yourself.

502
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,646
Drive, man.

503
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,517
So, what, are me and you on
or what now?

504
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,353
- Yeah, yeah, I'm your girl.
- Yeah?

505
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,061
Yeah.
Come here.

506
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,204
Well, I gotta go home.
I'll see you tonight, yeah?

507
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,069
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
all right, take care, yeah.

508
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,199
Coke head baby.

509
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,837
Whatever, man,
it'll be gone soon.

510
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,805
God, I ain't changing
no fucking nappies for it.

511
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,272
Look, yeah, there's an abortion clinic
number here, do you wanna bell it?

512
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,775
Not now, man. Not today.
Look, can I use your toilet?

513
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,847
Are you gonna do a shit?
Because if you are, then, no.

514
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,414
That's loose, man, I don't do that
in other people's houses.

515
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,620
Well, hurry up, we need to get
the money for the garms.

516
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,126
Yeah, she's banged up, babes.
Yeah.

517
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,125
All right, see you soon.

518
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,133
- Who was that?
- My man.

519
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,544
- Listen, lads, where you off to?
- Oxford Street, man.

520
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,808
Well, why don't you walk?
It's only down the road.

521
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,286
Because we wanted
to catch a cab, man.

522
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,186
Why don't you shut your mouth
and mind your own business, blood?

523
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,618
Well, to be honest might have
to drop you off at Marble Arch...

524
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:30,350
- because the traffic's...
- What's wrong with you?

525
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,129
Yeah, man, yeah, Tr¡fe
and them two l¡ttle pussyholes.

526
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,732
Yeah, man, yeah. No, no, don't reach,
don't reach, I'm cool, yeah.

527
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,936
Listen I swear down, blood,
if I see them before you see...

528
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,369
I'm gonna bang them up.
I'm gonna bang them up.

529
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,596
I'm gonna bust their heads,
do you understand me?

530
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,469
Listen, if you eye them, yeah if you
see them, you just ding me, yeah.

531
00:35:57,255 --> 00:36:00,391
- Can we go and get something to eat?
- No, I don't wanna look fat for Mark.

532
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:03,485
- But I'm starving, though.
- We'll get a pizza when we get to his.

533
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,942
- Cheers, mate.
- That's nine pound twenty, mate.

534
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,640
You know what, mate, I got passed
by five black cabs today.

535
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,974
- Well, that ain't my fault, mate.
- Just because I'm black.

536
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,242
Ain't that ironic, though, like?
Black cab don't take black man.

537
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,922
- So, what's your point?
- My point is that...

538
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,822
it becomes a vicious circle.

539
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,117
- Well, what's that mean?
- It means...

540
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,691
Come back!

541
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,955
- Come on.
- You little black bastard!

542
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,459
Now I'm hungry.

543
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,231
Why did you bring me here again?

544
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,898
We give him some dope and he gives us
money for our dresses.

545
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,167
Can we get it and go, please,
because I'm really tired...

546
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,177
of listening to you two fuck.
Look...

547
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,343
I didn't know he was gonna be so old.

548
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,483
He's twenty-eight. He's an actor.

549
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,212
That's almost twice our age.

550
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,082
I know, but he thinks I'm eighteen,
though, so...

551
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,357
You were good, baby.

552
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,898
You lot want anything else?

553
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,990
No.

554
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,141
Hang on, hang on,
I thought she was pregnant?

555
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,109
Yeah, she is right now,
but she's getting rid of it.

556
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,068
- Go on, Lis, it's good.
- Okay.

557
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,579
So how much do you want for all this?
Three hundred?

558
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,316
Yeah.

559
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,078
All right, I'll go get it.

560
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,016
Right, I'll be back
in a minute, yeah?

561
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,625
So, you like what you see, huh?

562
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,461
No.

563
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,700
So what do you
come upstairs for then?

564
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,406
- I wanted to see if she was all right.
- She was fucking great.

565
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,973
- I bet you are as well.
- Fuck off!

566
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,803
You're sick.

567
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,843
- You know she's only fifteen?
- Yeah, of course I do.

568
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,950
I found her student card.

569
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,143
She thinks
it's her little secret.

570
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,321
Do you know
what my little secret is?

571
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,188
Go on, have a guess.

572
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,225
I'm a fucking bastard.

573
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,029
You know, I've never fucked
a pregnant girl before...

574
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,704
but, with you,
I think I'd make the exception.

575
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,600
How about you fuck yourself?

576
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,343
You should take the chance
while you can, you little slag.

577
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,775
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a fucking little slag...

578
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,616
because you're fifteen years old
and you're pregnant.

579
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,084
Probably some little black fellow
who hasn't hung around.

580
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,248
But that's cool,
because I like you.

581
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
So when you've decided
to dump it...

582
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,786
why don't you come back
and see me?

583
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,766
You won't have to get jealous of me
fucking your mate...

584
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,734
because I'll probably
fuck you too.

585
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,596
You know...

586
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,707
- you're not right about everything.
- What's that, then?

587
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,408
You're not a bastard...

588
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,179
you're a cunt.

589
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,680
Right, ready for round two, baby?

590
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,303
Boy! This shop is heavy.

591
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,269
Good afternoon, sirs.
Can I help you?

592
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:19,846
- Yeah. Where are your hats, rude girl?
- Downstairs, sir.

593
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,656
- It's here?
- It's over there.

594
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,827
This is what you want, isn't?

595
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,663
What do you think?

596
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,236
You know what,
blood fuck that guard, man.

597
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,442
You know what,
can we kick, man?

598
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,410
I'm sure they've got better stuff
down the road anyway.

599
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,717
Hey!

600
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,458
Wait.

601
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,022
Come on, come on.
Come with me. Come on.

602
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,093
Get the fuck off me, man!
What you doing?

603
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,734
- You're in a lot of trouble, mate.
- For what?

604
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,430
- Stealing that hat.
- I had it on when I come in, man.

605
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,606
- What's he taken?
- The cap.

606
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,309
He had it on
when we came in, bro.

607
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,970
Hey, pipe down, please.
And I'm not your bro.

608
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,179
Oi, fuck off, blood, about pipe down.
Get off me, man!

609
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,908
Listen, I told you,
I fucking had that when I come in.

610
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,911
- Don't swear at me.
- And what the fuck you gonna do?

611
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,518
You better watch it,
the police have been called.

612
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,042
Hey, call them, man.
I don't give a fuck.

613
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,788
I'll tell them, too.
I had the hat when I come in.

614
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:31,755
Hey, check your cameras, man.

615
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,357
Nisha, would you call
the police, please.

616
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,121
This young man has taken this hat
and is now causing a commotion.

617
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,158
- Is that all he's taken?
- Yeah.

618
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,488
But he was wearing that cap
when he came in.

619
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,800
- Are you sure?
- Yes, because I greeted him.

620
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,994
Thank you!

621
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,294
- I'm not sure that he was.
- I am sure. Sorry.

622
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,835
Move out the fucking way
and let us out, man! Yo, blood.

623
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,169
- Are you gonna fucking apologise, coz?
- Just leave, please.

624
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,175
- Hey, hold up, man.
- What?

625
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,614
Do you know what?
You want your hat so much, take it.

626
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,086
Fucking prick!

627
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,426
I'm stinging. Were you watching?
I bet you could hear, isn't it?

628
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:17,092
So, three hundred squids, yeah, babes.
We'll split it down the mids.

629
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,963
You got shoes, right?
We can't be looking like no tramps.

630
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:20,838
Yeah.

631
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,806
You are looking forward
to tonight, yeah?

632
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,241
I don't know, yeah, probably.

633
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,209
What's the matter, then?
You look like someone just...

634
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,244
Exactly. Look,
I've been thinking about stuff.

635
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,572
Me like this,
Katie killing herself.

636
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:37,044
I mean, that is why
we got the day off.

637
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,155
I don't know, maybe
we shouldn't go to the party.

638
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,457
What?

639
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,893
I don't know.
It's like, it's weird. It's strange.

640
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,859
She was so tall and pretty...
I wish I was that tall.

641
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:52,495
You know, I reckon
she could have been a model.

642
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,905
I knew she was troubled, but...

643
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,641
I never thought it was that bad
that she'd have to kill herself.

644
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,802
Well, it's done now.
Nothing we can do.

645
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:03,269
- I could have stuck up for her.
- So why didn't you?

646
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,381
I don't know.

647
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,217
Well, she's dead now.
Get over it. I am.

648
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,054
Don't you ever think about anything
but yourself?

649
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,921
Yeah.
Clothes, shoes, money, sex.

650
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,557
Wait, sex involves me
though, don't it?

651
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,352
Do you think Moony likes me?

652
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,462
- I don't know.
- He's so fine.

653
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,700
I won't fuck him
unless he eats me out.

654
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,202
- Do you think he will?
- I don't know.

655
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,863
So when you gonna get rid
of this baby?

656
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,102
- Lis?
- Just leave it, Becky, yeah?

657
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,476
Saint Martin Girls.
What you lot saying?

658
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,744
Oi, do you hear about that big bird
girl that committed suicide?

659
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,149
Proper sensitive, isn't it?

660
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:49,620
She got so upset.
We was only joking with her.

661
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,861
- Didn't look like a joke.
- Lis, shush.

662
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,429
She just got a bit feisty, that's all.
She needed a little bit of slapping.

663
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,125
But we was only playing with her.
We never meant her to slit her wrists.

664
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,030
- She hung herself.
- Whatever. She's dead.

665
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,207
- Because of you.
- What?

666
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,246
She killed herself because you
and your friends bullied her...

667
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:10,804
till she couldn't take it
no more.

668
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,183
- You killed her.
- Shut up, you sket.

669
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,548
- You killed her.
- Fucking shut up.

670
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,719
You killed her.

671
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,478
Listen, right, if you don't fucking
shut up, you're gonna join her.

672
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,282
Look she don't mean it, yeah. Please,
don't beat us up. She's pregnant.

673
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,052
You're that girl
that Sam fucked.

674
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,890
Wait till I tell everyone
about this ho.

675
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,333
You know what?
Yeah, tell them.

676
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,200
Tell them Alisa's pregnant
and she's keeping the fucking baby.

677
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,003
- What?
- I ain't scared of you.

678
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,603
If you're gonna do something
to me, then do it.

679
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,136
Go on.

680
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:45,138
I got bigger things to worry about
than what you can do to me.

681
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,293
What's the matter?

682
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,729
- You should bang her up, star.
- I should, shouldn't I?

683
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,673
What the fuck were you thinking,
Alisa? They could have beat us up.

684
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,466
- So?
- You're so selfish.

685
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,201
What if my face got scarred
or something?

686
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,380
And what the fuck are you talking about
"keeping the baby"?

687
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,449
You're not gonna have
an abortion now?

688
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,646
- Just leave it, Becky.
- So, what, are you like pro-life now?

689
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,083
No, but a girl we both
knew just died...

690
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,188
and I didn't do anything
to stop it.

691
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:29,259
- But I can do something about this.
- So, okay...

692
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,586
what about school?

693
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,796
What if you'd have got raped?
Would you have an abortion then?

694
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,328
- I don't know. Yeah, probably.
- You have to get rid of it.

695
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:38,161
- Who's gonna help you?
- I don't need any help.

696
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,867
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's morning sickness.

697
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,209
- It's not morning though.
- Look, I need to speak to Trife.

698
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,109
Let's go and buy our garms.
And then we'll find him, okay? Come on.

699
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,622
Curtis lives up there.

700
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,859
- What, is that it?
- I think so.

701
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,491
You think so?

702
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,664
You think...
you think so?

703
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,462
Do you think I've got time
for what people think now, Del?

704
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,970
- Is this the place, bro?
- Yes, it's the place.

705
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,976
But you gotta do this
on your own, bruv.

706
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,180
I'll wait for you back at mine.

707
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,679
- You're gonna go now, is it?
- I can't be seen here, man.

708
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,015
What would you do, man?

709
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,784
What would you do, man?

710
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,577
- That was a forty five pound hat, bloods.
- So?

711
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,938
You could've give it to me
for tonight, like.

712
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,878
Blood, it wouldn't have fit
your big African head anyway, man.

713
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,050
Oh my days!

714
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,558
You man, you man, you man,
check that gash over there, blood.

715
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:10,755
- Shit, check the back of, rude boy.
- She's bathing as well, you know.

716
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,797
See, that's what I want, blood.
I want a rich bitch like that.

717
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,988
Yeah, so, so what, who's on it?
Me, yeah?

718
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:18,296
No, blood, that's me, man.
I saw her first, isn't it?

719
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,858
My size.

720
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,363
My size.
Hey, darling, I'm...

721
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,433
Hey, girl,
I'm talking to you, man.

722
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,708
I'm chatting to you!

723
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,738
I don't think she's on it.

724
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,978
Blood, can't chat to a girl
like that, man.

725
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,846
You think you're nang, blood? Why
don't you show him how to do it, then?

726
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,644
Fuck it.
Let's duck, man.

727
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,287
He don't wanna check for that
because he's still on Alisa, isn't it?

728
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,194
Man, I'll show you now
I can chat to that girl, man.

729
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,154
Go on then.

730
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,760
- Why is he always on our hype, man?
- He thinks he's big, man.

731
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,932
- Hey, can I help you?
- Do you work here?

732
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,132
No, sorry,
just making conversation.

733
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,203
I wouldn't buy
these trainers, though.

734
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,276
- Seriously, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

735
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,185
Well, the front always comes off.

736
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,551
Plus, those are the old ones.
New ones are upstairs.

737
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,587
Trevor.

738
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,091
Stella.

739
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:27,166
- Want a zoot, blood?
- Yeah. Come, we get out of here, man.

740
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,740
You know I could have got
the number though, isn't it?

741
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,674
- So could I, blood.
- I don't think so, blood.

742
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,069
You look smart...
What do you do?

743
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,839
Smart. That's a new one.
What... like smartly dressed?

744
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,812
- No, clever, intelligent.
- Thank you.

745
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,283
I'm an architect.

746
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,324
Rings? You married?

747
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,193
Yeah, my...

748
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,728
husband's been away
a while.

749
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,624
If I was your husband,
I'd never leave you.

750
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,926
And I don't need Viagra,
you know.

751
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,296
Thank you...

752
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,796
that's useful to know.

753
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,300
Don't you get lonely
by yourself?

754
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,771
Yeah.

755
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,312
Yeah. I do.

756
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,778
Actually, sometimes I could use
a bit of company.

757
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,487
- I'd keep you company.
- I bet you would.

758
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,493
- How old are you?
- How old are you?

759
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,621
Twenty-six. You?

760
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,765
- I'm twenty-three.
- You're not twenty-three.

761
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,161
All right, I'm twenty-two,
but I'm mature, man.

762
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,032
- Twenty-two? Really?
- All right, I'm twenty, I swear.

763
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:39,543
It's not like I'm trying it on
or anything.

764
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:40,840
Good.

765
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,976
Because I wouldn't want
to disappoint you.

766
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,463
My girl puts onion in my burger.

767
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,998
But, blood, man, you shouldn't have
thrown it, though, isn't it?

768
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,265
She didn't do what I asked.

769
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,567
You should have gave
the burger to me, blood, man.

770
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:07,560
- Man, I don't like onions.
- Hey, what happened, man?

771
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,534
She's a cock tease, man. She's on it,
and then she ducked, isn't it?

772
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,369
That's a bit weird. White girls
usually fuck you for a browns.

773
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,645
- I knew you wouldn't get that, rude boy.
- Standard.

774
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,978
Shut up, man. I'm still gonna bang
that when I go see her.

775
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,184
How are you gonna bang her, blood
and go see her when she kicked out.

776
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,286
Are you stupid or something?

777
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,378
No.

778
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,282
I got this,
and I'm gonna bring it to her.

779
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,357
Hey, blood, hold him,
hold him, hold him.

780
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,359
Jay, I beg you, pass it back, man.
Hey, Moons, Moons, Moons. Hey, Jay.

781
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,419
Blood, she got plenty dollars in here,
you know. And she's a...

782
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,532
Boy! What the fuck are you doing, man?
Where are you going?

783
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,469
- Leave it. Leave it out, he's a youth.
- Or what, coz?

784
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:42,097
Or else I'll bust you in your head
you fucking white pussyhole!

785
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:43,833
What? Blood, you think because
I'm white, I won't knock you out?

786
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,439
Is that right, blood?
Yo, let me take my hat off.

787
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,040
How about white boy,
skinhead nutter, mate?

788
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,040
Does that work better for you,
dickhead?

789
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,076
Oi.

790
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,814
- Shit.
- That's really good though, cousin.

791
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,650
What, man,
you think that scares me?

792
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,819
Man, you don't even know me.

793
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,994
Low it low it, come on, come on.

794
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,464
Just get out of here, man.
You men got murked, like.

795
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,909
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- What are you talking about?

796
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,739
You! Starting fights
in the middle of the street, man.

797
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,915
I was backing you up, blood.

798
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,439
That's not what
I'm talking about, blood.

799
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,481
If we plan something together,
that's cool.

800
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,253
But that was under control
until you started, man.

801
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,022
You can't just start arms house
in the middle of the street.

802
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,024
- What's wrong with you, blood?
- Just cool it, Jay, man.

803
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,026
All right, man.
So where's the purse?

804
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,688
Wait, blood. I told you, yeah,
I want the fucking cards, isn't it.

805
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,430
No, man, who fucking took it?
Give me the purse!

806
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,590
Blood, man, you want,
you want the cards, yeah?

807
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,094
- Yes, I want the fucking cards.
- You want the cards.

808
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,892
- Hey, Moons. Moons.
- Hey, blood, don't fuck about.

809
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,863
So what, you can share
your girl with Sam...

810
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,105
and you can't even share
the purse with us, blood.

811
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,732
You fucking prick.

812
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,009
- Get the fuck off me!
- Fuck is wrong with you, blood?

813
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,700
We're gonna split that or not?
All right, that's what it's got to?

814
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,437
You know what, take your fucking
purse, you like it so much.

815
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,943
You're a dickhead, man.

816
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,847
Hey, blood,
don't take it out on us...

817
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,086
because your girl
got pressed by next man.

818
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,189
If you was somebody else, I would have
stabbed your claret, rude boy!

819
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,817
Stab me then, blood!
My uncle'll kill you!

820
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,755
You and your fucking uncle, man!
If my man's even real.

821
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,486
You know what, blood, if he is real,
yeah, you better go to him, isn't it?

822
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,260
Because, blood, you ain't got no-one
no more, man. You ain't got Alisa.

823
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,059
You ain't got that sket no more.

824
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,066
And we ain't backing you no more.
Come, Moons, man.

825
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:26,402
Hey, who the fuck you chatting to, man?
Without me, you two ain't shit!

826
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,510
And Alisa, I can have her if I want,
but I don't need her.

827
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,514
I don't need pussyhole friends
like you, either.

828
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,345
Yeah, you keep telling
yourself that, blood.

829
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:36,219
Remember, we might call you Trife
but your name's Trevor.

830
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:38,585
- Remember that, blood.
- Come, we jet, blood.

831
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,916
Claire, honey,
Sam's here to see you.

832
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:16,355
Thanks, Mrs. Parkinson.

833
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,718
I'll leave you kids to it.

834
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,035
- Where are they?
- Who?

835
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,698
Don't try to boy me off,
them three little pussyholes.

836
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,100
I don't know.

837
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,370
I'm only gonna ask you this
one more time.

838
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,443
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

839
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,874
Jeez.

840
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,985
Listen, yeah.
My mum nearly broke her arm.

841
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,351
You better start talking,
or I'm gonna bang you up, you hear me?

842
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,081
When we get to school, I'm gonna tell
everyone what a rubbish fuck you are.

843
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,192
And how bad you smell.
If you know what I'm saying.

844
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:54,056
Please, don't, I really don't know
where they are.

845
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:57,427
All I know is that they're going to
that party tonight.

846
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,499
That's where they're gonna be.

847
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:04,096
So why weren't I invited?

848
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,970
Because no-one
that's going likes you.

849
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,910
Sam, stop, please.
I'm sorry.

850
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:14,544
Claire?

851
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,819
Claire, baby, are you all right?

852
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,087
Yeah, mum, I'm fine.

853
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,615
Me and Sam are just talking.

854
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:24,452
Okay.

855
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,162
Use a condom,
sweetheart.

856
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,433
That brings me
to my next question.

857
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:32,967
Whose girl are you?

858
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,236
Because I don't even know
why I bother with you.

859
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:39,309
You're ugly, you're a shit fuck, and
you're with me, like sixth-form top boy.

860
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,301
If it weren't for me,
who would even look at you?

861
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:43,773
I don't know.

862
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,285
- Why did you sleep with Alisa?
- Why'd you fuck that fucking Jay?

863
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,276
In my drum as well!

864
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,416
I don't know. I'm sorry.

865
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,014
It's all right, it's all right.

866
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,926
It's just... I do everything you want,
whenever you want me to.

867
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:03,621
So why are you mean to me
and all that? I don't understand.

868
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,001
Come here.

869
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,135
Okay, so Plaza, yeah?
In an hour.

870
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,535
- All right, then. Bye.
- Right, see you then. Bye.

871
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,073
Come fuck on, man.

872
00:55:56,386 --> 00:56:00,117
Look, what you need is
some retail therapy, yeah?

873
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,325
Alisa says to meet her in the cafe thing
downstairs in one hour.

874
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,562
What, did you tell her
that Trife ain't here?

875
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:06,551
No.

876
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:07,864
Are you a fool or something,
blood?

877
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,133
You don't think she really wants
to chat to you, do you?

878
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,191
I don't know.

879
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:14,337
You know, fuck it isn't it, I'll tell her,
I'll give her a piece of my mind, man.

880
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,304
You get me?

881
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:23,035
Oh my God, that dress looks dark
on you. Is that the one you want?

882
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:24,645
Yeah, I think so.

883
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,873
Well, I got all these.
I can't make my mind up.

884
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:28,550
We are gonna be the hottest girls
there tonight.

885
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,744
Everyone else is gonna look like
tramps compared to us.

886
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,823
Hi, madam, can I help?
Is that the dress you like?

887
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,222
- Yeah.
- It looks great on you.

888
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,061
Well, if you pull your
hair back like this...

889
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,256
it will accentuate
your fabulous figure.

890
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,428
- Thank you.
- Nice figure?

891
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:44,300
Not for long.
She's knocked up.

892
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,928
Congratulations.
My wife is pregnant.

893
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,305
- Wife? I thought you were a batty man.
- Excuse me?

894
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,267
- Ain't you gay?
- No.

895
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,704
- There's nothing wrong with it.
- I know, I'm just saying.

896
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,003
- All right, calm down, Yankee.
- I'm Canadian.

897
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,477
- Same thing.
- Excuse me, how much is this one?

898
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,213
This one is a hundred
and thirty pounds.

899
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:04,947
Becks?

900
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,391
Well, I want this one.
How much is it?

901
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,131
This one is two hundred
and ten pounds.

902
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:26,233
Lis, can you not find another one?
I really want this one.

903
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,843
- We've got three hundred between us.
- Yeah, and you said you'd split it.

904
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,740
Look, who got the money?

905
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,780
I'm doing you a favour
in the first place by getting you one.

906
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,885
Come on, soon you'll have
a big fat belly anyway.

907
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,375
You won't be able to wear it.

908
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,521
You've still got ninety quid.
I'm sure you can get something nice.

909
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:41,658
Don't worry, honey.

910
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,252
I'll find you something to make
you look even more fabulous.

911
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,638
- Trevor?
- Yeah.

912
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:04,770
He'll be with you in a sec.

913
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,711
You're a handsome one,
aren't you?

914
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:26,521
Trevor.

915
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,330
- What happen?
- You told me to reach.

916
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,032
Debbie look after you?

917
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:34,895
Yeah.

918
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,570
Come.

919
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,310
Me like the work you did
on that thing.

920
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:49,275
This...

921
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,086
is for you.

922
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,358
See, I told you I would, man.

923
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,761
If you want me to do
anything else, I'm...

924
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,820
Just cool yourself, man.

925
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,063
What's that?

926
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,474
Heroin.

927
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,840
- You want some?
- I'm cool, man.

928
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,142
Go on...

929
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,416
take some.

930
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,528
You grow fast, man.

931
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,433
Anyway...

932
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,770
me like the work
you did on the gun.

933
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,435
- It's easy, I can...
- Don't speak, just listen.

934
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,205
You know...

935
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,185
all you need in this world
is money...

936
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:01,412
and if you know how to get it,
you laughing.

937
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:05,125
- You seen that nice TV in my front room?
- Yeah.

938
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:09,059
You got one? No? But you'd like one,
of course you would.

939
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,990
Curtis, I've got Keith
on the phone. He wants you to...

940
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:14,465
Tell him that I talk to my nephew.
Tell him wait.

941
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,036
But he's already on the phone.
He says he's...

942
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,608
Me said tell him wait.

943
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:29,640
Anyway...

944
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:37,251
why you don't come work for,
with me?

945
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,560
Trust me, I want to, man.
Fucking had enough of everything else.

946
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,669
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Just a few little things.

947
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,894
That sounds like something
you can do?

948
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,005
Sounds live, man.
I'm there.

949
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,971
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

950
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,043
Me did sell the last
of the bad guns to some youth.

951
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,206
Me have more of the replicas
for you to drill in the back.

952
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,849
In the meantime...

953
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:08,413
you did so well with this one
that me think you should have it.

954
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,776
- So where is he?
- I told you.

955
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:37,252
When he switched, yeah,
we just kicked out and left him, man.

956
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,886
And don't bother trying to call him,
because his phone's off.

957
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,420
Look, I really need
to speak to him.

958
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,057
Listen up, everybody.

959
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:45,487
Me say listen up.

960
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,088
This is my nephew Trevor.

961
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,493
Real family member that will be joining
our family from now on...

962
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,537
so, treat him nice.

963
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,102
What going on, bro?

964
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:05,677
What's up with this baby shit, man?
Is this true or something?

965
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,940
Of course it's true.
Who's gonna lie about being pregnant?

966
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,585
- Nuff people, man.
- Well, I'm not lying.

967
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,988
All you do is lie.

968
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:14,223
And now you've been caught out, you're
trying to drag Trife back into this.

969
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:15,713
Try and fuck up his life,
isn't it?

970
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,722
Look, I think I should be speaking
to him about this, not you.

971
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,451
You are talking to me.

972
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,425
And what exactly
are you gonna say to him?

973
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:24,295
"I'm sorry, Trife I fucked another guy
while I was with you."

974
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,235
Because it don't matter
because he knows now.

975
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,702
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

976
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:31,838
Listen, Trevor.

977
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:36,038
Come, I want you to handle
something for me.

978
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,746
You're bad, isn't it?

979
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:49,949
You behave yourselves, yeah?

980
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,722
Anything?

981
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:02,360
You see, this is the reason
me want you to come work for me.

982
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,706
- Curtis.
- Shut up!

983
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,141
You see this fucker?

984
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:10,210
Him take my property,
but my money never come back.

985
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,682
Where the fuck is my money,
nigger?

986
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,850
I can get it for you, man.

987
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,757
It's at my place. I told you
I was gonna bring it round later today.

988
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,224
Hey, shut your mouth, blood.

989
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:25,859
If he wanted it when you decided to
bring it and not when he asked for it...

990
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,895
you wouldn't be tied
to a fucking table, would you?

991
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,129
What are you waiting for?

992
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,005
I'm sorry.
Please, I'm sorry.

993
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,645
You know what, boy?

994
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,347
I want you
to get my money today.

995
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,881
- I will.
- But before you go...

996
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,746
I'm gonna make sure you remember
that you don't fuck with Curtis.

997
01:04:58,628 --> 01:04:59,686
Trevor...

998
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,524
I want you to carve a C from the corner
of him eye to the corner of him mouth.

999
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,005
- Me?
- Yes...

1000
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,468
you.

1001
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:23,777
I want you
to carve a blood clotline...

1002
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:26,981
from here to here.

1003
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,685
Carve the fucking line.

1004
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:40,893
No, let him.

1005
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:42,962
Cut him.

1006
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,595
Man.

1007
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,167
Man, please!

1008
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:48,703
Please!

1009
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:52,973
No.

1010
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:01,387
No!

1011
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:26,947
Good.

1012
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,620
Trevor... come.

1013
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,517
Come here.

1014
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:36,248
Trevor!

1015
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,733
Please.

1016
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:09,658
The best thing you
could do right now is fuck off...

1017
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,558
and get an abortion of Sam's baby.

1018
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,059
Because he don't want you,
and Trife don't want you either.

1019
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:15,990
What, has he said that?

1020
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:19,326
- Who wants a sket like you?
- Has he told you he don't want me.

1021
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,867
Yeah.
Now fuck off, isn't it.

1022
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,675
What's up with your girlfriend,
though? Fucking Sam.

1023
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:32,370
No wonder Trife dashed her, man,
she's a fucking ho like.

1024
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,676
I know.
I couldn't be like that.

1025
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,182
Only give my things
to special mans like you.

1026
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,819
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1027
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,349
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1028
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,217
Becks, can we go?

1029
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:45,784
- Where, to the party?
- No, I just wanna go home.

1030
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:48,025
Well, I'm not ready.

1031
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,891
- Becky, please, can we just go?
- Look, go if you wanna go.

1032
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:55,661
Don't come to the party tonight, be a
boring cow. I'm staying with this lot.

1033
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,436
You know what,
just do what you want, yeah?

1034
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,205
Fat cunt.

1035
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,779
I fucked that g¡rl
a few weeks ago, blood.

1036
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,713
Every day for a week
when she's supposed to be your girl.

1037
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:55,948
Why aren't you speaking to me?

1038
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,509
So this party, where is it?

1039
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,005
You're not still gonna go,
are you?

1040
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:27,841
You saw what they done to my mum.
Where is it?

1041
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,077
Nice invite.

1042
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:34,585
- I don't think you should go.
- Why not?

1043
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:38,452
I just think this thing with them lot
should stop or someone's gonna get hurt.

1044
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,060
Your mum's all right
and you got me.

1045
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:43,993
Stay here tonight,
we can fuck all night.

1046
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,294
Promise me you'll stay.

1047
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,432
All right, I promise.

1048
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:54,507
I just wanna go home and check on
my mum, make sure she's all right.

1049
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:59,210
- Cool. I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

1050
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,346
Alisa!

1051
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:09,148
Alisa!

1052
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,390
Wait. Alisa!

1053
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:18,396
- What you doing?
- I'm going home. I only live over there.

1054
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:21,535
- Your hand's bleeding, are you okay?
- Oh, shit.

1055
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:22,965
Yeah, yeah.

1056
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,935
- Have you been crying?
- No.

1057
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,303
You look like you have.

1058
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,151
Are you coming to Blake's party?

1059
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:37,977
Oh, no, I'm really n
in the mood.

1060
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:40,751
Come on, come with us.

1061
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,284
I don't know.

1062
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,960
You look like you need to be around
some friends to cheer yourself up.

1063
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:45,892
Yeah.

1064
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:49,690
I promise I'll do anything I can
to get you smiling again.

1065
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,590
And how are you gonna do that?

1066
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,472
Come on, come with me.

1067
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,144
Okay. Let me just go home
and get changed, yeah?

1068
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:05,011
But I'm only gonna come, like,
if I can hang out with you.

1069
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:27,565
H¡, th¡s ¡s Al¡sa.
Please, leave...

1070
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:02,928
Trife... enter, my friend.
While the parents are away and what not.

1071
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,734
Want some of this?
It's Cuban.

1072
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,707
Where's Alisa?

1073
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,639
She's inside.
I think she went into the garden.

1074
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,028
Bruv...

1075
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,463
blood, sorry, man.

1076
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:12,969
I'll see you later.

1077
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:14,607
Sorry, bruv.

1078
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:19,406
- What you doing?
- So, what, he's your man now?

1079
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,709
No, but at least he's been nice to me
today. Look, what do you want?

1080
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,547
I wanted to say hello, isn't it.

1081
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,985
- Hello.
- How you doing?

1082
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,659
If you wanna say something to me,
then say it and leave me alone.

1083
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:33,025
- Hey, what happened to your hand?
- I got it cut.

1084
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,096
- Are you all right?
- It's fine.

1085
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,661
No, are you all right?

1086
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:44,131
- So what do you do today?
- Nothing that would interest you.

1087
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:49,776
Look, Lis, can we go somewhere
a bit more private, please?

1088
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:13,201
So, what, where is he, then?

1089
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:15,169
I don't know, I just saw him
come out here.

1090
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:16,905
I'm going back in, man. This is...

1091
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,100
I don't know why
I come to your party, man.

1092
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:26,175
- So what time you staying till?
- Cool, baby, we just got here, like.

1093
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,509
True, it'll probably
get better later.

1094
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,420
Would be better
if Blake weren't such a chief.

1095
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,580
Look at him trying
to friends up Jay.

1096
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:36,415
I mean... I'd consider this
a success, wouldn't you?

1097
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:41,021
Jay, did I mention
how sharp you look.

1098
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,255
Go away, Blake.

1099
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,905
I know you tried to speak to me earlier
and I didn't want to listen...

1100
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,899
but I wanna talk to you now.

1101
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,705
Look, don't worry about your little
life, Trevor, I don't need your help.

1102
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:02,239
And I'm sorry you had to hear
what you heard from Sam...

1103
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,713
and I understand
that you don't want me...

1104
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,719
but I thought you ought to know
that I never slept with...

1105
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:10,415
All right. I know you never meant
to hurt me and blah, blah...

1106
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:12,661
but before you carry on there's some
things I need to get off my head...

1107
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,429
and if I don't,
I'm just gonna forget.

1108
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,090
- Look, Trevor, you don't...
- Wait...

1109
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:22,326
I'm on that, boy.

1110
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:25,362
Excuse me, you came with me.

1111
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,838
No, there's a difference.
You came with me.

1112
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:32,175
But don't worry, though,
babes, like...

1113
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:34,181
there's enough Moonies
to go around, isn't it, like.

1114
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:35,646
So safe, yeah?

1115
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,949
Yeah, Danielle,
what's going on then, man?

1116
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,051
I see you at school the other day.
I wanted to come and talk to you...

1117
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,847
but you're always with
your friends, man.

1118
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:44,049
- You can still come up to me.
- No, but I don't like...

1119
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,623
Please.

1120
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:49,626
Danielle, I'm gonna come
chat to you in a sec, yeah?

1121
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,024
So, with both your little buddies
doing there own thing...

1122
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,034
is there anything
that you wanna do?

1123
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,665
Like what?

1124
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,169
Like me.

1125
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:58,565
What?

1126
01:17:58,907 --> 01:18:00,932
Do you want to fuck me?

1127
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,834
No, not really, I got a girl.

1128
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,707
So? I won't tell her.

1129
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,546
I thought you liked Moony?

1130
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:09,742
No, I like you.

1131
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:11,845
He's a bit of a fool.

1132
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:13,385
That's one of my best friends
you're talking about down there.

1133
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,389
Look, do you wanna fuck or not?

1134
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:21,525
You can put it in my arse as well.
It hurts, but I don't mind.

1135
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:24,565
No, low it, man.
Hey, Danielle.

1136
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:31,733
What I wanted to say ¡s th¡s.

1137
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,538
I know we were only going out
for a couple of months...

1138
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:40,013
but it was fun, dred. You made me feel
like feel good, you get me?

1139
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:44,212
I mean, not just sex. I mean, your
things feel good and everything, but...

1140
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,184
you.

1141
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,316
It was you.

1142
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:54,690
But I didn't know what to do when you
started wanting hugs and that in school.

1143
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:58,263
I started thinking about what the boys
would think and them stupidness there.

1144
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,497
When I broke up with you,
I realised I was stupid.

1145
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:05,830
I told everyone, "I ain't going back
out with her", but...

1146
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:08,140
I wanted to.

1147
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:14,382
When I found out you fucked Sam,
it hurt me.

1148
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,282
- Look, Trevor...
- Wait.

1149
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,687
That hurt me.

1150
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,082
That's why I said
what I said today.

1151
01:19:25,994 --> 01:19:27,689
I've seen some shit today...

1152
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,060
makes me think about life.

1153
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:36,435
You're one of the best things
in mine.

1154
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:41,634
So even though
it's some next man's baby...

1155
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:45,306
I wanna be with you.

1156
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,506
And I wanna look after
you both.

1157
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,583
I wanna change for you.

1158
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,016
Because...

1159
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:00,958
I love you.

1160
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,201
Why you laughing?
I said I love you.

1161
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:09,364
- Trevor, I never slept with Sam.
- What?

1162
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,098
I've been trying to tell you.

1163
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:14,309
He lied. He told everyone
I went to his house.

1164
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:15,310
He said I might as well go...

1165
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,039
because he was gonna
tell everyone he fucked me, but...

1166
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:20,073
I never, I swear.

1167
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:22,248
So, the baby...

1168
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:26,212
You're the only one I've slept with.
It's yours.

1169
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,587
- What's wrong?
- Shit.

1170
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:34,856
- My mum's gonna kill me, man.
- Mine too.

1171
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:55,513
Listen, listen, we're gonna work, yeah?
We'll stay together forever.

1172
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,378
I'm not sure we will...

1173
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,019
but we're gonna have this baby,
so, we should try.

1174
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:07,190
Yeah, pussyhole, what now?

1175
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:09,056
- You think you're a man? Get up.
- Sam don't!

1176
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:12,164
No... you think you're bad?
You wanna act like a big man?

1177
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,102
I'm gonna beat you
like a fucking big man!

1178
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:19,636
Where's your two boys? Because you
three pussyholes are finished tonight!

1179
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,745
We can work something out,
I swear to you.

1180
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:24,813
Fuck...

1181
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:28,044
- Sam, man, fucking hell, what you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!

1182
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:41,188
Moony! Jay, look, Sam's beating up
Trife outside, right now!

1183
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:46,935
- So, what, are you gonna back us or what?
- No, he's your mate, blood.

1184
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:47,731
You pussy!

1185
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:49,594
You must have lost
your fucking mind fucking with me.

1186
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:51,601
We can work something, I swear to you.
Hey, Jay, don't, man.

1187
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,607
Hey, blood,
get the fuck off him, man.

1188
01:21:59,047 --> 01:21:59,979
I'm sorry.

1189
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,646
Come on then... Come, come.

1190
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,181
Hey, low it, man, low it.

1191
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:08,046
Yeah, you are.

1192
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:15,594
You wanna disrespect my mum?
You wanna fuck my girl?

1193
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:26,065
You're not fucking real,
blood, you hear me?

1194
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,536
Stay down!

1195
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,267
All you fucking pussyholes, yeah.

1196
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,279
Any of you fuck with me, this is what
you get, you understand, blood?

1197
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,505
Just leave us alone, Sam.

1198
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:36,784
Everyone knows
you never fucked me.

1199
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:39,111
What are you gonna do,
beat us all up?

1200
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:40,822
Who'd wanna fuck you anyway?
Look at you.

1201
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:43,188
- Shut up.
- Suck my dick, you fucking bitch.

Fucking dickhead.

Trife, get off him, please.

I don't know who you are, coz,

1227
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,308
Do you know

Trife, you're gonna be all right,

Better shut the fuck up, man.
Shut up!

Get down on your fucking knees now.
Put your head on the stone. Fucking cry!

See, man look at this,

I fucking found this shit yesterday,

1235
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,996
Sam says he's gonna fucking kill me,
so I'm gonna save them all the trouble.

1236
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:16,369
I'm not even... fuck...
I'm not even scared any more.

1237

Anything's better than here.
And it fucking goes on, you cunt.

1238
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:22,544
She was fucking fifteen, man.

1239
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:24,943
- She was fucking fifteen.
- I never done nothing to her, blood.

1240
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:28,122
Give me one fucking good reason why
I shouldn't fucking blow your head off.

1241
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,450
You give me one.
Why you shouldn't die.

1242
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,459
Give me one fucking reason
why you shouldn't die!

1243
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,088
Because he's not worth it.

1244
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,895
Baby, baby, it's really bad!

Oh, fuck. Trife!

He's stopped breathing! What?
Man, where's the doctor?

1247
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,212
Trife? Trife?

Fuck you,

Fuck off and leave him, blood, man.
Why you around watching now?

None of you did shit to help, man.
