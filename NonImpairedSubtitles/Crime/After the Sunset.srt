right into the museum.

10
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,950
Stan, you've got more cover on you
than the president.

11
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,454
The diamond is safe.

12
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:34,221
This is an armed caravan,
completely bulletproof, magnetic locks.

13
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,558
- This transfer is under control.

Are you kidding me, ref?
That's the Lakers' ball.

Okay, great.

Nice job. Bye-bye.

- Tip him. Get him outta here.
- Yeah, yeah.

30
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,842
Jesus.

31

No, come on, that's enough.

Okay, thank you.

There you go.

Let's roll.

Ref, listen!
This is insane!

38
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,581
It's a foul on him.

39

Charge? I'll show you a charge!

40

I'll show you a damn charge, man!

That's the worst call I ever seen!

What do you think this is, a rodeo?

43

Then I'll be the clown!

44
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,665
- Let me in the game!
- Sit down, please.

45

Get out of my way!
Play some real ball!

46

Hey, put Malone in there!

48

Get Shaq in the game!

Shit! He's gone.

57

We've lost him.

58
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,185
What?

59
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,355
- Burdett is gone.
- <i>Find him.</i>

60
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,761
He's coming after it.

61
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,631
We're fine.
Just relax.

62
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,671
Don't tell me to relax.

63
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,172
I've dealt with this guy before.

64
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,117
See him yet?

65
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,591
We're looking, we're looking.

66
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,387

<i>Oh, kiss me</i>

68

Stand down. We got him.

69

He's still here.

70
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,001
On the Jumbotron.

71
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,298
He changed his seat.

72
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,036
Get a direct visual.

73
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,070
You got it.

74
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,299
See, Stan, we got you here.

75

No need to panic.

76
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,679
Do you have a direct visual yet?

77
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,772
<i>Negative. We're still looking.</i>

78

00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,151
We're clear.

80
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,251

- One lousy buck.
- Cheap bastard.

00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,167
I wrote my vows.

168
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,361
- What?
- I wrote my vows.

169
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,429
- You?
- Work in progress.

170
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,104
Max, this is Ron and, uh...

171
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,341
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Gail.

172
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,712
- Gail, yes.
- Great to run into you again.

173
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,546
- I met them at the tennis club.
- Oh.

174
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,017
What kind of business you in, Maxwwell?

175
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,021
Pest control.

176
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,682
- This is Sheila and Ed.
- Hey!

177
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

178
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,524
They're from Orlando.

179
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,289
I met them parasailing.

180
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,887
So, uh, what kind
of business are you in, Max?

181
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,525
I have a bunch of sweatshops
in the Philippines.

182
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,863
- Oh.
- Oh.

183
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,404
You should see those kids
make those hats.

184
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,337
- Great, huh?
- Wow.

185
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,534
- Scootch in.
- Hi.

186
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,974
Max, this is Wendell and June.

187
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,671
We met snorkeling.

188
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,213
- Max, right?
- Yes.

189
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,645
Yeah, Wendell.

190
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,650
- Oh, I love lobster.
- Oh, yummy!

191
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,811
Wow, look at that!

192
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,250
Stocks may rise and fall,
economies may collapse,

193
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,919
but the American farmer's always
gonna need manure.

194
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:45,157
My family's been in manure
for three generations.

195
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,528
No shit.

196
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,293
Holy cow!

197
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,761
Sheila and I like to swoc.

198
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,497
Swoc?

199
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,098
We like to have sex
with other couples.

200
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,069
Check.

201
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,373
Ooh, honey, look at that!

202
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,676
Something wrong?

203
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:07,241
Six months.
I can't take any more lobster.

204
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,480
There's only one thing
I enjoy eating more than lobster.

205
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,455
Huh, huh, huh?

206
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,252
Man, do I love lobster!

207
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,692
So, I'm setting up
for this 30-foot putt,

208
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,389
I got a chance for an eagle.

209
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,761
An eagle. Now, sweetie...

210
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,857
Steal her bracelet.

211
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,561
I saw you looking at it.

212
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,728
Steal it.

213
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,998
You know you want it.

214
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,835
We're retired, baby.
All I want is you.

215
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:32,275
Come on, let yourself go.
Have fun.

216
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,777
I bet you can't get it.

217
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,246
Of course I can, but I won't.

218
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,375
Bet you can't.

219
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,783
Max. Aren't you having a good time?

220
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,514
Please come again.

221
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,581
Maxwwell, this one's on me.

222
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,889
Oh, thank you very much.

223
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,725
That's weird, I can't find my wallet.
Did I give you my wallet?

224
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,788
No, you didn't give me your wallet.

225
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,734
That's so weird! I could swear
I put it in my pocket before I came here.

226
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,101
It's okay, big fellow.
I got it.

227
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,730
Oh, thanks, Maxwwell.

228
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,206
That is so sweet.

229
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,903
Where the hell is my wallet?

230
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,542
Luc, what's in
the Caribbean Romance again?

231
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,085
Light rum, amaretto,

232
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,350
orange juice, pineapple juice,
and a splash of grenadine.

233
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,324
What about the Pink Paradise?

234
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:24,761
Coconut rum, amaretto, cranberry juice,
orange juice, and pineapple juice.

235
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,965
People actually drink this stuff?

236
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,002
They love it.
You know, it makes them feel exotic.

237
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,594
Give me a Jack on the rocks.

238
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,265
It doesn't have a fancy name,
but if it was good enough for Frank,

239
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,740
it's good enough for me.

240
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,276
Frank?

241
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,868
Who's Frank?

242
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,469
Sinatra.

243
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,447
Did Frank take an umbrella?

244
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,275
Not even when it was raining.

245
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,879
Hi, baby.

246
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,457
How was it?

247
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,498
Amazing! You'd love it!

248
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,694
The only sounds are your breath
and your heartbeat.

249
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,468
The reef is like a thousand jewels,
sparkling right in front of you.

250
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,667
You should really try it next time.

251
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,268
Mm-hmm. Well,
I like to breathe unassisted.

252
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,006
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

253
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,947
I thought you liked it
when I give you mouth to mouth.

254
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,342
State your business.

255
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,238
You're gonna shoot
an FBI agent, Burdett?

256
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,340
All I see is an intruder...

257
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,876
...who just swallowed $80 worth
of my whiskey.

258
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,813
Put down the weapon.

259
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,381
Don't make me shoot you again.

260
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,117
Again?

261
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,025
Is that the way we're gonna play it?

262
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,865
What are you doing
in my house, Agent Lloyd?

263
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,837
Sitting, drinking, eating chocolate.

264
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:23,841
- You have a warrant?
- FBI doesn't have jurisdiction here.

265
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,536
I know, that's why I came down here.

266
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,044
Oh, I don't think it is.

267
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,343
The <i>Seven Seas Navigator</i>
docking here for a solid week.

268
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,351
They're having a nice promotion
for the maiden voyage,

269
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,149
calling it the Diamond Cruise.

270
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,247
A gem exhibit whose star attraction is

271
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,451
the third Napoleon Diamond.

272
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,927
Stop me when I get to the part
you don't know.

273
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,260
It's the only one you two haven't stolen.

274
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,355
Allegedly.

275
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,095
And it's gonna be right here
for a whole week... the last of the set...

276
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,535
and I suspect you plan to purloin it.

277
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,662
Well, I don't.

278
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,604
So finish your drink and get out.

279
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,164
It's okay to be happy to see me.

280
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,370
Just because you're English doesn't
mean you need to hide your emotions.

281
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,471
I'm Irish.
We let people know how we feel.

282
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,947
Now fuck off.

283
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,549
And you can take any bugs you planted
along with you.

284
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,179
I'm retired.

285
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,350
A retired guy wouldn't have anything
to worry about from those.

286
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,916
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Take it.

287
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,586
You might learn something from it.

288
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,426
But return it for me.
It's overdue.

289
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,227
Give my love to Lola, will you?

290
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,336
How was the tennis lesson?

291
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,314
Great. The teacher says I'm a natural.

292
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,180
He says I've got the best backside
he's ever seen.

293
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,310
That's <i>backhand.</i>

294
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,512
Don't go in there.

295
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,783
- Why?
- Let's talk.

296
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,485
Okay, you're making me nervous,
and I don't get nervous.

297
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,061
Agent Lloyd just left.

298
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,827
What's <i>he</i> doing here?

299
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,424
He came to show me this.

300
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,874
Damn it, Max.

301
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,433
Is this what we're here for?

302
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,072
No. It's not.

303
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,576
This is not retirement at all.

304
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,086
This is the next setup, isn't it?

305
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,147
Babe, <i>you</i> chose
this island, remember?

306
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,853
I hope you don't think
this is a gift from God.

307
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,558
'Cause this is God messing with us.

308
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,397
Oh, no. Max.

309
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,969
Did Stan do this?

310
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,805
Sort of.

311
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,473
I figured he'd bug the place,
so I started checking.

312
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,448
Did you find any?

313
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,780
Only what he wanted me to find.

314
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,481
There's another one here somewhere.

315
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,484
Now, don't worry.
I already checked.

316
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,753
There's nothing in there.

317
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,350
That's the problem.

318
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,055
There's nothing in here.

319
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,258
What is it?
What's wrong?

320
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,930
I hid the bullet in the camera.

321
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,666
What bullet?

322
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,935
The one he shot you with.

323
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,567
Oh, no.

324
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:17,146
I kept it to remind me
of how close I came to losing you.

325
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,741
Lola, you know that bullet
puts me on the scene.

326
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,548
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

327
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,612
I'll get it back.

328
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,867
Good morning, Mr. Lloyd.
Your suite is ready.

329
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,273
- Suite?
- Suite, sir.

330
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,278
It's a larger room.

331
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,014
Atlantis reserves this bridge suite
for our more dignified guests.

332
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,384
Breakfast is on the house, these are
vouchers for free tennis lessons,

333
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,360
complimentary skin exfoliant,
seaweed body wrap and facial scrub,

334
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,090
located in the spa on the club level.

335
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,597
Also, please remember.

336
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:12,433
Shoes and shirt are required
in all public spaces at all times.

337
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,631
State your business.

338
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,730
You can't bribe me
with a seaweed body wrap, Max.

339
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,468
This doesn't buy you one bit of space.

340
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,635
I'm gonna be on you wherever you go.

341
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:53,837
It's no bribe, Stanley.

342
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,312
I just want you to see
that if you lead the kind of life I do,

343
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,576
stealing is the last thing on your mind.

344
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:01,941
Mr. Lloyd.

345
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,616
Are you ready for your massage?

346
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,755
I'll do your back.

347
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,760
I'll do your front.

348
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,419
You son of a bitch.

349
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,070
- Lola?
- Yeah.

350
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,603
- He hid it in a black jewelry box.
- Good job.

351
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,977
Thank you.

352
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,948
Talented masseuse.

353
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:33,944
You get rid of it this time.

354
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,509
I will.

355
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,323
Good evening.
May I take your order?

356
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,317
No, thank you.
I just lost my appetite.

357
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,622
Just as well.

358
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,493
I don't take orders from criminals,
I arrest them.

359
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,157
Or fall asleep trying.

360
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,395
So you're admitting you were there.

361
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,438
No. I read about it in the papers,
just like everyone else.

362
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,496
You're famous.

363
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,865
I'm a punchline.

364
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:02,607
But like my grandma used to say,
he who laughs last laughs loudest.

365
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,444
By the way,
return that movie, would you?

366
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,108
The store called.

367
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,913
I haven't finished it yet.

368
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,114
They catch the thief,
but it's not who you think it is.

369
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,157
I don't like those twist endings.

370
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,658
Well, we don't like you.

371
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,455
Aw w.

372
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,517
Lola.

373
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,655
They're playing your song.

374
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,724
Why don't you take Stanley
for a dance?

375
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,360
He's feeling lonely.

376
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,133
And I am feeling charitable.

377
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,341
Let's go, Stan.

378
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,635
Really?

379
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,237
I'll try to have her back by dawn.

380
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,022
Constable...

381
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,330
Can I help you?

382
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,196
I wanna talk to Mooré.

383
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,599
Get out of the way.

384
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,502
Monsieur Mooré is currently socializing.

385
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,507
Interrupting a man's leisure
is harassment.

386
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,941
That's not harassment.

387
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,609
You feel that?

388
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,944
- Ooh.
- That's harassment.

389
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:15,146
And you tell your boss
this is just the beginning.

390
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,553
I have two hands,
and I can't be bought.

391
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,612
Ooh.

392
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,326
Excuse me, constable.
May I have a word with you?

393
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:38,735
<i>Audrey, where you get that sugar?</i>

394
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,937
Listen, Stan,
I know what you're doing.

395
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:45,073
But if you drag Max into your game,
he will not lose.

396
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,175
Eventually, they all lose.

397
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,844
Not my Max.

398
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,354
Do yourself a favor...
leave us alone.

399
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,416
We're just a couple of retirees
trying to enjoy the island life.

400
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,986
All the same, I'll stick around,
see what develops.

401
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,660
Excuse me.

402
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,394
In a second, honey.
You'll get your chance.

403
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,266
Damn, I got the stink on me tonight.

404
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,067
Step off the dance floor, sir.

405
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,341
Hey!

406
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,137
- Have fun, Stan.
- Hey. Lola!

407
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,838
Police.
Raise your hands, sir.

408
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,611
I'm law.
Federal B.I.?

409
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,488
It is illegal on this island to carry
a concealed weapon without a permit.

410
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,188
I'm working a suspect.

411
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,962
Are you not supposed to inform
local authorities when you arrive,

412
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,526
Agent Stanley P. Lloyd?

413
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,002
- You know him?
- He's my suspect.

414
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:48,307
Well, we're still gonna have to
take this to the station and register it.

415
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,677
You're letting the criminal go.

416
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,942
This is crazy.

417
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,574
You think this is crazy?

418
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,449
Your dancing, <i>that</i> was crazy.

419
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,078
This way, Agent Lloyd.

420
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,123
Welcome to paradise.

421
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,357
Okay.

422
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,365
- The watermarks and holograms match.
- Oh.

423
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,560
But I still have to register the gun.

424
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,866
You have a nice smile.

425
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,774
I haven't smiled at you.

426
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,471
You will.

427
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,450
That's just the way I feel about it,
and they have to deal with it.

428
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,542
Yes, sir.

429
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,652
Ah, Sophie.

430
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,552
I need to speak to you.

431
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,217
I'm getting complaints
about you bothering Henri Mooré.

432
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,283
Just doing my job, Zacharias.

433
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,420
The man is practically
the unofficial mayor of the island.

434
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,123
In one year, he's made
everyone here like him,

435
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,063
something you haven't been
able to do in a lifetime.

436
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,897
I guess we can't all be
the kiss-ass politician you are.

437
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,571
I want you to stay behind tonight
so we can discuss your attitude.

438
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,301
You knew about my attitude
the day we got married

439
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,865
and knew about it
the day we got divorced.

440
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,776
You're not gonna learn
any more about it tonight.

441
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:58,782
Besides, I have plans
with Special Agent Lloyd of the FBI.

442
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,875
He's just arrived on the island.

443
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,747
Is that so?

444
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,646
Shall we?

445
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,384
We shall.

446
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,857
She's feisty.

447
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,427
Mmm. Isn't it beautiful?

448
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:24,001
Yeah.

449
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,906
Is it enough?

450
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,875
Of course it is.

451
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:46,128
Some people say the only way
to rid yourself of temptation

452
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,290
is to yield to it.

453
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,197
I don't know about that.

454
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:59,266
I say turn your back on temptation...

455
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:05,311
...or substitute something
more tempting.

456
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,929
See how easy that was?

457
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,576
What's the shortest amount of time
you've ever known a guy

458
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:37,172
before you kissed him?

459
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,580
I see what you're thinking,
and you can forget it.

460
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:44,554
Guys come down to this island looking
for a slice of paradise with a local girl,

461
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,954
and they will say anything to get it.

462
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,654
I resent being lumped in with all guys,

463
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,960
though, admittedly,
I would say anything right now.

464
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:56,330
How long have you been chasing Max?

465
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:02,295
Seven years... ever since the first
Napoleon Diamond went missing.

466
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,433
I got to the scene,
took a few shots at the getaway car.

467
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,174
Next day, bottle of champagne arrives
at FBI Headquarters for me,

468
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:15,049
with a note says,
"Aim for the tires next time."

469
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,781
He was baiting you.

470
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,790
- Hmm.
- Is there a money trail?

471
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,850
Everything's plain...
taxes, bank accounts.

472
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,158
He doesn't buy
expensive paintings, yachts, nothing.

473
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:31,294
I think it's more about the challenge
and the alibi... that's his work of art.

474
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,200
Sounds like you admire him.

475
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,767
Would I like to live one day
in his velvety slippers?

476
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,275
Maybe.

477
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,209
But I don't admire him.

478
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,304
He's beat me too many times for that.

479
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,576
Maybe you need the female touch.

480
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,143
That's exactly what I need.

481
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,712
Listen, I want a big arrest,
you need local help.

482
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,157
I'll extend the FBI courtesy on this one.

483
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,592
As long as I'm riding shotgun.

484
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,530
What's going on?

485
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,697
I'm expanding the deck.

486
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,434
You're trying to stay busy.

487
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,671
Look, on this deck,
we are going to sit here

488
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,771
and watch sunsets until we get old.

489
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,107
Can't wait.

490
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,776
Where are you going?

491
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,376
You said I need a hobby.

492
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,444
I guess I'll go find one.

493
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:25,546
Really?

494
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,750
I'll call you later.

495
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,349
He's here.

496
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,092
The centerpiece of our exhibit.

497
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,625
Napoleon had three priceless diamonds
set into the hilt of his sword.

498
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,798
After his defeat, they were pried out
and dispersed around the globe.

499
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,833
This is one of the rare occasions the last
remaining diamond is on public display.

500
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,505
And next, we have
some rare Egyptian gems.

501
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,836
Cute little rock.

502
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,640
I'm just here to look.

503
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:55,838
Just as well.

504
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,213
With six cameras...
four stationary, two revolving,

505
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,047
a dozen I.R. Motion sensors...

506
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,781
Sixteen.
You missed the ones at ankle level.

507
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,323
Plus your standard
24-hour rotating guards.

508
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,882
Unbreakable polycarbonate display,

509
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,758
controlled by an uncopyable
magnetic key card.

510
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,726
I just realized...
you could never get it anyway.

511
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,433
You're right.

512
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,508
When you're right, you're right.

513
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,575
It's impossible.

514
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,391
Give me a ride.

515
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,620
I don't think so.

516
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,889
Maybe you should think again.

517
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:48,585
May I present Monsieur Henri Mooré.

518
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,626
Mr. Burdett.

519
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,787
It is a pleasure to meet you, sir.

520
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,764
Oh, you're an American.

521
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,392
Hmm. Henri Mooré?

522
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,436
Ah. My name is Henry Moore.

523
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,995
I placed the thing on the "e".

524
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,064
I felt it more appropriate
to my surroundings.

525
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,042
- Oh.
- Please.

526
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,139
I imagine you're wondering
why you're here.

527
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,150
Well...

528
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,618
Forgive Jean-Paul's tactics, Mr. Burdett,

529
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:21,181
but to put it bluntly, the impoverished
people of this island need your help.

530
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,283
Hmm.

531
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,795
Five years ago, I was
a successful businessman in Detroit.

532
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,990
While vacationing on this island,

533
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,193
I was sitting on the beach
drinking a...

534
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,133
Citron martini.

535
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,007
I don't recall what I was drinking...
it's not important.

536
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,872
But I experienced a revelation...

537
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:43,073
that I had been brought to this island to
provide the commensurate social services

538
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,378
that were sadly lacking
for the poorer elements of society here.

539
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,420
And you want me to buy a table
at your next fundraiser.

540
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,284
No, Mr. Burdett.

541
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,187
But I am offering you the opportunity

542
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,159
to participate in the vital growth
of my infrastructure.

543
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,593
Uh-huh. How's that?

544
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,097
I want you to steal me that diamond.

545
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,196
I'm not a criminal.

546
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,567
Right. Neither am I.

547
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,162
Good.
Then we understand each other.

548
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,673
- Yes.
- Yeah.

549
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,902
Let me show you around, Mr. Burdett.

550
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,975
Do you think it fair
that the indigenous of this island

551
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,848
are not allowed to enter the casinos
unless they work there?

552
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,721
Why is it that only the rich should enjoy

553
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,022
pharmaceutically-assisted moments
of personal introspection?

554
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:33,825
The safety and security found
in owning your own machine gun.

555
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,163
The pleasures derived

556
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:40,534
from financially-procured
female companionship.

557
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:46,004
The underprivileged should not be
denied these essential diversions.

558
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,375
I mean, look around you, Mr. Burdett.

559
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,038
No one is turned away.

560
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,613
All I do, I do for the people.

561
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,276
And why do you need
the diamond for that?

562
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,616
I have an urgent need to expand
my humanitarian program.

563
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,921
A cash injection
in the tens of millions of dollars

564
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,791
would relieve the entire Caribbean.

565
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,729
What I'm suggesting
is a partnership, Mr. Burdett.

566
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,030
You are a stranger to this island.

567
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,071
I can give you what you don't have...

568
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:20,270
access to the marina, the crews,
rotation schedules, whatever you need.

569
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,364
I couldn't sleep.
Didn't wanna wake you.

570
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,141
I saw you on the ship yesterday.

571
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,503
I had a feeling you might be there, too.

572
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,851
Don't you ever feel
we weren't quite finished?

573
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,259
Look, Max, I miss it, too.

574
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,263
We were great.

575
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,699
And we went out
at the top of our game, undefeated.

576
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,066
The best time to quit.

577
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,363
Maybe.

578
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,601
Max, I cased it.

579
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,204
It's not a one man job, and there's
no way you're pulling me into it.

580
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,748
We're retired.

581
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,013
Now the challenge is
to find joy in simple things.

582
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,714
And I like that challenge.

583
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,408
Yeah?

584
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,543
I lied on the ship.

585
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,052
I <i>could</i> get it.

586
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,110
<i>Here's how.</i>

587
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,884
<i>I'd cut the camera feed</i>
<i>and go in from behind the exhibit.</i>

588
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,927
It's blowable from the storage room,
and I'd do it after 10 P.M.

589
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,655
Why?

590
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,630
The retired arthritic cops
always get that shift.

591
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,534
So that's how you do it.

592
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,069
And now I've told you.

593
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,264
So now I can't.

594
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,811
Oh, my God.

595
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,013
- What are you doing?
- I'm cooking.

596
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,181
- Since when?
- This morning.

597
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,918
We are decent law-abiding people,

598
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,961
and decent law-abiding people
cook omelets for breakfast.

599
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,921
Oh.

600
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,230
State your business.

601
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,732
<i>You almost had me last night</i>

602
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,168
<i>with that old David Copperfield</i>
<i>smoke and mirrors trick.</i>

603
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:04,435
"Look at my assistant with the big tits
while I take the Rolex right off your wrist."

604
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,600
What do you want about her?

605
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,541
I wanna know
how you're really gonna do it,

606
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,637
and you're gonna tell me
while we're fishing.

607
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:11,909
Fishing?

608
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,313
I don't fish.

609
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,318
I got a boat stacked with beer.

610
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,375
Drink it yourself.

611
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,388
<i>You might as well come.</i>
<i>You're paying for it.</i>

612
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,321
<i>I charged it to my suite.</i>

613
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,951
All the same, Stanley, I'll pass.

614
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,051
There is an option.

615
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:28,030
I get the local police to bring you down
to the station, we sweat you there.

616
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,327
<i>And I do mean sweat.</i>

617
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,767
<i>There's no air conditioning,</i>
<i>so dress light.</i>

618
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,771
The eggs on this island taste funny.

619
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,364
They must have some weird chickens.

620
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,341
<i>What'll it be, Max?</i>

621
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,470
I'll see you soon.

622
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,386
Tell me this isn't better
than standing in some lineup.

623
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,861
I've never been in a lineup.

624
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,059
Ooh, that's a hell of a watch.

625
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,400
What's that kind of thing run you?

626
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,599
A couple of grand.

627
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,938
Why don't you pick one up
on the Bureau's expense account?

628
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:19,073
Oh, they keep me on a real tight leash.

629
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,845
I got you to thank for that.

630
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,317
Ah.

631
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,179
Whoo! It's cookin' out here.

632
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,355
So if I didn't shoot you,
where'd you get the screen door?

633
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,355
Knitting accident.

634
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,512
Dab some of this on my back, will you?

635
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,139
Are you serious?

636
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,012
Yeah. I've got delicate skin.
I don't wanna burn.

637
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:02,519
I bet you were the best kid in the
neighborhood at hide-and-seek, huh?

638
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,890
So you joined the Bureau.

639
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,327
Yeah, I found them all.

640
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,761
No one ever found me.

641
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:14,800
Once I found a good spot,
I'd stay there for days.

642
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,264
There you go.

643
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,871
Now, turn around.
I'll do you.

644
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,038
I'll handle it.

645
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,944
No, come on.
You're gonna burn.

646
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,118
Good.

647
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,216
Okay.

648
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,057
There. That's good.

649
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,960
Wait. Don't you want me
to coat everything?

650
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,464
That's good. My pole.

651
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,330
No way, man!
I'm only doing your back!

652
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,390
My pole!

653
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,834
Hey, we got something.
Come on.

654
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:47,962
Oh, oh, oh. Look at this!

655
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,869
Oh. We got something here, Stanley.

656
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,929
Ooh! Aah!

657
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,033
Shit! Come on!

658
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,702
Come on! Help me pull it up.

659
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,746
Don't lose it, don't lose it!

660
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,049
- It's a monster.
- We can do it!

661
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,211
This is big.
Okay, come on, pull!

662
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,754
- Are <i>you</i> pulling?
- I'm pulling, man.

663
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:05,846
Jesus Christ!

664
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,721
Stanley!
One, two, three!

665
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,692
Oh! Aah!

666
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,553
Jesus Christ!

667
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,257
It's a shark, it's a shark.

668
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,355
Yeah.

669
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,926
Why is it not moving?

670
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,096
- Maybe it's in shock.
- What do you wanna do?

671
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,867
Maybe it's dead.
I mean, it looks dead.

672
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,770
Go over and shake it.

673
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,074
- Why me?
- Well, you're FBI.

674
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,636
What's that have to do with anything?

675
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,512
If it bites your arm off,
you get disability for the rest of your life.

676
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,881
- Go!
- <i>You</i> hooked it.

677
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,044
<i>You</i> go see if it's alive.

678
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,781
Yeah, I hooked it,
so <i>you</i> go see if it's alive.

679
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,117
- Go!
- Hey, hey!

680
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:42,090
Oh, okay.
Here I go.

681
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,125
I'm just gonna sneak up on it.

682
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:46,887
Why are you whispering?

683
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,829
So it won't know the plan.

684
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,191
Hey.

685
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,972
- Aah!
- Aah! Shit!

686
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,567
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

687
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,175
You have the right to remain silent!

688
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,550
Yeah, it's dead.

689
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,219
Yeah.

690
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,173
Look at them.

691
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,549
If you didn't know any better,
you'd think they were friends.

692
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,555
You must be Lola.

693
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,281
Sophie?

694
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,352
Nice gun.

695
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,791
Sig Sauer P228.

696
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,726
Custom trigger action.

697
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,922
Oh.

698
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,625
- Nice shoes.
- Thank you.

699
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,860
- Chanel?
- Cruz collection.

700
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,360
How bad was it?

701
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,901
Oh, not too bad.

702
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,975
Sophie seems nice.

703
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,010
Yeah, for a cop.

704
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,944
Lola seems cool.

705
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,142
For a thief.

706
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,832
Yes!

707
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,495
I resign. You win.

708
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,972
Make a wish.

709
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,942
Okay.

710
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,309
I wish you'd write your vows.

711
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:57,924
<i>I'm so tense.</i>

712
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,156
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Let me relax you.</i>

713
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,028
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Why are you taking off your clothes?</i>

714
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,158
Now we're talkin'.

715
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,792
<i>Are you being naughty?</i>

716
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,461
<i>Naughty enough to spank.</i>

717
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,938
Oh, yeah!

718
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,033
<i>I'll bite you.</i>
<i>Can I bite you?</i>

719
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,635
<i>The door.</i>
<i>Are we expecting anyone?</i>

720
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,806
<i>Yeah. A friend.</i>

721
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,576
- <i>A friend?</i>
- A friend?

722
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,912
<i>A girlfriend.</i>

723
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,042
<i>You didn't.</i>

724
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,586
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

725
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,248
<i>You know I'll do anything for you.</i>

726
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,751
<i>Wait here.</i>

727
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,351
<i>What's she gonna do?</i>

728
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,855
Tell him.
Tell him.

729
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,059
<i>She's gonna help me relax you.</i>

730
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,658
<i>You're kidding.</i>

731
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,494
Nice.

732
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,163
<i>You're gonna like this.</i>

733
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,570
Lucky bastard.

734
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,699
- <i>Who is she?</i>
- <i>You'll see.</i>

735
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:50,473
<i>Max, I'd like you to meet Stan's mom.</i>

736
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,315
<i>Night, Stan.</i>

737
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,521
Son of a...

738
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,182
You're only in port 48 more hours.

739
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,948
Stay on high alert.

740
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,990
Agent Lloyd, we have the most sophisticated
security system

741
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,549
ever installed on a seagoing vessel.

742
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,026
And you'll need it.

743
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:13,957
Excuse me, sir.

744
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,866
There's been a security breach.

745
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,417
Don't move!

746
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,886
Turn around.

747
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,324
Turn around!

748
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,295
- No!
- Stan!

749
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,201
Damn it.

750
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,647
The other side!

751
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,324
Just stop him!

752
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,798
Let's do it, come on!

753
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,716
<i>Although the famed</i>
<i>Napoleon Diamond was undisturbed,</i>

754
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,556
<i>the unknown intruder knocked out</i>

755
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,256
<i>a</i> Seven Seas Navigator
<i>maintenance worker,</i>

756
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:30,664
<i>stole his uniform,</i>
<i>and slipped onto the ship.</i>

757
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,506
You're cheating on me, aren't you?

758
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,742
What are you talking about?

759
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,681
Maybe not with a woman,
but with a diamond.

760
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:48,440
You want her.

761
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,509
And I'm jealous.

762
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,612
You've got nothing to worry about.

763
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,554
Where were you tonight, Max?

764
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:58,526
I've been home, writing my vows.

765
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:59,584
Oh! Let me see.

766
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,723
Sorry.
You have to wait.

767
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,827
Well, I'm not gonna let
that little bitch take my man.

768
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,563
I'm gonna fight for what's mine.

769
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:08,729
Really?

770
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,239
And how exactly are you gonna do that?

771
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,866
I'm a thief.

772
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,244
I know a thing or two about distraction.

773
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:24,380
It's a beautiful jewel, Max.

774
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:29,519
But I guarantee you,
it's no fun in the tub.

775
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:33,820
Mmm.

776
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:37,294
I had him.
You shoulda stayed out of my way.

777
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,767
I didn't want you to get hurt.
I'm sorry.

778
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:42,634
You're the one who's hurt.
You should ice that.

779
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,038
Why are men always trying
to protect women?

780
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,006
'Cause you smell good.

781
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,738
It's all about sex, isn't it?

782
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,440
Why can't we just be
two cops working a case?

783
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,210
Hey, I happen to agree with you.

784
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,342
From now on,
we're just partners on this.

785
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,579
Fine.

786
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,951
- So, let's have dinner and discuss it.
- No, thanks.

787
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,421
How about a steam?

788
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:03,926
What... l... no, I always steam
with my partners.

789
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,152
Okay, you wanna go
for a Jacuzzi, partner?

790
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,790
I have a big tub in my room.

791
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,471
We have to talk.

792
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:27,278
Max. Great timing.
Ride with us.

793
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,011
Can we just do this one on one?

794
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,519
Oh, of course.

795
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:35,316
<i>California dreaming...</i>

796
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,987
Are you familiar with the pleasures
of anonymous love, Max?

797
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,488
No.

798
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:46,263
Recently I found myself experimenting
with alternative lifestyle parameters

799
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,531
based largely
on the free love philosophy

800
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,699
as found in the collected works
of The Mamas and The Papas.

801
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:54,503
I never made that connection.

802
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:55,704
Oh, it's there.

803
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,543
That Michelle Phillips,
she could walk it like she talked it.

804
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,981
Earl, burn one of my CDs for Max.

805
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,575
Yes, sir.

806
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,221
This is it, Max.

807
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,630
My vision.

808
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,096
My infrastructure growing
before our eyes.

809
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:23,098
It used to be a children's hospital,

810
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:27,041
but I'm revitalizing it
into a paramilitary training facility.

811
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,841
More importantly,
that ship is leaving in two days.

812
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,473
What's this?

813
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:36,917
Everything you need.

814
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,682
Schematics, detailed plan.

815
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,781
You can do it yourself.

816
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,485
Go in through the air conditioning vents.

817
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,463
The exhibit is accessible
from the storage facility behind it.

818
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:51,763
There's cameras there, so you're
gonna have to cut the central feed.

819
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,564
Red wires in the control panel here.

820
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,902
If you don't cut the red wire,
they'll see everything.

821
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,601
- What next?
- Blow the wall.

822
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,075
- C-4?
- Uh-uh.

823
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,908
I'd use a shape charge
with a detonation cord.

824
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,414
Smaller but more effective.

825
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:10,681
And... you'd wanna blow it
after 10 P.M.

826
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,848
- Why is that?
- Graveyard shift.

827
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,654
Always the retired cops
with arthritis.

828
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,421
That's how I'd do it.

829
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,219
Then that's how I'll do it.

830
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,798
You know, we're not
partners anymore, Max.

831
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:30,098
In fact, you see me,
cross the street.

832
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,253
<i>You gotta go</i>

833
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,163
<i>Go where you wanna go</i>

834
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,168
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

835
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:03,400
<i>With whoever</i>
<i>you wanna do it with</i>

836
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:06,271
<i>You gotta go</i>
<i>where you wanna go</i>

837
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,607
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

838
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:12,876
<i>With whoever</i>
<i>you wanna do it with</i>

839
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:18,512
<i>You don't understand</i>
<i>that a girl like...</i>

840
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,484
Good afternoon. Atlantis.
How may I help?

841
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,924
Mr. Lloyd,
the Bridge Suite, please.

842
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,451
<i>Hello.</i>

843
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:27,928
- Stanley.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

844
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,694
- It's Max, just checking in.
- <i>Cut the crap, Max.</i>

845
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,167
<i>You're making sure I'm in my room</i>
<i>and not following you.</i>

846
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:36,103
How could you be following me
if you're in your room?

847
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,663
- See you soon, Stanley.
- <i>Okay.</i>

848
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,269
Hello!

849
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,436
What?

850
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:24,836
What?

851
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:28,111
If you're gonna forward your calls,
don't tail me so close.

852
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,954
Aah!

853
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,091
Hey.

854
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,996
I heard the call
over the radio.

855
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,332
Every year there's one white boy
that goes down at Junkanoo.

856
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,472
Here's what I found out.
Max closed escrow,

857
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,202
and then a month later
the cruise booked the diamond.

858
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,642
- Maybe he <i>is</i> retired.
- I doubt it.

859
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,475
He met with Henri Mooré today,

860
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,640
the biggest gangster on the island.

861
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,415
Thanks for coming.

862
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,421
You know, this one
you really do have to ice.

863
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,889
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

864
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:19,722
Better?

865
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,122
There's another one here.

866
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:25,723
Now?

867
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:28,236
This one's particularly painful.

868
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:36,437
There's some referred pain.
It's somewhere around... here.

869
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,780
I'll have to get hurt more often.

870
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,343
And in more interesting places.

871
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,243
- Oh, God, I'm vibrating!
- So am I.

872
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,973
No. No, no.

873
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,174
- I'm getting a call.
- What?

874
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,376
Is nothing sacred?

875
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,611
Shit, I have to go.

876
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:19,621
Go? No, you can't go.
I just unwrapped my head.

877
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,350
Sorry, I need a rain check.

878
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,824
What, are you crazy?
It never rains here.

879
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,019
Just give me five minutes, all right?

880
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,654
Five minutes?
You should be embarrassed.

881
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,027
Okay, three.

882
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:31,191
Oh, Stan, come on.

883
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,827
Okay, two!
Please don't make me beg. Please.

884
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,200
A quick two?

885
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,933
Oh, don't worry, I'm quick.

886
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:05,756
Hello.

887
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,666
Mr. Burdett, it's Luc from the bar.

888
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,900
There's a guest down here
that's bombed that's shouting your name.

889
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,875
Welcome to paradise, Frank!

890
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:21,547
Well, it's only paradise
for criminals, like Max Burdett.

891
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:25,486
Yeah. I hear him.
I'll be right there.

892
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:30,525
- Where'd he go?
- Over there.

893
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:31,992
Oh, thanks, Luc.

894
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,626
What are you doing to yourself?
What's wrong?

895
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:37,791
- Nothing.
- Nothing's wrong?

896
01:00:39,736 --> 01:00:42,000
Me and Sophie hooked up.

897
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,936
And it was beautiful.

898
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,806
But it's only gonna
last for one more day.

899
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,207
Why is that?

900
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,905
Because the ship's only gonna
be here 24 more hours,

901
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,709
and you're gonna clip Napoleon III

902
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:54,716
and make me look
like a jerk again.

903
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,421
- I'll have another one!
- You've had enough.

904
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,355
You are not my daddy.

905
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:05,826
I didn't take you as an umbrella
kind of guy, Stan.

906
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,920
These remoras really have
a kick to 'em.

907
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,090
Hey, Stan, buck up.
You're a good agent.

908
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,100
No, I'm not.

909
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,137
You know, I used to blame you,
but now I see it clearly.

910
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,638
It's not you, it's me.

911
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,607
You've got genius, man.

912
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:24,113
If I had an ounce
of what you have, I'd never stop.

913
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,946
You've got a gift, man.
It's inspiring.

914
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,947
I love these remoras!

915
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,013
Bartender! Give me another one!

916
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,330
It's okay, Stan.
It's okay.

917
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,961
Luc, you're not working tonight, right?
Give us a hand here.

918
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,800
Come on, Stan,
here you go. Come on.

919
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,965
Here you go, buddy.
Yeah.

920
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:54,867
Come on, come on.

921
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,602
What about me?!

922
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,815
That's it, Stanley.

923
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,544
Here you go.

924
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:03,915
That's it.

925
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,550
That's it. Here we go.

926
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,494
You tell anyone I tucked him in,
I'll kill you.

927
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:27,040
- Sure thing, Mr. Burdett.
- Call me Max.

928
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,907
- Max.
- Okay.

929
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:57,800
Lola!

930
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,502
It's locked.
And don't try to break in.

931
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:01,736
You're not welcome.

932
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,673
I finished the deck.

933
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:09,149
You promised to spend
the first sunset on it together.

934
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,516
- Lola.
- That's not all.

935
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:13,913
I found your notebook.

936
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,883
Lola.

937
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,553
I'll sit down right now
and write my vows, okay?

938
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:27,327
The vows are not for me,
they're for you.

939
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,566
You have to figure out if what
we have means anything to you.

940
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:34,937
Come on, Max.

941
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,772
Do you really think the third one's
gonna make you whole?

942
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:44,314
- I don't know.
- Well, don't come back until you do.

943
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:48,079
Where am I supposed to go?

944
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:53,888
She threw me out.

945
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,163
Why is it my problem?

946
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,701
'Cause every hotel
on the island is booked.

947
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:07,474
Can I move
this surveillance stuff?

948
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:10,774
Don't mess with it!
It's very expensive.

949
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:15,314
Listen, I'm not gonna
sleep on the floor.

950
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:18,217
Well, I guess you're
out of luck.

951
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:19,686
We both are.

952
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,987
Move over.

953
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:28,687
Shit.

954
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:40,741
So what'd you do?

955
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,470
I missed our first sunset
on her new deck.

956
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:47,841
That's it?

957
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,917
I'm no good at sunsets.

958
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,623
Of course you're not.

959
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:06,027
The world is divided up between people
who like to watch the sunset

960
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:07,467
and those who don't.

961
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,503
Yeah.

962
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,405
People like you
are never happy.

963
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:17,378
You're anxious, type-A, egocentric
perfectionists who can't sit still

964
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:21,405
and die alone with a million bucks
and a thousand regrets.

965
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,014
The people who can relax,
enjoy the sunset,

966
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:29,387
hold hands at the end of the day...
they're the happy ones.

967
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,060
So why can't you do that?

968
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,434
Because of you.

969
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,138
Don't hog the blanket.

970
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,182
- Good night, Max.
- Good night.

971
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:42,489
You know, the Bureau's got
a "don't ask, don't tell" policy,

972
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,499
but this is pushing it, Stan.

973
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,035
Kowalski, Stafford.

974
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,092
Sophie?

975
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,764
The L.A. Office got a call
from Inspector Bethel here.

976
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,173
He wanted to know the scope
of the FBI's operation on the island.

977
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,370
Since we don't have
an operation on the island,

978
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,242
we felt we'd
come here and check it out.

979
01:06:58,314 --> 01:06:59,781
What's he talking about, Stan?

980
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,077
Let me explain.

981
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,641
He's on suspension.
He has been for three months.

982
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:04,845
Suspension?

983
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,514
He was deemed unstable
after he lost Napoleon II.

984
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,080
You told me
you were here on the case.

985
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:10,648
I am here on the case,

986
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:14,389
and once I bust this guy,
get reinstated, upped,

987
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:15,930
these slobs will be saluting me.

988
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,329
Are you guys dating?

989
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,300
He's nothing but a suspect to me.

990
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,996
- Oh, really?
- That's not what these show.

991
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,301
Your suspect's paying
for this suite.

992
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,931
And the seaweed body wraps.

993
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:27,771
You two look pretty chummy.

994
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,746
So you lied to me, Stan.

995
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,648
And you got your
slice of paradise, hmm?

996
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,345
I hope it was everything
you thought it would be.

997
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:39,683
Sophie...

998
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:42,986
You might want to do more
of a background check next time

999
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,651
before you partner up.

1000
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,532
She didn't have to be
so hard on you, you know?

1001
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,228
Storming out like that.

1002
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:56,168
She's got grounds.

1003
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:59,366
The thing you gotta understand
about us law enforcement types

1004
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,672
is we don't much
appreciate lying.

1005
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,736
Come on, Stan, you fibbed,
maybe withheld a little.

1006
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,304
But lie? Nah.

1007
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:11,585
You are an FBI agent
working a case.

1008
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,715
You know, when you put it like that,
it doesn't sound so bad.

1009
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,690
I could explain it to her.

1010
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,226
What about you?

1011
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,729
You are a hell of a catch.

1012
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,231
I've seen the way
you are with Lola.

1013
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,528
You love that girl.

1014
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,229
So you're working out
some personal issues.

1015
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,272
All you need is a little support.

1016
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:31,499
Exactly.

1017
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,940
Hell, I could
make her understand.

1018
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,877
Max can't eat, can't sleep.

1019
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,887
He's like an injured bird.

1020
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,253
Stan's hurt.
He's in pain.

1021
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:50,087
He's like a wounded dog.

1022
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,889
He needs you, Lola.
You're his better half.

1023
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,259
Just give him one more chance.

1024
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,264
He's a good guy, Sophie.

1025
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:59,733
I'm sure he's a liar,
but that comes with the job.

1026
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,537
I don't know.
This is all a bit strange.

1027
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,335
What do you think, Lola?

1028
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,898
- I don't buy a word of it.
- I'm with you.

1029
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,308
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1030
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:10,709
- Listen, hear us out.
- Come on, one second.

1031
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:11,768
Look...

1032
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,478
Tonight the lies stop.

1033
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,042
He's serious. It's over.

1034
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,816
He's not chasin' it,
and I'm not chasin' him.

1035
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:24,417
I'm sorry, but I won't believe you
until that ship is gone.

1036
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,552
And we still got a few hours
before she sails.

1037
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:28,824
Look, I can't make
that ship disappear tonight,

1038
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,229
but I can make us disappear.

1039
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:33,700
- What are you talking about?
- I found a hobby.

1040
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:37,401
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell me about this.

1041
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,338
When we come up for air,

1042
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:43,310
that ship will be headed to Paris
and the diamond will be gone forever.

1043
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:07,633
So, where you taking us?

1044
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,933
We're headed to a hidden reef
where there's rumored to be

1045
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,496
100 million in gold
somewhere among the wreckage.

1046
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,673
You're kidding.

1047
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:18,971
Wow!

1048
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,811
Look at this.

1049
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,943
Yeah, these ships have
been down here since the '40s,

1050
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:26,385
but nobody's ever
found any gold.

1051
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,390
Well, maybe with the help
of the FBI we'll get lucky.

1052
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,290
My money's on Max.

1053
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:36,422
100 million four ways...
that's 25 million a piece if we split it.

1054
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,068
Have any idea where to start?

1055
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:46,869
It could be anywhere down here.
Let's split up, look around.

1056
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:52,911
You guys sure this is safe?
I'm allergic to shellfish.

1057
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,679
You've got nothing to worry about.
I've seen how you handle sharks.

1058
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:28,575
When we get back,
I'm buying everyone umbrella drinks.

1059
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:39,325
Hey, little guy,
have you seen any gold down here?

1060
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,700
Hey, Max, I'm counting on you
to make me a rich man.

1061
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,743
Lola, hypothetically speaking,

1062
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,684
what's it like to hold
25 million in your hands?

1063
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:40,921
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1064
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:42,713
Right.

1065
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:00,373
- Good night, old-timer.
- Eat shit.

1066
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:41,545
What the hell is that?

1067
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,248
There is an intruder
in Storage Facility B.

1068
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:49,449
- <i>Attempted break-in in progress.</i>
- Son of a bitch!

1069
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:52,016
<i>All security</i>
<i>to Storage Facility B.</i>

1070
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:16,635
<i>Hey, Max.</i>

1071
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,504
What's up?

1072
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,516
Where are you?

1073
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:25,075
Oh, I'm somewhere inside the ship.

1074
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:28,452
Oh, yeah, me too.
Thanks, that helps a lot.

1075
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,891
Max, did you say
you were <i>inside</i> the ship?

1076
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:35,085
Yeah, it's amazing.

1077
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:38,360
Hmm. Really?
What do you see?

1078
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:42,301
<i>It's pretty dark.</i>
<i>I think I'm in the captain's quarters.</i>

1079
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,032
That's interesting.

1080
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:53,706
Max, suddenly I don't feel like
having an umbrella drink.

1081
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,556
I'm beginning to think we're gonna
go home empty-handed.

1082
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,155
Where are you, Max?
I'm gonna come hunt with you a while.

1083
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,497
I'm coming to you.

1084
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:17,137
How you see me?
I cut the red wire.

1085
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:21,369
Ah, nice work, genius.
You cut the heating to the Jacuzzi.

1086
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,239
<i>Max, you at the stern?</i>

1087
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,747
<i>Max?</i>

1088
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,783
<i>Stan Lloyd to Max Burdett.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

1089
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,222
Who'd he think he was,
the Invisible Man?

1090
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,531
Dear God.

1091
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,729
Shit.

1092
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,931
It was a diversion.
Get back to the diamond!

1093
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,899
<i>Max, where are you?</i>

1094
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:03,574
<i>Will you answer me?</i>

1095
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:04,949
<i>Hello!</i>

1096
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,317
There!

1097
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:16,387
He's in the vents!
He got the diamond!

1098
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,126
Max, what was that?

1099
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,895
<i>Max!</i>

1100
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,799
I think he left his radio.

1101
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,270
I thought I heard
something else.

1102
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:27,273
<i>Where'd you go?</i>
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

1103
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:45,493
Nice costume.

1104
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,354
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1105
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:52,523
<i>Party all the time,</i>
<i>party all the time</i>

1106
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:55,069
<i>Party all the time</i>

1107
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:58,231
<i>My girl wants</i>
<i>to party all the time...</i>

1108
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,831
Go back to your cabin, please.

1109
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,237
Aha, there you are!

1110
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,574
Hey, Max, come on.

1111
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,842
Last night we were spooning.
Now you're running away?

1112
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,641
<i>Come on!</i>

1113
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,517
Yoo-hoo, Max.

1114
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:33,298
Oh, I get it.
A little hide-and-seek.

1115
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,645
Like I told you on the boat,
I caught 'em all.

1116
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,825
You're good,
but you're not that good.

1117
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:05,362
You know what they say...
the FBI always gets their man.

1118
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:10,301
Max!

1119
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:12,107
I'm having an air problem!

1120
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:14,979
Stan, are you okay?

1121
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,917
I can't breathe! Help!

1122
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,354
Where are you, Stan?

1123
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:25,886
I'm coming, Stan.

1124
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:28,759
It's okay, Stan.
I'm right here.

1125
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,092
Take off your mask.

1126
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,092
I got him, honey.

1127
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,794
I'm right here.

1128
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,703
You're okay, Stan.

1129
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:41,033
Nothing to worry about, partner.

1130
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:49,481
I saw my life flash
before my eyes.

1131
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,917
Leave it to me to get
the faulty regulator.

1132
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,455
You know,
I never dove before.

1133
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:58,186
- I would like to propose a toast.
- What are we celebrating?

1134
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:00,051
Retirement.

1135
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,325
- I'll drink to that.
- Good.

1136
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,527
Hello.

1137
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:11,535
What?

1138
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:12,937
How?

1139
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:15,902
- What's wrong?
- The diamond's been stolen.

1140
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,912
- What?
- Half an hour ago.

1141
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,276
You set us up.

1142
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:24,545
Come on.

1143
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,086
This whole thing.

1144
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:30,056
You got your perfect alibi... me.

1145
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,888
Hey.

1146
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,723
Get your hands up.

1147
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,660
Are you serious?

1148
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,391
No wonder you just retired.

1149
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:40,662
You don't have
anything left to steal.

1150
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:42,430
I've got to get to the ship.

1151
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:44,500
You couldn't resist, could you?

1152
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,632
You had to screw me
one last time.

1153
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,336
You had to make an ass
out of me!

1154
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:59,616
Hey, Lola.
Lola, wait.

1155
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:09,821
Hey.

1156
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:16,429
You really did save me down there.

1157
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,641
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.
I was only trying to protect you.

1158
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:28,876
How generous of you.

1159
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,441
You were right, you know.
I couldn't do it without you.

1160
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:35,114
You gotta admit, though,
the look on Stan's face was sheer poetry.

1161
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,885
Shut up, Max.

1162
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,016
Hey.

1163
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,593
Lola, please.

1164
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:45,431
Max, I helped you
because I love you.

1165
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,229
But now I'm leaving you.

1166
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:57,144
Lola, I thought you'd
appreciate how I did it,

1167
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:00,306
you of all people.
Hey, hey.

1168
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,712
I do.
It was a smart plan, Max.

1169
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:08,051
You're a great thief.

1170
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:10,289
But I want a great man.

1171
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:18,756
Lola.

1172
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:22,801
Move inside.

1173
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:28,001
What, you thought this was over?
Turn around!

1174
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:33,212
I tried to deal with you
from an elevated place, man,

1175
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,749
appeal to your intellect,
spit poetry and shit at you.

1176
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:38,377
But no, man, you had to bring me
down to the gutter.

1177
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:39,613
Where is the diamond?

1178
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,350
- She's got nothing to do with this.
- Oh, she does now.

1179
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:44,688
You kill my dog,
I'm gonna slay your cat.

1180
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:46,192
Don't get...

1181
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:55,263
Aah!

1182
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,572
Nice throw, bitch!

1183
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,267
No!

1184
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:07,605
Where'd you come from?

1185
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:49,889
He asked me to help him steal it
a week ago. I turned him down.

1186
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,448
He must have stolen it himself,

1187
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,461
then he came back here
to make sure there were no loose ends.

1188
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:57,020
So why didn't you come to me,
tell me what they were planning?

1189
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:58,656
He said he'd kill us.

1190
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,428
You wouldn't have believed him anyway.

1191
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:02,595
You thought Mooré was
the Second Coming for this island.

1192
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,661
Don't tell me
what I think, woman.

1193
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,106
- Where's the diamond?
- I have no idea.

1194
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:11,339
- They were trying to frame us.
- Are we finished here?

1195
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,912
You know, I don't believe a word
of what you're saying.

1196
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:19,781
I know.

1197
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,372
Don't leave.

1198
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,169
Good luck, Max.

1199
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:09,892
Lola, wait.

1200
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:11,992
Hear me out.

1201
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:15,092
It's not gonna work, Max.
Not this time.

1202
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,662
I know it's too late,
but I finally wrote them. See?

1203
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,568
Lots of words.

1204
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:23,270
But I don't need to read them
because I know it by heart.

1205
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:28,013
I've spent my whole life chasing things
which I thought were valuable,

1206
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:31,483
when the only thing I really cared for
was right in front of me all along.

1207
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,686
You are my heart, Lola.

1208
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:39,488
From this moment on,
you are my only jewel.

1209
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:43,162
I want a life
filled with sunsets.

1210
01:26:43,231 --> 01:26:46,860
And I never wanna watch
one of them without you, not ever.

1211
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:55,672
The first diamond I've ever bought.

1212
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:02,245
I love you, Lola Cirillo.

1213
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,485
Marry me.

1214
01:27:15,997 --> 01:27:18,431
- On one condition.
- Anything.

1215
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,524
I want the receipt.

1216
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:31,801
Here you go, Luc.

1217
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:33,437
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1218
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:36,915
Jack on the rocks, with an umbrella.
What the hell, I'm celebrating.

1219
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:40,285
Forget the Jack on the rocks,
let's have remoras all around.

1220
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:41,845
Remoras all around.

1221
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,323
Stanley, what the hell
are you doing here?

1222
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:46,986
Well, I thought I'd stick around.

1223
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:50,824
Oh, yeah, look familiar?

1224
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:53,230
Treated myself,
maxed out the credit card.

1225
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:54,859
But it suits me,
don't you think?

1226
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,769
Well, it must take a bite
out of a government salary.

1227
01:27:57,839 --> 01:27:59,864
Ah, I can afford it all right.

1228
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,777
Come on, let's sip
our remoras and talk, shall we?

1229
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:23,887
I thought you said
these things have a kick.

1230
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,629
Luc, what's in this?

1231
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:32,002
Orange juice, mango juice,
grenadine, and coconut milk.

1232
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:34,664
No liquor?

1233
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:39,471
<i>Nada.</i>

1234
01:28:42,183 --> 01:28:44,549
I love these remoras!

1235
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,678
Bartender, give me another!

1236
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:55,228
You tell anyone I tucked him in,
I'll kill you.

1237
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,129
- Sure thing, Mr. Burdett.
- Call me Max.

1238
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,690
- Max.
- Okay.

1239
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:12,043
You know,
I really like that cove.

1240
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,888
Are you okay?
'Cause you don't look too good.

1241
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:31,555
As an underwater enthusiast, you should
know what a remora really is, Max.

1242
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:34,658
A remora is
kind of a stowaway,

1243
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:39,264
a suckerfish that sticks
to the shark's body and feeds off it.

1244
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,035
The shark does all the work,

1245
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:44,306
but the remora gets the spoils.

1246
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:57,988
You did it, Stan.

1247
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:02,262
Right from the start.

1248
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:05,664
It's the only one
you two haven't stolen.

1249
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:08,167
You set me up.

1250
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:11,069
I revel in it.
I revel in it!

1251
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:20,079
Could it be that the great
Max Burdett has finally lost?

1252
01:30:24,218 --> 01:30:25,515
No, I didn't.

1253
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,854
I got Lola.

1254
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,719
Congratulations, Stan.

1255
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,261
I'm looking at it right now.

1256
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:45,965
My plane takes off
in ten minutes.

1257
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,908
Tomorrow morning the bidding
w will start at $30 million,

1258
01:30:49,977 --> 01:30:52,707
and if I were you,
I'd bring cash.

1259
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:03,656
You win some,
you lose some.

1260
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:06,618
We still have the sunsets.

1261
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:09,956
Yeah.

1262
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:13,330
Don't worry,
one day you'll find a hobby.

1263
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:19,204
You know,
I think I already have.

1264
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:26,510
Bye-bye, paradise.

1265
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:33,542
No.

1266
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:37,348
No!

1267
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,992
Max!

1268
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:49,593
No, you bastard!

1269
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:57,076
Last time, right, Max?

1270
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:58,873
Last time.

1271
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:01,773
You son of a bitch!

1272
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,075
Max!

1273
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,085
If you want it,
come and get it

1274
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:07,142
I've got it

1275
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,449
Oh, whoa

1276
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:10,514
If you need it,
come and get it

1277
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:11,580
I've got it

1278
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:12,683
Oh, whoa

1279
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,990
If you want it,
come and get it

1280
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:16,154
I've got it

1281
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,219
Oh, whoa

1282
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,323
If you need it,
come and get it

1283
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:20,389
I've got it

1284
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:21,492
Ahh

1285
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:24,003
I'm a pro
when it comes to the getaway

1286
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:26,039
So don't even
try to follow me

1287
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:28,007
Bonnie and Clyde,
me and my lady

1288
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:30,475
Right on down
to the end of the story

1289
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,672
I'm wanted in so many countries

1290
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:34,977
Not even the feds can catch me

1291
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:36,277
'Cause I am made to run

1292
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:39,012
In this profession
there is no other like me

1293
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:41,247
If you want it,
come and get it

1294
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:42,346
I've got it

1295
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:43,412
Oh, whoa

1296
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:45,618
If you need it,
come and get it

1297
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:46,751
I've got it

1298
01:32:46,827 --> 01:32:47,851
Oh, whoa

1299
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:50,056
If you want it,
come and get it

1300
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:51,189
I've got it

1301
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:52,289
Oh, whoa

1302
01:32:52,366 --> 01:32:54,300
If you need it,
come and get it

1303
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:55,460
I've got it

1304
01:32:55,536 --> 01:32:56,594
Oh, yeah

1305
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,935
What you think you saw,
you did not see

1306
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:01,099
'Cause it's so easy for me

1307
01:33:01,175 --> 01:33:03,439
To get away
from sharks and security

1308
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:05,570
I love to challenge my ability

1309
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:07,876
So never underestimate me

1310
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:10,076
I'm versatile with agility

1311
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:12,381
Don't you be surprised
if you lose the prize

1312
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,182
'Cause I've done this before

1313
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,223
If you want it,
come and get it

1314
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:17,416
I've got it

1315
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:18,515
Oh, whoa

1316
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,652
If you need it,
come and get it

1317
01:33:20,728 --> 01:33:21,717
I've got it

1318
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:22,785
Oh, yeah

1319
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:25,225
Yo

1320
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:27,494
To all the ladies in the dance

1321
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:28,694
To each and every princess

1322
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:30,828
Hey, ah, ha, ah

1323
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:31,894
Yo, confess

1324
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:36,376
I lose all control when I see you
standing there in front of me

1325
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,139
Your style, your clothes, your hair

1326
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:40,874
Hey, woman, you look so sexy

1327
01:33:40,948 --> 01:33:42,813
The way you wind
and the way you dance

1328
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:45,351
And the way that you
twist and turn your waist

1329
01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:47,614
Leaves me wanting,
leaves me yearning

1330
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:49,815
Leaves me feeling for a taste

1331
01:33:49,890 --> 01:33:54,327
Before the end of the night

1332
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:57,887
I wanna hold you so tight

1333
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:58,954
So tight

1334
01:33:59,033 --> 01:34:02,491
You know I want you so much

1335
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:03,559
So much

1336
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,539
And I'm so tempted to touch

1337
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:07,869
Yo, uh, uh

1338
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:10,274
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

1339
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:12,369
My little woman,
man, I need you so much

1340
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:14,778
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

1341
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:16,908
My little woman,
man, I'm inside your clutch

1342
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,384
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

1343
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:21,580
My little woman,
man, I need you so much

1344
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,886
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

1345
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,256
My little woman,
man, I'm inside your clutch

1346
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:28,620
Yo

1347
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:30,789
To all the ladies in the dance

1348
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:32,093
I'm lookin' at these ladies

1349
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:35,226
Thinkin' about one of them
havin' my babies, huh

1350
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:36,894
I don't even know your name

1351
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:39,940
Little woman,
I don't even know your age

1352
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:41,565
But there's somethin' about you, girl

1353
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:43,667
When I see you winding
in front the stage

1354
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:44,733
I'm talkin' about you

1355
01:34:44,812 --> 01:34:46,302
Please forgive me,
please excuse me

1356
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,847
But there is nothing else
that a man can do

1357
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:48,939
Excuse me

1358
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:50,847
I can't help myself, little woman

1359
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:53,182
I just need to be next to you

1360
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:56,280
Before the end of the night

1361
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:57,756
Before the end of the night, huh

1362
01:34:57,825 --> 01:35:01,352
I wanna hold you so tight

1363
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:02,418
Wanna hold you

1364
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:05,431
You know I want you so much

1365
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:06,761
Want you so much, huh

1366
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:10,361
And I'm so tempted to touch

1367
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:11,427
Come on, huh

1368
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:13,632
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

1369
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,869
My little woman,
man, I need you so much

1370
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:18,241
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

1371
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:20,371
My little woman,
man, I'm inside your clutch

1372
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:22,746
Tempted to touch,
tempted to touch

1373
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:24,910
My little woman,
man, I need you so much

1374
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:28,284
Na na na-na-na-na na-na

1375
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:33,026
Na na na-na-na-na na-na

1376
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,857
Yeah

1377
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:37,989
She's got the touch
I love so much

1378
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:40,693
That's all I ever wanted

1379
01:35:40,768 --> 01:35:43,669
I'm surely God-blessed

1380
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:47,731
Uh, under her spell
she had me crushed

1381
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:50,299
I sworn I was anointed

1382
01:35:50,377 --> 01:35:53,710
Got caught by her magic

1383
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:57,547
Ah, she had me
drooling for a while

1384
01:35:57,618 --> 01:35:59,518
With her sexual motion

1385
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:02,351
Like taking candy from a child

1386
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:04,414
Suck on her love potion

1387
01:36:04,492 --> 01:36:07,723
I can't believe
the changes I've made

1388
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:10,923
Since I met my baby

1389
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:15,228
You know,
she drive me crazy

1390
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:16,826
On and on

1391
01:36:16,904 --> 01:36:19,998
What a beautiful lady

1392
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:21,837
On and on

1393
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:24,901
She drives me crazy

1394
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:26,503
On an on

1395
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:29,777
And there's no ifs nor maybes,
she goes

1396
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,750
On and on

1397
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:33,719
Yeah-eah

1398
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:37,087
Like a volcano she erupt

1399
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:39,058
Blowing up my pager

1400
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:42,254
Every minute, every hour

1401
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:43,489
Whoo-whoo, yeah

1402
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:46,624
I realize she likes my stuff

1403
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:49,134
I chose the right flavor

1404
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:52,297
This moment I will savor

1405
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:53,362
Lord

1406
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,534
I've never trusted pretty smiles

1407
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:58,441
'Cause looks are deceivin'

1408
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:01,106
Sexy want my love profound

1409
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:03,514
Some pretty girls are misleading

1410
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:05,984
Lesson learned,
don't judge a book

1411
01:37:06,053 --> 01:37:09,386
By looking at the cover

1412
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:14,026
You know, she drive me crazy
