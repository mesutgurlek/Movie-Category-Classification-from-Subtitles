1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Okay, let's do it.

2
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,110
10-4, 20  William 12.

3
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,910
You are eastbound,
pursuing tanker truck.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,870
Backup is available.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,030
Air Unit 3 is in the area.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,190
I can handle this myself.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,470
This is Air Unit 3.
Forget it, Tango.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,870
we'll take over.
Drop back.

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,880
Drop dead. I've been
on this case for 3 months.

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,080
we're out of our jurisdiction.
Sheriff and CHP are on the Way.

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,390
Do Whatever you're going to do.

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,830
Good luck.

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Thanks.

14
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Jesus!

15
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,880
He's crazy!

16
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,680
Shit!

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,630
Glad you could drop In.

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,510
Like jewelry?

19
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,950
Fuck you!

20
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,960
I prefer blondes.

21
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Do the honors.

22
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,310
-Captain.
-What's going on?

23
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,150
Letting the locals do their thing.

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,070
You blew out the truck window.

25
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,390
-Two guys are in the road.
-I noticed.

26
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,990
-We're out of our jurisdiction here.
-True.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,550
-What's going on?
-I heard a rumor about this truck.

28
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,630
-What about it?
-It's not a truck.

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,710
It's a gas truck.

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,720
It's a major moving violation.

31
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,750
Check the first panel?

32
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,110
Full of gas.

33
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,950
We checked the whole truck!
There's nothing in it!

34
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,550
You're out of your neighborhood,
city boy!

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
I want your badge and weapon!
I want your ass!

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,430
Who do you think you are?!

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,440
He thinks he's Rambo.

38
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,750
Rambo. . .

39
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,760
. . .Is a pussy.

40
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
What do you know, It's snowing!

41
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,950
Anybody want to get high?

42
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I'll be damned!

43
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Not bad for a city guy.

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,430
Ray Tango.

45
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,750
He's done it to us again.

46
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,950
If it isn't Tango, it's Cash.

47
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,270
Tango and Cash!
Cash and Tango!

48
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,280
These two cops are driving me crazy.

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,310
We must do something about this.

50
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,320
I agree. I would like
to handle this myself, Mr. Perret.

51
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,870
No, we will handle it.

52
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,950
No.

53
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Not that way.

54
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I have something else in mind.

55
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Hey, Cash!

56
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Armani with a badge!

57
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Look out!

58
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,070
Police business!

59
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,670
This is my car!

60
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Move!

61
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,840
What are you doing to my car?!

62
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Son of a bitch!

63
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,080
What's wrong?
Got a headache?

64
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,990
You crazy!

65
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,150
What did you do with my car?!

66
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I believe in perestroika !

67
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Welcome to America!

68
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Tango, I saw your picture in the paper.

69
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,310
Ray, Look at this.

70
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Blind luck!

71
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,720
-Catherine's in your office.
-That's great!

72
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,030
You just don't take off. . .

73
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,910
. . .on the spur of the moment. It's--

74
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,790
What?

75
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,830
Illogical?

76
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,630
-Very!
-It's not that big a deal.

77
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,470
I'll be gone a month or two.

78
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,830
It takes that Long to build a house,
not take a vacation.

79
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,840
A dance tour is not a vacation!
I just want to get away.

80
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,070
You have all you need in this town.

81
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,590
Grime, crime and slime.

82
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,550
No, thanks. I 'd rather go.

83
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Okay, but give me the phone numbers
so I can reach you.

84
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,750
Why don't I call you?

85
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Why don't you call me?

86
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Catherine, If you feel stressed,
don't run away.

87
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,590
Stay and we'll deal with this together.

88
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,190
Don't make me feel guilty.

89
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I just need some time alone, okay?

90
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,480
I promise, Lieutenant,
to be a good girl.

91
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,750
There It Is!

92
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,790
The key word.

93
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,070
''Good. ''

94
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,080
You're telling me you'll be good
because you know. . .

95
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,960
. . .automatically, I think you'll be bad.

96
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,390
What's a margin call?

97
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,230
Why?

98
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,310
Your stockbroker's on Line 3.

99
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Don't Leave.

100
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,910
Hold on.

101
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,830
I have a plane to catch.

102
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,150
Catherine, don't go.

103
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Think positive.

104
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,550
Shit!

105
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Harvey, It's me.

106
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,150
-It's good you wore a vest.
-Hardly needed It with these.

107
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,790
Half-Load soft Lead slugs.

108
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
This guy was reality sloppy.

109
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,710
Look at this.

110
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
This shirt cost $9.
Get me a new vest, okay?

111
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Whoa, pizza!

112
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,390
Who was fucking with my gun?

113
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,630
The sight's shifted.

114
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,640
-Maybe you dropped It.
-I didn't drop It.

115
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,430
Captain!

116
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,150
Get anything out of him?

117
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,160
No, he doesn't speak English.
Our Interpreter says he wants a Lawyer.

118
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,030
Let me question him.

119
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
The guy who just tried
to bow you away? Forget It!

120
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Stay away from him, Gabe.

121
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,590
So, you don't know any English?

122
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I don't know Chinese, so we'll have to
give you a crash course.

123
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,280
But I got a feeling
you'll be a quick Learner.

124
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Come here. Sit down.

125
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,790
This Is Lesson number one.

126
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,950
The next Lessons get harder.

127
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,150
Who hired you?

128
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,150
I think he's one of Quan's men.

129
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,160
I don't know his name.
I swear!

130
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,310
Look at that, Flattop.

131
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,030
You're speaking Like a native already.

132
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
-What Is this?
-English 1 01 .

133
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,310
Your scumbag Lawyer
won't be here for a whine.

134
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,110
Is there anything you want to share?

135
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,120
A deal. Tonight.

136
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,270
4942. . .

137
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,230
. . .Front Street. 9:00.

138
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Very good.

139
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,190
My compliments.

140
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Pretty good for your first Lesson.
Don't forget to wash your hands.

141
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
There's a big bust going down,
4942 Front Street.

142
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,470
-Is that reliable?
-Yes. A phone tap.

143
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,790
-Fantastic.
-What Is this?

144
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Downtown crown
versus Beverly Hills wop.

145
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,030
-All the news that's fit to print.
-I don't get you.

146
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,040
You make a shipload of money.
Why do you do this?

147
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,030
Action.

148
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,510
Good old American action.

149
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,520
If you want to stare death In the eye,
get married.

150
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Is that a proposal?

151
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Gabriel Cash.

152
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,350
How many millions?
How many?

153
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,360
How many this time?

154
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,470
Oh, God!

155
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,070
Ray Tango!

156
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,670
He Loves to dance.

157
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,680
He waltzes In and takes all my drugs. . .

158
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
. . .and then Tangos out again.

159
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,390
I've had enough.

160
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Too much television. . .

161
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,840
. . .can hurt your eyes.

162
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,550
Now do you see why we can't kill them?

163
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,750
No.

164
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,270
I do not see.

165
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,150
It would be much quicker.

166
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,160
And easier.

167
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,910
Quicker. . .

168
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,430
. . .and easier.

169
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,550
That's how you make a cake.

170
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,190
Or clean a toilet bowl, or shop. . .

171
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,310
. . .by mail.

172
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,320
But It's not how to run a
multi-million-dollar business Like ours.

173
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,190
Mr. Quan.

174
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
On the east side. . .

175
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,510

182
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,510
Two Little mice. . .

183
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,520
. . .and so much damage.

184
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,520
But If we kill them,
we risk all-out war with the police.

185
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,310
They're heroes already.

186
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Why make martyrs of them?

187
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,550
Instead of death. . .

188
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,470
. . .we have a game.

189
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,480
A game that only we can win.

190
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,590
Within two weeks. . .

191
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
. . .I will take delivery of the Largest
shipment of weapons that. . .

192
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,080
. . .we have ever handled.

193
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Within that time. . .

. . .and Cash. . .

196
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,040
. . .will be safely tucked away. . .

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,440
. . .behind bars.

198
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Aren't they beautiful?

199
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,070
You almost got yourself killed, pal.

200
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,910
It's the other way around.

201
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,830
I Pull this trigger,
your throat's hanging off that wall.

202
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,670
Pull that trigger,
I'll blow you In half.

203
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,390
You never had a chance
to hit me with that gun.

204
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Not this one.

205
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,390
You know me?

206
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,990
You're L.A.'s second-best cop.

207
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,630
I heard the same about you.

208
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,910
-Stay off my case.
-Your case?

209
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,550
I've been on It 3 months.

210
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Then you're stupid. I've been on It
30 minutes and I caught up with you.

211
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
-Stay off my case.
-Nice tie!

212
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,510
How do you want to do this?

213
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,110
I'll go first. Cover me on three.

214
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,430
One.

215
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,350
-Two.
-Three.

216
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,670
Freak!

217
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,680
What's the score?

218
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,470
My turn.

219
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,590
Don't move!

220
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,590
Don't move your hands.

221
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
His hands aren't going anywhere.

222
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Do the honors.

223
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,710
He's wired.

224
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,720
This Is all wrong!

225
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,510
-You ought to be a cop.
-Did you expect this?

226
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
No, I didn't,
and I didn't expect you, either.

227
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,390
Why Is he wired?

228
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Got me. Good luck getting anything
out of him. But this is your show...

229
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,680
. . .so I'm gone. Ciao, babe.

230
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,110
Drop your weapons!

231
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,990
-Freeze!
-We're cops!

232
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Wait! We're on the same team!
Just read this, damn It!

233
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I'm going to blow
both your fucking brains out!

234
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,550
-No problem.
-I'm convinced.

235
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,670
He's hysterical.

236
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,510
-I'd Like a receipt for that.
-Me, too.

237
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,520
We can talk about this.

238
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,190
That's my gun.

239
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,590
What's It doing here?

240
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,430
That gun was In my Locker.

241
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,440
It's not your gun now!

242
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,710
It's evidence.

243
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,070
-Why's your gun here?
-They stole It.

244
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,990
Tell me what you did.

245
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't know this man.
I didn't come with him.

246
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,120
So with your permission,
I'll be Leaving. Ciao.

247
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,960
You didn't come with him,
but you're Leaving with him.

248
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,430
You're making a mistake.

249
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,440
You're going down for this.

250
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,510
Get these bastards out of here!

251
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,270
Now!

252
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,280
-You're bad karma.
-I hope you got a good Lawyer.

253
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Perret says use this tape.

254
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,840
-Did Tango shoot a federal officer?
-No comment.

255
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,630
Was Cash there too?

256
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,390
No comment.

257
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,150
what do they have?

258
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,910
They got a .380
with Cash's fingerprints.

259
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
They think It's the murder weapon.
Ballistics Is checking It.

260
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,720
They were at the scene of the crime.
No one was seen coming or going.

261
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,830
What else?

262
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,030
The tape Is ready.

263
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,040
What tape?

264
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,080
-Show us the money.
-/It's in the suitcase.

265
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,910
-Open it.
-/It's all there.

266
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,070
-Count it if you Want to.
- we Want to.

267
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,470
where's the stuff?

268
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Right here.
Direct from the police lockup.

269
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,550
You know, / like dealing With cops.

270
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,550
/t restores my low opinion
of human nature.

271
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,560
/n that case, you'll love this.

272
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Lts. Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash,
two highly-decorated officers...

273
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,510
...go on trial today...

274
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,520
...for slaying an undercover agent
during a sting operation.

275
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,830
Tango and Cash insist...

276
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,840
...they are victims of a
setup by criminal figures...

277
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,670
...aimed at taking the two cops
out of action.

278
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Expert Witnesses Will lead off
the prosecution's case.

279
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,110
Mr. Skinner, you've heard the tapes.

280
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Can you make a judgment
about Its authenticity?

281
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,310
I have no reason to believe
It Isn't genuine.

282
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,390
How did you test this tape?

283
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,550
I took samples of the suspects. . .

284
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,310
. . .comparing them to the tape
with an oscilloscope.

285
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,390
They matched.

286
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
When this Is over, remind me
to rip his tongue out.

287
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,630
With a tow truck.

288
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,640
When I entered the premises,
I saw the two suspects, the guns. . .

289
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
. . .the money, the drugs, the dead body.

290
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,990
When those guys showed up. . .

291
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,630
. . .I figured It's all gone sour.

292
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
I was going to go and clear
everything up. . .

293
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,350
. . .when they killed him.

294
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
When this Is over,
Let's pay Jabba the Hutt a visit.

295
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,270
I 'll bring the chain saw.

296
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,280
I'll bring the beer.

297
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,950
Detective Cash assaulted me.

298
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,350
He put a chair on me and sat on It.

299
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,360
I couldn't find a piano.

300
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,270
This bastard can speak English!

301
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,710
The squarecrow can talk!

302
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,750
Squarecrow?

303
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,950
What do you call It?

304
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,960
As the attorneys for Tango
and Cash left the courtroom...

305
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,510
...their mood can only
be described as grim.

306
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,270
They face an uphill battle...

307
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,280
...if not an impossible one.

308
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
Ray, somebody set you up good.
I feel we should cop a plea.

309
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,350
You can guarantee minimum security?

310
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,230
Absolutely. That will be the deal.

311
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,510
Does Cash's attorney agree?

312
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,230
If he's smart, he does.

313
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,240
I want to talk to Cash.

314
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,470
I need to work on my
statement for the court.

315
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,830
What do you want?

316
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,590
First, to say I'm not fond of your kind.

317
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,270
What kind Is that?

318
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,870
You're a glory hound and a hot dog.

319
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,270
That stings.

320
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,390
Tell me when the critique Is over.

321
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,110
It's over.

322
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,870
-My Lawyer wants me to cop a plea.
-Mine, too. 1 8 months.

323
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,990
Lompoc Country Club.

324
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The gym opens at 5 a.m.
You can start pumping early.

325
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,390
-Who set us up?
-I don't know.

326
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,430
I got a Lot of admirers. You?

327
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,350
A few.

328
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Look, If we cop a plea,
we cop It together.

329
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,920
You mean that your Lawyer
wanted you to make a deal. . .

330
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
. . .but you didn't want to Leave this
glory hound holding the bag, right?

331
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,950
-Right.
-What a generous guy!

332
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,750
-I'll make the statement.
-I will.

333
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,950
No way. You'll screw It up.

334
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,550
When's your birthday?
When were you born?

335
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,270
-Why?
-Day and month.

336
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,280
-You want to do my horoscope?
-Just give me the month.

337
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,830
-May.
-February.

338
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,670
I got seniority.
I'll make the statement.

339
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,270
August 1 6.

340
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,280
I read your records. That's when you
were hatched. August 1 6.

341
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,240
I got seniority.

342
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
All rise.

343
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,550
The court Is now In session.

344
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,430
The Honorable
Judge McCormack presiding.

345
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,470
Be seated.

346
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,350
Your Honor.

347
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,310
The defendants wish
to change their plea.

348
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,270
Order!

349
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,070
Very well, counselor.
What Is the plea?

350
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,030
Your Honor, may I approach the bench?

351
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Proceed, Mr. Tango.

352
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,080
It's okay.

353
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Your Honor, I've been
a policeman for 1 2 years.

354
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
I think It's the best organization
In the country.

355
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,880
I've been told I'm too aggressive
In capturing criminals.

356
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,830
If that Is a sin. . .

357
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,550
. . .I'm guilty.

358
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,910
I've aways worked with good cops.

359
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,510
You are.

360
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,870
They're doing a tough job.

361
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,880
I only hope that with this trial,
the whole department. . .

362
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,720
. . .Is not judged by what has transpired.

363
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Thank you.

364
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,470
Not bad.

365
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Have you anything to add, Mr. Cash?

366
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,200
-Yeah.
-No!

367
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Mr. Tango has spoken very eloquently.

368
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,160
I wish I could be as forgiving.

369
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,200
But I can't, because. . .

370
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,400
. . .this whole thing. . .

371
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,750
. . .fucking sucks!

372
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,070
This Is a pile of shit!

373
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,990
Your Honor!

374
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Order!

375
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,230
Order!

376
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,240
Be seated, Mr. Cash.

377
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Your Honor, the defendants
wish to plead no contest. . .

378
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,310
. . .to a charge of
voluntary manslaughter.

379
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,470
This Is part of an agreement?

380
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,150
Yes. The state
recommends a sentence. . .

381
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,160
. . .of not more than 1 8 months
In a minimum-security facility.

382
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Mr. Cash, Mr. Tango, do you
enter this plea of your own free will?

383
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,950
Yes, sir.

384
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,670
The agreement Is
acceptable to the court.

385
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,680
The defense and the state
will deliver the proper documentation.

386
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Court Is adjourned.

387
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Now that Tango and Cash
are behind bars. . .

388
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,200
. . .you needn't be afraid anymore.

389
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,320
What's wrong, gentlemen?
You don't share my enthusiasm.

390
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,870
Mr. Perret, I am sorry. . .

391
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,880
. . .but I cannot appreciate
these games you keep paying.

392
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,310
Forgive me for asking, Mr. Perret. . .

393
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,320
. . .but what happens In 1 8 months
when they get out?

394
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Use your Imagination.

395
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,560
What makes you think
they'll ever get out again?

396
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,910
Now go take care of your business.

397
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,920
I got a feeling this Is
going to be a great year.

398
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,070
Ever hear of shock absorbers?

399
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,830
Welcome to Club Fed.

400
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,840
What a vacation!

401
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,760
End of the Line. Get out.

402
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,320
You, this way!

403
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,760
What do you have to say now, genius?

404
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,760
I don't think there's
a golf course here.

405
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
Make yourselves
at home sweet home, boys.

406
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,030
This Is a mistake, right?

407
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,040
My underwear Is riding Into my throat.

408
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,310
They're not there?!
They were on the bus!

409
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,590
I'm trying to trace them.

410
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
They were transferred
off the bus near Victorville.

411
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,910
We got to find them.

412
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,710
Your underwear problem Is solved.

413
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,720
I noticed. You can stop
holding In your stomach.

414
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,240
Come on! Somebody bribed the
prison board! That's why we're here!

415
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,880
They're as crooked as
everybody else In this deal.

416
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
I'll Tell you one thing.
Whoever set us up Is fucking connected.

417
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,350
Do you think It's Quan?

418
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,470
Thanks.

419
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,470
No, wait! I got It!

420
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,230
It's Lopez!

421
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,630
Lopez! Follow me through here.

422
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Lopez has a guy pretend
to try and kill me. . .

423
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,910
. . .and claim that Quan hired him.

424
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,920
He feeds me bogus Information
about the setup.

425
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Lopez figures, no matter what,
I'll think It was Quan.

426
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,920
All the time It's Lopez,
and now I know It.

427
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,990
What do you think?

428
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That with your I.Q., you're unarmed
and still very dangerous.

429
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,440
If you're so smart, Tell me
who set us up, Sherlock Holmes.

430
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,360
-I don't know yet.
-You don't know shit!

431
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,390
What are you doing?

432
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,870
Relax.

433
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,310
Soap.

434
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,190
Don't flatter yourself.

435
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,390
Peewee.

436
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,950
I don't know you that well.

437
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Don't worry.
Someday the other one will drop.

438
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,950
You just keep talking, tripod!

439
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,710
Sure, Minnie Mouse!

440
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,190
By the way. . .

441
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
. . .I bet they stick us
In the general population.

442
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
They don't put cops
In general population.

443
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Never put cops In
general population, huh?

444
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,870
Cash, I'll Light your fucking bowels!

445
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,150
I'll stick brown sugar up your ass!

446
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,390
Shit, I put half these guys away.

447
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,630
Tango, you're going to be my bitch!

448
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,390
I'll kick your fucking ass!

449
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,150
You know what I hate?

450
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,910
-Litter.
-Goddamn It!

451
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,590
I forgot the marshmallows.

452
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,310
I don't think rehabilitation
Is working here.

453
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,590
They're just misunderstood.

454
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,310
Cops!

455
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,070
Bring them to me!

456
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,470
Bring them to me!

457
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Cops! Cops!

458
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,230
Bring them here!

459
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,310
Come here!

460
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,390
I want to talk to you.

461
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,150
Hey, punk!

462
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,160
When I get out of here,
I'll tear you a new ass.

463
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,720
You know Captain Dynaball here?

464
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,240
I Loved you In Conan the Barbarian.

465
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
If you need me, me and my ass
will be In the neighborhood.

466
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,350
You fucking pig! It's over for you!

467
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,150
You're going to be very popular here.

468
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Funny, I don't see
your fan cub, either.

469
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,160
That crapper Is mine!

470
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,630
And what am I supposed to use?

471
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,640
I don't give a shit!
Just don't use that.

472
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Okay, bud. We're going to
get one thing straight right now.

473
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,080
That Is yours!

474
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,310
Would you mind stopping that?

475
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,150
Thank you.

476
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,470
I appreciate It.

477
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I'm not afraid of you.

478
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,350
See that?

479
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,190
I killed him.

480
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,870
Congratulations.

481
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,880
He was my best friend.

482
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,160
Crazy people fear no one.

483
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Look at that!

484
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Sugar Is up. I cannot believe this!

485
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,790
Let's dance, Tango!

486
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,870
Come on, Cash!

487
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,880
Get the bag on him!

488
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,470
Kill him!

489
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Kill the fucker!

490
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,280
You're dead meat, Tango!

491
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,310
They got you?

492
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,320
What's It Look Like?

493
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,670
Let me guess.

494
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,510
The welcoming committee.

495
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,230
Either that or a surprise party.

496
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,870
Don't make a move.

497
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,390
We'll talk our way out.

498
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,710
I doubt they're Into smart talk.

499
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,750
If we panic, we're history.

500
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,230
The Infamous. . .

501
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,990
. . .Cash and Tango.

502
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,990
Dishonored, Imprisoned.

503
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,550
A shameful fall from glory!

504
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,150
Who are you?

505
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Just think of me as somebody who. . .

506
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,510
. . .doesn't Like you much.

507
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,520
The surprise party Is out.

508
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Shit! That's the guy
I followed to the setup.

509
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Don't panic.

510
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Tarty Tango!
You're a pretty boy, aren't you?

511
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,950
I'm panicking.

512
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,670
How would you Like me
to change It for you?

513
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,510
-I wouldn't.
-How about you?

514
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,710
Maybe you first.

515
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,350
Don't panic.

516
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,360
I'll cut your throat,
yank your tongue out the hole. . .

517
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,150
. . .and tie It In a Windsor knot.

518
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,990
-I don't wear ties.
-Brave boy!

519
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,310
You want to cut my throat?!
Go ahead!

520
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,470
You want to cut off my head?

521
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,480
You can bowl with It!
Just don't Let him do It!

522
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,990
I don't want to get killed. . .

523
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,870
. . .by this limey jerk-off!

524
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,880
I want to get killed
by an American jerk-off!

525
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,990
You wanker!

526
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Put It away for now.

527
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,670
Just for now.

528
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Some of your other friends
want to say hello first.

529
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,310
What are you doing?

530
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,470
-Buying time.
-For what?

531
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,480
I don't know yet.

532
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,870
Shit, It's Conan.

533
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,510
-We'll get FUBAR now.
-What's FUBAR?

534
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,190
You'll see.

535
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Real bad-ass cops!

536
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,310
You don't Look so tough now.

537
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,870
Do you, you fuck?!

538
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,150
He means you.

539
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,070
This pig and his cop friends. . .

540
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,080
. . .broke my ribs, my Leg and my jaw.

541
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,990
You broke that jaw?

542
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,990
He deserved It.

543
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,430
Why did you do that?

544
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,710
Why? I was having a bad day!

545
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Like now?

546
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Don't panic!

547
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,870
Rats In a maze. . .

548
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,310
. . .men. . .

549
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,310
. . .In a cage.

550
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Place your bets!
Which broke survives?

551
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,870
Who's brave?

552
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Who fries first?

553
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,670
Cook, you bastard!

554
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Tango, you got any family?

555
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,830
Yeah. You?

556
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,840
I go steady with an alimony check.

557
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,510
First, Mr. Cash.

558
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,150
No, don't do It.

559
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Cash!

560
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,880
Cash!

561
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Fuck you.

562
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,240
Tango?

563
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Get them down!

564
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,630
Off the scaffold!

565
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Lock this place down!

566
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,990
Shit!

567
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
You fight this one. I'm burned out.

568
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
You Look Like hell, Cash.

569
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,230
Matt, Is It reality you?

570
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,870
It Is.

571
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Am I glad to see you!

572
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,240
My arm.

573
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,870
-Who's he?
-Matt Sokowski, assistant warden.

574
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,950
My C.O. when I was a rookie.

575
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,030
You guys are In deep shit.

576
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,390
Really?

577
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,310
Who set you up?

578
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,230
I think we just met him.

579
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,240
If this creep wants us dead so bad,
why doesn't he shoot us?

580
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,590
Why play this game?

581
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,190
He has a boring nightlife.

582
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,200
-How'd he get In?
-Anything can happen here.

583
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,280
All you need Is cash.
We have the best guards money can buy.

584
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,840
You got the bucks,
you get what you need.

585
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,920
Once you're back In
general population, they'll nail you.

586
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,190
You got only one choice: escape.

587
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,830
Escape?

588
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,840
I'll get a spoon and start tunneling. . .

589
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
. . .and you can chew through the bars.
This Is bullshit!

590
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,990
What's with him?

591
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
He's upset. He misses his wardrobe.

592
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,990
What do we do?

593
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,430
Listen, I got a plan worked out.

594
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,550
We trust him?

595
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,790
We've known each other 1 5 years.

596
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,550
-We trusted our Lawyers.
-And the judge.

597
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,560
And that got us nowhere.
Now trust me.

598
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Now that Is a risky proposition.

599
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,470
I got a present for you.

600
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,480
You're unbelievable!

601
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,630
I do miss my wardrobe.

602
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,870
This Is the ventilation system.

603
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,590
Enter It from
the utility shaft In the yard.

604
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,600
This main ventilation shaft
Leads beyond the wall.

605
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,760
I can shut down one fan
and Leave this door unlocked.

606
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,640
I'll get you the right work detail
and Leave tools at the shaft.

607
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,870
This way Looks faster.

608
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,750
-No, It's Longer.
-Let's stick to plan A.

609
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,870
Let's get you to the Infirmary.

610
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,430
Why your plan A?

611
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
It's better than your plan B,
which you don't even have.

612
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Not yet, but I will.

613
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,990
My partner In pain.

614
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,870
Sokowski got us trash detail. Let's go.

615
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,670
Whoopee! Race you to the dumpster.

616
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,150
It's set for now. Come on.

617
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,230
Negative.

618
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,710
I'm not going.

619
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,230
Did you have a brain meltdown?

620
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,990
Look, I have an aversion
to getting FUBAR.

621
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
-What's FUBAR?
-''Fucked up beyond all recognition. ''

622
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,910
I don't trust Sokowski!

623
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,920
He's a cop, for Chrissake!

624
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,670
What's this?

625
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,670
My fiancée, Slinky.

626
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,680
Up, Slinky.

627
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,040
Let's see how business Is.

628
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,600
You are one mistrustful,
maladjusted human fucking being!

629
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,430
I Love you, too.

630
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,830
I'm not coming back for you.

631
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,870
You're making a big mistake.

632
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,880
You don't have to.
Hope you make It, Cash.

633
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Let's go, you're Late!

634
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,830
I hope you and Cousin It. . .

635
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,950
. . .are very happy together. . .

636
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,670
. . .and raise a beautiful Litter.

637
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,230
Ciao.

638
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,240
Ciao.

639
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,360
You're half an hour Late, asshole!

640
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,040
I'm doing my best, boss.

641
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,920
Matt!

642
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,630
There he Is!

643
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,640
Let's go!

644
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,480
Out of my way!

645
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,680
-What are you doing here?
-I got lonely.

646
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,040
I can't hold It all day!

647
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Shit!

648
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,760
Come on, Cash!

649
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,560
This way!

650
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,880
Move It!

651
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,440
Your friend Matt waltzed you
Into a trap!

652
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,350
How could you be so stupid?

653
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,430
Matt's dead.

654
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,440
They cut his throat ear to ear.

655
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,150
