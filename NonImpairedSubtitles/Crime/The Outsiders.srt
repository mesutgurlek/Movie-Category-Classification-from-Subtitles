1
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:51,894
<i>"When I stepped out...</i>

2
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,567
<i>"...into the bright sunlight...</i>

3
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:59,539
<i>"...from the darkness</i>
<i>of the movie house...."</i>

4
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:30,749
What's going on?

5
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:33,926
We're early.

6
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,326
What do you want to do?

7
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,463
Nothing legal. Let's get out of here.

8
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:00,712
-How're you doing, Bill?
-Sharp!

9
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,982
Turn around! I've had it!

10
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,015
Here come the hobos.

11
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,521
I ain't got no cash....

12
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,751
Anyone want to buy a windshield wiper?

13
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:40,695
Give them the money.

14
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:43,155
What's the movie about?

15
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,234
I don't know.

16
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:49,828
It's one of those beach movies.

17
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:00,505
-Did I say you guys can play on my grass?
-No.

18
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,342
Then what are you doing here?

19
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,781
Give me those cards, will you?

20
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,986
-You guys ever play "52 Pick-Up"?
-Yeah.

21
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,493
What?

22
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:16,825
Don't get wise.

23
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:22,301
I don't like little kids,
I just don't like them.

24
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,367
Get out of here or I'll kill you!

25
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,618
The sky's getting dark. Let's go.

26
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,605
What do you think you're doing?

27
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:07,809
Cherry, just relax. You're supposed to be
my girlfriend, aren't you?

28
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:10,345
Don't ever pull anything like that again.

29
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:11,713
Are you serious?

30
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,449
Who do you think you are?

31
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,723
Don't do this to me.

32
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:18,759
I'm not going back there.

33
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:23,530
-I don't even understand.
-They just want to make it complicated.

34
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,642
Hey, baby, you want to see
what's hanging?

35
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:44,881
You're sure you want to do this?

36
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:47,422
I came to see a movie
and I'm gonna see a movie!

37
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,855
I'm freezing.

38
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:52,255
-Why didn't you bring a coat, stupid?
-I forgot.

39
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:06,498
Some cute redhead.

40
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:11,372
Are you a real redhead?

41
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,416
Are you real?

42
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,364
How can I find out
if this is your real red hair?

43
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:37,563
If this is the same red hair
that you have on these eyebrows, too?

44
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,544
Cut it out.

45
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,956
Get your feet off my chair
and shut your trap!

46
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,858
-Who's gonna make me?
-I'm gonna get a Coke.

47
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,292
Who, your boyfriend?

48
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:01,388
Leave her alone.

49
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:04,364
That's the Greaser who just
got out of jail.

50
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,198
Whatever you say.

51
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:08,735
Better leave us alone or
I'll call the cops.

52
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:13,306
You got me scared to death.
What am I gonna do, Pony?

53
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,635
This girl is making me shake.

54
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,773
Why don't you be nice and leave us alone?

55
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:22,874
I'm never nice.

56
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,583
Can I interest you in
a Coca-Cola or a 7Up?

57
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:29,249
Get lost, hood!

58
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:32,224
I'm sorry.

59
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:39,467
I didn't know you had this problem
of yelling in my face.

60
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,130
All right, I'll go.

61
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,395
I know when I'm not wanted.

62
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,613
You filthy Greaser!

63
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,518
Are you going to start now, too?

64
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,233
You don't look the type anyway.
What's your name?

65
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,666
Ponyboy Curtis.

66
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,367
That's an original name.

67
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,672
My dad was an original person.
I got a brother named Sodapop.

68
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,477
It says so on his birth certificate.

69
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:30,978
My name's Sherry, but my friends
call me Cherry because of my hair.

70
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,415
Yeah, I know.

71
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,820
We go to the same school.
You're a cheerleader.

72
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,055
You don't look old enough
to be going to high school.

73
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:42,090
What's a nice boy like you doing
hanging around with that trash?

74
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,160
Dal is my buddy. I'm a Greaser, too.

75
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,494
We're all friends.

76
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,298
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

77
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,907
Your brother, Sodapop,
he works at the gasoline station?

78
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,337
Yeah, that's him.

79
00:09:56,412 --> 00:10:00,041
-Sodapop is cute.
-I should have known you were brothers.

80
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:06,415
How come we don't see your brother
at school anymore?

81
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:10,219
Has he been working full time
since your parents died?

82
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,819
-He's a dropout.
-That's too bad.

83
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,960
I thought this might cool you off.

84
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:25,104
Maybe that will cool you off
until you learn how to be decent.

85
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,039
Fiery, huh?

86
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:28,508
Just the way I like them!

87
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:29,908
Get off of me!

88
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,173
Leave her alone.

89
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:36,949
What did you say?

90
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:39,349
Come on, you heard me. Leave her alone.

91
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,891
-What did you say, you little shit?
-Come on.

92
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:45,916
Wise ass.

93
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,509
Thank you, he had me scared to death.

94
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,782
You didn't show it.
Nobody talks to Dal like that.

95
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,621
From what I saw, you do.

96
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,820
Why don't you sit with us to protect us?

97
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:22,895
-What do you think? Come on.
-Might as well.

98
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,931
How old are you?

99
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:31,764
-Fourteen.
-Sixteen.

100
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,071
I thought you were both fourteen.

101
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:39,045
Why aren't you scared of us
like you were of Dally?

102
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,976
You two are too sweet-looking.

103
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:45,652
Besides, I know about Dallas Winston.

104
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,246
You two don't look mean.

105
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,521
Right. We're young and innocent.

106
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:55,095
No, you're just not dirty.

107
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,330
Dal is okay. He's tough and all,
but he's cool if you get to know him.

108
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,367
He'd leave you alone
if he knew who you were.

109
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,999
-I'm glad he doesn't know us.
-I kind of admire him.

110
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,247
-Get outta my hair!
-You gotta couple of hairs outta place!

111
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,946
Here, kid, have a beer.
It'll settle your nerves.

112
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:22,081
Well, now, who do we got here?
Your great-grandmothers?

113
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,655
What are you ladies doing
with these Greasers?

114
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,024
Dal was bothering them.

115
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:30,724
He was, huh?

116
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,561
Where is old Dal now anyway?

117
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,834
Yeah, where is Dally?

118
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:40,434
He left.

119
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:44,174
I know he slashed my tires!

120
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,847
Look, Tim, he left.
You guys seen Dally?

121
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,240
No.

122
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:54,745
I'll be looking for him.

123
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:01,389
-Dally got a blade?
-I don't think so.

124
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,655
Good. Tim will fight him fair.

125
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:10,795
-You guys don't play rough, do you?
-A fair fight ain't rough.

126
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,034
Yeah, real simple.

127
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:17,172
If he gets killed, you just bury him.
No sweat.

128
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:21,612
You dig okay. Want a chew?

129
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,686
Help yourself,
puts hair on your chest.

130
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:28,780
Come with me to get some Cokes
and popcorn.

131
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:30,750
Sure.

132
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:32,653
-Do you want some?
-I do.

133
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,987
Yeah, me, too. Get Johnny some, too.
I'm buying.

134
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,060
Is your friend with the sideburns okay?

135
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,637
He ain't as dangerous,
if that's what you mean.

136
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:52,778
He sure scared Johnny.

137
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,884
Johnny's a nervous wreck anyway.

138
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,981
He got beat up a few months ago
by some Soc.

139
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,821
That's how he got his scar?

140
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,228
Yeah, the guy was wearing rings.

141
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,856
We're not all like that.

142
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,530
That's like saying all Greasers
are like Dallas Winston.

143
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:18,504
-Yeah. What are you gonna do?
-Let's take it outside.

144
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,434
Why don't you both take it outside?

145
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:25,805
He's probably jumped a few people.

146
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:30,443
Anyway, you think the Socs have it made.

147
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,255
The rich kids. The Southside Soc.

148
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,117
I'll tell you something
that might be a surprise...

149
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:41,526
...but things are rough all over.

150
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:47,892
Let's get out of here, or Two-Bit
will think we eloped to Mexico.

151
00:14:50,205 --> 00:14:52,435
So, you're from the Southside, huh?

152
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,336
-It must be a nice neighborhood.
-It is.

153
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:56,571
I like it.

154
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,505
I'm from the other side of town.

155
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,372
Tell me about your oldest brother.
You never talk about him.

156
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,173
What's to tell?

157
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,502
He's big and roofs houses.

158
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,812
No, really. What's he like?

159
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,140
I feel like I already know Sodapop.

160
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,888
Tell me about Darry.
Is he wild and reckless like Soda...

161
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,513
...or dreamy like you?

162
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:46,360
He ain't like Soda and he
sure ain't like me.

163
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,089
He can't stand me.

164
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:54,001
I bet he'd like to put me in a boy's
home, except Soda won't let him.

165
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:57,197
-What are you talking about?
-You all get along fine.

166
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:58,373
No, we don't.

167
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,034
Shut up 'cause you ain't wanted
at home neither.

168
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,574
You shut your mouth!

169
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:07,712
-I'm sorry, I just got a little mad.
-That's all right. Don't worry about it.

170
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:14,249
Oh, no, look who's coming!
What are we gonna do?

171
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:17,889
Who are these clowns?

172
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,386
Cherry, what's going on?

173
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:23,095
What are you doing?

174
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,259
Just because we got a little drunk--

175
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,236
You call reeling and passing out
on the streets "a little"?

176
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:34,575
I've told you before, I'm never going
out with you when you're drinking!

177
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,437
That's no reason to be with these bums.

178
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,140
Who're you calling bums, pal?

179
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:40,112
You!

180
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:42,480
We got two more of us in the back seat.

181
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,447
Pity the back seat!

182
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:48,285
-You're looking for a fight!
-I am looking for a fight!

183
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,259
We'll go with you.

184
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:57,258
-Why? We ain't scared of these bastards.
-I hate fights.

185
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,170
I'm sorry.

186
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,705
I couldn't use this.
I could never cut no one.

187
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,267
Cherry! Come on.

188
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,213
We'd better go with them.

189
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:21,982
If I see you in school and I don't say hi,
please don't take it personal.

190
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:23,388
Yeah, I know.

191
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,950
You're a nice boy....

192
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,193
It's okay.

193
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:38,302
I hope I never see Dallas Winston again.
If I do, I'll probably fall in love with him.

194
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,170
-Come on, baby.
-Don't touch me.

195
00:17:51,386 --> 00:17:52,876
Just watch it, greaseball.

196
00:17:57,926 --> 00:18:00,588
Those are two of the best-looking girls
I've ever seen.

197
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:10,735
-What was that?
-Marcia's number.

198
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,372
Probably fake, too.
I must have been crazy to ask her.

199
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,671
Girl like that would never go out with me.
Where you going?

200
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:20,105
Home.

201
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,342
I've got a new hat.

202
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:28,078
You're crazy!

203
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:31,718
You never would have used
that busted bottle I gave you.

204
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:33,921
I might have. Where you headed?

205
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:37,059
I don't know. Maybe I'll go play snooker
or get drunk.

206
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:38,793
-I'll see you later!
-Okay.

207
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:43,862
I hate when my folks are fighting.
Let's go to the lot.

208
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:58,081
It was because we're Greasers.

209
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,950
Might have hurt her reputation
or something. Don't worry about it.

210
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:07,025
I guess so.

211
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:20,104
That was a tough car.

212
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,579
Mustangs, they're tough.

213
00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:29,180
Big-time Socs all right.

214
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:32,043
It's always the same.

215
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,635
I can't take much more of this.

216
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:54,167
I'll kill myself or something.

217
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:57,338
Don't talk like that, Johnny.

218
00:19:58,247 --> 00:19:59,874
You can't kill yourself.

219
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,145
I've got to do something.

220
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:19,991
It seems like there's gotta be some place
without Greasers, Socs....

221
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,629
There must be some place...

222
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,608
...with just plain ordinary people.

223
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,074
It's like that out in the country...

224
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:41,445
...away from all the big towns.

225
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,122
In the country.

226
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,158
<i>I miss going there with my folks.</i>

227
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:16,013
Ponny, wake up.

228
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,424
What time is it?

229
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:22,486
I don't know. I went to sleep, too.

230
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,096
You better go home.

231
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:30,803
I'm gonna stay all night out here.
Who'll care anyway?

232
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,408
If you get cold, come to my house.

233
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:38,269
What's Darry gonna say?

234
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:01,797
Where have you been?

235
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,428
Do you know what time it is?

236
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,466
It's 2:00 in the morning.

237
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,939
Where have you been?

238
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,408
Fell asleep in the lot.

239
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:13,239
I was talking to Johnny, then fell asleep.
I didn't mean to.

240
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:18,582
I can't even call the cops because
you two would be sent to a boy's home.

241
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:23,049
-Let's go to bed now.
-I said I didn't mean to.

242
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:26,624
"l didn't mean to, I forgot."
That's all I ever hear from you.

243
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:29,391
You shut up! I'm tired
of you sticking up for him!

244
00:22:29,498 --> 00:22:30,931
Don't you yell at him.

245
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:33,860
Ponyboy...

246
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,266
...I didn't mean to.

247
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,476
Come on, Johnny. Let's run away.

248
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:09,465
Take it easy. It will be all right.
Just relax a minute.

249
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:11,595
Got a cigarette? I'm scared, man.

250
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:14,902
Don't be, man. You're scaring me.

251
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,804
What happened?

252
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,209
Darry hit me.

253
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,446
We got along fine until Mom and Dad died.
Now he can't stand me.

254
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:26,247
I think I like it better
when the old man's hitting me.

255
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,118
At least he knows I'm there.

256
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,060
Let's walk to the park.
Maybe I'll cool off enough to go home.

257
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:39,093
Ain't you about to freeze to death?

258
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:41,402
You're not kidding.

259
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,169
Got a light?

260
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,471
Found this butt, man.

261
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:22,765
Here.

262
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,473
Look what's coming.

263
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,207
This is our territory.

264
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:32,553
I bet they're looking for us.

265
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:37,450
Want to split?

266
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:38,618
Stay cool.

267
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,493
What do you know?

268
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,056
They're drunk.

269
00:24:49,638 --> 00:24:51,230
It's that guy with the rings!

270
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:53,069
Aren't these the Greasers who...

271
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,576
...tried to pick up our women?

272
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:58,703
You're out of your territory.

273
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,872
Better watch it!

274
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:01,540
No, you better watch it!

275
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:17,992
You guys know what Greasers are?
White trash with long, greasy hair.

276
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,568
You know what a Soc is?

277
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,506
What?

278
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,836
White trash with Mustangs and madras.

279
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:34,404
Get him!

280
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,782
Johnny, run!

281
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:46,658
Stay down, pal!

282
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:02,440
Son of a bitch! Grab his arms!

283
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:09,773
Give me a drink for this Greaser.

284
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:11,249
Here, give me that.

285
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:13,452
Have a drink, pal.

286
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,339
I killed him.

287
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,351
I killed that boy.

288
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:22,954
I killed him.

289
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:34,764
I think I'm gonna be sick.

290
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,003
Go ahead, man. I won't look at you.

291
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,501
I won't look.

292
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,115
Are you all right?

293
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,724
You really did kill him?

294
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:09,867
I had to.

295
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:14,800
They were drowning you.
They might have killed you.

296
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,105
They were gonna beat me up.

297
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,379
What happened to the other guys?

298
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:32,226
They all ran. They all ran off
when I stabbed him.

299
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,292
What do you boys want?

300
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,563
We gotta see Dallas.

301
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,224
He's busy.

302
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:16,130
Tell him it's Ponyboy and Johnny, man.
He'll come.

303
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:19,733
Come on.

304
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,951
What do you guys want?

305
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:42,620
-Johnny killed a Soc.
-What?

306
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,490
All right, good for you. Let's go.

307
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:49,768
We thought you could get us out,
if anyone could.

308
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:54,768
I'm sorry to get you away from this party,
but I don't know what to do.

309
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,507
I was just trying to get some sleep.
I got in a fight with Shepard tonight.

310
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:01,515
Let me see what we can do. Get in.

311
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,708
-Are you wet?
-I'm okay.

312
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,354
You'll die of pneumonia
before the cops ever get you.

313
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,196
Hey, stupid, take your sweatshirt off.
You'll freeze to death.

314
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:31,168
I wish I had a weed now.

315
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,680
Don't point the thing at me. It's loaded.

316
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,793
Here's $50.

317
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,722
I'm not anxious to tell your brother
and get my head kicked in.

318
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,131
Then don't.

319
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:58,137
This is a little big, but it's dry.

320
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:06,278
Take the 3:15 train to Windrixville.
It's a freight.

321
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:10,542
There's an abandoned church
on top of Jay Mountain.

322
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:15,349
There's a pump in the back,
so you don't have to worry about water.

323
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,424
Get a week's supply of food as soon
as you get there, before the story gets out.

324
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:31,899
Then don't so much as stick your noses
out the door. Am I clear?

325
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,567
I'll be there when everything is cool.

326
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,711
Relax. lt'll work out.

327
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:48,617
I thought New York was the only place
I'd end up in a murder wrap.

-Yeah.

Check it out, man.

331
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,063
The church.

332
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:27,045
-What was that?
-Just an owl.

333

Johnny?

334
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:58,649
You all right?

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,498

Johnny?

340
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:51,436
A loaf of bread...

341
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:54,366

00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:07,079
I remember you said something once.
We saw the movie, remember?

346
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:09,653
Maybe you can read it out loud to kill time.

347
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:12,556
Thanks a lot.

-A deck of cards.

-We'll cut our hair, you'll bleach yours.

351

You ain't gonna touch my hair.

353
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:41,414
You'd have to, anyway, if we got caught.
The judge would make you get a haircut.

354
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,781
-I don't see why.
-I don't know either.

I'm gonna cut mine, too,

-You ain't touching my hair.
-It will grow back.

358
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,891
It's not that it won't.

359
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,368
Go ahead.

360
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,071
Sorry.

361

Damn knife.

362
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:21,688
Don't pull so hard.

363
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:23,327
Quit gabbing.

364
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,931

365
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:28,692
Can I see now?

366
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,703
No, we gotta bleach it first.

367
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,762
Bleach it and quit cutting.

368
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,303
This will do it.

369
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:40,736
Here.

370
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:46,478
Jeez, this really makes me look tough.

371
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:54,962
Go ahead. Get your jollies.

372
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:57,053
-My pleasure.
-Yeah, I know it is.

373
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:04,034
Be nice.

374
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:10,301
-It hurts, don't it?
-Yeah, yeah.

375
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:12,774
I didn't cut that much off of you.

376
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:14,712
It was your idea, smarty.

377
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:25,223
Well, I guess we're disguised.

378
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,660
I guess so.

379
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,894
It's just hair.

380
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:43,003
It ain't us. It's like being in a costume
you can't get out of and I hate it.

381
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:45,375
Well, we gotta get used to it, Ponyboy.

00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:51,765
Who?

479
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:56,701
Remember that good-looking broad I tried
to pick up the night you wasted that kid?

480
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,201
What's her name?

481
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,307
Cherry something? The redhead?

482
00:46:02,075 --> 00:46:04,600
-Cherry Valance.
-Cherry the Soc. Yeah.

483
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,777
We were at the vacant lot and she pulls up.

484
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,581
I thought that took a lot of nerve.

485
00:46:11,652 --> 00:46:12,710
Yeah.

486
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:14,417
She said she'd...

487
00:46:14,488 --> 00:46:19,323
...testify that the Socs were drunk
and they were looking for the fight.

488
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:22,385
And you just fought back
strictly on self-defense.

489
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,860
So, it's cool.

490
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,897
That little broad sure does hate me.

491
00:46:28,235 --> 00:46:32,001
I offered to take her for a Coke,
and she told me to go to hell.

492
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:38,609
So you think she might like me a little bit?

493
00:46:40,113 --> 00:46:42,104
I think she's kind of cute.

494
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:48,145
What do they do for kicks around here?
Play checkers?

495
00:46:48,322 --> 00:46:49,880
This place is out of it.

496
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:58,520
-I've never been to the country before.
-We're gonna turn ourselves in.

497
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:03,194
I got a good chance of being let off easy.

498
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,501
It was self-defense, like you said.
Pony and Cherry could testify.

499
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,097
We won't say you helped us.

500
00:47:08,175 --> 00:47:11,372
I'll give you back that gun,
so you won't get into any trouble.

501
00:47:11,445 --> 00:47:13,345
Are you sure this is what you want?

502
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,746
It ain't fair for Darry and Soda
to worry about Ponyboy.

503
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:22,279
-I guess my folks aren't worrying.
-The boys are worried.

504
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,255
Two-Bit wanted to go to Texas
to hunt for you.

505
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:28,992
-I asked if my parents asked about me?
-No, they didn't.

506
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,758
Do you think my old man gives a damn...

507
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:34,801
...if I'm dead in a car wreck
or in jail or something?

508
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:37,837
He doesn't care.
But that doesn't bother me none.

509
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,741
Come on. You're not going anywhere.

510
00:47:49,016 --> 00:47:52,713
I get you a hideout, I get you a hangout,
a hideout.

511
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:58,521
And now you want to split. This is terrific.

512
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,157
You don't know what a few months in jail
can do to you.

513
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,491
You get mean. I just don't want to see it
happen to you like it did to me.

514
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:18,075
-What's going on?
-I wonder how that started?

515
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,048
Where are you going?

516
00:48:32,225 --> 00:48:33,214
Get over here!

517
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:36,691
Some of the children are missing.

518
00:48:38,565 --> 00:48:39,725
I'm sure of it.

519
00:48:43,704 --> 00:48:45,001
Get ahold of yourself.

520
00:48:45,906 --> 00:48:46,770
Come back.

521
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:48,772
Don't go in there, you'll get hurt.

522
00:48:49,977 --> 00:48:51,239
Come here, man.

523
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:55,605
You're gonna get him?

524
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,051
Move back before you get hurt.

525
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:20,838
What was that?

526
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:23,633
-ls that guy coming?
-No.

527
00:49:24,244 --> 00:49:27,042
-How come? Too scared?
-No. Too fat.

528
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:33,912
Johnny, watch out!

529
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:35,716
We'll get you out of here.

530
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:52,004
Help me! Over here!

531
00:49:53,206 --> 00:49:54,605
Move it! Get out!

532
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:56,635
Look, man!

533
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:57,734
In here.

534
00:50:03,316 --> 00:50:05,546
Hey, Dal, take this kid.

535
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,617
Get out of here, Johnny.

536
00:50:09,156 --> 00:50:10,316
Are you okay?

537
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:15,318
Take them to Dallas.

538
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:17,863
Get them and get out!

539
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:26,569
Come on!

540
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,971
Are you crazy?

541
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:30,974
You're burning!

542
00:50:31,044 --> 00:50:32,204
Get him!

543
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,052
Jesus Christ! Stupid kid.

544
00:50:47,227 --> 00:50:48,216
Help!

545
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,925
I'm coming, Johnny!

546
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:02,807
Johnny? Dallas?

547
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:06,011
They're all right. They're behind us.

548
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:08,374
They're in another ambulance.

549
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:12,344
You three are the bravest kids
I've seen in a long time.

550
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:16,121
Are you professional heroes or something?

551
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:18,322
We're Greasers.

552
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:21,421
-Are you kidding me?
-No, I'm not.

553
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,658
Take me to town and you'll find out fast.

554
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:34,768
You shouldn't smoke, son.

555
00:51:35,942 --> 00:51:37,102
Why not?

556
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:40,340
Because you're a young man, that's why.

557
00:51:40,781 --> 00:51:42,408
It's a bad habit to get into.

558
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:44,680
You're smoking.

559
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:47,613
I'm older than you.
I've been smoking for a long time.

560
00:51:56,897 --> 00:51:59,661
If you ever pull another stunt like that,
I'll kill you.

561
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,373
Look at your tough hair.

562
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,680
I'm sorry.

563
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:26,850
I thought we lost you
like we did Mom and Dad.

564
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:37,197
You sure look funny.

565
00:52:47,948 --> 00:52:49,575
Let's go, little brother.

566
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:51,810
We're home.

567
00:52:53,954 --> 00:52:56,354
He's getting pretty big to be carried.

568
00:53:28,421 --> 00:53:31,254
-Anybody home?
-ln here. Don't slam the door.

569
00:53:40,066 --> 00:53:42,557
What are you doing? Look what you did.

570
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,900
You made me ruin my eggs
and drop my spoon.

571
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,030
Look at the blond-headed monkey!

572
00:53:47,107 --> 00:53:50,304
I wouldn't have believed it,
if I hadn't seen it in the paper.

573
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:53,903
Tell me, Ponyboy,
what's it like being a hero?

574
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,136
A what?

575
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:57,546
A hero, you know, like a big shot.

576
00:53:58,218 --> 00:53:59,708
Beer for breakfast, Two-Bit?

577
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:05,284
They're charging Johnny
with manslaughter?

578
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,525
What do they mean, "if he recovers"?

579
00:54:08,595 --> 00:54:10,654
It also says how you saved them kids.

580
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:13,722
They'd have burned to death
if it hadn't been for you.

581
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,167
Dallas will be mad.
They didn't mention his police record.

582
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:20,037
It's all about us.

583
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:23,771
Darry, me and Soda.

584
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,843
They're thinking about putting me
and Soda in a boy's home?

585
00:54:28,915 --> 00:54:30,109
No way.

586
00:54:30,317 --> 00:54:32,410
They ain't putting me in a boy's home!

587
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:34,578
They don't do that to heroes.

588
00:54:35,121 --> 00:54:37,385
Where is Soda and Super-Dope, anyhow?

589
00:54:42,595 --> 00:54:43,960
Super...what?

590
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:45,662
All brawn, no brains.

591
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:47,632
Have you seen my shirt somewhere?

592
00:54:47,734 --> 00:54:50,703
You have to wear pants too.
I think there is a law.

593
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:54,331
-How about my jeans?
-I ironed them. They're in my closet.

594
00:54:55,508 --> 00:54:57,135
Hurry up, you'll be late.

595
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,672
Did you hear about
that juvenile court thing?

596
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,318
The cops told me last night.

597
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:11,047
After we stomp the Socs real good,
we'll throw a party so we can get drunk.

598
00:55:12,492 --> 00:55:16,189
-Where you gonna get the dough?
-I'll think of something.

599
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,065
Mickey's on TV.

600
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:39,650
I hate to leave you by yourself.
I should take the day off.

601
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,712
I'll be okay. I've stayed by myself before.
Besides, we can't afford it.

602
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,091
-Yes, but I should stay.
-Don't worry, I'll babysit him.

603
00:55:49,029 --> 00:55:51,224
Why don't you get a job?

604
00:55:52,298 --> 00:55:54,391
Come on, Soda. We gotta get to work.

605
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,768
I've gotta quit smoking,
or I can't do track next year.

606
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,572
You gotta do the dishes.

607
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,404
-I'm gonna cut off your air.
-Two-Bit, lay off.

608
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:06,338
He ain't looking so good.

609
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:08,002
Lazy bum!

610
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:16,280
You smoke more than a pack today...

611
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:19,521
...and I'll skin you, you understand?

612
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:23,927
If you carry more than one bundle
of roofing at a time...

613
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:26,692
...me and Soda will skin you. Understand?

614
00:56:29,202 --> 00:56:31,295
-Say hi to Johnny.
-All right.

615
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,577
We gotta clean up the house.

616
00:56:42,682 --> 00:56:44,673
The cops and reporters will come by...

617
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:47,914
...and it's time for the state people
to check on us.

618
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,457
This house ain't messy.
You ought to see my house.

619
00:56:52,258 --> 00:56:54,658
I have. If you had the sense
of a billy goat...

620
00:56:54,727 --> 00:56:57,696
...you'd clean up your house
instead of bumming around ours.

621
00:56:58,631 --> 00:57:01,293
If I ever did that,
my mom would die of shock.

622
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,041
I'd drive, but the brakes went out
on my car.

623
00:57:20,253 --> 00:57:21,948
Almost killed me and Kathy.

624
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,558
You should meet her brother.
Now, there's a hood.

625
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:29,060
He's so greasy, he glides when he walks.

626
00:57:30,964 --> 00:57:34,695
He goes to the barber shop
for an oil change, not a haircut.

627
00:57:45,512 --> 00:57:47,173
-Stay close.
-What do they want?

628
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:50,614
-I don't know. How many were in the car?
-Four or five.

629
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,282
Let's hurry inside.

630
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,916
Let's see what they want.

631
00:57:57,524 --> 00:58:00,493
-Why do you want to see what they want?
-Just stay here.

632
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,730
No jabs before the rumble.
You know the rules, ape-face.

633
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:13,931
We know.

634
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,038
I want to talk to you.

635
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:21,076
Go ahead. I'll keep my eye on him.

636
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,345
Speaking of the rumble, pal....

637
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:31,817
I read about you in the paper. How come?

638
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,457
I don't know.

639
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:36,622
I felt like playing the hero.

640
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:38,697
-I wouldn't have.
-Wouldn't have what?

641
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:42,094
I would have let those kids burn to death.

642
00:58:42,368 --> 00:58:45,201
You might not have.
You might have done the same.

643
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:46,935
I don't know.

644
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,208
I just don't know anything anymore.

645
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:56,445
-I never believed a Greaser could do that.
-Greaser has nothing to do with it.

646
00:58:58,151 --> 00:59:00,016
Check out their pants!

647
00:59:01,487 --> 00:59:02,886
Want to talk inside?

648
00:59:04,023 --> 00:59:06,014
Are you boys waiting for a flood?

649
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:11,894
I hear they stamp your face
into gorilla cookies.

650
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,934
-You're funny.
-Oh, yeah?

651
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,963
I couldn't tell this to anyone else.
My friends would think I'm crazy.

652
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,136
That friend of yours who got burned.
He might die.

653
00:59:31,184 --> 00:59:34,517
And tonight, people will get hurt
at the rumble. Maybe killed.

654
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:41,952
You can't win. You know that.

655
00:59:43,029 --> 00:59:46,328
Even if you whip us,
you'll still be at the bottom.

656
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,863
We'll still be the lucky ones at the top
with all the breaks.

657
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:56,631
Greasers will still be Greasers,
and Socs will still be Socs.

658
00:59:56,709 --> 00:59:58,006
It doesn't matter.

659
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:03,715
Anyway, thanks, Greaser.

660
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,815
I meant, thanks, kid.

661
01:00:11,557 --> 01:00:15,049
Been nice talking to you, Randy.
My name's Ponyboy.

662
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,535
You're real funny, Two-Bit. Let's go.

663
01:00:29,075 --> 01:00:31,771
-Now, get the hell out of here.
-See you at the rumble.

664
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:38,840
What did "Mr. Super-Soc" have to say?

665
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:40,950
He ain't a Soc.

666
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,856
Just a guy that wanted to talk.

667
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,759
-Take care.
-See you later.

668
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:51,089
Take it easy.

669
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,542
How they treating you, kid?

670
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:16,854
You got your picture in the paper
for being a hero.

671
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,580
Look at that.

672
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:21,623
That's tough enough, huh?

673
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,991
I guess you can look at it later.

674
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:30,798
Do you want anything?

675
01:01:31,471 --> 01:01:32,802
A book.

676
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:36,102
Can you get me another one?

677
01:01:37,076 --> 01:01:40,011
He wants <i>Gone With The Wind</i>,
so I can read it to him.

678
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:43,740
Would you mind getting it?

679
01:01:45,918 --> 01:01:48,216
I'll go get it from the gift shop downstairs.

680
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:08,730
I guess Dal's gonna be okay.

681
01:02:11,244 --> 01:02:13,872
Me and Darry, we're getting along
real good now.

682
01:02:15,748 --> 01:02:17,079
Are you okay?

683
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:21,687
It just hurts sometimes.

684
01:02:23,623 --> 01:02:28,322
Not usually, because I can't feel anything
below the middle of my back.

685
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:31,086
Pretty bad off, ain't l?

686
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,057
No. You'll be all right, kid.

687
01:02:36,068 --> 01:02:37,626
You gotta be.

688
01:02:38,805 --> 01:02:40,636
We couldn't get along without you.

689
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:43,105
I won't be able to walk again.

690
01:02:44,076 --> 01:02:47,170
Not even on crutches.
Doc says I busted my back.

691
01:02:48,147 --> 01:02:49,637
You're gonna be fine.

692
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,516
I know you are.

693
01:02:54,654 --> 01:02:56,849
You want to know something, Ponyboy?

694
01:02:57,056 --> 01:03:01,049
I used to talk about killing myself
all the time. I don't want to die now.

695
01:03:01,928 --> 01:03:05,921
It ain't long enough.
Sixteen years ain't gonna be long enough.

696
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,593
Hell, I wouldn't mind so much if there
wasn't so much stuff I ain't done yet...

697
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:14,832
...so many damn things I ain't seen yet.

698
01:03:18,077 --> 01:03:20,238
That time we were up in Windrixville...

699
01:03:21,614 --> 01:03:24,981
...was the only time I've ever been away
from our neighborhood.

700
01:03:28,588 --> 01:03:29,953
Knock it off.

701
01:03:30,957 --> 01:03:34,324
If you get too juiced up,
the doc won't let us see you anymore.

702
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:42,694
Your mother is here to see you.

703
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:46,761
-I don't want to see her.
-It's your mother, she's here to see you.

704
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,935
I said I don't want to see her.

705
01:03:49,008 --> 01:03:52,205
She probably just wants to tell me
how much trouble I'm causing.

706
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:54,269
Why don't you tell her to--

707
01:03:56,883 --> 01:03:58,145
What's the matter?

708
01:03:58,217 --> 01:04:00,879
-You just can't see him now.
-Pony, is he okay?

709
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,813
-I don't know.
-He's all right.

710
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,919
-You make sure he gets this, all right?
-Okay.

711
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:16,234
-What's happened to your gown?
-I threw it away.

712
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:19,063
Get out! You make my stomach sick.

713
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,675
-How are you doing?
-How are you doing, man?

714
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:26,439
Here, I swiped you a gift.

715
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:30,705
It's good to see you guys.
This place gives me the creeps.

716
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,139
I want out.

717
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,016
Tim Shepard dropped by.

718
01:04:37,523 --> 01:04:38,751
He saw my picture.

719
01:04:38,824 --> 01:04:43,284
He couldn't believe it didn't have
"Wanted Dead or Alive" underneath it.

720
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:46,087
He told me about the rumble.

721
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:48,898
I hate missing it.

722
01:04:51,571 --> 01:04:53,061
You got a cigarette?

723
01:05:03,215 --> 01:05:05,274
How is he? How's Johnny doing, man?

724
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,688
I don't know about stuff like this...

725
01:05:11,123 --> 01:05:13,114
...but he didn't look too good.

726
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,152
He passed out cold before we left.

727
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:30,065
Still got that knife?

728
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:33,039
That knife.

729
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,307
Give it to me, will you?

730
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:48,950
We gotta win that fight tonight.

731
01:05:51,931 --> 01:05:53,922
We gotta get even with those Socs.

732
01:05:59,105 --> 01:06:02,370
Let's do it for Johnny.
We'll do it for Johnny!

733
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:13,082
Are you okay?

734
01:06:16,522 --> 01:06:18,012
You feel kind of hot.

735
01:06:18,924 --> 01:06:19,982
I'm okay.

736
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,054
Be a pal and don't tell Darry, okay?

737
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:28,460
I'll take a bunch of aspirins
when I get home.

738
01:06:29,368 --> 01:06:30,357
All right.

739
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:34,432
But Darry will kill me if he finds out
you're sick and you fight anyway.

740
01:06:35,641 --> 01:06:37,905
Keep your trap shut and he won't find out.

741
01:06:41,213 --> 01:06:45,206
Do you know that the only thing
that keeps Darry from being a Soc is us?

742
01:06:45,451 --> 01:06:46,440
Yeah, I know.

743
01:06:52,058 --> 01:06:54,618
<i>Tonight. I don't like it one bit.</i>

744
01:06:57,163 --> 01:06:59,563
Something awful's gonna happen.

745
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,273
We're gonna stomp those Socs.
Everything's gonna be all right.

746
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:29,258
-Tough little kids, huh?
-Yeah. Future Greasers.

747
01:07:40,906 --> 01:07:42,669
What's up with the big times?

748
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:45,875
No weapons.

749
01:07:46,212 --> 01:07:48,442
They play your way. It's a fair deal.

750
01:07:48,714 --> 01:07:50,113
You sure about that?

751
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,076
Randy told me. He knows for sure.

752
01:07:55,221 --> 01:07:56,916
Good deal. Thanks, Cherry.

753
01:07:59,725 --> 01:08:01,090
Ponyboy, wait a minute.

754
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,151
Come here, I want to talk to you.

755
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:07,998
How's Johnny doing?

756
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,667
Not so good.

757
01:08:10,803 --> 01:08:12,566
Would you come and see him?

758
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:14,696
-No, I couldn't.
-Why not?

759
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:16,997
I couldn't.

760
01:08:20,613 --> 01:08:22,274
He killed Bob.

761
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,382
Maybe Bob asked for it.

762
01:08:27,086 --> 01:08:28,553
I know he did.

763
01:08:30,156 --> 01:08:33,785
But you didn't know his other side.
He could be real sweet.

764
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:37,957
He wasn't just any boy.

765
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:41,392
Bob had something
that made him different...

766
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:46,228
...made people follow him. A little better
than the crowd, you know what I mean?

767
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:51,333
I don't want you to go see him anyway.
We don't need your damn charity!

768
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,543
I wasn't trying to give you charity.

769
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,352
I only wanted to help.

770
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:07,850
I liked you from the start.

771
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,087
The way we talked.

772
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,130
Wouldn't you try to help me if you could?

773
01:09:17,002 --> 01:09:19,835
Can you see the sunset
from the Southside very good?

774
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:21,904
Yeah. Real good.

775
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,605
You can see it from the Northside, too.

776
01:09:27,313 --> 01:09:29,042
Thanks, Ponyboy.

777
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:30,876
You dig okay.

778
01:09:32,117 --> 01:09:33,448
See you around.

779
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,565
-Soda, when did you start shaving?
-When I was 15.

780
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,675
-When did Darry?
-When he was 13.

781
01:09:57,743 --> 01:10:00,405
Why? Growing a beard for the rumble?

782
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,713
You're funny.

783
01:10:03,482 --> 01:10:07,475
<i>Readers Digest</i> pays a lot of money
for funny things.

784
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,021
You like fights, huh, Soda?

785
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:14,719
Yeah, I like fights.

786
01:10:16,195 --> 01:10:18,254
-How come?
-It's a contest.

787
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:20,662
It's like a drag race,
or a dance or something.

788
01:10:20,766 --> 01:10:23,132
We'll beat those Socs' heads in.

789
01:10:23,235 --> 01:10:26,671
When I get into a fight, I want to stomp.
I like it, too.

790
01:10:30,075 --> 01:10:31,702
Why do you like fights?

791
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,176
He likes to show off his muscles.

792
01:10:34,713 --> 01:10:37,409
I'll show them off on you,
if you get any mouthier.

793
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,185
I don't know if you ought to be
in this rumble.

794
01:10:46,392 --> 01:10:49,054
How come? I've always
come through before, ain't l?

795
01:10:50,696 --> 01:10:53,130
You were in shape before.

796
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:57,861
You ain't looking so good,
you're tensed up all the time.

797
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:01,567
Come on, it's a fight.
Everyone is tensed up before a rumble.

798
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:04,966
It's skin against skin.
He ain't gonna get hurt.

799
01:11:07,112 --> 01:11:08,943
I'll grab a little one.

800
01:11:09,748 --> 01:11:13,184
We will need every man we can get,
but I don't know.

801
01:11:13,252 --> 01:11:16,813
If it was with knives or chains,
it would be different.

802
01:11:16,889 --> 01:11:18,220
I'll be okay.

803
01:11:19,258 --> 01:11:22,227
All right, but you be careful.

804
01:11:22,461 --> 01:11:23,689
I will.

805
01:11:23,963 --> 01:11:26,056
Why don't you worry about him so much?

806
01:11:26,265 --> 01:11:30,702
That's one kid brother I ain't gotta worry
about 'cause he can use his head...

807
01:11:30,803 --> 01:11:33,465
...at least to grow hair on. Let's go!

808
01:12:00,132 --> 01:12:03,101
You and Ponyboy, if the fuzz show,
beat it out of there.

809
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:06,466
We'll get jailed, but you two will get
the boy's home. Understand?

810
01:12:06,672 --> 01:12:10,005
Ain't nobody gonna call the fuzz
in this neighborhood.

811
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:15,742
All the same, you two beat it out of there.
Do you hear me?

812
01:12:32,197 --> 01:12:33,630
How are you doing, Tim?

813
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,799
Pretty good.

814
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,239
You and the quiet kid killed the Soc.
Right?

815
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,237
Yeah.

816
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:44,941
Good going, kid.

817
01:12:45,477 --> 01:12:47,468
Curly always said you were a good kid.

818
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:52,347
Curly's in the reformatory
for the next six months.

819
01:12:53,852 --> 01:12:57,845
-Hey, Greasers!
-We're on our way!

820
01:14:10,329 --> 01:14:13,662
We'll go out there as even as we can get.
You stay close to me, kid.

821
01:14:33,986 --> 01:14:36,318
Hello, Darrel. Long time no see.

822
01:14:37,756 --> 01:14:38,848
Hello, Paul.

823
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:40,352
What's up?

824
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:43,019
They used to buddy around together,
play football.

825
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,060
I'll take you.

826
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,825
A rumble ain't a rumble without me.

827
01:16:47,586 --> 01:16:49,349
Ponyboy, are you okay?

828
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,538
Are you okay? Come on.

829
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:43,639
Act sick, and I'll pretend like
I'm taking you to the hospital.

830
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:47,611
You've got to have a good reason
for driving like that.

831
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:52,773
The kid fell off his motorcycle
and I'm taking him to the hospital.

832
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:00,383
How bad is he?

833
01:18:01,026 --> 01:18:04,018
Do I look like a doctor?
He looks pretty bad to me.

834
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,586
Follow me.

835
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:10,165
Sucker.

836
01:18:36,161 --> 01:18:37,992
I was crazy. You know that?

837
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,458
I was crazy about wanting Johnny
to stay out of trouble.

838
01:18:41,533 --> 01:18:44,400
If he was smart like me,
he wouldn't be in this mess.

839
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:47,836
If he was smart like me,
he wouldn't have ran in that church.

840
01:18:49,908 --> 01:18:52,706
You better wise up, man.
You just better wise up.

841
01:18:53,779 --> 01:18:56,373
Get tough like me and you don't get hurt.

842
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:02,611
Watch out for yourself
and nothing can touch you, man.

843
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,537
We beat the Socs, man. Chased them
right out of our neighborhood.

844
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:29,104
It's useless.

845
01:19:31,817 --> 01:19:33,717
Fighting ain't no good.

846
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:41,783
They're still writing editorials in the papers
about you being a hero.

847
01:19:43,528 --> 01:19:46,326
We are all proud of you.
It's gonna be all right.

848
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,008
Stay gold, Ponyboy.

849
01:20:03,315 --> 01:20:04,782
Stay gold.

850
01:20:16,328 --> 01:20:17,818
Johnny, come on.

851
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:26,236
So, this is what you get for helping people?

852
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:30,834
You punk!

853
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:33,801
Come on, Johnny, don't die.

854
01:20:38,617 --> 01:20:40,949
Come on, don't die on me now.

855
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:43,715
Please!

856
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,093
Bastards!

857
01:21:23,528 --> 01:21:25,519
You're not allowed here.

858
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:31,164
I'm allowed anywhere I want.

859
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,635
-You're out of your mind.
-Why do you help people?

860
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:40,307
It doesn't do any good.

861
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,916
What do you think, Soda?
Do you think it makes me look tough?

862
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:48,719
It makes you look different.

863
01:21:49,921 --> 01:21:51,889
That guy had sharp teeth.

864
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:54,759
What do you mean by "different"?

865
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:56,961
You got a hole in your mouth.

866
01:22:01,433 --> 01:22:03,025
Where have you been?

867
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:13,973
What's wrong?

868
01:22:15,614 --> 01:22:17,206
Johnny's dead.

869
01:22:24,289 --> 01:22:26,450
Told him about beating the Socs.

870
01:22:27,258 --> 01:22:28,885
He just died.

871
01:22:29,728 --> 01:22:31,355
Told me to "stay gold."

872
01:22:34,432 --> 01:22:35,990
Dally's gone.

873
01:22:38,136 --> 01:22:40,104
He couldn't take it. He's gonna blow.

874
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,054
Do you want to buy one of those?

875
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:16,233
You tear them, you have to pay for them.
Don't do that!

876
01:23:24,816 --> 01:23:27,011
You gotta pay for that magazine.

877
01:23:31,489 --> 01:23:33,218
Oh, God. Don't shoot.

878
01:23:34,626 --> 01:23:36,924
Give me the money. Give me the money!

879
01:23:37,395 --> 01:23:38,987
I'm so sick of you punks.

880
01:23:39,698 --> 01:23:41,131
Take it and get out!

881
01:24:10,161 --> 01:24:11,992
-Hello, Darrel?
<i>-No, it's Steve.</i>

882
01:24:12,063 --> 01:24:14,361
Steve, I want to talk to Darry.

883
01:24:20,538 --> 01:24:24,304
<i>I robbed a store.</i>
<i>The cops are looking for me.</i>

884
01:24:25,076 --> 01:24:27,909
-Can you meet me in the park?
<i>-Sure. Are you all right?</i>

885
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:29,970
-Johnny's dead.
<i>-We know.</i>

886
01:24:32,217 --> 01:24:35,448
-Meet me in the park, will you?
<i>-We'll be right there.</i>

887
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:40,820
It was Dally. The cops are after him.
We have to hide him.

888
01:24:58,109 --> 01:24:59,508
You'll never get me alive!

889
01:24:59,577 --> 01:25:00,566
Drop it!

890
01:25:01,446 --> 01:25:02,845
It's not loaded! Don't!

891
01:25:02,914 --> 01:25:04,211
Stop!

892
01:25:04,949 --> 01:25:06,917
Not Dally, too!

893
01:25:10,588 --> 01:25:12,180
He's just a kid.

894
01:25:19,564 --> 01:25:20,690
Pony?

895
01:26:07,345 --> 01:26:10,940
"I asked the nurse to give you this book,
so you could finish it.

896
01:26:11,216 --> 01:26:14,879

their lives are worth more than mine.

897
01:26:14,953 --> 01:26:18,946
"They have more to live for.
Tell Dally I think it's worth it.

898
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,916
"I'm gonna miss you guys.

899
01:26:22,994 --> 01:26:26,691
"I've been thinking about it, and that poem,
that guy that wrote it.
