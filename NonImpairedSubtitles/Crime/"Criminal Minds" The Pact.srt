Hi, I'm Detective Pratt.
You must be SSA Hotchner.

Well, I talked to San Diego PD.

164
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:47,570
They sent over everything on
the first victim Brenda Wipley's case.

And Mr. Coleman's updated

that we're looking
for a spree killer?

169

Not until we know exactly
what we're looking for.

Thank you.

172

Morgan and JJ think
that maybe our second victim Mark

173
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,721
went to meet a drug dealer.
Have you gotten the tox screens back?

174
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,090
Neither of the victims
had drugs in their system.

175
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:10,757
It doesn't mean they didn't
go meet a dealer.

176
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,159
But a drug dealer doesn't call you
twice a day for two weeks.

177
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,361
Usually you call him.

Go ahead, Garcia.

180
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,100
The path of my cyber sleuthing
has had majestic results.

181
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,670
Digging into victim number
two's past,

182
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,038
it turns out meth isn't the only thing
Mark Coleman had done.

183
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,707
He also changed his last name.

184
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:28,774
From what?

185
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,343
Logan. And that's where
the plot thickens

186
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,344
like a bad pudding.

187
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,847
So when Mark was a junior
in college,

188
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,216
he gets picked up by police
on a drug charge.

189
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,218
They find some articles
of clothing

190
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,554
of a missing 8-year-old girl
named Kelly Taylor in his car.

191

They are covered
with Mark's DNA.

192
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,791
After a lengthy interrogation,

193
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,360
he confesses to sexually
assaulting her,

194
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,296
but denies killing her, and
because her body was never found,

195
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:53,999
they couldn't link him
to the disappearance.

196

since he got out?

Since then he's worked at 3
different fast food joints.

have to figure out

what to do with
the remaining 6.

Hey. I'm Dr. Mathis.

212
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,269
I heard it took
the L.A. M.E. 4 hours

213
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:36,638
to find the second
victim's entire body.

214
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,674
Yeah, he was spread
all over the place.

215
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:41,342
Well, victim one had it
easy by comparison.

216
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,945
She was dragged postmortem.

217
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:45,113
We thought she was alive
at first.

218
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:47,114
No. She died from
a series of blows to the head.

219
00:09:47,182 --> 00:09:49,516
So the unsub was scared
on his first kill,

220
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:51,852
then two hours later
when he got his second victim,

221
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,022
his confidence suddenly
evolved.

222
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,857
That's a pretty quick
evolution.

223
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:59,860
And therein lies the problem.

224
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,631
So I talked to victim
number two's father.

225
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:06,466
He said as far as he knew,
no one was trying

226
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,701
to get back at Mark
for the rape.

227
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:09,368
He got out of jail
last month.

228
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:12,371
He was getting out more, exercising,
trying to get on with his life.

229
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:15,642
Well, I just compared photos
from the first and second crime scenes.

230
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,643
The cars used to drag
were different.

231
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:18,978
Maybe the killer
switched cars?

232
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:20,679
Or we're looking
at two unsubs.

233
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:22,047
What did you
and Morgan find?

234
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:23,616
Well, at both crime scenes,

235
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:26,719
the nearby stores were either closed
or being remodeled,

236
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:28,954
so the killer would have
had to scope the area,

237
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,889
lure and drag the victim
without being caught.

238
00:10:30,957 --> 00:10:33,225
This guy has a lot to do.
So the question remains,

239
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,227
how can you do that
twice in one night

240
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,129
in cities over
100 miles apart?

241
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:39,564
Two unsubs would explain
the evolution in M.O.

242
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:41,833
What did Rossi and Blake say?

243
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:43,301
The first victim Brenda
was dragged postmortem.

244
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:44,603
The second victim
was alive.

245
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,405
So we're most likely looking
at one unsub who's hesitant

246
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:51,108
and another one
who actually enjoys it.

247
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:53,810
What do you mean,
you killed her first?

248
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,347
I just couldn't do it
while she was still alive.

249
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:57,881
But that's the whole point.

250
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,583
Come on,
you know what she did.

251
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,519
I know. But she was
begging for her life

252
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,187
and I just couldn't hear it
anymore.

253
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,088
Oh, you should have
called me.

254
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:07,323
You had your own thing
to do.

255
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,361
Ok, we've been planning this thing
for 6 months.

256
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,629
If you thought you were
gonna chicken out,

257
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:15,265
you should have told me
at last week's meeting.

258
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,034
Ok, we're done now,
so let's just go home

anywhere.

When I killed Mark,

262
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:29,077
he told me there were
two other guys that helped.

263
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:30,812
What?

264
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:36,318
He didn't do this alone?

265
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:40,921
So what are we
gonna do now?

266
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,823
We're gonna kill them.
That is what we're gonna do.

267
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,592
I can't do this again!

268

together, two unsubs versus one victim.

number two, Mark Coleman,

278

as well?

what you're talking about.

Yeah, it was on the ground.

or prior calls.

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,870
Garcia, what did you find
out about Paul Montgomery?

316
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:09,972
So guess who were BFFs
in college.

317
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,641
Hmm. Mark Coleman
and Paul?

318
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:13,276
10 points to Blakendore.

319
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:15,011
Turns out Paul
was a character witness

320
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,180
in Mark Coleman's
rape trial.

321
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:19,082
He waxed poet about his boy.
The jury didn't care.

322
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,218
So we have two scumbags
and an innocent mom as victims.

323
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:23,919
Anything
in Brenda Wipley's past?

324
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:26,522
No, not that I've found yet.
She went to college at UCLA,

325
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,623
she went to high school
in Orange County.

326
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:29,358
Does she have a sealed
juvie record?

327
00:14:29,426 --> 00:14:30,859
Why didn't I think of that?

328
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:32,194
See, this is why
you're the boss man

329
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,930
and I'm the minion
who types things.

330
00:14:34,997 --> 00:14:37,833
Uh, it turns out Brenda
was not as coifed as her bob.

331
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,867
When she was 17,
she was involved in a DUI

332
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,604
that resulted in the death
of a 2-year-old boy, Sam Dolan.

333
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:43,871
Did she serve time?

334
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,874
Yeah, she was sentenced
to a year in juvie.

335
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:48,529
It was reduced to two months

336
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,511
after her father gave
hefty chunks of change

337
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:51,912
to some political
organizations.

338
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,115
So, we're definitely
looking at a vigilante team

339
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:56,216
avenging the death
of these two kids.

340
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:58,184
We should talk to the parents
of the original victims.

341
00:14:58,253 --> 00:15:01,888
I'll bet they're the connection
to these unsubs. Thanks, Garcia.

342
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:08,094
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Dolan.

343
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:17,202
That was taken
at his second birthday.

344
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,739
His mom sent one
to everyone.

345
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,407
I know this is hard,

346
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:23,876
but I need to ask you
some questions

347
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:27,145
about the death of the woman
who killed your son.

348
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:28,913
Like I told the cops,

349
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:30,749
I was returning home
from London

350
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:32,250
the night Brenda
was murdered.

351
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:33,985
I have my boarding pass.

352
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:36,854
Ok. Now, what about your wife?
Where was she?

353
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:41,393
She killed herself
a few years ago.

354
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,327
Uh...

355
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:46,430
I am so sorry
to hear that.

356
00:15:46,498 --> 00:15:48,699
She said she was
getting better, and--

357
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,601
but ever since
Sam's death,

358
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,170
she was a mess.

359
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,172
Do you think
the lenient sentence

360
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,374
was a contributing factor
in her death?

361
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:58,675
Absolutely.

362
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:01,944
She thought the system
failed us.

363
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:06,683
She wouldn't leave
the house after that.

364
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,384
She even did therapy
over the phone.

365
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:09,752
Did she have friends over?

366
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,053
No.

367
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:12,888
She spent all her time
on the Internet.

368
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:14,690
Really?

369
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:17,459
Did she join any online
support groups?

370
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:19,861
How'd you know?

371
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,301
She said it was
making her better.

372
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,737
But I--I thought
it was making her worse.

373
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:29,805
Why?

374
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:33,006
Because it allowed her
to obsess about it.

375
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:38,045
And look where that got her.

376
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,253
Oh, no.
[Vomiting]

377
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:47,520
Not again.

378
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:49,188
I can't do this.

379
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:52,225
I thought it was gonna help,
but it isn't.

380
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,761
That's because
you're not letting it.

381
00:16:54,795 --> 00:16:56,262
But it's wrong.

382
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,898
An eye for an eye?
It's biblical.

383
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,968
When I wake up
in the morning,

384
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:04,803
I see Kelly's face.

385
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:08,607
When I close my eyes,
she's still there.

386
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:11,610
I don't know how much longer
I can go on like this.

387
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:13,279
Don't. Don't you say that.

388
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:15,181
But that's how I feel.

389
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:17,616
You should feel
rejuvenated.

390
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:21,652
Come here. Come on.
Come on.

391
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:25,790
Look.

392
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:27,392
Look at you.

393
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:28,894
They did this.

394
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,228
They did this to you.

395
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:34,366
So don't tell me they don't deserve
what's coming to them.

396
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,535
Order's up.

397
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,570
Thanks.

398
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:41,338
Just finished my interview.

399
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,073
Sam Dolan's father
checks out.

400
00:17:43,141 --> 00:17:44,876
His mother committed
suicide a few years ago.

401
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:46,310
What about Kelly's parents?

402
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:48,178
We've left them
messages, but...

403
00:17:48,246 --> 00:17:49,647
You might send an officer
to their house

404
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:50,882
and places of employment.

405
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,982
We should also check
at the support group

406
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,651
Sam's mother belonged to.

407
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,453
Morgan:
Well, we got something.

408
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,855
The calls the unsub made to the victims--
twice a day at night.

409
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,457
That shows incredible
persistence.

410
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:02,559
The first victim, Brenda,
was a happily married teacher,

411
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:04,961
so why would she take calls
from a random man late at night?

412
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:05,652
If she was cheating,

413
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,030
she wouldn't meet someone
at a restaurant near her house.

414
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:09,064
I think she was meeting a woman.

415
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:11,166
The roommate said the second victim,
Mark, in a sober living house

416
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:13,201
said that he was talking
to someone online a lot lately.

417
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,525
The night he got killed,

418
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,472
he got dressed up like
he was going out on a date.

419
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:18,808
And he's straight, which further
confirms it was a female.

420
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,043
That would explain
the blitz attacks.

421
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,245
They weren't because our
unsubs were insecure men,

422
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,713
they were because our unsubs
are women,

423
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:28,883
who needed to subdue
their victims first.

424
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:31,953
We need to give the profile.

425
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,356
We believe that these unsubs
are two women

426
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:37,692
who are killing people
convicted of heinous crimes.

427
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,127
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

428
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:42,796
He'll be out
in 10 years.

429
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,466
Unlike solo vigilantes,
they're working in concert

430
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:48,401
and they're planning
and executing coordinated attacks.

431
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,070
Their mentality
is like a lynch mob.

432
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:52,272
They believe the justice system
has gone wrong

433
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:53,740
and it's up to them
to set it right.

434
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:55,875
Due to the pre-planning
and level of commitment,

435
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:58,110
we believe our unsubs
are over 30.

436
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,814
And they probably learned

437
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,113
about the crimes they're
avenging through the media.

438
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:03,916
It's possible
they were involved

439
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,518
in these losses
personally

440
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:08,354
and now feel
they need to act.

441
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:11,023
No! I don't accept it!

442
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:14,860
My baby's life was worth
more than 10 years!

443
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:19,297
This latest attack felt
more improvised and personal.

444
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:21,032
They didn't lure
their victim.

445
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,936
Rather, they blitz
attacked him outside of his job.

446
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:27,238
Now, during a spree,
the threat is that an unsub

447
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:29,507
will either strike again
or disappear.

448
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:32,776
Now, if they've completed their vendetta,
then the latter is more likely.

449
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:35,245
Our unsubs may not have
prior criminal histories,

450
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:37,915
as they see themselves
as do-gooders.

451
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:41,218
Based on the fact that
one victim was dragged postmortem

452
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,253
and the other
were dragged alive,

453
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:47,456
we believe that one woman
is not as confident in the mission

454
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,458
while the other
is more domineering.

455
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:54,463
We're looking for mothers,
relatives, friends who have lost children.

456
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:56,766
We also need to look
at the collateral damage

457
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,601
of the crimes our current
victims committed years ago.

458
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,069
Since this is the only thing
our unsubs have in common,

459
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,071
it tell us
that as time goes on,

460
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:06,274
their friendship will become strained
and ultimately fall apart.

461
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:09,678
Hotch: So how do these
unsubs meet?

462
00:20:09,746 --> 00:20:11,279
Maybe they're involved
in the trials.

463
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:12,915
In two different cities?

464
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:14,615
I don't know.

465
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,651
If Sam Dolan's mom was in
an online support group,

466
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,085
maybe after
she killed herself,

467
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,687
someone else became
obsessed with her grief.

468
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:22,289
Yeah, but who'd have
that same level of interest?

469
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:24,959
Let me call Garcia.

470
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:25,960
[Ring, beep]

471
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,929
- Hey, Garcia.
- At your service.

472
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:29,597
Were you able to find out
anything

473
00:20:29,665 --> 00:20:31,665
about that online support
group Mrs. Dolan was in?

474
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,333
Uh, let me see.
Uh, uh, uh, it had 200 members.

475
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:35,535
It was an anonymous group.

476
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:37,336
Did any of them start
talking about Sam Dolan

477
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,173
about two months ago,
after his mother's suicide?

478
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,177
Ok, uh, I've got
a screen name, Ellen R.

479
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,447
From San Diego. She talked about
Sam in a private chat room.

480
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:50,616
Did Sam Dolan's mom have any friends
or relatives with that name?

481
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:53,552
Yeah, she's got a sister
Ellen Russel.

482
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,920
She works in a boat shop.

483
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:57,856
And that'd give her access
to hitching equipment.

484
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,725
Who was she interacting
with in the support group?

485
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,326
She talked
to a lot of people.

486
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:04,028
In the last year,
she was mainly

487
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,730
talking to a Darlene B.

488
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,165
Kelly Taylor's mom's
name is Darlene.

489
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,500
What's her maiden name?

490
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,402
Beckett. In the last
6 months,

491
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,404
most of their discussions
have been around the pending release

492
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,039
of Mark Coleman from prison.

493
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,608
And they probably
hatched a plan.

494
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,310
We need to get search warrants
for Ellen's and Darlene's houses.

495
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:21,444
Oh, my gosh! This just in.
So when Mark was released a month ago,

496
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,780
her and Ellen started calling him,
posing as a friend.

497
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:25,215
That would explain
the disposable cell phones.

498
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:27,651
That's the trigger.
Mark's release set them off.

499
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,486
Yeah, right, great.
So Ellen was still mad

500
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:32,522
because there was no justice
served for her nephew's death,

501
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,992
and...her and Darlene must
have agreed to swap revenge killings.

502
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,593
And they'd avoid
getting caught.

503
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,161
It's like
"Strangers on a Train."

504
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,930
Yeah, but this ain't
Hitchcock, folks.

505
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:44,033
Why kill Paul? He was just
a character witness for Mark.

506
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:45,935
A character witness who
traveled 300 miles once a week

507
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:47,369
to see his friend
in prison.

508
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:49,438
Friends usually
distance themselves

509
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:50,773
from rapists and murderers.

510
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,040
Unless you're involved.

511
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,442
Garcia, you and JJ look
into Kelly's disappearance.

512
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,011
We need to find out
how these unsubs got to Paul

513
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:58,813
and anybody else who might
have been involved in the case.

514
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:08,889
All right, I'll let him know.

515
00:22:08,957 --> 00:22:10,557
Ok. Got it.

516
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:14,361
My officers just interviewed
Darlene's ex-husband.

517
00:22:14,428 --> 00:22:17,063
He says she hasn't been the same
since Kelly disappeared.

518
00:22:17,131 --> 00:22:19,766
She's been suffering
from chronic depression.

519
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,836
The loss of a child either brings
you together or breaks you apart.

520
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,721
The day she disappeared,
Kelly left school early

521
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:20,355
because she and her mother
were going on vacation,

522
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:21,957
but she never made it home.

523
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,926
They found her underwear
in Mark's car,

524
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:25,194
which led to his confession.

525
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:27,295
I got the lab results
back from Kelly's rape.

526
00:23:27,363 --> 00:23:30,165
It turns out there was a second
DNA sample on her underwear,

527
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,767
but it's too degraded
to make a match.

528
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:34,069
Maybe the women suspected
it was Paul's.

529
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:36,226
San Diego PD just searched
Ellen's house.

530
00:23:36,227 --> 00:23:38,746
She's not there, but they put an officer
out front just in case she comes back.

531
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:41,042
So we need to figure out
who Paul was to Mark in college.

532
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,978
They ran cross-country, sometimes
participating in a relay together.

533
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,312
It means
they were close.

534
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,414
Don't 4 people do relays?

535

[Beep]
Hey, baby girl.

536

Hey.
Listen, we need to figure out

537
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:55,989
who ran in the cross-country relay
with Paul Montgomery and Mark Coleman.

538
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:58,558
Bryce Phillips
and Jason Nelson.

539
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:00,160
They look inseparable.

540
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:01,161
And where are they now?

541
00:24:01,229 --> 00:24:02,495
Bryce lives in Amsterdam,

542
00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:05,198
Jason in the Los Feliz area
of Los Angeles.

543
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:07,760
And what was Jason's
relationship with Mark like

544
00:24:07,785 --> 00:24:08,801
when he went to jail?

545
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:11,871
Jason was at the hearing and he
visited Mark once a week in prison,

546
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:13,005
so, close?

547
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:14,573
He probably participated
in the crime.

548
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:16,375
And our killing duo
found out about it.

549
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:17,843
That would explain
the change in M.O.

550
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:20,712
Maybe Mark gave a dying declaration
and gave up his boys.

551
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:22,381
Maybe our ladies
are improvising,

552
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:24,515
which explains killing
Paul outside his job.

553
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,751
We need to get to Jason's
house before they do.

We were all just sitting around

we said--we said no,

but then someone said...

that we should
go and get one.

we were out on the corner.

00:28:58,693 --> 00:28:59,627
Aah!

632
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:01,828
Stop it! Stop it!

633
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:03,696
- Are you serious?
- I need to find her.

634
00:29:03,764 --> 00:29:05,197
I need to bring her
back home.

635
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:06,198
She is dead!

636
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:08,802
And we are killing
this guy.

637
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:11,704
No, I can't! I have got to
bring her back home.

638
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:13,440
[Groans] Ellen,

639
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:17,175
closure is important
to a mom.

640
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:19,778
And, uh...

641
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:21,713
[Coughs, groans]

642
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:24,182
Whoo! Ahh.

643
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:26,685
Besides, to protect myself,
I told a neighbor

644
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:28,153
to write down
the license plate

645
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,922
of any strange car
that came by.

646
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:31,757
So...

647
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:33,491
you were expecting us?

648
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,495
Well, I knew you found
the first two.

649
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:39,563
I assumed I'd be next.

650
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:47,203
Ucch. Why are men so messy?

651
00:29:47,271 --> 00:29:49,706
I don't get down like this.
I'm a clean freak.

652
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:53,777
Why does that
not surprise me?

653
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:57,713
Something's just...
off about this guy.

654
00:29:57,781 --> 00:29:59,281
Gut feeling?

655
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:01,584
Deep gut.

656
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:10,493
Jennifer Jareau, your gut
knows what it's talking about.

657
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,663
So nothing about Jason Nelson
seems out of the ordinary?

658
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,032
He seems as all-American
as apple pie.

659
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,167
No reports of any bodies found.

660
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,503
Maybe they haven't
killed him yet.

661
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,270
We'll keep you posted.

662
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:26,841
This guy might give these ladies
a run for their money.

663
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,377
Morgan: Trophies.

664
00:30:29,444 --> 00:30:31,212
Kelly wasn't the only girl.

665
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,281
This is all a facade.
Jason's a psychopath.

666
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:36,250
A psychopath versus
two vigilantes.

667
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:40,754
I have a feeling this
is not going to end well.

668
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:48,928
Is this it?

669
00:30:48,996 --> 00:30:51,797
Is this where
you put Kelly?

670
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:54,501
Uh...hmm...

671
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:55,668
No.

672
00:30:55,736 --> 00:30:56,936
What do you mean?

673
00:30:57,004 --> 00:30:58,704
You said
this was where she is.

674
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:00,239
Well, I will take you there

675
00:31:00,306 --> 00:31:01,773
if you do something for me.

676
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:04,376
No! This is not
a negotiation.

677
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:06,445
No. It's a bribe.

678
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:08,747
What do you want?

679
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:09,748
Kill someone.

680
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:11,083
Anyone.

681
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:15,454
And then I'll tell you
where it is.

682
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:18,469
You want us to just kill
some random person?

683
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:19,479
That's what I said.

684
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,772
I want you to know
how good I felt.

685
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,594
That's disgusting!

686
00:31:23,662 --> 00:31:24,695
We're not murderers.

687
00:31:24,763 --> 00:31:25,796
Oh, really?

688
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,632
That's not what it looks like
from here.

689
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,468
And besides,
if you don't do it,

690
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:33,136
my neighbor will drop
a dime on you, remember?

691
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:34,871
You didn't tell
your neighbor.

692
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:37,807
You'll never know.

693
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:45,848
Darlene, do you want to
find your daughter or not?

694
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:48,750
Not like this.

695
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:50,819
You don't have a choice,
ladies.

696
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,654
Yeah, we do!

697
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:56,425
Darlene, just do it.

698
00:31:56,493 --> 00:31:58,794
I can't!

699
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:01,430
Damn it!

700
00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:14,909
Ohh!

701
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:18,213
Pow! Boom!

702
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:22,048
Noo!

703
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,620
Awesome!

704
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:29,323
Oh, no, no, no!

705
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,724
Now you take us
to her daughter.

706
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,394
Or you're next.

707
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:37,006
Ohh.

708
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:53,278
The victim says he was shot
by a white woman.

709
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,680
She was with a black woman
and a white guy.

710
00:32:55,748 --> 00:32:58,383
These women have been
so specific about their victims

711
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:00,519
up until this point,
why shoot a random person?

712
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:04,188
Jason's a psychopath.
Maybe he made them do it.

713
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,656
He could be
holding them hostage.

714
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:08,459
Or he's got something
that's keeping him alive.

715
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:10,361
A bargaining chip?

716
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:12,863
Maybe he knows
where Kelly's body's buried.

717
00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:15,466
But Ellen did the shooting,
not Darlene.

718
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:17,134
Ellen tortured
the second victim.

719
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:19,170
And she's helping Darlene
kill the rest of Kelly's assailants,

720
00:33:19,237 --> 00:33:20,803
when she could have
just walked away.

721
00:33:20,837 --> 00:33:22,672
So this woman
is a psychopath, too.

722
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:25,475
Then Jason's made
a love connection.

723
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:26,873
And he'll probably try
to manipulate Ellen

724
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:28,453
to do something worse.

725
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,681
We lost these women
a long time ago.

726
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:35,051
Blake, turn Jason's place
upside down.

727
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,488
We need to find where
they may have put Kelly's body.

728
00:33:39,556 --> 00:33:41,290
Ellen, why?!

729
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:42,991
Now, why did you
go and do that?!

730
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:44,693
We have come too far.

731
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,462
Bull. She liked it.

732
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:47,729
No, she didn't.

733
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:49,631
Tell him
you didn't like that.

734
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:51,433
Oh, oh, you know,

735
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,933
if we were smart, Ellen,

736
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:54,535
we'd partner up.

737
00:33:54,603 --> 00:33:55,536
Shut up!

738
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:56,804
We could drive
across the country

739
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:58,639
just killing people.

740
00:33:58,707 --> 00:34:00,874
I'd get my little girls,

741
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:04,112
and you can get,
you know, whoever you wanted.

742
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:05,146
That's enough!

743
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:06,947
Wouldn't it be great...

744
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:10,117
To live in a world
where no one judged you?

745
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:12,852
I wouldn't judge you, baby.
I would have your back.

746
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,621
Come on.

747
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:16,856
Come on,
what do you say?

748
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:20,527
If we are not at that body
in the next 20 minutes,

749
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:22,929
I'm gonna take that gun and
shove it so far down your throat,

750
00:34:22,997 --> 00:34:25,498
you're gonna wish
you were dead.

751
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,766
Yeah, yeah...

752
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:30,068
just make a left.

753
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:31,870
This is getting exciting.

754
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:37,643
Hmm...

755
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,778
Hmm hmm hmm,
let's see.

756
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:43,848
I think it was over here
to the right.

757
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,517
You think or you know?

758
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,153
I know. I just moved it.

759
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,287
Why would you do that?

760
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:51,456
When Mark died,
I needed to cover my tracks.

761
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:54,626
Uh...oh. Oh. Oh.

762
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,093
It's right here.
I remember.

763
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,095
Right...here.

764
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,665
Start digging.

765
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:09,606
The landlord says this is
Jason's storage closet.

766
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:17,880
It looks like
my storage unit.

767
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:21,083
My husband has so much crap,
it's not funny.

768
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:23,419
Is it hard being in a relationship
with someone overseas?

769
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:24,820
We make it work.

770
00:35:24,888 --> 00:35:27,323
Working for Doctors Without Borders
is a very noble cause.

771
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,292
I would imagine you guys have
an epistolary novel by now, though.

772
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,228
We stick to Skype.
It's modern.

773
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:35,263
When we're together,
it's like we're dating,

774
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:38,900
and when we're not,
I get stuff done.

775
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,903
Look at this.

776
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,741
Fresh loam soil.

777
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:49,276
Usually found near
plains and streams.

778
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,511
Either he was
just camping...

779
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,246
Or used it
to move the body.

780
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:54,682
Jason finds out
his friends are killed,

781
00:35:54,749 --> 00:35:57,518
he might take precautions.

782
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:01,387
What is taking so long?

783
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:03,590
I'm almost there.

784
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:04,591
Hurry up!

785
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:06,659
[Thud]
Oh...

786
00:36:06,727 --> 00:36:07,660
[Thud]

787
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:11,564
Oh. Oh...

788
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:29,146
There it is.

789
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:33,417
That's just a skull.

790
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,519
Where's the rest
of my daughter?

791
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:39,022
We have a few more
holes to dig.

792
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,926
You cut up my baby?

793
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:47,197
That was my idea, too.

794
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:49,299
Oh, my God!

795
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:51,001
Oh, my God.
[Laughing]

796
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:52,803
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

797
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:56,072
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

798
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,276
[Screaming]

799
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:10,853
There's loam soil surrounding
some Southern California beaches

800
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:13,889
and also loam soil around
some parks in the area.

801
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:15,690
What areas are near
running trails?

802
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:18,426
Uh, there is a trail
in the Hollywood Hills area

803
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:19,906
that is lousy with loam soil.

804
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:22,415
And I'm sending Morgan
and Rossi to the location now.

805
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:41,982
Over here.

806
00:37:49,657 --> 00:37:51,591
They got him.

807
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:54,761
We've got officers at Ellen
and Darlene's homes

808
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:56,530
just in case
they come back.

809
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:59,299
And have them check the airports,
bus stations, train stations, everything.

810
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,634
I'll also put an APB out
along the coast.

811
00:38:01,702 --> 00:38:04,069
Garcia cross-checked
the trophies we found at Jason's,

812
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:06,071
and they match articles
from 3 different missing children.

813
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:07,473
And have officers
excavate the area

814
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,041
around where
Jason's body was found.

815
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:10,309
There may be
more bodies there.

816
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:12,044
I'm on it.

817
00:38:12,111 --> 00:38:13,979
Blake:
At least we got Jason.

818
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:16,215
He could have kept
killing forever.

819
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:18,316
And the women
just get away.

820
00:38:18,384 --> 00:38:20,452
Hmm. For now.

821
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,888
You ok?

822
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:25,323
Yeah.

823
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,362
Yeah.

824
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:37,000
[Chatter, laughter]

825
00:38:41,373 --> 00:38:43,440
So now what?

826
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:44,441
Well,

827
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:47,578
um, we're gonna split up.

828
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:49,879
I might keep heading south.

829
00:38:49,946 --> 00:38:52,014
You'd do good here.

830
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:53,516
Yeah. You're right.

831
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:57,387
I think it's better
if we don't stay together.

832
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:02,492
You know what I don't get?

833
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:05,861
How this was so easy for you.

834
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:07,161
How so?

835
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:09,163
We had to kill 5 people.

836
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,599
Our deal was just for two.

837
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,467
That's not what
I'm talking about.

838
00:39:12,535 --> 00:39:15,570
Does it bother you that none
of this took the hurt away?

839
00:39:15,638 --> 00:39:18,440
I never thought it would.

840
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:19,941
Then why did we do it?

841
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:24,211
Because somebody
has to pay, ok?

842
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,346
I don't care
what anybody says.

843
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:28,883
Actions have consequences.

844
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,218
Maybe not at trial.

845
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,287
Maybe not in jail.

846
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:35,355
Come on.
Admit it, Darlene,

847
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,290
this gave you
a reason to live.

848
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:39,859
That's what I was hoping.

849
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:44,030
But it just made me
feel more...

850
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,134
more nothing.

851
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:50,570
Then you're a wuss.

852
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:55,974
I'm gonna go get us
something cold to drink.

853
00:39:56,042 --> 00:40:00,879
Wait. I diss you and you care
if I'm thirsty?

854
00:40:00,947 --> 00:40:04,382
Huh. You gotta start
thinking about yourself, honey.

855
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:06,251
That's the game.

856
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:17,728
Dollars ok?

857
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:19,564
Gracias.

858
00:40:46,523 --> 00:40:48,056
Ellen Russel?

859
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:52,862
How'd you find me?

860
00:40:52,896 --> 00:40:57,398
Darlene never unpacked
her daughter's bags from this trip.

861
00:40:57,466 --> 00:41:01,002
And I took a wild guess.

862
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:04,772
So what happens now?

863
00:41:06,141 --> 00:41:09,176
What happens now
is you go back to the U.S.

864
00:41:09,244 --> 00:41:13,881
I take 6 days off
that I don't even want.

865
00:41:13,948 --> 00:41:17,183
Where's Darlene?

866
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:19,285
She's long gone.

867
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,690
Personally, I have
mixed feelings about that one.

868
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:27,895
But we'll get her, too.

869
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:31,497
Levantese.

870
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:11,334
[Speaking spanish]

871
00:42:11,402 --> 00:42:13,537
...a Los Estados Unidos.

872
00:42:13,605 --> 00:42:15,238
Rossi: Thanks for your help.

873
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,725
Rossi: Paul Brown once said,

874
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:39,427
"If you win, say nothing.

875
00:42:39,495 --> 00:42:42,664
If you lose, say less."

876
