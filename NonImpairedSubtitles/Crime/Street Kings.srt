3
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,407
Yo, dawg.

4
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:02,993
Konichiwa.

5
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,195
- What?
- Konichiwa.

6
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,438
Konichiwa means:
"What's up?"

7
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:11,217
- So what the fuck's up?
- We know what it means.

8
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,994
You wanna smoke?

9
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:14,642
Read the paper??? yourself clean.

10
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:16,907
Couple of these and you'll be
fucking like beasts.

11
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,685
- Boys like pussy, right?
- Hey!

12
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:24,255
Yo, do we look like fucking
tweakers (speed addicts) to you?

13
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:28,251
- So you got the shit or not?
Yeah. You?

14
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,760
What the fuck is this?
We said a machine gun.

15
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,992
It is a machine gun.

16
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:43,037
- The kind you can carry.
- Couldn't get none of those.

17
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:46,311
This baby's got character,
Korean war vintage.

18
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:48,421
Maybe we mowed down
one of your grand-papa sans,

19
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,652
when he was charging the wire
in China.???

20
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,875
Shit, it's fuckin' stuck.

21
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:55,136
Fuck it! Take it right. 3 large,
($3000) (and it's yours).

22
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:57,075
Nigger, I drive a $100,000 car.

23
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:59,807
We want your fagotty ass right
or we'll jack (take) it from you.

24
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,726
Cool. Down to insult right now.

25
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,455
Konichiwa is Japanese.
It's insulting to Koreans.

26
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:07,077
How am I supposed to tell
if you can't?

27
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,392
'fuck's that supposed
to mean, white boy?

28
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,674
Means you got eyes like apostrophes,
you dress white, you talk black,

29
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,529
and drive dukes?? (gay cars).
So how am I supposed to know

30
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:15,751
what kind of zipperhead (Asian)

31
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,551
dog-munching thing you are,
if you don't

32
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,248
Yo.

33
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:21,616
You know what the fuck we are?

34
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:23,939
Yes, you're a couple of
panheads (peasants)...

35
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,768
buyin' a machine gun out of a trunk.

36
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:29,847
What's up?

37
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,512
- Take him up.
- Get your ass up!

38
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:39,901
Shit.

39
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,696
What do you mean, shit?!

40
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:48,006
- Konichiwa, bitch.
- Let's go.

41
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:23,792
Where?

42
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,224
* Missing
Call Missing Children Hotline

43
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,911
(Shit! )

44
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:33,048
It' okay.
I'm a cop.

45
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,238
Captain Wander, congratulations on
breaking the case.

46
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:58,677
Can you tell me how
you've found the twins?

47
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:01,555
Truly, my people turned this city
upside down, looking for these girls.

48
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,836
I could not be prouder of my men.

49
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,655
Ma'am, excuse me.

50
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,641
How can you shoot a guy
taking a dump?

51
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,330
I mean, seriously, that's sacred.

52
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,919
That's like shooting
the man in a church.

53
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:13,079
Or a Dodger game.

54
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,032
Whatever it takes to be a hero,
any time, any place, right, Lud?

55
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:16,709
I guess so...

56
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:18,639
I hate these slit-eyed
kiddy-raping bastards.

57
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:21,012
At least kidnap some full-grown
ladies with shapes.

58
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,431
Wow. Maybe we should check his
closet next, eh, Lud?

59
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:26,009
The girls are being examined by
a physician right now.

60
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:28,940
Both twins are in good health

61
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,422
and will be reunited
with their family shortly.

62
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,849
L.A. Times front page tomorrow
is gonna say:

63
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:36,562
"Vice detective rescues missing twins."

64
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:40,048
Detective.
Singular.

65
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,691
Yeah, maybe we've been sittin'
around on our asses and doin' jack shit

66
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,051
- and all during the last month.
- Hey!

67
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:46,471
You two cut the shit.
The boss is on his way right now.

68
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:47,966
I mean, you could've
just saved some for us.

69
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:49,239
[What do you want], Santos?

70
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,713
You wanna see their faces every night?
You wanna be a killer?

71
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,440
You know what? Shut the fuck up!

72
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,713
Hey, what the hell is going on?
Hey!

73
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:57,241
This is real professional.

74
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,735
What if I walk in here
with the chief? Huh?

75
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,192
Santos, go get your ass outside.

76
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,633
Find Ted Berman and make sure

77
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,350
that that crime scene lot
is in order.

78
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,868
- Yes, sir.
- Ride along, boy.

79
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,534
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hey, secure that bullshit, right?

80
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:11,364
Both of you.

81
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:14,712
Clady, you take DeMille back
to the ward and start writing.

82
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:17,244
I want something to red-pin by midnight.

83
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,156
- Tell your buddy he's
gonna do his writing.

84
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,548
Got it captain. Let's go.

85
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,914
This is crazy.

86
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,129
You fucked 'em up.

87
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,290
This is beautiful.

88
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,634
And that machine gun shit,
that was perfect.

89
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,763
I know you hate to wait,
but it's better this way.

90
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:48,733
- You all right?
- Yeah.

91
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,672
- I got shot.
- Yeah, but you're okay?

92
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,695
Yeah. I'm okay, Jack.

93
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:57,075
Because I know you're not tripping
about these...these assholes, right?

94
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,930
Fuck, it's cool.

95
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,088
You were toe to toe with evil,
and you won.

96
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,302
You saved those girls.

97
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:06,233
This is lovely, Tommy.

98
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,999
Come here, man.
Give me a hug.

99
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:10,414
Come on.

100
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:17,377
Not so tight.
What are you hiding from?

101
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,207
You've been drinking.

102
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,900
You know, that thing
they say about vodka?

103
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,461
That you can't smell it?

104
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:26,962
It's bullshit.

105
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:27,933
The D.A. (district attorney)...

106
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:29,440
shooting team is in rut
right now (do their job).

107
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,559
And your're not ready
for public consumption.

108
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,655
So...come on, I wanna
get you to a hospital.

109
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,305
Get you away from all of this.

110
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:38,650
Thanks, Jack.

111
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,044
If that aint L.A.'s deadliest white boy.

112
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:57,109
Aren't you on the wrong side
of the yellow tape?

113
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:00,196
Congrats on four more notches
for your gun butt.

114
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,594
I'll be praying for
the families of your victims.

115
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,717
They're called "suspects."

116
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,942
The victims are the
14-year old school girls...

117
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:09,746
the suspects kept in a cage
and sold to chicken hawks (paedophiles)

118
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:11,933
to poke prod (harrass)
put on the Internet.

119
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:14,770
"Suspects," Washington.
"Suspects."

120
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,290
As evil as those men were,
they had a right to trial.

121
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,043
There is gonna be some
blowback (revenge)...

122
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,477
from the Korean community on this one.

123
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:25,158
Now that you're off limits,
why don't you just say it?

124
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:26,827
You think I'm a racist.

125
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:28,850
- Do you have another explanation?
- No, I don't,

126
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,150
because if I rule and
determine a suspect...

127
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,478
is black, yellow or brown

128
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,505
I blow them out of their socks.

129
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,292
But if they are white,
I give them a ride home.

130
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,270
You know why?
Because I am a racist. Fuck you.

131
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,790
Man, I would give you my right arm
to have that shit on tape.

132
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,336
What happened to you, Terrence?
We used to be brothers.

133
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:48,574
Hey, hey!

134
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:52,273
Stay on point, Washington.
You stay on point (focus).

135
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:55,718
Always, Captain Wander.
Always.

136
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,031
Tom. Come on,
let's get you out of here.

137
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,097
Don't go near that piece of shit.

138
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:05,504
He's got it coming, Jack.

139
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:07,622
Do not go near him.
Stay away, far away.

140
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,175
- Fuck him.
- That's an order.

141
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,121
I'm waiting for Nurse Garcia.

142
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:21,604
I did the same thing
with this girl once.

143
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:25,398
She was a waitress at a jazz bar.

144
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,860
I'd sit in her section and
won't let anybody else serve me.

145
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,133
If they changed sections,
I'd change tables.

146
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,291
Persistence, that's the key.

147
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,355
Wait a second.

148
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,305
You're that cop. You're that--
I've just seen your face on tv.

149
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:48,105
You rescued those
Korean twins, right?

150
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,491
Are you okay?
Did you get shot?

151
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,620
No.
Yeah.

152
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:58,531
How about you?

153
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,593
Me? I sell insurance.
Life, auto, casualty.

154
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,421
That was some heavy shit, man.

155
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:07,791
So those guys, they shot first, right?

156
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,835
Excuse me?

157
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:13,030
The whole city was looking
for those kids.

158
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:19,386
- How'd you find them?
- That's my job.

159
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:25,533
Excuse me, Captain.
Sorry to interrupt.

160
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,287
Deputy Chief??? is trying to raise you
on the simplex (radio).

161
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:32,499
Insurance, Tom.
I sell insurance.

162
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,012
If you ever need any,
and you will,

163
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,672
why don't you give me a call?

164
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,769
No one has to know but us.
Not Clady, not Wander, no one.

165
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,934
CAPTAIN JAMES BIGGS.

166
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,740
Listen, for your own good...

167
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,587
Don't get yourself so far out there
that I can't reel you back.

168
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,507
See you sometime.

169
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,046
Who was that?

170
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:07,250
Copper??? cops.
Jesus.

171
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,227
- Who?
- Nobody, Grace.

172
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,014
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:19,755
Hold this.

174
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,141
You know, you can just
stop by sometime.

175
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:26,419
You don't have to get shot
when you want to see me.

176
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,538
Why? I like it like this.

177
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,093
Don't you?

178
00:16:30,193 --> 00:16:31,598
No, I don't.

179
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:33,710
I don't.

180
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,737
No.????

181
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:38,911
I work here. I'm not losing
my license for you.

182
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:42,084
- I am a cop.
- No.

183
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:49,863
I keep the door open after
identifying myself as a police officer.

184
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:51,341
Upon entry, I was fired upon

185
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:54,221
by a suspect in the living room
with a silver automatic.

186
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:56,599
I returned fire,
he goes down.

187
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,857
Then I'm hit in the torso by shotgun
fire from the second suspect.

188
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:01,057
Point of entry?

189
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,135
Front door in the
west side of the structure.

190
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,233
Why didn't you call
for backup?

191
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,202
Exigent (urgent) circumstances.

192
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:10,537
I heard screams
emanating from the house,

193
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,816
and assertained a crime was in progress.

194
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:43,170
Great work you did there.
Thanks a lot.

195
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:45,665
Now it's a party.

196
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,416
Oh my goodness, now it's
a bandage???, captain.

197
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:48,376
How you doin'?

198
00:17:48,476 --> 00:17:51,345
Steady, steady.
Yeah, he's in.

199
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:54,423
What's with you?
Clady give you a 'happy ending'?

200
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:56,842
Is that any way to address a commander?

201
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,512
Got the call from the
chief this morning.

202
00:17:58,612 --> 00:17:59,708
[The promotion] is next week.

203
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,774
Congratulations, boss.

204
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:04,917
We're gonna have the keys to the city.

205
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,086
Do you believe that shit?
They're crowning him king.

206
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,297
Let's get a toast to that.
Toast to the king.

207
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:10,923
King Wander.

208
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,800
Yo boss, gotta be your driver
when you make chief?

209
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,886
- You got it, you got it if you want.
- All right.

210
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:16,898
You know, I owe you one, Tom.

211
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:19,470
That pot twins caper,
that gave me the edge.

212
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,977
You know, the chief,
he's breaking tradition.

213
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:23,048
????

214
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:26,373
The first commander's slot?? always goes
to the head of Internal Affairs,

215
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,373
that's the way it is.

216
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,900
That's because they got
so much dirt on everyone.

217
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,454
That's right,

218
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:31,095
and they're always
looking for more, huh?

219
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,772
Yeah.

220
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,599
You know this prick?

221
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,977
Came at me like "Joe Concerned Citizen"
asking procedural questions.

222
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:42,239
Yeah, we got a history, this--

223
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,301
See, if they'd show up
during the daytime,

224
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:46,676
you would know who your enemies are.

225
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:48,219
What did you tell him?

226
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,697
I couldn't help myself clearly,
I told him everything.

227
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,497
Attaboy.

228
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,550
You know, this is a typical
Biggs bullshit move,

229
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,635
???
Backdoor is all they fuckin' got.

230
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,762
Why is Internal Affairs
after my ass all of a sudden?

231
00:18:57,862 --> 00:18:59,180
It's Washington, brother.

232
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,841
Your ex-partner is a snitch.

233
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,073
Holy shit.

234
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:10,800
Jack, talk to me.

235
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,760
Washington has had several meetings...

236
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,971
with Captain Biggs over
the last few weeks.

237
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:17,540
They're no secrets in the department,

238
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,293
so when I became cognizant (aware)
of the problem, we threw a tail on him,

239
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,287
I followed this guy,
Eastside, Westside, Southside.

240
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,259
Next thing I know, he's ringing Biggs'
doorbell in??? land.

241
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,118
Who's Washington given up?
(betrayed)

242
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,764
You, Tom.

243
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:35,086
- Me?
- Yeah.

244
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,809
- Why now?
- Because I shitcanned (fired)

245
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,228
him from this unit
and he is a vindictive bastard.

246
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:42,898
And now he is on a mission
to pull the??? from under my best guys.

247
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:46,743
All my best guys,
that's what this shit's about.

248
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,136
Tommy, Tommy.

249
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:53,242
- That's your life right there.
- I'm just gonna talk to my friend.

250
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:54,535
- No, you 're not. You're not.
- You wanna talk?

251
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,016
Let's talk about my foot up your ass

252
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,372
if you don't sit the fuck down
here on your chair right now.

253
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:00,759
Have a seat.
Come on.

254
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:04,179
What the fuck is wrong with you?

255
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:09,726
Do not, and I repeat, do not
hand Washington your badge.

256
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:14,013
I know you two have done some
??? (shit) together,

257
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,808
But we gotta hold the line,
you and me.

258
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,372
We've been here before, haven't we?

259
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:21,687
When the gates of hell
opened up on you, Tom.

260
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,390
I took care of you then,
I'm gonna take care of you now.

261
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,119
- All right?
- Okay.

262
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:07,626
Washington.

263
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,305
Drop it.
- What are you doing?

264
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:12,881
Do you want to kill me, partner?

265
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:14,550
Are you crazy, we've
got a 211 in park rest???.

266
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,385
I got you.
I got you and Wander.

267
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:19,731
Listen to me, you idiot. We've got two
gang bangers rolling in hot.

268
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,074
Shit.

269
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:01,506
Washington.
Stay with me, partner.

270
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,246
- Don't move! Let me see your hands!
- I'm a cop...

271
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:27,519
I'm a cop,
I'm a fucking cop!

272
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,166
Fuck.

273
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:31,460
- It's Ludlow.
- Give me an ambulance now.

274
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,079
Holy shit.

275
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,634
He's a cop too?

276
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:37,192
Yeah.

277
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,561
Where's the video?

278
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,701
- Who else has seen this?
- Just us, boss.

279
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,203
It was a straight 211 that went south.

280
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:49,163
That's not what it was,
that's what it looks like.

281
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:51,449
But it's not what it looks like.
It's not.

282
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:53,376
That's all there is, Tom.

283
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:56,262
What it looks like.
What everybody sees.

284
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,622
You knew that.

285
00:24:57,722 --> 00:24:59,095
Right, if anybody in the
department sees this video,

286
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:00,491
you're no longer a cop,
do you understand that?

287
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:03,620
The department?
If the D.A. sees this...

288
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,076
- he's going to prison.
- Why?

289
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,065
Because Washington was
in the wrong place at the wrong time?

290
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:09,796
No, because you were.

291
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:13,254
Washington's problems are over.
Yours are just beginning.

292
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:16,536
Try to think
two moves ahead, for once.

293
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:20,077
Captain Biggs will say that you got
two thugs (criminals) off the street

294
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:21,999
went after a cop who
was diming (selling) you out

295
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,723
to Internal Affairs.

296
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:24,707
It writes itself.

297
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,813
I was just gonna break his jaw.
- That's a good answer.

298
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:30,639
I gave you a direct order:
Stay away from him.

299
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,700
Give me your goddamn gun.
Now.

300
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,303
Give me your goddamn gun.

301
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,451
You don't give a shit about yourself,
that's pretty obvious,

302
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:46,729
but you gotta think about the unit.
You really fucked us on this one.

303
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,982
Clady, give me a minute, please.

304
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,568
Yes, sir.

305
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,700
I can't afford to lose you.

306
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:01,541
Who would do what you do?

307
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:05,290
You are the tip of the fucking spear.

308
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:10,420
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

309
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,577
Maybe...

310
00:26:19,261 --> 00:26:20,860
the clerk...

311
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,652
forget to put a disk
in the recorder today.

312
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,849
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom.

313
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:35,278
And you ran to the aid to Washington.

314
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,417

00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:09,950
Detective Washington was tireless

475
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,100
in his devotion to his church,
his love for his family...

476
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,874
and his dedication to this department.

477
00:35:16,974 --> 00:35:20,336
Uniform detail,
atten-hut!

478
00:35:20,936 --> 00:35:24,457
Fire guard,
port arms.

479
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,603
Half right, face.

480
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:31,864
Ready.
Aim! Fire!

481
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,250
Aim!
Fire!

482
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,048
Aim!
Fire!

483
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,641
Uniform detail,
present arms!

484
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,888
- Go back to work.
- Yes sir.

485
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:11,625
Let's go get 'em.

486
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:12,729
Sir.

487
00:36:26,243 --> 00:36:28,163
Mrs. Washington?

488
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:34,453
- I was the first scene.
- Yeah, of course you were.

489
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:37,247
Excuse me.

490
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:55,076
Are you Diskant?

491
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:56,442
Yeah.

492
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:59,575
You're working on Washington?

493
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:01,362
Yeah.

494
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:03,823
You know who I am?

495
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,208
Yes.

496
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,903
Are you not interviewing me?

497
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:10,876
You are on my list.

498
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:13,745
Let's get rolling.
Where do I start?

499
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:18,021
Gang books, mug shots (photos)?
211 ("robbery") reports?

500
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:20,715
If you want.

501
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:23,343
Come on, Diskant.
You've worked for homicide before.

502
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:27,429
I'm 242 ("battery": brawls, fights).

503
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,750
Okay, 242.
You got the ballistics report?

504
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,850
No.

505
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,594
The bullets are still at the coroner's.

506
00:37:33,694 --> 00:37:35,955
Yeah, but they've given
you updates, right?

507
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:38,795
Did they tell you how many different
calibres they dug out of Washington?

508
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:41,152
- What do you want?
- How many?

509
00:37:45,948 --> 00:37:47,867
Goodbye, detective.

510
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:58,554
Harry, I thought you were dead.

511
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:16,604
[Department of Coroner]
[Administration Operations]

512
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,993
I'm from Vice Special.

513
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,613
Tom Ludlow.
I know who you are.

514
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:27,562
I handled your wife's autopsy.

515
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:31,101
That was you?

516
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:33,004
The asshole, remember?

517
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:35,010
Right.

518
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,188
The guy who washed away all the
hair and fibre evidence.

519
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:41,079
The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab.

520
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:43,748
The guy who left me
with nothing to go on.

521
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,075
It's not my job to investigate adultery.

522
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:48,353
How can I help you?

523
00:38:52,723 --> 00:38:54,892
Pulled these out of Washington?

524
00:38:54,992 --> 00:38:57,499
Yep. 18 rounds. Ten .45 calibre...

525
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,782
full metal jackets,
seven 9 millimeter FMJs

526
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:02,322
and a single .38 hollow point...

527
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,606
mushroomed against the
scapula (shoulder blade).

528
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:08,039
Serious overkill.
Must've really pissed off the shooters.

529
00:39:10,741 --> 00:39:13,136
Did you get what you were looking for?

530
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,977
I am Detective Diskant, we spoke
on the phone earlier.

531
00:39:17,077 --> 00:39:20,064
- I'm here for the ballistics evidence.
- How're you doing?

532
00:39:20,664 --> 00:39:24,289
- When can I expect the report?
- In about an hour, sir.

533
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:27,320
- Can you fax this to my office?
- Okay.

534
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,364
Thank you, Doc.

535
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:39,554
Diskant, talk to me.

536
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:42,549
You got three different calibres,
that means three weapons.

537
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:46,077
What's your take went
on down in that market?

538
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:48,613
Two bad guys come through the front door...

539
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:50,531
to rob the place, one
of them sees the clerk,

540
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:51,993
cut's him in half, the other one sees

541
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,646
Washington, whose weapon
is already drawn,

542
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:55,828
empties his clip into him.

543
00:39:55,928 --> 00:39:58,117
His buddy joins the party,
till he runs dry,

544
00:39:58,218 --> 00:39:59,736
then one of them pulls a .38,

545
00:39:59,836 --> 00:40:02,719
pumps a final "fuck you"-round
into Washington's back.

546
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:06,596
They leave, you show up
after they're gone.

547
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,594
Got it all figured out.

548
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:15,031
I got your back here,

549
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:17,425
but you got to keep your distance
and let me work this case.

550
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:20,294
No one's gonna find these assholes.
Is that what you need to hear from me?

551
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:22,197
Are you fucking kidding me?

552
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:24,899
They get a pass and you get a pass.
That's the deal, right?

553
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:27,318
What are you talking about,
"the shooters get a pass"?

554
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:29,349
I don't understand.
Clady said you were on board.

555
00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:30,767
Not with this.

556
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:33,332
What is the deal?
You throw in this case for a promotion?

557
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:35,676
If I were you I'd be
more morried about yourself.

558
00:40:35,776 --> 00:40:38,293
Hey, you piece of shit! You got a
187 (homicide) on a police officer

559
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:40,293
and you're fucking
lettin' the suspects walk?

560
00:40:40,393 --> 00:40:42,095
- You want these guys found?
- That doesn't piss you off?

561
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:43,782
- So they can put you out in the????
- Fuck off!

562
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:44,911
Place you in the store
before the shooting?

563
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,829
Do you want to catch
a felony for obstruction?

564
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:49,166
If I say you weren't there,
you weren't there.

565
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:53,094
This is your mess,
and I'm cleaning it up.

566
00:40:53,194 --> 00:40:55,046
Yeah, it pisses me off.

567
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:58,133
Diskant.

568
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,284
Yeah.

569
00:41:01,034 --> 00:41:03,213
Yes, hang on one second.

570
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,165
All right, go ahead.

571
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,101
All right, thank you.

572
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:13,507
Bye bye.

573
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:17,639
You write in codes.

574
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:20,739
The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt
and a bandana outside the store.

575
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:22,932
The DNA corresponds to those two names.

576
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:24,863
Congratulations, you
I.D. ed the shooters.

577
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:26,886
Yeah, normally I would be pretty happy.

578
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,204
Pull the rep sheets. Give me copies.

579
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,308
I'll see you around.

580
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:40,217
The computer says you
arrested these guys.

581
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:43,345
Fremont and Coates.

582
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:46,389
Good guys.
Say hi from me.

583
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:47,890
Do you remember them?

584
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,354
Who can forget?

585
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:51,936
Heroin dealers with a
taste for blood.

586
00:41:52,536 --> 00:41:56,190
Came up from Belize to make a sale
and they liked the Southland so much.

587
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,237
They never left.

588
00:41:57,337 --> 00:42:00,470
Yeah, we hooked these fine gentlemen
on a rape/mutilation caper.

589
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,174
It seems they had a
three day hostage fest

590
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:05,112
with this cute little Guatemalan chick.

591
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:07,993
They snatched her up
when she was walking over from school.

592
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:09,061
Hurt her bad.

593
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:11,647
- Then why are they on the streets?
- They walked from the????.

594
00:42:11,747 --> 00:42:13,202
One of our own felt we violated

595
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:15,290
Mr. Coates' and Mr.
Fremont's civil rights

596
00:42:15,684 --> 00:42:17,286
and told the city attorney.

597
00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:19,505
- Washington dimed you out.
- Yeah.

598
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,255
Why do you think they put that dude
community relations?

599
00:42:23,355 --> 00:42:24,819
Are you shittin' me?

600
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,605
Washington kicked loose
the very guys who whacked him?

601
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:29,403
Damn ironic, isn't it?

602
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:32,924
Hello, guys.
What is this, a garage sale?

603
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:35,775
Hello, Lud?
What's this?

604
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,199
Why...uh...

605
00:42:37,749 --> 00:42:39,600
Why do you have this?

606
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,994
Those are the shitbags
who popped Washington.

607
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:43,637
Sarge, we can get these guys.

608
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:46,336
No, no.
Not if you want to keep your badge.

609
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:47,742
Besides, these two animals?

610
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:49,214
These guys,
they'll take care of each other.

611
00:42:49,314 --> 00:42:50,528
They'll be dead by the end of the week.

612
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:51,971
Probably shoot
each other's fucking faces off.

613
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:53,064
no one needs to.

614
00:42:53,164 --> 00:42:54,210
You know how this shit it works.

615
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,476
This week's suspect,
next week's victims.

616
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:58,300
Right?

617
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,922
Yeah, right.

618
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,690
- What are you doing here, Tom?
- Let's talk.

619
00:43:31,919 --> 00:43:33,571
I'm sick of this shit, man.

620
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:36,273
It's the same damn song for three years.

621
00:43:36,373 --> 00:43:38,292
Crying about your wife.

622
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,295
She's gone, Tom.

623
00:43:41,095 --> 00:43:43,674
What's it going to take
to bring you back from Mars?

624
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:47,906
Have I ever asked you for anything?

625
00:43:48,006 --> 00:43:49,804
You know what,
you ask me for shit all the time.

626
00:43:49,904 --> 00:43:51,566
Big things, Jack?

627
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,466
Important things.

628
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:55,159
What's up, Tom?

629
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,727
Give me a green light to...

630
00:43:56,827 --> 00:43:58,930
take out the assholes
who did Washington.

631
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,355
Come on, Jack.
King's X. (time-out, truce)

632
00:44:03,855 --> 00:44:05,373
What the hell is this?

633
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:08,464
I can lay them out like
I did those Koreans, but off the books.

634
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:10,570
I'm talking shovels and trash bags.

635
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,597
Who's going to know?
Who's going to care?

636
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,320
The Koreans...

637
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,247
that was business.

638
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:18,110
This is some crazy bullshit...

639
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,218
wrapped around in that
drunk ass mind of yours.

640
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:22,269
Look at yourself.

641
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:24,731
Look at yourself Tom, you're a mess!

642
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:28,042
When did you start drinking today?

643
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:30,333
You're little airplane bottles of vodka.

644
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,200
And you drove over here intoxicated.

645
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,606
You want a second DUI?
(driving under influence)

646
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:35,298
No one's going to fuck with me, Jack!

647
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:36,600
You're not listening to me!

648
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,115
You're not listening to me!

649
00:44:38,215 --> 00:44:39,946
No, you listen to me.

650
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:43,267
This is much bigger than that.

651
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:46,686
Do you think Biggs is stupid?

652
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:49,439
He has a PhD in catching cops slipping.

653
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:54,064
You know this.
You know all this.

654
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:56,287
You gotta hold your mud (stay strong).

655
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:58,365
Can you do that?

656
00:44:59,465 --> 00:45:02,403
It's time to turn the page
and close the book.

657
00:45:12,787 --> 00:45:14,430
They took $200.

658
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,663
I had forgotten about this
until I saw this.

659
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,487
That's the man.

660
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:22,647
That's him.

661
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:26,969
They took all my pay.
Said it was for the cookie jar.

662
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:30,288
The cookie jar.

663
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:32,265
That's what he said.

664
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:37,721
I'll be right back.

665
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:53,804
What do you want, Disco?

666
00:45:55,346 --> 00:45:58,383
Washington was dirty.
He was a piece of shit.

667
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,921
Why are you telling me this?

668
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:05,799
I think you know why.

669
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:08,685
I know why.

670
00:46:11,211 --> 00:46:13,815
- Got it in this? Huh?
- That's a new phone.

671
00:46:13,915 --> 00:46:15,988
You're working for Internal Affairs.

672
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:18,962
You made one deal,
maybe you made two?

673
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:21,924
Did Captain Biggs
flip you to the dark side, punk?

674
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:24,901
You know what?

675
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:29,931
They're right about you.
You are fucking out there (mad).

676
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:33,376
From now on you stay away from me.
We don't talk.

677
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:36,538
Hold on, Disco.
Hold on.

678
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:39,775
I gotta watch my own back
these days, you know?

679
00:46:41,075 --> 00:46:42,810
Come on.
Don't be mad.

680
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,688
Washington was dirty.

681
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:49,776
Hit me, princess.
Come on.

682
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,771
Couple of things.

683
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:55,773
You know, we found $50,000 in cash
??? at the store?

684
00:46:55,873 --> 00:46:58,860
No, I didn't. That's a lot of cash
but not in itself damning.

685
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,866
Oh, but this is.

686
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:02,321
Looks like an evidence tag.

687
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:03,656
I found it in Washington's truck.

688
00:47:03,756 --> 00:47:05,362
I had SID (Scientific
Investigation Division)...

689
00:47:05,462 --> 00:47:06,826
scan it, corresponds
to a kilo of heroin.

690
00:47:07,226 --> 00:47:09,637
Guess who comes along
and signs up the dope?

691
00:47:09,737 --> 00:47:11,143
Washington.

692
00:47:11,243 --> 00:47:14,093
Washington signed out heroin
and returned brown sugar.

693
00:47:16,977 --> 00:47:18,972
Guys who worked (killed) him moved dope.

694
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:23,316
You know, Washington sprung them from
a rape [charge] on a technicality.

695
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,967
No, I did not know that.

696
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:27,563
Maybe they had a business arrangement.

697
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:29,849
Maybe it was a hit?
(assassination)

698
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:31,993
That would explain
the heavy artillery.

699
00:47:34,203 --> 00:47:36,414
Washington deserved it, right?

700
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:38,584
He was dirty, so fuck him.

701
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:41,611
I feel much better
about the suspects walking,

702
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:45,007
And you must feel better, too, right?
We're doing the right thing.

703
00:47:48,383 --> 00:47:50,471
No shame if you want to take your pass.

704
00:47:55,516 --> 00:47:57,303
This has to be you and me.

705
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:01,507
Why do you think we're
in the goddamn bathroom?

706
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:25,139
This is it. The last known address.

707
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:41,946
We are cops.

708
00:48:42,848 --> 00:48:43,928
Do you live here?

709
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:45,209
How long have you been living here?

710
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,440
Three months.

711
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,566
Who's living with you?

712
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:52,559
My mum, my dad, my sisters and brothers
and my cousin Grisella.

713
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:53,752
No one else?

714
00:48:58,387 --> 00:48:59,587
Okay.

715
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,138
Family or not.
Our boys are long gone.

716
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:09,666
All right, Disco.

717
00:49:10,266 --> 00:49:12,752
See those yahoos (idiots)?
I'm gonna jam 'em.

718
00:49:12,852 --> 00:49:14,802
And when I do,
one of them is gonna bolt (run).

719
00:49:14,902 --> 00:49:16,257
That's the one that has to do it.

720
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:19,063
Are you bored or something?

721
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:20,960
This is their (neighbor)hood.

722
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:23,055
If anyone knows Fremont
and Coates, they do.

723
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:28,652
- Fuck it.
- Look at those guys.

724
00:49:35,316 --> 00:49:36,994
Get him.

725
00:49:42,206 --> 00:49:44,201
Suck on my balls!

726
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:48,254
Go home.
You're in the wrong neighborhood.

727
00:49:51,924 --> 00:49:53,510
Watch out!

728
00:50:00,182 --> 00:50:01,910
Run, amigo.

729
00:50:23,014 --> 00:50:24,474
Spencer.

730
00:51:04,246 --> 00:51:05,841
I had him.

731
00:51:07,408 --> 00:51:08,943
Why are you running, man?
