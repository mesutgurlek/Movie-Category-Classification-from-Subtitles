1
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,068
Let's go, let's go.

2
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:21,775
Ready for them?

3
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:23,869
Rosie, open up.

4
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:29,673
<i>Vamos. Afuera. Vamos.</i>

5
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:34,785
Okay, let's go.

6
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:39,254
- Just give me five.
- What?

7
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:49,470
What do you want me to do?

8
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:51,972
Look, it's not my problem.

9
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,804
All I'm asking, Stevens,

10
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,470
is did the old man get seen to?

11
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:59,070
He was sweating and shaking
when I put him on the bus.

12
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:00,672
He said his arm felt numb.

13
00:03:00,749 --> 00:03:02,740
Jesus Christ, Brogan.

14
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:05,082
Everything is
a humanitarian crisis with you.

15
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:08,351
You signed off on more
orders of recognizance

16
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,722
than the rest of your unit combined.

17
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:12,055
Don't give me that shit.

18
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:14,391
The man's about to have
a goddamn heart attack.

19
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:16,226
I want him seen to.

20
00:03:20,436 --> 00:03:21,903
Here he is.

21
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,962
Your guy was given
a clean bill of health by Doc Sturgess.

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,201
He bused out three hours ago.
You happy now?

23
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,904
Yeah, I'm happy now.

24
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,963
Hey, Max, you're coming
on Wednesday, right?

25
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:55,629
For my dad's nationalization party?

26
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:57,797
Max, it's an important thing
in my culture

27
00:03:57,873 --> 00:03:59,101
to make my father proud.

28
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,937
You know they've been
wanting to meet you.

29
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,000
I give you my word,
they're not as scary

30
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:05,239
as I made them out to be, okay?

31
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:07,680
You better do it before
they blow the lunch whistle.

32
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,241
All right, let's go, compadres. Let's do it.

33
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,514
Get down!

34
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,247
- Over there.
- I got it. Sorry.

35
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,747
What you waiting for, Brogan?

36
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:24,088
A marriage proposal?

37
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:26,150
Come on.

38
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:27,718
Come on.

39
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:37,505
Hey, hey! Gene.

40
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:41,033
I got her. Thanks.

41
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:58,258
No, no, no.

42
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:00,522
<i>No es posible.</i>

43
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:20,176
<i>Muy bonita. You get her number?</i>

44
00:06:22,484 --> 00:06:24,076
I smell an O.R.

45
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,915
Yeah, he's always giving
the pretty ones a pass,

46
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:28,320
sometimes even
the not-so-pretty ones.

47
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,119
- Oh!
- Okay?

48
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:32,558
Now knock it the fuck off.

49
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:08,060
Okay, everybody say,
"Thank you, Mr. Kossef,

50
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,064
for singing that beautiful song."

51
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,760
Thank you, Mr. Kossef.

52
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,573
You know, that was actually
a pretty tough crowd.

53
00:07:23,645 --> 00:07:25,044
Yeah.

54
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:27,206
Well, was I shit?

55
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:29,250
No, actually.

56
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,752
No, and for somebody
who just learned the song last night,

57
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,414
- I thought you did a very good job.
- Oh, good.

58
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:37,424
'Cause I had absolutely no idea

59
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:39,687
- what I was singing about.
- Yeah.

60
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:42,229
- Oh, you could tell?
- Yeah, and also,

61
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:44,595
please don't take this the wrong way,

62
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:49,694
but what kind of Jew gets
hired at a Jewish day school

63
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:51,762
who doesn't speak any Hebrew

64
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,331
or even really, like, know
the first thing about Judaism?

65
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:57,901
Well, I guess, the atheist kind.

66
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,208
Excuse me?

67
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:00,714
No, I'm sorry.

68
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:03,216
It's just... I just needed a job.

69
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:06,379
And it was actually my manager's mom

70
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:09,583
- is the principal of the school.
- Ah.

71
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,658
- You didn't completely suck.
- Oh, thank you.

72
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,406
I do not want you to say
a word about this to anyone.

73
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:31,412
I mean anyone.

74
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,448
It could be very serious
trouble for the school,

75
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,075
- and for me.
- No, I'm not gonna say anything.

76
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,483
I want you to know

77
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:41,613
I am only doing this
because of my son,

78
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,285
because he says to me, "Mom, Gavin
is going to be an important musician."

79
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,260
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

80
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:51,026
Otherwise, I wouldn't do anything like this.

81
00:08:56,138 --> 00:09:00,006
Well, thank you. Thank you, Rachel.

82
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:03,135
Honestly, I can't thank you enough.

83
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,557
She'll be right along, ma'am.

84
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,119
Thank you.

85
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:42,341
Oh.

86
00:09:46,822 --> 00:09:49,655
Mmm. Mmm.

87
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,157
Hold on just a second.

88
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:55,662
Would you like to draw?

89
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,164
Here you go, honey.

90
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:00,428
I have something else
for you this week, too.

91
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:04,670
Your teacher, Madame Ntende,

92
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:07,435
sent this to me in the mail.

93
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,739
She said that you lost it
right before you left

94
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,745
and that you were really sad.

95
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:14,043
And she found it a few weeks ago.

96
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:27,687
Honey, it's gonna be
a little while longer,

97
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:32,096
and we are working very hard
to find you a good mommy.

98
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:35,603
She won't ever replace
your real mommy,

99
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,831
but she will love you.

100
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:41,740
And I promise that she'll never leave you.

101
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,484
The men
involved in this terrorist attack

102
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:53,487
have been vilified,
demonized, and condemned

103
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,420
by the Western world.

104
00:10:56,725 --> 00:11:01,253
But we never want to talk
about the 9/11 Jihadists as real people.

105
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:03,763
The media and our leaders
are quick to label them

106
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:07,962
as terrorists and monsters
and murderers.

107
00:11:08,036 --> 00:11:11,062
But shouldn't we try
to understand them as human beings?

108
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,606
Fuck, no.

109
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:16,440
Everybody calls them cowards

110
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,775
for murdering helpless passengers

111
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:21,907
and causing the deaths
of thousands of innocent lives.

112
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,042
- What would you call them?
- Hey.

113
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,314
It's the truth.

114
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:30,256
But cowards do not knowingly
sacrifice themselves

115
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:32,122
for a greater cause.

116
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:34,128
- I don't agree at all.
- The cause is to kill us?

117
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:38,056
You may not agree with their cause...

118
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,067
I don't understand why she's up there.

119
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:43,002
But I do not believe their actions

120
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:45,835
were either cowardly or irrational.

121
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:47,966
You know you don't want
to hear this shit, Ms. B.

122
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,772
She's talking.

123
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:53,803
I feel that, like the oppressed
Palestinian people,

124
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:55,816
or the Iraqi citizens

125
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:58,478
under occupation
in their own homeland,

126
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:01,021
that they found themselves without a voice.

127
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,522
Hey.

128
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,185
And that the only way for them to be heard

129
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,423
is to scream with the might of tons of steel

130
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:12,364
and thunderous jet engines
behind them upon impact.

131
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,163
Okay, okay.

132
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:17,103
Their voices were heard.

133
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:19,606
You may not like what they had to say

134
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:22,108
or how they got their message across,

135
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:24,475
but for the first time, we heard it.

136
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,309
We gotta listen to this shit?

137
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,542
- What we heard was a cry for justice.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

138
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:32,053
Okay, okay. Yes, thank you.

139
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,883
Hey, Ms. B., thank you.

140
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,287
I am... I am not sure

141
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:38,383
that that was the point
of the assignment, Taslima,

142
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,123
but, uh, yes, it was
certainly thought-provoking.

143
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:44,097
- Bullshit.
- Yeah, bullshit.

144
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,189
You can sit down now.

145
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:46,461
College is hungry for her.

146
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:47,831
Fucking traitor.

147
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:49,426
Crybaby.

148
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,062
Why don't you get
the fuck out of our country

149
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:53,073
and go back to camel-humping
Saudi Arabia,

150
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,837
- where the fuck you camel-humpers live.
- Brian. Brian.

151
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,343
I know you're upset,

152
00:12:57,412 --> 00:13:00,040
but I'm not going to condone
an outburst like that.

153
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:03,141
Yo, what's your name? Taslima bin Laden?

154
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:05,550
Hey, yo, I just got one question, Ms. B.

155
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,178
Did you frisk her? What if the bitch

156
00:13:07,255 --> 00:13:09,746
be strapped with dynamite
or TNT or something?

157
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:11,587
She going to get a grenade!

158
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,651
- Yo, take us all out.
- Boom!

159
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:14,888
Marcus!

160
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,776
Sure, I'm up for that.

161
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,611
Oh, shit, it's my brother.

162
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,119
Hey.

Javier's giving me a ride home.

165
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,415
It's on my way.

166
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,928
I just need five minutes to finish up.

167
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:49,691
I'm in the middle of an order.

168

Look at you. Cover yourself up.

169
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:54,633
Just go.

170
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,728
I'll meet you in the car.

171
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,272
Please.

172
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,612
- Um, Heavy-eye?
- Javier.

173
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:15,247
Hi, I'm Claire.
We spoke on the phone, remember?

174
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:17,951
Right. Yeah.

175
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:19,516
Okay.

176
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:23,054
Is that okay?

177
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:24,826
Yeah, it's good.
Come back on Friday.

178
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,335
Friday. Is that the soonest?

179
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:29,802
Yeah.

00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:33,307

Thank you. I'm done.

Glad you came.
So how was your class?

235
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,666
What?

236
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:05,610
<i>I got a recurring role on The D'Angelos.</i>

237
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,773
- You got a part? Are you serious?
- Bitch.

238
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,215
- You did? You got a part?
- I know, it's unbelievable.

239
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,752
Oh, fuck. That's a big deal, babe.
It's big news.

240
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,185
- Yeah.
- We should get a drink.

241
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:15,279
I'll get it.

242
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:19,056
Thanks, babe.

243
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,391
So how did you pull it off?

244
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:24,295
I don't know. The casting director
knows my situation.

245
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:28,358
She's given me until Friday
to get my l-9 in.

246
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:32,099
So there's a fellow I met
through someone at Crunch.

247
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:34,664
He works at one of those photocopying
stores on Fountain.

248
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:37,074
Come on, no, no, no.
You can't do that.

249
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:39,909
If you get caught
with a fake green card,

250
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,949
you could be done for fraud.

251
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:44,109
It's no different from photoshopping
your Social Security card

252
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:46,483
to remove the "Not
for Employment" stamp.

253

Or passing yourself off
as a religious Jew

like, an actual atheist.

255
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:53,252
- Come home with me.
- What?

256
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:54,988
I'm serious. Come home with me.

257
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:57,759
It's not practical. You know that.

258
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:01,598
You know we can't make a go
of it without status.

259
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,637
I've gotta get legal, and so do you.

260
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,468
You've got to get legal.
You know that.

261
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,939
I'm working on that, all right?

262
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:08,202
I just want to know
where this guy is.

263
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,506
Your Captain America
who's gonna come down

264
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:11,943
he's gonna sweep you off your feet,

265
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:13,742
he's gonna marry you,
he's gonna make you legit.

266
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:15,544
- Isn't that what you're looking for?
- Captain America?

267
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:18,141
I just wonder what's taking you so long.

268
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:19,948
Here you go.

269
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,247
Thanks, babe.

270
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:25,383
Yeah, listen, I gotta go.

271
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,485
I gotta go. It was a real pleasure
meeting you...

272
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,154
- Rose.
- Rose.

273
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,165
Yeah, just give me an email

274
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,929

00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:37,436

276
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,700
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

277
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,481
She owes me money for the week.

278
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,027
What are you doing,
negotiating with me?

279
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:38,054
Is that what you think you're doing?

280
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:40,396
How much?

281
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:42,527
$50.

have a mailing receipt?

No, because I just copied
my l-94 and sent it by regular mail.

Okay, well, then how about a cancelled
check for the application fee?

Ma'am, you are not out of status

00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:30,092
until you receive a decision
on your extension application.

308
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:32,605
However, if that application
is lost in the system

309
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,732
or for whatever reason
it doesn't get to us,

310
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,367
then how are we supposed to know

311
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:38,435
that you even sent it in in the first place?

312
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:41,675
From our perspective, with no mailing receipt
or cancelled money order,

313

Yeah.

323
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:27,316
Yeah? You look dazed.

324
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:28,987
- No.
- Do you need to sit down?

325
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:30,121
Does it hurt anywhere?

326
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,186
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You sure?

327
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:32,755
Yeah, I'm all right, I think.

328
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:36,394
I've just had a really, really shitty day.

329
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,961
- Where you from, New Zealand?
- Australia.

330
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,405
It's always one or the other.

331
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:42,169
I can never quite tell the difference.

332
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:44,108
I said New Zealand to impress you
in case I was right.

333
00:25:44,178 --> 00:25:46,339
Most people usually say Australia,

334
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:48,712
which upsets the Kiwis.

335
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:50,774
I don't have the money to pay for this.

336
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,785
I'm not insured on my car.

337
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,787
Ouch. That's not good.

338
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:57,790
I must have fucked someone over
really badly in a past life

339
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,849
because shit is just
piling up for me today.

340
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,986
I just spent the last
three hours in there

341
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:03,997
trying to convince some bureaucratic bitch

342
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:06,533
that I actually did file for an extension
on my visitor's visa.

343
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,125
Which I fucking did.

344
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:11,933
- What's your name?
- I'm sorry. I'm Claire Shepard.

345
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:13,166
Claire Shepard, I'm Cole Frankel,

346
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,401
- and I know of your frustrations.
- You do?

347
00:26:15,476 --> 00:26:18,240
I'm a supervisory center
adjudications officer.

348
00:26:18,312 --> 00:26:20,177
What that means is I get to determine

349
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:24,684
whether a green card
application has merit or not.

350
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:26,811
Ah, that must be interesting.

351
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,514
Yeah, I'll tell you what's interesting,

352
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,614
and what's of a bit of concern to me,

353
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:32,989
aside from you not having insurance,

354
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,585
and that's someone who's filing
for an extension of their visitor's visa

355
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:37,494
driving around with a stack
of head shots in her car.

356
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:40,625
There's nothing wrong
with a beautiful woman like yourself

357
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,898
having head shots in her car
if you were back in Australia.

358
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:48,965
You're not authorized to be seeking
employment in the United States, Claire.

359
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:52,012
Am I wrong about that?

360
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:54,070
All right, here's what I propose.

361
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:56,446
We call AAA... my card, of course.

362
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:59,008
If you don't have insurance,
you sure as hell don't have AAA.

363
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,917
Then we get your vehicle sorted out.

364
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:03,855
Then we go grab some lunch together.

365
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,357
Excuse me?

366
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:08,793
I want to buy you lunch, Claire,
and explain your options to you.

367
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:11,161
or we could just take a walk
back into the building

368
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,859
and sort it out there.

369
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,548
Juanito! Juanito!

370
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:44,113
Juanito! Juanito!

371
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:49,995
<i>Gracias, Señor.</i>

372
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:11,551
Sanchez. Mireya.

373
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:14,383
24.

374
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:18,824
It would be last night
or early this morning.

375
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,325
You positive?

376
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:23,921
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

377
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,427
That's a great show.

378
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:33,166
Nothing can touch that on TV.

379
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,334
I thought you said you wanted
to discuss my situation.

380
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,604
All right.

381
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,213
Here's the thing, Claire.

382
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:44,410
You want to be an actress
like Nicole and Naomi, obviously.

383
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:46,419
You know as well as I do

384
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:48,421
the work they do in Australia
doesn't count for shit.

385
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:52,585
They're stars because they
make movies here in America.

386
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,823
If you were to get deported,
or even chose voluntary departure,

387
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,488
you ain't getting back into this country

388
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:59,532
for a minimum of ten years.

389
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,331
And with voluntary departure,
they say it's closer to five,

390
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:05,736
but the truth is, you're lucky
if you ever get back in.

391
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,273
What's your wife do?

392
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:08,774
She works for the other side.

393
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:10,173
She's an immigration defense attorney.

394
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:12,508
Oh. Is she available for a consult?

395
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:17,306
That's funny.

396
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:21,343
Sexy, great sense of humor.
You got it all, Claire.

397
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,253
Except for a work permit.

398
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:25,815
I don't think you'll feel so witty

399
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:28,555
when they introduce you
to a holding cell down in San Pedro.

400
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,494
Strip-search, the whole bit.

401
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:34,227
Some mama Latina makes you
her bitch for a couple nights.

402
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:39,295
All right. You've made your point.

403
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:41,967
So where would you like to do it?

404
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:05,389
You're goddamn amazing.

405
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:06,592
Whew.

406
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,431
You really are...

407
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:12,336
a perfect little fuck machine.

408
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,497
Without a green card.

409
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,774
Well, maybe we could
do something about that.

410
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,784
You can get me a green card?

411
00:31:24,852 --> 00:31:27,412
I can't just manufacture one for you.

412
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:32,448
I'm not in the counterfeiting business.

413
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:35,427
But I can have your file and application,

414
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:38,954
which would conveniently
land on my desk,

415
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:43,128
and regardless of the merits
of that application,

416
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:45,398
it would be approved.

417
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:48,134
You could really pull that off?

418
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,438
Like, on what grounds?

419
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:53,912
You're a recognized TV star
in Australia, Claire.

420
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:56,142
I'm bloody well not. I'm not even close.

421
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:59,083
I don't know that.

422
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:01,451
And no one else does.

423
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:07,090
You fabricate some credits,

424
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:09,721
a few, uh, Aussie awards,

425
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:11,287
some bullshit testimonials.

426
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:14,095
And I make it fly.

427
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:15,465
It's called an EB-1.

428
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:18,198
It's a green card for persons
of extraordinary ability.

429
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:20,763
Are you jerking me around?

430
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:22,365
Or is this real?

431
00:32:24,545 --> 00:32:26,410
Because if you can make
this happen for me...

432
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,674
You'd make it worth my while.

433
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:29,147
Mm-hmm.

434
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:31,480
For two weeks.

435
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:33,452
For a green card?

436
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,511
Six months, baby.

437
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:38,524
I don't think so.

438
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:40,389
One month.

439
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:41,826
Three months.

440
00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:43,795
Two months

441
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:46,526
and you get me approved
up front, all right?

442
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,363
You can hold on to the paperwork,

443
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:49,493
but I want to see it.
I want to know that it's real.

444
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,003
Done.

445
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:53,369
But you're on the clock from tomorrow.

446
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,399
I call, and you get your ass over
to whatever address I give you.

447
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,137
All right.

448
00:33:02,216 --> 00:33:04,548
So you through with me for the day?
Can I go grab a shower?

449
00:33:04,618 --> 00:33:07,109
No, wait.

450
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:11,419
I got one more favor
to ask of you, Claire.

451
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:15,451
I want you down on all fours
at the edge of the bed.

452
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,471
You ain't got that yet?

453
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:32,739
- You cheated today.
- Check it out, yo.

454
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:34,280
Wait, wait, wait.

455
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,043
You gonna talk to her, dude?

456
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,947
- Taslima. Taslima!
- Oh, God.

457
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,651
It's the sand-nigger express.

458
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:44,555
Raghead chick can hide her face
and nobody even know she butt-ugly.

459
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,752
Hey, maybe you can get
your sister to convert or something, A.Z.

460
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:48,488
Shut up.

461
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:53,631
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff!

462
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:57,027
Put on your belt.

463
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:02,265
No.

464
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:14,181
Immigration Customs Enforcement. Open
the door.

465
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:23,187
What is this about?

466
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,958
Federal agents.
Open the door, please.

467
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:26,624
We have a warrant.

468
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:32,301
Hands against the wall, please.

469
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:33,930
Hands against the wall.

470
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:35,565
What is this?

471
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:37,132
Why is the FBI here?

472
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,940
Relax, sir. Put your
hands behind your back.

473
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:47,417
Are you Taslima Jahangir?

474
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:50,780
I'm Special Agent Phadkar.

475
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:53,018
Will you show me
to your bedroom, please?

476
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:59,194
I don't understand what this is about.

477
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,824
Did you write this?

478
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,300
Why do you have it?

479
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:04,633
It was brought to our attention
by the principal of your school.

480
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:06,798
He was troubled by the position you took.

481
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:09,842
I thought there was something
like freedom of speech in this country.

482
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,970
You essay elicits sympathy
for the 9/11 hijackers,

483
00:35:13,046 --> 00:35:14,536
suggests you feel their cause was just.

484
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,139
That's not what I wrote.

485
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:18,684
I wrote that I understand
why they did what they did.

486
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:20,879
I didn't write that I support it.

487
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,718
Do you? Support their actions?

488
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,659
I understand their need to be heard.

489
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,822
I don't think they went
about it in the right way.

490
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:32,728
Agent Phadkar.

491
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,936
Do you have an interest in suicide?

492
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,478
Your diary suggests you do.

493
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,481
That's not...

494
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:56,116
Those are notes on a class paper
on why religions oppose suicide.

495
00:35:57,124 --> 00:35:58,682
And you're not opposed to it?

496
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:02,752
I wouldn't become a suicide bomber,
if that's what you mean.

497
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,262
But you condone suicide bombing

498
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,196
as a legitimate means
to make a statement?

499
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,631
That's what you wrote in your essay.

500
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:10,534
You're twisting my words.
That's not what I wrote.

501
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:14,005
Well, reads that way to me.

502
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:16,907
"Upon impact, their voices
were finally heard.

503
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:19,036
"You may not like what they had to say

504
00:36:19,112 --> 00:36:20,773
"or how they got
their message across,

505
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:24,374
"but we heard it.
For the first time, we heard it."

506
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:27,648
I was just saying that
they got our attention

507
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,951
and that maybe
we should understand

508
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,457
why they did what they did. That's all.

509
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,721
So if someone's pissed off at America,

510
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:37,263
they should hijack and fly planes
into our buildings.

511
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,991
That seems like
a reasonable thing to do.

512
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:43,162
Agent Phadkar, over here.

513
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:44,931
Take a look at this.

514
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:47,735
She has a World of Islam account.

515
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:50,936
She's been frequenting
some interesting chatrooms.

516
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:52,774
Global Jihad,

517
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:55,781
Jihad Talking Points.

518
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,283
I'm interested in all
Muslim points of view.

519
00:36:58,351 --> 00:37:00,342
It keeps me informed.

520
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,016
Taslima, your parents are
in the United States illegally.

521
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:08,584
My brother and sister were born here.

522
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:09,959
They're American citizens.

523
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,225
True.

524
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,028
But you and your parents are not.

525
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:17,366
When your brother and sister
reach the age of 21,

526
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:20,964
they're entitled to petition
for your parents to enter this country.

527
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:23,373
Until then, your family has no status.

528
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:27,240
Listen to me, Taslima.

529
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,714
Here's what I'm willing to do for you.

530
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:32,274
I'm not interested
in detaining your family.

531
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:35,788
But I'd like to talk to you further.

532
00:37:35,856 --> 00:37:38,222
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
has every right

533
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,486
to take your family into custody,

534
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,188
but if you leave with us now
and cooperate with us,

535
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,254
Immigration won't detain them.

536
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,129
They'll still have to resolve their status,

537
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,668
but nobody's looking to make
an issue of that right now.

538
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:51,966
You understand?

539
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:22,060
Mr. Max, welcome to my home.

540
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:25,002
- Thank you.
- You honor me with your presence tonight.

541
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:26,971
- Thank you.
- This is my wife.

542
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,564
Very nice to meet you. Welcome.

543
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,405
Thank you. You have a beautiful home.

544
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:31,910
Thank you.

545
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:33,969
Congratulations, sir, on your naturalization.

546
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:35,674
Thank you. Farid.

547
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:40,817
Come over here. Come and meet
an important gentleman.

548
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:43,287
- He's my youngest son. He's a lawyer.
- Ah.

549
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:45,381
- How are you?
- How do you do?

550
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,552
- It's a pleasure.
- Hi. How are you?

551
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:51,597
This is Max. He is the partner of Hamid.

552
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:54,361
You show him the respect,
or he will have you deported.

553
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:58,502
He can't deport me, Baba.
I've already been naturalized.

554
00:38:58,572 --> 00:39:00,506
You're the only person in this house
who can be deported.

555
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:03,065
Until Saturday.
Then he becomes one of us.

556
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:07,207
I'm gonna go put her down.
It was good to meet you.

557
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,679
- Thank you.
- Okay, come on.

558
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,718
Hey, Max, I'm so glad
you made it tonight.

559
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:16,380
I really appreciate it.

560
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:18,151
Get you a drink?

561
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:19,590
Yeah, Scotch rocks, please.

562
00:39:30,804 --> 00:39:33,534
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

563
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,573
Inside.

564
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:43,445
My sister should not
have come here tonight.

565
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:44,676
What's going on there?

566
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:47,015
She puts herself before the family.

567
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:50,022
She shouldn't expect
to be welcome around here.

568
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,320
Baba.

569
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:58,286
So, Max. Hamid speaks so highly of you.

570
00:39:58,365 --> 00:40:00,663
He looks up to you.

571
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:03,532
Never understood why he joined the
immigration Gestapo.

572
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:04,968
I think that deep down inside

573
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:07,233
he doesn't feel like he belongs.

574
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:09,036
I mean, what better way
to prove you're red, white, and blue

575
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:12,101
than by throwing out those
who also don't belong?

576
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:13,941
You're a lawyer, huh?

577
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:16,244
I'm a junior partner
at Berkhof, Mazolo, and Klein.

578
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:18,216
Specialize in personal injury.

579
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:19,479
We have 35 lawyers under us.

580
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:21,782
You're an ambulance chaser.

581
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:24,119
I don't chase anyone.

582
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,680
I turn clients away.

583
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:29,092
Excuse me.

584
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:40,305
You have another one of those?

585
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:49,212
Max Brogan. I work with Hamid.

586
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:50,909
I know who you are.

587
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,484
Thank you.

588
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,460
What does that say on your bracelet?

589
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:05,722
"Little angel."

590
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,966
My father gave it to me when I was 12.

591
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:18,667
You realize that they're staring at us.

592
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:22,181
Very disapproving looks you're getting
for consorting with the outcast.

593
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:25,149
I'll risk it.

594
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:31,988
I've never been invited
to a shunning before.

595
00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:34,492
What is this? Something you guys
brought over with you?

596
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:36,222
I didn't bring it.

597
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:38,423
I was born here.

598
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:41,626
I'm the only one in this family
who's an actual American.

599
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:46,068
Probably decided to naturalize.

600
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,505
Makes 'em every bit as American as you.

601
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:54,277
Let me tell you about my father.

602
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:57,475
The great American-to-be.

603
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,417
He was always critical of the Shah.

604
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:01,977
But after the revolution,

605
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:05,718
one of his business rivals spread rumors
that he was anti-Khomeini.

606
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:09,990
And the whole family
had to flee across the border to Turkey.

607
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:13,624
He spent most of his savings
trying to get everybody over here.

608
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:20,232
But see, he doesn't pine
for the days of the Shah.

609
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:22,900
And I think he'd be perfectly content

610
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:27,413
in that fucked-up Islamic shithole
that that country is today.

611
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,074
Which is why he resents
every day he spends here.

612
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,345
Well, he could go back.

613
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,284
He's too old to start over.

614
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:36,788
So what's your story?

615
00:42:36,856 --> 00:42:38,323
Any family?

616
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:42,887
I have a daughter.

617
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:45,430
I'm not with her mother anymore.

618
00:42:45,498 --> 00:42:47,557
How old is she?

619
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:48,896
26.

620
00:42:48,968 --> 00:42:51,869
Uh... no.

621
00:42:51,938 --> 00:42:53,906
27.

622
00:42:53,973 --> 00:42:57,465
You better get that straight,
or you might piss her off.

623
00:42:57,544 --> 00:42:59,535
I think I did that already.

624
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:04,805
Max, my father's asking for you.

625
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:07,644
It was nice meeting you, Max.

626
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,620
You, too.

627
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:11,782
I'm out of here.

628
00:43:11,858 --> 00:43:14,190
Got a date.

629
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,524
Got a real hot date, Max.

630
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:21,226
Ignore her. She's crazy.

631
00:43:22,836 --> 00:43:24,531
I'm tired, Hamid.

632
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:26,504
I'm gonna go home.

633
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:29,699
Max.

634
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:31,937
My father.

635
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:35,777
See you tomorrow.

636
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:38,010
Tell your family thanks for me, okay?

637
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,856
You know what she said

638
00:43:45,925 --> 00:43:47,893
to the Yoruban interpreter today?

639
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,521
"Are you my mommy?"

640
00:43:50,597 --> 00:43:51,962
The interpreter says

641
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:54,625
she's losing her ability
to speak the language.

642
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:57,363
It's 23 months
that she's been in there.

643
00:43:57,437 --> 00:44:00,167
23 fucking months.

644
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,074
I feel gutted every time I go.

645
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,806
Ah, it's a shitty situation.

646
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,407
But you can't keep
beating yourself up over it.

647
00:44:12,752 --> 00:44:15,653
I was thinking...

648
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:17,314
we could maybe adopt her.

649
00:44:18,658 --> 00:44:19,818
D.

650
00:44:19,893 --> 00:44:22,384
I'm serious.

651
00:44:22,462 --> 00:44:25,090
Her mother's dying of AIDS in a hospice.

652
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:27,497
Leike's dad
back in Nigeria denies paternity

653
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,262
and won't accept custody of her.

654
00:44:29,335 --> 00:44:31,132
We're working on it. One of our own.

655
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:34,503
And we can keep working on it.

656
00:44:34,574 --> 00:44:36,667
I've thought about this a lot.

657
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:39,439
And it feels right.

658
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:42,538
It feels like it's meant to be.

659
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:45,015
You can't just lay this
on me and expect me to...

660
00:44:47,687 --> 00:44:48,984
God.

661
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:00,733
Will you think about it?

662
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,995
It's important to me.

663
00:45:05,104 --> 00:45:06,867
Please.

664
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,500
Yeah, I'll think about it.

665
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:11,203
Thank you.

666
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:33,697
- I can't do this.
- Oh.

667
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:37,463
I haven't even spoken Hebrew
since my bar mitzvah, you know?

668
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:38,595
I didn't even know it then.

669
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:39,660
You know what?

670
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:41,536
You guys, you're all the same.

671
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,542
All of you. You're all reform at best.

672
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,272
Most of you haven't gone to Shul
since your bar mitzvahs.

673
00:45:46,346 --> 00:45:48,610
But first thing you do when you come
over here is play the Jew card.

674
00:45:48,681 --> 00:45:50,478
Haven't you got any shame?

675
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,347
Ouch. That's pretty...

676
00:45:52,418 --> 00:45:54,682
Oh. Hello?

677
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:57,416
Hey, Mum. Hey, hey, hey.
How are you doing?

678
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,048
Yeah, did you get my message?

679
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:01,457
Uh-huh. Yeah.

680
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:03,518
Well, what about the rabbi?

681
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:07,225
No, I need you to
get him to write a letter

682
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,632
like on the Temple's letterhead

683
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:13,866
saying, uh, that I attend services regularly.

684
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,999
Uh, I was bar mitzvahed by him.

685
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:18,475
And that I'm, you know,

686
00:46:18,544 --> 00:46:22,139
I'm strongly committed
to the Jewish faith.

687
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:23,409
All right.

688
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:24,973
Well, listen,
I'm kind of busy right now.

689
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:26,450
But I'll get back to you, though.

690
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:27,508
And will you do that for me?

691
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:28,884
Yeah, you promise? Okay.

692
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:30,923
Listen, M... Yeah.

693
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,014
I'll speak to you soon.

694
00:46:32,091 --> 00:46:33,115
All right. I love you, too.

695
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:36,184
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye.

696
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:39,288
Ahh...

697
00:46:39,365 --> 00:46:42,664
Iook, l... I got to be home by 10, yeah?

698
00:46:42,735 --> 00:46:44,726
So, um...

699
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:46,704
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

700
00:46:46,773 --> 00:46:48,502
- With everything.
- Thank you.

701
00:46:48,574 --> 00:46:51,338
Oh, what about if I just
kind of twiddled these...

702
00:46:51,411 --> 00:46:52,503
these side bits here?

703
00:46:52,578 --> 00:46:53,670
You think I'd get away with that?

704
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:56,408
If I just stick these out like that?

705
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:00,346
I can go all night with my wife,

706
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,513
but I'm like a teenager with you.

707
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:11,797
Doesn't sound like you've gone all night
with her in a long while.

708
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:15,595
It used to be hot between us.

709
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:20,901
One day, you're just
not into it anymore.

710
00:47:20,973 --> 00:47:23,567
It becomes like an effort.

711
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:26,111
Easier to jerk yourself off in the shower

712
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:27,908
than to rub her back for half an hour.

713
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,971
Bloody sad.

714
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:32,415
Yeah, it is.

715
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:37,088
Maybe I'll come watch you
on the set next week.

716
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:42,394
That's not part of the deal.

717
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:43,588
It's not supposed to be.

718
00:47:43,663 --> 00:47:45,790
I just thought I'd stop by and...

719
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:48,959
Um, I got to go.

720
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:53,995
I've got a meeting with an agent.

721
00:47:54,073 --> 00:47:56,234
If she signs me, it's major.

722
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:00,603
I'll call you tomorrow.

723
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,928
Denise Frankel.

724
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:24,827
- Hello.
- Hello.

725
00:49:24,897 --> 00:49:26,660
Please, thank you
for helping my daughter.

726
00:49:26,732 --> 00:49:29,929
Clearly, this is not
about her immigration status.

727
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:31,697
But they're using her lack of status

728
00:49:31,771 --> 00:49:34,205
to get around normal criminal
and juvenile proceedings.

729
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,570
My wife wants to know
when we can see her.

730
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:40,111
I'm working on that.

731
00:49:42,515 --> 00:49:46,212
I'm pushing for a one-on-one
with the FBI task force officer tomorrow.

732
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:52,552
Right now, your entire family
is at risk for removal.

733
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:55,594
I recommend you do not
go back to your apartment.

734
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:58,425
Do you have any friends or family
with whom you can stay?

735
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,908
Rosa.

736
00:50:12,979 --> 00:50:15,379
Come on, Rosa.

737
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:17,245
Rosa. Rosa.

738
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:20,285
Can't find you, Rosa.

739
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:26,652
And another one bites the dust.

740
00:50:26,726 --> 00:50:27,920
We do our best.

741
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:31,395
I'm sure you do, sir.

742
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:32,931
Yes.

743
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:34,159
Yes, this is him.

744
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:38,097
Who?

745
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,592
Hey, Hamid.

746
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:05,995
Hamid? Hey, Hamid.

747
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:07,896
Hey!

748
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:08,956
What's up?

749
00:51:09,035 --> 00:51:11,469
I, uh... It's my sister.

750
00:51:11,537 --> 00:51:12,834
What's the matter?

751
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:23,244
Maybe you can help me.

752
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:36,695
Do you recognize him?

753
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:40,425
Agent Baraheri?

754
00:51:45,871 --> 00:51:47,634
It's her boss,

755
00:51:47,707 --> 00:51:50,835
from the print shop where she works.

756
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:53,640
We've got security video
from the motel

757
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:55,078
of an unidentified male perp

758
00:51:55,147 --> 00:51:56,637
in a hooded sweatshirt
leaving the scene.

759
00:51:56,716 --> 00:51:59,685
Time of death somewhere
between 11 and midnight.

760
00:52:03,189 --> 00:52:05,680
Did you know that your sister
was having relations

761
00:52:05,758 --> 00:52:08,352
with Mr. Bedraz,

762
00:52:08,427 --> 00:52:11,362
who was married with two young kids?

763
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:15,867
I never talked to her

764
00:52:15,935 --> 00:52:17,994
about the details of her private life, no.

765
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,332
Do you know of anyone

766
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:21,896
who may have had it in for her?

767
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:23,999
Jealous of her, perhaps?

768
00:52:24,076 --> 00:52:28,877
Like I said, I didn't get into her life.

769
00:52:28,948 --> 00:52:31,280
There's something else.

770
00:52:33,386 --> 00:52:35,980
I found these while going through
Mr. Bedraz' jacket

771
00:52:36,055 --> 00:52:37,249
looking for identification.

772
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:39,086
They come in sets of threes.

773
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:41,251
Green card, driver's license, social.

774
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:43,795
All counterfeit.

775
00:52:43,863 --> 00:52:45,387
We found more of this stuff
at his apartment

776
00:52:45,464 --> 00:52:47,227
earlier this afternoon.

777
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:48,766
As best we can figure,

778
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:51,132
he was cranking them out
after hours at the store.

779
00:52:51,203 --> 00:52:53,000
We've referred that end of it

780
00:52:53,072 --> 00:52:55,506
to your documented benefit
for our task force.

781
00:52:55,574 --> 00:52:57,804
Think it might be Mexican mafia,

782
00:52:57,877 --> 00:53:00,778
upset about him cutting into their action?

783
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:04,942
We're looking at a number
of possibilities right now.

784
00:53:05,017 --> 00:53:07,713
When would be a good time to interview

785
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:11,484
your other family members,
Agent Baraheri?

786
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:14,185
Can I just...

787
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,253
I'd like to spend a moment
with my sister alone, please.

788
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:21,026
Of course.

789
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,534
Um...

790
00:53:23,602 --> 00:53:25,160
I'm sorry for your loss.

791
00:53:40,186 --> 00:53:42,211
I hate the fucking smell of that place.

792
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:48,957
I know you're judging me, Max.

793
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:52,492
What are you talking about?

794
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:54,192
My sister.

795
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:56,996
What you witnessed last night.

796
00:53:57,069 --> 00:53:58,798
Now I'm mourning her.

797
00:53:58,871 --> 00:54:00,634
You doubt the veracity of my heart.

798
00:54:00,706 --> 00:54:03,004
I'm just sitting here
feeling your pain, my friend.

799
00:54:03,075 --> 00:54:06,533
Feeling for your entire family.

800
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:08,341
It's a sad, terrible thing, your loss.

801
00:54:08,414 --> 00:54:13,044
No way do I doubt
your love for your sister.

802
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,416
No way.

803
00:54:20,926 --> 00:54:23,895
Well, if you need someone
to talk it through with...

804
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:25,487
Thank you.

805
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,750
Officially, she's being held

806
00:54:46,819 --> 00:54:49,617
for an unlawful presence
in the United States.

807
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:52,384
Unofficially... and I'll never repeat this
outside this room...

808
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:54,756
she's being detained
for presenting an imminent threat

809
00:54:54,827 --> 00:54:56,818
to the security of the United States,

810
00:54:56,896 --> 00:54:59,228
based upon evidence
that she planned to be a suicide bomber.

811
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:02,900
And what evidence would that be?

812
00:55:02,968 --> 00:55:05,436
Don't play coy with me, counselor.

813
00:55:05,504 --> 00:55:07,335
The signs are all there.

814
00:55:07,406 --> 00:55:09,340
We're talking about
a devout Muslim young woman

815
00:55:09,408 --> 00:55:11,706
who at 15 years of age
walks around veiled.

816
00:55:11,777 --> 00:55:14,769
Who engages in internet talk
focused on the duty of Jihad.

817
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:16,815
And writes openly about suicide.

818
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:19,112
Did you take a look at her bedroom?

819
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:21,119
How austere it was?

820
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:23,212
This isn't the life of a normal teenager.

821
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:24,620
Everything about her is a red flag.

822
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,523
Only when viewed through
the distorted looking glass

823
00:55:27,593 --> 00:55:29,356
of your own paranoias.

824
00:55:29,428 --> 00:55:30,918
I could joust with you all day,

825
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:33,464
but here's the reality of our situation.

826
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:36,262
She's illegal. She's removable.

827
00:55:36,335 --> 00:55:39,361
And I intend to have Immigration
and Customs Enforcement remove her

828
00:55:39,438 --> 00:55:40,735
to ensure the safety
of the American people.

829
00:55:40,806 --> 00:55:42,637
Just like that?

830
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:45,336
You would uproot
a 15-year-old American teenager

831
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:48,209
who came to this country
when she was 3 years old?

832
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,269
Who doesn't speak Bangla,

833
00:55:49,348 --> 00:55:51,475
at least not with any fluency.

834
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:54,075
And based on the most
circumstantial of evidence,

835
00:55:54,153 --> 00:55:56,713
you would exile her
to a Third World garbage dump

836
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:59,087
that to her might as well be
another planet?

837
00:55:59,158 --> 00:56:02,150
That's exactly what
I'm going to do, counselor.

838
00:56:03,896 --> 00:56:05,591
What about the rest of the family?

839
00:56:05,664 --> 00:56:07,598
The two younger siblings
are American citizens.

840
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:09,293
Yes, they're American citizens,

841
00:56:09,368 --> 00:56:11,199
and they're shit out of luck.

842
00:56:14,406 --> 00:56:17,136
Unless...

843
00:56:39,365 --> 00:56:41,265
<i>## </i>

844
00:56:43,802 --> 00:56:47,363
Have you got company?

845
00:56:47,439 --> 00:56:49,031
No.

846
00:56:49,108 --> 00:56:51,372
Are you looking for some?

847
00:57:02,054 --> 00:57:04,386
I'm not being funny, all right, Claire?

848
00:57:04,456 --> 00:57:07,448
But I just want to know
why some INS guy

849
00:57:07,526 --> 00:57:09,426
would commit fraud for you.

850
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:10,985
It's not like you're famous enough

851
00:57:11,063 --> 00:57:12,792
- to get that kind of visa.
- All right.

852
00:57:12,865 --> 00:57:17,097
No, I'm only saying.
I only know 'cause I tried.

853
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:19,967
Well, they don't call it the INS anymore.

854
00:57:23,475 --> 00:57:25,409
Gavin?

855
00:57:25,477 --> 00:57:27,240
Come on.

856
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:30,305
I always thought I'd have to marry
an American guy.

857
00:57:30,382 --> 00:57:33,146
That's why I didn't see
any point in us, you know?

858
00:57:33,218 --> 00:57:35,550
But I don't have to do that now.

859
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:37,111
I don't have to marry an American guy.

860
00:57:37,189 --> 00:57:38,622
I can be with the guy that I'm into.

861
00:57:40,926 --> 00:57:44,259
This changes everything for us.

862
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,457
You know?

863
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:54,005
I just, uh...

864
00:57:56,742 --> 00:57:59,575
I just want to know
why he's taking all that risk for you.

865
00:57:59,645 --> 00:58:01,510
- You know?
- Oh.

866
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:06,483
Are you paying him?

867
00:58:06,552 --> 00:58:08,247
Where'd you even get the case worker?

868
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,685
Oh, baby.

869
00:58:09,755 --> 00:58:11,746
No.

870
00:58:11,824 --> 00:58:15,783
It... Don't go there, baby.

871
00:58:15,861 --> 00:58:17,488
Oh, come on, Claire.

872
00:58:17,563 --> 00:58:19,963
How are you paying him?

873
00:58:20,032 --> 00:58:20,964
Well... Come back.

874
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:23,092
No. How are you paying him, Claire?

875
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:26,831
How are you paying him?

876
00:58:33,812 --> 00:58:36,076
No. No.

877
00:58:36,148 --> 00:58:38,048
You are fucking kidding me.

878
00:58:38,117 --> 00:58:41,143
You are fucking kidding me.

879
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,984
I am such a fucking idiot.

880
00:58:44,056 --> 00:58:46,081
You are fuck... Are you serious?

881
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:51,052
Baby, I want to be with you, baby.

882
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,392
You know I want to be with you.

883
00:58:52,464 --> 00:58:53,829
Were you with him today?

884
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:55,662
- Please don't do this.
- Were you with him today?

885
00:58:55,734 --> 00:58:57,599
- Baby, please don't do this.
- Just tell me. Were you with him today?

886
00:58:57,669 --> 00:59:00,832
Was he inside of you today?
Were you with him today?

887
00:59:00,906 --> 00:59:04,034
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck. How many times?

888
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:06,441
How many times, Claire?

889
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:07,604
I just want to know.

890
00:59:08,203 --> 00:59:09,636
I just want to know
how fucked you have to get

891
00:59:09,705 --> 00:59:11,730
to get a fucking green card!

892
00:59:11,807 --> 00:59:13,434
Fuck!

893
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:25,780
Um...

894
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:34,222
as often as he wants.

895
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:39,594
It's only for two months,

896
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:42,728
and then I never have to see him again.

897
00:59:42,805 --> 00:59:44,796
And I never have to worry

898
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:48,070
about being deported or being narced on.

899
00:59:48,143 --> 00:59:50,668
I can just...

900
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:22,063
Hey!

901
01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:25,201
Easy. Easy.

902
01:01:25,274 --> 01:01:27,174
Immigration!

903
01:01:27,242 --> 01:01:29,870
Mireya?

904
01:01:29,945 --> 01:01:31,606
- Hey, hold her!
- Mireya?

905
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:40,315
<i>Lo siento. Lo siento.</i>

906
01:01:40,389 --> 01:01:42,016
Thanks.

907
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,927
I'm sorry. You have very few options,

908
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:54,594
none of them favorable
to your situation.

909
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:58,401
You may request
voluntary departure as an entire family

910
01:01:58,474 --> 01:02:00,704
and leave the United States
immediately.

911
01:02:00,776 --> 01:02:03,210
Or you may choose to fight the matter,

912
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:06,042
which inevitably would
lead to deportation.

913
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:11,147
There is a third option.

914
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,780
And as painful as it is,

915
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:15,847
I am required to present it to you.

916
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,756
One of you could choose
voluntary departure

917
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:22,922
and leave with Taslima,

918
01:02:22,998 --> 01:02:25,228
and one of you could remain in the U.S.

919
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,325
with Jahanara and Abul.

920
01:02:27,402 --> 01:02:29,734
How is that possible?

921
01:02:29,805 --> 01:02:32,501
Special Agent Phadkar has intimated to me

922
01:02:32,574 --> 01:02:34,633
that if we were to choose
that course of action,

923
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,941
Immigration would not seek out
the remaining parent,

924
01:02:38,013 --> 01:02:40,072
provided they kept a low profile.

925
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:43,641
There is something else
you should understand.

926
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,812
Whichever of you remains,

927
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:47,219
if you choose that,

928
01:02:47,289 --> 01:02:50,588
if you try to see Taslima
before she leaves,

929
01:02:50,659 --> 01:02:52,593
you would be taking a really big risk.

930
01:02:52,661 --> 01:02:55,824
In all likelihood, she will be escorted
by Immigration agents

931
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:57,661
all the way to her departure gate.

932
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,844
All right, girls.
Come on! Lights out.

933
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,851
- Under the covers.
- Lights out in two minutes.

934
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:19,285
<i>Vamanos, María.</i>

935
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,523
You look like you need a friend.

936
01:03:29,464 --> 01:03:32,399
Are you waiting for your mommy
to come get you, too?

937
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:37,235
Yeah.

938
01:03:37,306 --> 01:03:38,568
Yeah, I am.

939
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:39,766
When is she coming?

940
01:03:42,244 --> 01:03:43,802
Any day now.

941
01:03:43,879 --> 01:03:46,780
Do you know any good stories?

942
01:03:46,849 --> 01:03:51,081
I know a lot of good stories.

943
01:03:51,153 --> 01:03:52,620
All right, girls. Lights out!

944
01:03:52,688 --> 01:03:55,953
Come here,
and I'll tell you all the best ones.

945
01:03:56,024 --> 01:03:57,321
Time for bed!

946
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,456
And how could you disbelieve

947
01:04:05,534 --> 01:04:08,230
while to you were being recited
the verses of Allah.

948
01:04:48,777 --> 01:04:50,335
<i>Gracias.</i>

949
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,456
Hey, Chin.

950
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,293
- Good morning.
- Black suit.

951
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:12,526
This is clean and press.
You gotta get the smell out of it.

952
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,502
- Hospital, hmm?
- Yeah.

953
01:05:24,513 --> 01:05:26,174
Thank you.

954
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:30,777
Uh, better not forget this.

955
01:05:35,424 --> 01:05:36,755
Very nice.

956
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,599
Hey, can we do this now or what, huh?

957
01:05:57,479 --> 01:05:58,741
I'm leaving her.

958
01:05:58,814 --> 01:06:01,009
Okay.

959
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,677
We won't have to skulk around anymore.

960
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:05,151
Skulking's fine with me.

961
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,120
I'm not exactly proud
of this arrangement.

962
01:06:07,189 --> 01:06:08,554
I don't want an arrangement.

963
01:06:08,623 --> 01:06:10,818
- Cole...
- Just listen to me.

964
01:06:10,892 --> 01:06:13,292
I know this started in a fucked-up place.

965
01:06:13,362 --> 01:06:15,922
And that you are not here
on your own volition.

966
01:06:15,998 --> 01:06:18,558
And that there's a...

967
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:25,437
there's a good chance
I probably make your skin crawl.

968
01:06:25,507 --> 01:06:28,738
I just want us to start over again.

969
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,437
I wouldn't say who I was.

970
01:06:30,512 --> 01:06:32,571
I wouldn't put any kind of scare in you.

971
01:06:32,647 --> 01:06:35,081
Just ask you out for a cup of coffee.

972
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,549
I'm not looking to renegotiate.

973
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:37,550
You're not hearing me.

974
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:38,881
No.

975
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:41,548
You're not hearing me.

976
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:45,081
This is what you need
to understand, okay?

977
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,391
When I come into
one of these fleabag rooms,

978
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:51,125
I switch off.

979
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,999
You might as well be making it
with a rubber fuck doll,

980
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:58,369
because she'd be giving you more emotion
than you'd ever get from me.

981
01:07:00,575 --> 01:07:02,440
When I get home,

982
01:07:02,511 --> 01:07:04,706
I'm an hour in the shower,

983
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,907
getting clean of you.

984
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:08,210
That is the extent of it.

985
01:07:08,283 --> 01:07:13,812
That is as real
as it is ever going to get between us.

986
01:07:13,889 --> 01:07:16,119
Is that clear enough...

987
01:07:16,191 --> 01:07:17,590
for you?

988
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:22,186
Hmm?

989
01:07:26,768 --> 01:07:29,999
So you want to do this now or what?

990
01:07:49,825 --> 01:07:51,793
You won't hear from me again.

991
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:56,195
And your green card will be in the mail.

992
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,226
Good luck, Claire.

993
01:09:26,288 --> 01:09:27,983
Hamid.

994
01:09:28,056 --> 01:09:29,853
How are you doing?

995
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:33,719
Hmm.

996
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:37,196
Hey, listen,

997
01:09:37,265 --> 01:09:40,962
you left your jacket in the car
on the way back from the morgue.

998
01:09:41,036 --> 01:09:43,095
You were complaining
about the smell,

999
01:09:43,171 --> 01:09:44,934
so I took it to the dry cleaners.

1000
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:48,305
You can pick it up any time.

1001
01:09:48,376 --> 01:09:52,506
That wasn't necessary, but thanks.

1002
01:09:55,217 --> 01:09:58,709
This fell out of the pocket
at the cleaners.

1003
01:10:01,623 --> 01:10:06,151
I was wondering why it wasn't in
her personal effects envelope.

1004
01:10:06,228 --> 01:10:10,426
She broke it a few days ago.

1005
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:12,398
I said I'd get it fixed.

1006
01:10:12,467 --> 01:10:15,402
Repaired.

1007
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:19,702
I got a friend
with a shop on Western, and...

1008
01:10:22,944 --> 01:10:26,243
Thanks for coming, Max.

1009
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:54,265
Gavin Kossef?

1010
01:10:55,777 --> 01:10:57,039
Gavin Kossef!

1011
01:10:57,112 --> 01:10:59,080
Uh, yeah.

1012
01:10:59,147 --> 01:11:01,411
I have to be honest
with you, Mr. Kossef.

1013
01:11:01,483 --> 01:11:04,475
I don't see much experience here
as a religious worker.

1014
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,247
You're not an ordained rabbi, are you?

1015
01:11:06,321 --> 01:11:08,084
Uh, no, no, I'm not.

1016
01:11:08,156 --> 01:11:11,353
But I've spent many years
devoted to my faith.

1017
01:11:11,426 --> 01:11:13,519
Uh, I grew up in a religious family,

1018
01:11:13,595 --> 01:11:14,994
I attended services regularly.

1019
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:17,793
I was bar mitzvahed.

1020
01:11:17,866 --> 01:11:19,527
I've taken Jewish leadership courses...

1021
01:11:19,601 --> 01:11:21,569
I'm still not sure that qualifies you.

1022
01:11:21,636 --> 01:11:23,695
You know, I honor my religion daily.

1023
01:11:23,772 --> 01:11:26,400
You know, in the Jewish
school where I teach,

1024
01:11:26,474 --> 01:11:29,466
I lead the class in prayers.

1025
01:11:29,544 --> 01:11:30,704
We discuss Bible stories.

1026
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:33,612
And you've been working
at this school illegally, right?

1027
01:11:33,682 --> 01:11:35,843
Yes, l... I have.

1028
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,078
Yeah. But I've admitted to that.

1029
01:11:38,153 --> 01:11:39,745
You can read the language?

1030
01:11:39,821 --> 01:11:42,722
- Hebrew, right?
- Yes.

1031
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:43,883
And what about the prayers?

1032
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:46,051
You can, uh... You can recite

1033
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:47,651
the important prayers of your faith?

1034
01:11:47,729 --> 01:11:48,753
You can do that, right?

1035
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:50,263
Uh, yes. Yes.

1036
01:11:50,332 --> 01:11:53,733
I can do the prayer for wine,

1037
01:11:53,802 --> 01:11:55,531
um, the prayer for bread...

1038
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:57,969
Excuse me just a moment.

1039
01:12:06,214 --> 01:12:08,648
Shit.

1040
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:12,811
Fuck.

1041
01:12:16,157 --> 01:12:19,126
Come in.
Close the door right behind you.

1042
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:26,490
Mr. Kossef, this is Rabbi Yoffie.

1043
01:12:26,568 --> 01:12:28,502
Uh, Rabbi.

1044
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,733
Ordinarily, I'd file
a request for evidence.

1045
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:40,474
But something tells me this approach
will prove more expedient.

1046
01:12:40,548 --> 01:12:43,016
I'd like Mr. Kossef to recite a prayer

1047
01:12:43,084 --> 01:12:45,109
to substantiate his knowledge of
the Jewish teachings

1048
01:12:45,186 --> 01:12:46,676
above that of a layman's.

1049
01:12:46,755 --> 01:12:49,383
If you could suggest something
and authenticate his response,

1050
01:12:49,457 --> 01:12:51,357
I'd greatly appreciate it, Rabbi.

1051
01:12:53,294 --> 01:12:57,424
You may recite
the Mourner's Kaddish, no?

1052
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:59,524
The Mourner's Kaddish?

1053
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,463
<i>Nu?</i>

1054
01:13:05,373 --> 01:13:07,739
Uh, yes. Yeah.

1055
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:13,009
Uh...

1056
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:18,018
It's a tradition that you cover your head.

1057
01:13:18,086 --> 01:13:22,284
If you just put your hands
on your head like that.

1058
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:23,551
Right?

1059
01:13:24,926 --> 01:13:29,556
- Um... like that.
- Yeah.

1060
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:08,692
Amen.

1061
01:14:21,716 --> 01:14:24,742
Very nice.

1062
01:14:24,819 --> 01:14:26,582
Very moving.

1063
01:14:30,692 --> 01:14:33,490
You should sing
in my services sometimes.

1064
01:14:33,561 --> 01:14:36,189
Oh, l... I would love to.

1065
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:38,198
Thank you very much, Rabbi.

1066
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:40,131
We'll be with you shortly.

1067
01:14:40,201 --> 01:14:41,259
Thank you.

1068
01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:47,399
Well, can't argue with that.

1069
01:14:49,711 --> 01:14:51,338
Rabbi?

1070
01:14:54,415 --> 01:14:56,679
I wasn't kidding about the voice.

1071
01:14:56,751 --> 01:14:58,912
I expect you tomorrow morning,

1072
01:14:58,987 --> 01:15:00,716
Temple Beth Shalom.

1073
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:03,814
About the rest, we can teach you.

1074
01:15:33,855 --> 01:15:38,656
I don't want to leave Jah and Abul.

1075
01:15:38,726 --> 01:15:40,694
When will I ever see them again?

1076
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:46,026
Or Papa?

1077
01:15:49,771 --> 01:15:52,865
He wants to be able
to say goodbye to you,

1078
01:15:52,941 --> 01:15:55,637
but what if he was to come here today?

1079
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:58,372
They would arrest him
and deport him as well.

1080
01:15:58,446 --> 01:16:02,507
And then Jah and Abul
will have to leave as well.

1081
01:16:02,584 --> 01:16:04,176
I don't care!

1082
01:16:04,252 --> 01:16:07,483
Why can't we all go?

1083
01:16:07,555 --> 01:16:08,817
Why do they get to stay?

1084
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:12,917
Because they were born here.

1085
01:16:12,994 --> 01:16:15,019
And if they stay and finish school,

1086
01:16:15,096 --> 01:16:18,031
they have more opportunities.

1087
01:16:18,099 --> 01:16:20,693
And I don't

1088
01:16:20,768 --> 01:16:23,635
because my life is shit now.

1089
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:26,702
I'm sorry. We're out of time.

1090
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:42,881
Mommy!

1091
01:16:42,957 --> 01:16:44,254
Mommy, please!

1092
01:16:44,325 --> 01:16:45,849
Please!

1093
01:16:45,927 --> 01:16:48,987
Please don't leave me, Mommy!

1094
01:17:27,902 --> 01:17:29,096
Come, my sweets.

1095
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:32,003
Say goodbye to your sister.

1096
01:17:34,642 --> 01:17:37,338
You won't be seeing her for a long time.

1097
01:17:37,412 --> 01:17:41,849
Please, I need the room for the next visit.

1098
01:18:31,699 --> 01:18:34,668
Did Homicide see these tapes?

1099
01:18:34,736 --> 01:18:36,203
No. They figured it was gang-related,

1100
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:38,101
so they only looked at
the night of the murder.

1101
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,800
Slow down. Slow down.
That's them.

1102
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:45,568
Stop.

1103
01:18:47,582 --> 01:18:48,571
That's the girl.

1104
01:18:51,385 --> 01:18:54,183
Back up a little bit.

1105
01:18:54,255 --> 01:18:56,314
This car that just pulled in here.

1106
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:57,982
Move in on there.

1107
01:19:04,732 --> 01:19:05,892
Can't make anybody.

1108
01:19:07,969 --> 01:19:09,596
Let's put another tape in.

1109
01:19:13,908 --> 01:19:16,035
Roll on down.

1110
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,210
Slow it up. That's them.

1111
01:19:21,282 --> 01:19:22,510
Stop.

1112
01:19:24,418 --> 01:19:25,646
Well, I'll be damned.

1113
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,620
There he is again.

1114
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:31,590
- Can you go in on the license plate?
- Sure.

1115
01:19:37,632 --> 01:19:41,534
2SAM564

1116
01:19:43,938 --> 01:19:45,337
Let's go to the next day.

1117
01:19:47,475 --> 01:19:48,942
There they are, coming out.

1118
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:55,113
Back up a little bit.

1119
01:19:56,717 --> 01:19:57,775
Go in on it.

1120
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:03,220
Same car.

1121
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:05,555
It's the same goddamn car.

1122
01:20:06,994 --> 01:20:08,359
Let me run that.

1123
01:20:20,408 --> 01:20:22,035
Another, please.

1124
01:20:34,822 --> 01:20:36,153
Another, please.

1125
01:20:36,224 --> 01:20:37,213
Last call, pal.

1126
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:50,023
Hey, Yong. You ready to
pop your cherry, bitch?

1127
01:21:50,097 --> 01:21:52,759
Fuckin' balls, man! Come on!

1128
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,266
Come on, you fuckin' pussy!

1129
01:22:00,308 --> 01:22:02,333
Get your fuckin' hands up!

1130
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,908
Move, motherfucker! You, too, bitch!

1131
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:10,245
Move it! Come on!

1132
01:22:10,318 --> 01:22:12,149
Stand the fuck down, you fucking cunt!

1133
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:13,846
Open the fucking door!

1134
01:22:13,921 --> 01:22:15,388
Don't you fucking dick me, old man!

1135
01:22:15,456 --> 01:22:17,447
Open the fucking door now!

1136
01:22:17,525 --> 01:22:19,493
Open the fucking door!

1137
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,152
You making big mistake.

1138
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:23,389
You have no idea
who money belongs to.

1139
01:22:23,464 --> 01:22:25,796
If I give to you, I die anyway.

1140
01:22:25,866 --> 01:22:29,495
Get the fuck back up, motherfucker!

1141
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,401
Get the fuck back up!

1142
01:22:36,644 --> 01:22:37,906
Shut up!

1143
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:38,911
What the fuck?

1144
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,379
What'd you go and do that for?

1145
01:22:40,448 --> 01:22:42,348
We weren't supposed to
hurt anyone, Seung!

1146
01:22:44,885 --> 01:22:46,785
That's it! Search him! Find the key!

1147
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:52,089
Move, bitch! Shut the fuck up!

1148
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:54,389
Shut the fuck up!

1149
01:22:54,462 --> 01:22:56,760
Get the fuck up!

1150
01:22:59,734 --> 01:23:02,032
Yeah, blow her fucking head
off if she tries anything! Let's go!

1151
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,832
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1152
01:23:03,904 --> 01:23:06,532
- Where's the key?
- Right, which fucking key?

1153
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,575
- Which key? Which key?
- I don't know!

1154
01:23:08,642 --> 01:23:12,840
Which fucking key, bitch?

1155
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,417
Fuck it. We're all in...

1156
01:23:42,576 --> 01:23:45,101
Put it down, man. I'll do it. I swear!

1157
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:47,044
You'll do her?

1158
01:23:47,114 --> 01:23:49,742
Where the fuck did you
learn to talk like that, huh?

1159
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:52,377
You get that on some American cop show
while you're growing up in Seoul?

1160
01:23:52,453 --> 01:23:55,251
I'm not from fucking Seoul.
I'm from.

1161
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:59,281
Hey. How old were you when you came over?
You still got an accent.

1162
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,625
- I'm gonna say maybe 11, 12 years old.
- I don't give a shit!

1163
01:24:02,696 --> 01:24:05,290
I'm gonna blow this bag's
head off if you don't put down your gun!

1164
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:08,199
Uh-huh. You still on the green card?

1165
01:24:08,269 --> 01:24:10,669
I'm American citizen, raghead!

1166
01:24:10,738 --> 01:24:12,467
My whole family just got naturalized!

1167
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,565
We're doing all
ceremony shit tomorrow!

1168
01:24:14,642 --> 01:24:16,234
Oh, tomorrow?

1169
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:19,245
Hey. You haven't taken your oath yet.

1170
01:24:19,313 --> 01:24:20,678
That means you're not a citizen.

1171
01:24:20,748 --> 01:24:22,978
Not until you take the oath.

1172
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:27,749
And I don't see how the fuck
that's gonna happen now, you know?

1173
01:24:27,822 --> 01:24:31,724
You're either gonna die here,
or you're going away for murder.

1174
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:33,817
You have done your parents proud.

1175
01:24:33,894 --> 01:24:36,021
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

1176
01:24:36,097 --> 01:24:37,962
They told me no one get hurt.

1177
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:39,624
I didn't kill anyone!

1178
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:40,962
What am I supposed to do?

1179
01:24:41,035 --> 01:24:43,196
I don't know what to fucking do!

1180
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:46,364
- How many in your family?
- Why do you keep asking about my family?

1181
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,135
They're not here now, are they?

1182
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,836
How many in your family?

1183
01:24:52,813 --> 01:24:54,303
My parents.

1184
01:24:57,585 --> 01:24:59,576
My younger brother and sister.

1185
01:25:03,591 --> 01:25:05,252
My sister was born here.

1186
01:25:12,299 --> 01:25:15,268
Well, tomorrow was supposed
to be a special day.

1187
01:25:15,336 --> 01:25:18,897
And you shit on it
for your whole family.

1188
01:25:18,973 --> 01:25:20,907
I've been through it.

1189
01:25:20,975 --> 01:25:24,968
It was the most spiritual
moment of my life.

1190
01:25:25,045 --> 01:25:28,276
You know, you're standing there,

1191
01:25:28,349 --> 01:25:31,750
looking around you
at all these people from everywhere.

1192
01:25:31,819 --> 01:25:33,844
Countries you can't even pronounce,

1193
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:35,548
you didn't even know existed.

1194
01:25:37,158 --> 01:25:40,150
And they're happy.

1195
01:25:40,227 --> 01:25:43,094
They're elated to be there

1196
01:25:43,164 --> 01:25:44,995
because it's their choice.

1197
01:25:48,869 --> 01:25:52,828
You wouldn't be here right now,

1198
01:25:52,907 --> 01:25:55,467
in this mess you're in,

1199
01:25:55,543 --> 01:26:00,571
if you could ever appreciate the awe
you'd feel in that moment.

1200
01:26:00,648 --> 01:26:02,445
The worthiness of the journey.

1201
01:26:07,922 --> 01:26:09,116
So,

1202
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:10,487
when you're standing there tomorrow,

1203
01:26:10,558 --> 01:26:12,219
in your new suit and tie,

1204
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:14,488
I want you to look around.

1205
01:26:14,562 --> 01:26:19,090
Okay? Look at those faces.

1206
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:22,795
And understand
the sublime promise of this moment.

1207
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:31,501
What the fuck, man.

1208
01:26:31,579 --> 01:26:34,207
I'm not gonna be there.
You said it yourself.

1209
01:26:34,281 --> 01:26:36,340
Stop messing with my head.

1210
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:39,875
All right. The way to end this,

1211
01:26:39,954 --> 01:26:42,286
my friend, is for you
to put down your gun.

1212
01:26:42,356 --> 01:26:43,687
- Now I'm gonna put mine...
- What the fuck!

1213
01:26:43,757 --> 01:26:47,215
What the fuck are you doing?

1214
01:26:47,294 --> 01:26:48,420
What the fuck...

1215
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,963
Now you put down your gun.

1216
01:26:51,031 --> 01:26:54,125
Let go of that woman.
You go in that back room.

1217
01:26:54,201 --> 01:26:56,635
You take the surveillance
tapes out of the system.

1218
01:26:56,704 --> 01:27:00,538
Okay? And you keep on walking.

1219
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,839
You're fucking with me.
Stop fucking with me!

1220
01:27:03,911 --> 01:27:06,709
You think I'm some jackoff? Huh?

1221
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,805
I think you made a mistake,

1222
01:27:08,882 --> 01:27:12,340
and you will never make
a mistake like this again.

1223
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:36,009
LAPD! Put your hands up!

1224
01:27:36,076 --> 01:27:38,271
Get 'em up!

1225
01:27:38,345 --> 01:27:40,210
Relax.

1226
01:27:40,281 --> 01:27:41,942
Situation's under control.

1227
01:27:42,016 --> 01:27:43,950
Help me out here.
You're saying there were four of them,

1228
01:27:44,018 --> 01:27:47,181
but the owner's wife is
positive there were five.

1229
01:27:47,254 --> 01:27:49,222
She says you let one of them walk.

1230
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:52,817
She also says you let him take
the surveillance tapes with him.

1231
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:56,590
She's confused. She had her
head down most of the time.

1232
01:27:56,664 --> 01:27:59,326
Hey, I killed four of them.
Why would I let one go?

1233
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,493
I look crazy to you?

1234
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,263
I can tell you how many there were.

1235
01:28:05,105 --> 01:28:07,539
There were only four. She's mistaken.

1236
01:28:07,608 --> 01:28:12,409
This man, he saved our lives.

1237
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:13,844
There were four.

1238
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,074
The witness has corroborated it.

1239
01:28:15,149 --> 01:28:17,049
They must have been
lax in surveillance.

1240
01:28:17,117 --> 01:28:18,550
Probably just covering up
for insurance purposes.

1241
01:28:45,346 --> 01:28:47,541
Hamid. Where the fuck are you?

1242
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,912
I need to talk to you
as soon as possible.

1243
01:28:49,983 --> 01:28:52,178
Give me a call as soon
as you get this message.

1244
01:28:52,252 --> 01:28:54,550
Immediately. I don't care what time it is.

1245
01:29:00,594 --> 01:29:02,892
<i>
One message.</i>

1246
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,430
<i>Max, it's Kevin.</i>

1247
01:29:04,498 --> 01:29:06,432
<i>Listen, call me when you can.</i>

1248
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,660
<i>Just a heads up.</i>

1249
01:29:07,735 --> 01:29:10,033
<i>LAPD contacted me a few minutes ago.</i>

1250
01:29:10,104 --> 01:29:13,733
<i>Apparently, Hamid was
involved in a shootout tonight in Koreatown.</i>

1251
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,775
<i>Don't worry. He's fine,
but I'm heading over</i>

1252
01:29:15,843 --> 01:29:17,936
<i>to the crime scene now to check things out.</i>

1253
01:29:18,011 --> 01:29:20,070
<i>Try me on my cell.</i>

1254
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:22,206
<i>
End of messages.</i>

1255
01:29:34,895 --> 01:29:36,988
"I'm not interested in you.
I'm not interested.

1256
01:29:37,064 --> 01:29:38,929
"I'm not interested in you.

1257
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:40,967
For one, you're too old for me."

1258
01:29:43,303 --> 01:29:45,237
Miss Shepard,
I'm Special Agent Ludwig

1259
01:29:45,305 --> 01:29:47,796
with ICE's Document
and Benefit fraud unit.

1260
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:51,106
This is my partner, Special Agent Howell.

1261
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:53,669
May we have a word
with you inside, please?

1262
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:58,845
We discovered these
and quite a few others

1263
01:29:58,919 --> 01:30:01,888
when we performed a search
of Javier Pedraza's apartment.

1264
01:30:01,955 --> 01:30:04,321
I didn't, um, use these.
I didn't go back for them.

1265
01:30:04,391 --> 01:30:07,383
- So you can't, um...
- You see what's interesting, Miss Shepard,

1266
01:30:07,461 --> 01:30:09,486
is we ran a check on your name.

1267
01:30:09,563 --> 01:30:11,531
A Claire Shepard arrived
on a B2 visitor's visa

1268
01:30:11,598 --> 01:30:12,929
seven months ago.

1269
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,491
And then just two days ago,
she has her status adjusted

1270
01:30:15,569 --> 01:30:19,164
to an EB-1 green card for
persons of extraordinary ability.

1271
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:21,207
According to the Internet Movie Database,

1272
01:30:21,275 --> 01:30:22,537
the only Claire Shepard

1273
01:30:22,609 --> 01:30:25,009
that matches your spelling,
age, and place of birth,

1274
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:27,569
has two credits on
little-known Aussie TV shows.

1275
01:30:27,648 --> 01:30:29,172
Walk-on roles.

1276
01:30:29,249 --> 01:30:31,308
She hasn't won any national
or international awards.

1277
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:34,252
Which is something
the adjudicator who handled your case

1278
01:30:34,321 --> 01:30:36,050
would have to have been aware of.

1279
01:30:36,123 --> 01:30:39,718
And yet he approved you for an EB-1.

1280
01:30:39,793 --> 01:30:42,261
Miss Shepard.

1281
01:30:42,329 --> 01:30:44,854
We'd like you to tell us
about your relationship

1282
01:30:44,932 --> 01:30:47,662
with Center Adjudications
Officer Cole Frankel.

1283
01:30:53,907 --> 01:30:56,137
Congratulations, McGill.

1284
01:31:02,049 --> 01:31:03,243
Mr. Frankel.

1285
01:31:03,317 --> 01:31:06,115
Special Agents Poulson and Womack.

1286
01:31:06,186 --> 01:31:07,778
OIG.

1287
01:31:07,855 --> 01:31:09,880
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1288
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:12,653
What is this, a joke?

1289
01:31:12,726 --> 01:31:15,320
I take it you're familiar
with Claire Shepard.

1290
01:31:15,395 --> 01:31:17,920
She just traded you
for voluntary departure.

1291
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:20,925
Turn around, please.

1292
01:31:21,001 --> 01:31:22,161
Hands behind your back.

1293
01:31:22,236 --> 01:31:24,602
Do you have to do this?
Do you have to cuff me?

1294
01:31:24,671 --> 01:31:25,865
Yeah, I'm afraid we do.

1295
01:31:36,884 --> 01:31:38,715
What the hell is this?

1296
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:41,686
Cole, where are you go...
where... what's going on?

1297
01:31:41,755 --> 01:31:45,657
Ma'am, your husband is under arrest
for immigration fraud.

1298
01:31:45,726 --> 01:31:47,353
Cole.

1299
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:57,866
Good morning, everyone.

1300
01:31:57,938 --> 01:32:00,736
My name is Judge Leslie Freeman,

1301
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:02,502
of the Federal District Court.

1302
01:32:02,576 --> 01:32:07,878
And it is my great pleasure
to welcome you here today.

1303
01:32:07,948 --> 01:32:12,044
All of you seated here
share one thing in common.

1304
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:15,247
You have all chosen,
of your own free will,

1305
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:18,655
to become citizens of this great nation.

1306
01:32:20,394 --> 01:32:23,488
For many of you, the road
to this joyous moment

1307
01:32:23,564 --> 01:32:27,557
has been fraught with
hardship and sacrifice.

1308
01:32:28,802 --> 01:32:31,794
It is incumbent upon me to remind you

1309
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:35,171
of your newfound responsibilities
as citizens,

1310
01:32:35,242 --> 01:32:38,439
and also to remind you
that an American citizenship

1311
01:32:38,512 --> 01:32:40,673
is not a guarantee of success

1312
01:32:40,747 --> 01:32:43,614
but rather the promise of opportunities.

1313
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:46,016
Unlimited opportunities.

1314
01:32:46,086 --> 01:32:48,020
It has always been my contention

1315
01:32:48,088 --> 01:32:51,114
that America is a welcoming nation,

1316
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:53,955
a country that accepts every new citizen

1317
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:57,019
with an embrace of good faith.

1318
01:32:57,097 --> 01:33:00,897
You have endless credit
to pursue your hopes and dreams,

1319
01:33:00,968 --> 01:33:05,803
as long as you honor
the rules and laws of our society.

1320
01:33:05,872 --> 01:33:08,705
I myself am a first-generation American.

1321
01:33:08,775 --> 01:33:10,868
- I guess I called it right.
- Max?

1322
01:33:10,944 --> 01:33:13,139
Well, he's gotta put the family first.

1323
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:15,613
Ain't that right, Hamid?

1324
01:33:15,682 --> 01:33:17,547
You know what I'm talking about.

1325
01:33:17,618 --> 01:33:20,712
- Do we have to do this right now?
- Yes, God damn it. Right now.

1326
01:33:22,623 --> 01:33:25,786
An innocent...
yes, innocent young woman

1327
01:33:25,859 --> 01:33:28,384
was brutally murdered 'cause
she flashed a little tit

1328
01:33:28,462 --> 01:33:30,760
on occasion, got it on
with a married man,

1329
01:33:30,831 --> 01:33:34,767
tried to live her life
outside your goddamn family.

1330
01:33:34,835 --> 01:33:38,771
She was your sister.

1331
01:33:38,839 --> 01:33:42,275
She deserved better
than that from you.

1332
01:33:42,342 --> 01:33:45,800
In this country,
we don't abide by that shit.

1333
01:33:45,879 --> 01:33:48,439
We got a name for it. Murder.

1334
01:33:48,515 --> 01:33:51,075
Cold-blooded murder.

1335
01:33:51,151 --> 01:33:54,587
And you and Farid
are going down for it.

1336
01:33:54,655 --> 01:33:56,714
Will our new citizens please stand?

1337
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:59,520
Raise your right hand

1338
01:33:59,593 --> 01:34:03,222
and join me in reciting
the Oath of Allegiance.

1339
01:34:03,296 --> 01:34:05,321
I hereby declare on oath...

1340
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:07,924
I've got the surveillance
tapes from the motel.

1341
01:34:10,337 --> 01:34:13,602
From the day before.
From last week.

1342
01:34:13,674 --> 01:34:16,302
I.D.'d Farid's Beemer.

1343
01:34:16,376 --> 01:34:18,435
He was watching her,
reporting back to you,

1344
01:34:18,512 --> 01:34:20,207
waiting for you to take action.

1345
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,181
I begged him, Max, to leave it alone,

1346
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,878
but he was being
pressured by our father.

1347
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:28,978
We both were.
He poisoned Farid's mind

1348
01:34:29,056 --> 01:34:31,616
with this talk about the shame
that we brought on our family,

1349
01:34:31,692 --> 01:34:33,819
because of her. But he never...

1350
01:34:33,894 --> 01:34:38,354
he never intended
for this to happen.

1351
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:44,835
Only that we would
teach her a lesson.

1352
01:34:44,905 --> 01:34:47,601
We were supposed to
catch them in the act

1353
01:34:47,674 --> 01:34:48,732
and beat them like dogs.

1354
01:34:48,809 --> 01:34:51,471
My father wanted Zahra humiliated,

1355
01:34:51,545 --> 01:34:53,740
- brought in line.
- Congratulations to all you citizens.

1356
01:35:01,288 --> 01:35:04,553
I wanted no part of it.

1357
01:35:04,624 --> 01:35:09,926
I thought if I just turned my back,

1358
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:11,293
it would all go away.

1359
01:35:14,935 --> 01:35:18,166
And now will you please stand

1360
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:20,706
and place your right hand over your heart

1361
01:35:20,774 --> 01:35:24,801
as we listen to Phil Perry
sing our National Anthem.

1362
01:35:24,878 --> 01:35:26,971
# Oh say #

1363
01:35:27,047 --> 01:35:31,484
# Can you see #

1364
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:33,883
# By the dawn's #

1365
01:35:33,954 --> 01:35:38,357
# early light #

1366
01:35:38,425 --> 01:35:42,452
He arrived at my apartment that night.

1367
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:44,463
After he...

1368
01:35:44,531 --> 01:35:45,463
After he...

1369
01:35:50,904 --> 01:35:52,872
Help me, Hamid.
Please, God, help me.

1370
01:35:54,808 --> 01:35:56,002
How did you get this?

1371
01:35:56,076 --> 01:35:57,907
Where's Zahra?

1372
01:35:57,978 --> 01:36:00,344
- I only wanted to scare her.
- What are you talking about?

1373
01:36:00,413 --> 01:36:02,347
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1374
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:05,612
- Her seeing a degenerate fucking beaner.
- What did you do, Farid?

1375
01:36:05,685 --> 01:36:07,346
I only wanted to get
in his face a little bit.

1376
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:09,047
You have to take this.

1377
01:36:09,122 --> 01:36:11,420
You're a cop. You know how
to do that kind of stuff.

1378
01:36:11,491 --> 01:36:12,651
What did you do, Farid?

1379
01:36:12,726 --> 01:36:14,159
I looked in the door.

1380
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:16,218
They were doing it like animals.

1381
01:36:16,296 --> 01:36:17,957
Oh, shit!

1382
01:36:18,031 --> 01:36:20,556
What the fuck are you doing?
Get out of here!

1383
01:36:20,634 --> 01:36:21,623
What the fuck is this shit?

1384
01:36:21,701 --> 01:36:23,191
What's your fucking problem?

1385
01:36:24,671 --> 01:36:26,901
What did you do to our sister?
Tell me what you did!

1386
01:36:26,973 --> 01:36:28,804
She's my girl, man.

1387
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:30,866
She's my girl. Don't be stupid.

1388
01:36:30,944 --> 01:36:32,707
Put the fucking gun down.

1389
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:36,005
Get the fuck outta here, man!

1390
01:36:40,153 --> 01:36:43,213
# In air #

1391
01:36:43,290 --> 01:36:47,090
# Gave proof #

1392
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:50,960
# Through this night #

1393
01:36:51,031 --> 01:36:53,022
You should have come
to me, God damn it.

1394
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:55,897
I was ashamed.

1395
01:36:55,969 --> 01:36:57,937
Ashamed of myself.

1396
01:36:58,004 --> 01:36:58,993
My family.

1397
01:37:01,975 --> 01:37:05,342
Better get yourself
a good criminal attorney, Counselor.

1398
01:37:05,412 --> 01:37:06,811
You're gonna need one.

1399
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,348
#... star-spangled #

1400
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:15,753
# Banner yet wave #

# For the land of the free #

1402
01:37:27,067 --> 01:37:29,467
Running out on our National Anthem.

1403
01:37:29,536 --> 01:37:31,333
Now, that's just plain disrespectful.

1404
01:37:31,404 --> 01:37:35,500
# And the home #

1405
01:37:35,575 --> 01:37:40,012

1407
01:37:41,748 --> 01:37:43,147
Farid Baraheri, you are under arrest

1408
01:37:43,216 --> 01:37:45,411
for the murder of your
sister, Zahra Baraheri,

1409
01:37:45,485 --> 01:37:46,474
and Javier Pedraza.

1410
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:02,658
Congratulations to all our new citizens.

1411
01:38:02,736 --> 01:38:05,466
Good luck to all of you.

Looks like she's been

I think she paid the wrong

All of my friends leave.

Not today, sweetie.

Someone's come for you.

Uh-oh. All right.

Here we go.

1436
01:43:46,312 --> 01:43:47,609

Uh, do me a favor, will ya?
Hold off on that.

1443
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,608
I'd like to take care of it myself.

1444
01:44:17,410 --> 01:44:20,777
I just want to do right by her.

1445

Thanks. I'll be down
as soon as I'm off shift.
