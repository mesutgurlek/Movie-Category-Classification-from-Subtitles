Yeah, the Crazy Horse.
That's you, right?

00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,655
- Yeah, you got something?
- Yeah, pole camera. Three days ago.

- Funny.
- Interesting.

10

The good news is no polyps.

11
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,027
The bad news is, as you can see...

12
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:37,030
...you've got a fairly severe case
of ulcerative colitis.

- Jesus Christ.
- She was getting better.

Then last week, another flare-up.

15
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,456
How you doing with the Prozac?
Is it helping?

16
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,208
- She can't even sleep.
- Ma.

17
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,211
- Well, look at her.
- I'd like to start you on prednisone.

18
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,630
- It's a steroid.
- Like for weight lifters?

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,050
I've had a great deal of success with it
treating this type of condition.

20
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,095
I do need to warn you, however,
there are certain side effects.

21
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,638
Mind you, these are temporary.

- What?

25
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,482
- Jerry Lewis in the last year or two.
- Oh, my God.

- A.J. had his friends over.

29
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,871
Oh, how'd he do
over there with your dad?

30

- Out raking the driveway?
- Fine.

asking if we were getting back together.

You know, I had a dream
that I moved back in here.

we did get back together.

41

Well, it wouldn't be a cartoon.

- I did not sleep with him, Tony.

your total disregard...

To film people without telling them?

leave the garbage in the dumpster?

- His name is Gilbert Nieves.

323

of an infrared stamp on his hand

in the strongest possible terms...

628
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,109
I'd stop to eat, but I don't wanna get
to the hospital after Tony.

629
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,528
I'm not hungry.

630
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,628
They'll keep him a few days, maybe.

631
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,213
Observation.

632
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,756
Do some tests.

633
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,466
Who knows?

634
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:50,037
He's a strong kid, Chrissy.

635
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,331
He's tough.

636
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,584
Very resilient.

637
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,641
Why are you crying?
He's gonna be fine.

638
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,927
Oh, no.

639
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,304
No. No.

640
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,017
- Come on.
- No! No! Please!

641
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,019
- Where you fucking going?
- Please!

642
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,646
- Come on!
- No! No!

643
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,439
- Fucking cunt.
- Please!

644
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,193
No. No! No!

645
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,279
No! No!

- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Tony.

655
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,430
You deserve it.

656
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,768
I want you to know this is the last time
we'll meet like this.

657
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,228
It's undignified.

658
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,358
Okay.

659
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,027
So...

660
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,571
...what's the word on your cousin?

661
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,621
I think I know where he's holed up.

662
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:26,754
- And?
- I know this has to be done, John.

663
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,341
But I'm asking you now, as a friend...

664
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,510
...let me handle this myself.

665
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,804
I can't do that, Tony.

666
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,685
You can do whatever the fuck you want,
John, you're the fucking boss.

667
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,895
I choose not to, then.

668
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,155
I want your promise it'll be quick.

669
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,992
I'm not gonna lie to you,
Tony, I don't have to.

670
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,660
Phil's gonna do it.

671
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,245
And he'll do it his way.

672
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,206
John.

673
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,668
This is me, now.

674
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,462
Come on.

675
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,507
Anything else?

676
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,053
No.

677
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,369
You know what, John?
I'll give you undignified.

678
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,789
Go fuck yourself.

679
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:47,043
You and Phil and whoever.

680
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,628
He's my fucking cousin.

[CLUB MUSIC PLAYS OUTSIDE]

682
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,075
Hey.

683
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,918
You all right?

684
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,504
Some funny shit.

685
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,344
The fuck is wrong with you?

686
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,560
I snorted a little H.

687
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,023
I know...

688
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:54,944
...but I can't stand the pain.

689
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,238
I loved her.

690
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,371
Fucking pain!

691
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,000
You think you're alone in this?

692
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,044
It was a judgment call.
She sounded okay.

693
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,088
What's the status on Moltisanti?

694
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,674
Last seen yesterday.
He was leaving the Bing with Tony.

695
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,093
- Should we bring him in?
- That'll get us nothing.

696
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,720
She really could have fled.
She could be in China.

697
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,238
How should we handle the other thing?
The Nieves murder?

698
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,365
We have the terror possibility.

699
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,826
Take it over from the Long Branch P.D.

700
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,750
Well, what did I say?
Is it beautiful?

701
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,631
Yeah, it's a gorgeous piece of land.

702
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,925
And with this view...

703
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,844
...it's well worth 600,000.

704
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,430
The surveyor's coming on Tuesday.

705
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,701
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, me? Yeah.

706
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,162
Absolutely.
