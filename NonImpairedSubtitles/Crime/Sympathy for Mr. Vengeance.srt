1
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:19,494
I'm a good person
I'm a hard worker

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,662
My older sister is
the only family I have

3
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,037
To put me through
art school

4
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:28,669
she gave up college
and got a job at a factory

5
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:33,749
But then she fell seriously
ill and had to quit

6
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:37,786
So I gave up art school
and got a job

7
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:42,789
But recently
I made a decision

8
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:47,663
I'm not sure whether
to tell my sister or not

9
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:51,326
I'm hesitating even
as I write this letter

10
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:55,498
If I decide to do it

11
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,506
I'll be listening to the
broadcast with my sister

12
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,968
I can't speak with my mouth

13
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:11,013
I'm deaf and dumb

14
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:20,194
Please read this letter to my
sister for me, since I can't

15
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:25,458
Sis, you're listening?

16
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:28,772
You told me if you die
you want to be buried by

17
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,773
the river where
we used to play

18
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:34,071
All right
I'll do that

19
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:38,444
But that'll be in
40 or 50 years' time

20
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:44,248
I'm going to save you
Really, I swear

21
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:50,451
Actually, I registered to
donate my kidney today

22
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:53,025
I know you
said not to that you'd rather die

23
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:56,032
that you'd rather die
than be a burden

24
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:59,532
But you know I never
do what I'm told

25
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,110
Not A type

26
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:20,214
if the blood types
don't match

27
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,628
then we can't do
a transplant

28
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:32,761
You haven't had test
since school, have you?

29
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:39,969
If you can't pay
take her home for now

30
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,771
Until we find
a suitable donor

31
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:49,140
just keep coming
in for dialysis

32
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,080
ok?

33
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,838
It's type B, B

34
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,435
Our new house
is an old house

35
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:25,378
The estate thought
it'd be OK for I'm deaf

36
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:45,400
If sister can't sleep
then neither can I

37
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:57,076
Aw, fucking great!

38
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,336
I heard that

39
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:05,302
this happened
in Australia

40
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:13,075
A man...

41
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:20,282
thought he had
two heads

42
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,763
Two heads?

43
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,062
Yeah, two

44
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,562
And

45
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:37,902
he kept getting
headaches

46
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:41,043
With two heads

47
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:44,602
he had headaches
all the time

48
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,076
So you know
what he did?

49
00:12:54,991 --> 00:13:02,363
He shot
one of his heads

50
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:11,006
The left
or the right?

51
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,610
Aren't you
going to lunch?

52
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,705
Come on

53
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:28,844
let's go
eat something

54
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:41,578
You've only
got 10 million won?

55
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:46,952
Well, first of all

56
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,922
give us your kidney
then we'll do it

57
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:56,063
You give us
yours and we'll

58
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,132
get you one
for your sister

59
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,269
For 10 million won
Got it?

60
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:08,509
Understand me?

61
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:42,610
Your blood type's B
right?

62
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,253
21 days later
Congratulations

63
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:15,762
Finding a donor
this fast is

64
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,866
simply a miracle

65
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:24,133
The surgery's in a week

66
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:28,268
so have her
admitted in 5 days

67
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,009
You said you had
10 million won, right?

68
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:40,555
So all your
problems are solved

69
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:52,059
Isn't it great?

70
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:58,664
You idiot
you stupid fuck!

71
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:06,538
That money would've
saved your sister

72
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,596
Why not?

73
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,190
not the time to
be thinking that way

74
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:28,566
There's a saying

75
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,602
Is a boiled pig afraid
of boiling water?

76
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:34,302
Besides

77
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,211
What are you going to do?
You've only got a week

78
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:40,215
You know how long

79
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:43,377
it'll take to find
another donor?

80
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,259
Is that her?

81
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,997
She's cute

82
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:08,004
Must be a friend

83
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:19,014
That's the bastard
who fired you?

84
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:27,252
That car's worth
10 years of your salary

85
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:30,762
That's why we
need a revolution

86
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,960
So sick people will
get free treatment

87
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,697
The time must come

88
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:39,501
when you can get any

89
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:41,735
damned organ you need!

90
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:46,580
The bad image

91
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,750
they get is cause
kids keep getting killed

92
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:52,686
But we're different

93
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,656
Give us money, we'll
return the kid pronto

94
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:01,728
I'm afraid
She won't want to go home

95
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:05,460
She'll be playing
with us all the time

96
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,626
Won't have
to go to school

97
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,242
What? What?

98
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:20,815
It's summer vacation

99
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:41,328
But think about it from
parents' point of view

100
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:44,202
They'll be so happy
to see her again

101
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:48,607
They'll love her more
and the family will be closer

102
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:53,611
we'll ask for
exactly 26 million won

103
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:56,718
How conscientious is
that right?

104
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:02,287
That money's nothing
to them

105
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,259
but for us it's a
matter of life and death

106
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:09,354
Movement of capital
maximizes the value of money

107
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,559
it's not a crime
don't you think?

108
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:27,875
There are

109
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,446
good kidnappings
and bad kidnappings

110
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:39,558
Good kidnapping enlists
the parents' cooperation

111
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:46,061
If they call the
police, the kid dies

112
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,563
The parents pay up

113
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:51,333
and the kid gets returned

114
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,974
Then nobody finds
out about it

115
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,810
People think all
kidnappings are bad

116
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:26,136
Daddy!

117
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,834
What?

118
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,777
Can I go play
at Yoosun's house?

119
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:32,678
No

120
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:36,047
Then will you buy me a
cell phone like Yoosun's?

121
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:42,190
Why do you buy
her stuff like that?

122
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:45,591
Have consideration
for your neighbors

123
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,507
Peng!

124
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:07,074
President Park!

125
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:10,516
Sir
please help me!

126
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:14,613
My wife ran off and
my kids are starving

127
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,827
In six years I never
missed a day of work

128
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:24,261
You know the percentage
of faulty goods was 0.008%

129
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,164
0.008%

130
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:27,963
Peng
what are you doing?

131
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:30,264
I explained it
to you already

132
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,781
Your employee?

133
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:18,547
I gave away my youth
to Ilshin Electronics

134
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:08,095
-Are you OK?
-Daddy!

135
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,365
It's not going to work

136
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,731
Why?

137
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:45,306
Look at him
I was fired by the kid's father

138
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:51,880
I'll be the first
person the police call in

139
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,220
Then what do we do?

140
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:18,840
Defeat the communists
the way for Korea is victory

141
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:32,082
Let's go for Freedom
Down

142
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:38,215
Defeat the communists

143
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:45,790
the way for
Korea is victory

144
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,491
By the way

145
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,440
how come Daddy's
friend is so poor?

146
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,308
Huh?

147
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:12,684
We spent a lot of
money because I'm sick

148
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:17,886
What hospital is
your mother in?

149
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,567
She doesn't know
about the car accident

150
00:31:52,494 --> 00:32:01,698
Daddy was too busy
so they got divorced

151
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,337
so

152
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:10,775
That's why
he left me with you

153
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:20,882
Mine?

154
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:39,170
Don't cry
Stop it!

155
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:45,705
Please
Stop

156
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:21,315
He wants to trade
it for your doll

157
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:36,888
Daddy loves Yoosun

158
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:41,867
Yoosun loves Daddy, too

159
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:37,750
Sis

160
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,021
More than anything

161
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:56,866
I'm jealous of girls with
mommys to braid their hair

162
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:17,022
Then come see
me sometime

163
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:20,023
Really?

164
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:40,177
Call me anytime

165
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:44,582
I'm all alone
so I get bored

166
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:43,060
He never said why he
missed work so often?

167
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:50,333
Then he never went off
for special training?

168
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:56,934
Yes, last week from
Monday to Wednesday

169
00:41:56,831 --> 00:42:00,358
She's washing

170
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:58,350
Give it!
I'm watching cartoons

171
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:15,585
Is anybody
out there?

172
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,871
Somebody help me

173
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:37,653
Go away!

174
00:49:48,703 --> 00:49:51,001
Ryu

175
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:53,836
Ryu!

176
00:50:00,648 --> 00:50:02,707
Ryu

177
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:27,237
Ryu Ryu Ryu

178
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:56,830
Ryu

179
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:14,013
The water's deep there
it's far over my head

180
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:45,037
Later I realized why
I thought the water was deep

181
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,540
When I was a kid
it was up over my head

182
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:59,729
Have you ever done
anything to provoke anyone?

183
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:05,670
Please think again

184
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:09,513
I always thought

185
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,811
I lived
an honest life

186
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:20,659
But think

187
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:26,923
Excuse me, what is
your net worth?

188
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:30,594
I'm a high school
graduate

189
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,199
and I started as
an electrical engineer

190
00:56:38,078 --> 00:56:40,012
My wife left me when

191
00:56:42,216 --> 00:56:44,047
the economy crashed

192
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:49,947
But why

193
00:56:52,059 --> 00:56:54,027
I don't understand

194
00:56:57,731 --> 00:57:01,599
Why didn't you
call the police?

195
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:08,203
I thought lots of
kids returned safely

196
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,204
If I do what
they tell me

197
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:17,350
Sir, I checked

198
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:20,181
it looks like they
used this phone number

199
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:24,018
they didn't answer
so we can't locate them

200
00:57:24,224 --> 00:57:27,785
It's this number
right?

201
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,002
My wife gave it to
her before she left

202
00:57:45,145 --> 00:57:47,238
Just a second

203
00:57:53,787 --> 00:57:55,277
Yeah

204
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:57,614
I'm working

205
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:01,217
So an operation will

206
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:03,259
take care of it?

207
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:11,536
Where would I get
10 million won?

208
00:58:13,774 --> 00:58:15,264
am I supposed to do?

209
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:24,684
At least kid wasn't
kidnapped and killed

210
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:28,510
We're lucky
you know

211
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:32,216
Cause we don't
have any money

212
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,834
Saw

213
01:00:09,923 --> 01:00:11,015
Lift up

214
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:16,489
One, Two, Three

215
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,497
Saw

216
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,511
Lung was
Swollen badly

217
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:24,754
It looks like a
woman's handwriting

218
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:29,432
Do you recognize it?

219
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:56,360
Yoosun

220
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:33,910
Why didn't you give
me swimming lessons?

221
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,618
I put this house
for sale

222
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:26,756
and I sold
the company, too

223
01:07:29,601 --> 01:07:31,296
That's all

224
01:07:35,207 --> 01:07:38,074
the money I have

225
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:02,631
there's nothing
special about it

226
01:08:02,768 --> 01:08:06,260
A brother and
sister lived here

227
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:09,670
They don't know
where they moved to

228
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:16,079
I'll look into it

229
01:08:26,725 --> 01:08:27,817
Let's go

230
01:08:27,993 --> 01:08:29,585
Nothing more
to see here

231
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:44,039
You asked if
I ever provoked anyone?

232
01:10:02,387 --> 01:10:04,617
Are you the father?

233
01:10:04,756 --> 01:10:08,487
-Well, actually
-I am

234
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:11,195
How is he?

235
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,669
If I were a very
optimistic doctor

236
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:20,996
I'd tell you
there was hope

237
01:10:22,241 --> 01:10:25,699
this is my guess

238
01:11:24,937 --> 01:11:27,872
When did you know
we'd become like this?

239
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:31,775
The moment
our eyes met

240
01:11:34,012 --> 01:11:35,411
You're like an ant

241
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:36,913
An ant?

242
01:11:38,116 --> 01:11:42,052
They say
ants are psychic

243
01:11:42,788 --> 01:11:46,724
They predict
earthquakes and floods

244
01:13:31,563 --> 01:13:34,555
Baek Hyun-jin's "Affection"

245
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:38,067
requested by a man who
signed Ryu of Doksan-dong

246
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:40,966
Any of you remember
this guy?

247
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,340
He was deaf

248
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:47,742
He sent a letter
saying his sister was sick

249
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:52,373
Oh, no
She passed away

250
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:55,211
He says, "I'm the
one who killed her"

251
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:00,257
"My life has no
meaning now."

252
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:03,323
You shouldn't
say that

253
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:07,728
Would she want to
see you like this?

254
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:12,768
Don't forget she's
watching you from above

255
01:14:12,871 --> 01:14:16,398
I know
you can't hear me

256
01:14:16,508 --> 01:14:20,877
but me and our
listening audience

257
01:14:21,012 --> 01:14:23,606
are praying for you

258
01:14:24,015 --> 01:14:25,744
Be strong

259
01:14:25,851 --> 01:14:27,842
To help you out

260
01:14:27,919 --> 01:14:29,546
I'll send you a new
Kimchi refrigerator

261
01:14:29,788 --> 01:14:33,815
It hasn't an address
so if anyone listening to

262
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:37,828
broadcast knows him
please let him know

263
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:43,364
We're waiting for such
touching stories from you

264
01:14:43,502 --> 01:14:45,060
If there's a story
you want to tell

265
01:14:45,137 --> 01:14:48,800
send me a letter

266
01:14:48,907 --> 01:14:57,838
Our address is Seoul
Yeongdungpo Yeouido...

267
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:01,414
I kept them cause the
pictures were pretty

268
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,318
I cried so much
while reading them

269
01:15:09,995 --> 01:15:11,622
But

270
01:15:11,696 --> 01:15:14,824
is he
really a kidnapper?

271
01:15:16,701 --> 01:15:20,762
Don't send him a gift
You haven't sent it?

272
01:17:35,106 --> 01:17:37,199
Two, three

273
01:18:43,174 --> 01:18:45,404
He's mentally
disabled

274
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:47,670
not stupid

275
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:17,403
President Park
this is Choi

276
01:19:23,448 --> 01:19:27,475
the results are out
and we checked the car

277
01:19:27,585 --> 01:19:29,610
Yes
I know that place

278
01:19:30,855 --> 01:19:34,552
I'll see you
there at 2:00

279
01:19:48,807 --> 01:19:52,140
Yes, I'm calling
about the sticker

280
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:56,102
Yeah the kidney
transplant

281
01:19:57,949 --> 01:19:59,314
Yes

282
01:20:00,452 --> 01:20:03,944
She wouldn't have
lived long anyway

283
01:20:04,122 --> 01:20:08,582
I searched hospitals
and found her file

284
01:20:10,395 --> 01:20:14,729
They managed to get a
kidney from someone

285
01:20:14,799 --> 01:20:17,165
but apparently they
didn't have money

286
01:20:18,269 --> 01:20:19,930
President Park

287
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:25,466
What I really
want to ask is

288
01:20:25,643 --> 01:20:29,545
What are you going to do
to when you find them?

289
01:20:29,681 --> 01:20:31,410
Kill them

290
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:12,920
Dismantle
the conglomerates!

291
01:21:17,095 --> 01:21:20,258
Drive out
U.S. Army!

292
01:21:24,869 --> 01:21:28,532
Destroy
the new liberalism

293
01:21:35,113 --> 01:21:38,139
that ruins the lives
of the people!

294
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:47,488
Destroy
the new liberalism

295
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,503
I understand

296
01:22:04,642 --> 01:22:08,271
I'll wire you the money
tomorrow and then call you back

297
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,588
Destroy
the conglomerates!

298
01:22:26,664 --> 01:22:29,155
Destroy
the conglomerates!

299
01:22:30,268 --> 01:22:32,566
Drive out
U.S. Army

300
01:23:24,088 --> 01:23:26,249
Are you going far?

301
01:23:28,459 --> 01:23:29,926
Hell, yeah

302
01:24:36,728 --> 01:24:40,459
Shit, you said
I could go first!

303
01:25:43,694 --> 01:25:47,061
It's in an artery
Chulseung

304
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,727
Don't take it out!

305
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:03,110
Mom

306
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:25,724
The noodles were all
soggy last time

307
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:29,361
Yeah, hurry

308
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:45,413
Huh?

309
01:28:54,018 --> 01:28:55,883
Where is the bastard?

310
01:28:56,988 --> 01:28:58,512
Fuck you

311
01:29:25,349 --> 01:29:27,010
Where?

312
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,219
Fuck you

313
01:29:31,355 --> 01:29:33,915
Tell me
you bitch!

314
01:29:36,994 --> 01:29:38,188
Fuck

315
01:30:37,788 --> 01:30:42,589
Next time, don't
order just one dish

316
01:31:57,401 --> 01:31:58,766
Mister

317
01:31:59,703 --> 01:32:01,193
Yoosun

318
01:32:02,106 --> 01:32:04,973
We didn't kill
her on purpose

319
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:08,177
I'm sorry

320
01:32:08,646 --> 01:32:10,773
we made a mistake

321
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:16,815
But I have something
to tell you

322
01:32:21,826 --> 01:32:26,957
I'm not just any
ordinary person

323
01:32:30,267 --> 01:32:33,236
If anything
happens to me

324
01:32:34,104 --> 01:32:38,302
my organization
is a terrorist group

325
01:32:39,376 --> 01:32:41,571
They'll kill you

326
01:32:41,946 --> 01:32:45,746
100%
For sure

327
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:51,647
I gave them
your picture

328
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:59,819
If you want to live
just leave me

329
01:33:00,965 --> 01:33:03,593
This is
for your sake

330
01:33:03,901 --> 01:33:05,766
honest

331
01:33:10,641 --> 01:33:12,199
And

332
01:33:14,545 --> 01:33:16,638
I'm sorry

333
01:33:19,483 --> 01:33:21,075
100%

334
01:34:35,993 --> 01:34:39,429
She sat next to
the deaf kid

335
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:44,297
so
she's deaf, too?

336
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:45,891
No

337
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:50,063
how come she went
to same school?

338
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,435
So
what I mean is

339
01:34:52,543 --> 01:34:55,137
she got expelled

340
01:34:55,245 --> 01:34:57,645
when was find out
she wasn't deaf

341
01:34:57,982 --> 01:35:01,679
She went to college
and was a left wing activist

342
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:06,119
sneaked onto a boat once
trying to reach N-Korea

343
01:35:06,256 --> 01:35:07,951
And?

344
01:35:10,361 --> 01:35:13,626
She got caught
by some fishermen

345
01:35:13,697 --> 01:35:16,257
caught her in a net
while she was swimming

346
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:20,368
She's part of the RAA

347
01:35:20,437 --> 01:35:21,699
What?

348
01:35:21,772 --> 01:35:23,637
I mean, she was

349
01:35:25,676 --> 01:35:29,806
Go to Intelligence
and bring a few of them

350
01:35:29,913 --> 01:35:31,938
The problem is

351
01:35:32,082 --> 01:35:37,349
She was the only
member of RAA

352
01:36:14,725 --> 01:36:17,751
Make way please
excuse me

353
01:36:21,031 --> 01:36:25,468
Excuse me

354
01:36:41,752 --> 01:36:44,880
we're
coming through

355
01:37:09,847 --> 01:37:12,543
I'm sorry
you can't ride here

356
01:37:24,928 --> 01:37:29,262
Its C-3
They found some of

357
01:37:29,366 --> 01:37:32,301
Cha Youngmi's flyers
at a crime scene

358
01:37:33,403 --> 01:37:35,166
What scene?

359
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:38,203
Three people
were murdered

360
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:06,883
yes

361
01:41:07,117 --> 01:41:11,577
The organ dealers
are dead!

362
01:41:11,688 --> 01:41:13,053
But
their sides

363
01:41:13,123 --> 01:41:17,219
are cut open
You know

364
01:41:17,361 --> 01:41:19,852
He took
the kidneys!

365
01:41:21,298 --> 01:41:22,629
President Park

366
01:41:22,699 --> 01:41:25,031
he seems like
a real psycho

367
01:41:25,135 --> 01:41:29,128
Killed three people
He isn't human

368
01:41:29,272 --> 01:41:31,263
Give this up now

369
01:41:31,575 --> 01:41:33,736
I'll return
all your money

370
01:48:53,149 --> 01:48:59,520
I know
you're a good guy

371
01:49:04,527 --> 01:49:07,155
But you know

372
01:49:11,734 --> 01:49:16,137
why I have to
kill you?

373
01:49:18,007 --> 01:49:20,669
Understand?

374
01:49:21,644 --> 01:49:25,546
Huh?
you know?

375
01:51:35,645 --> 01:51:39,877
-Hello?
-yeh, Inchon Hospital

376
01:51:39,949 --> 01:51:43,112
is there
boy's father?

377
01:51:43,353 --> 01:51:49,622
He died
just now at 12:20

378
01:51:49,726 --> 01:51:53,218
The mortuary's
on floor B2

379
01:51:53,329 --> 01:51:54,921
You've got
the wrong number

380
01:51:55,031 --> 01:51:55,861
What?

381
01:56:02,578 --> 01:56:04,409
Mister

382
01:56:06,983 --> 01:56:09,975
If anything
happens to me

383
01:56:10,786 --> 01:56:15,052
my organization
is a terrorist group

384
01:56:16,025 --> 01:56:18,255
They'll kill you

385
01:56:18,728 --> 01:56:22,425
100% 
For sure

386
01:56:24,166 --> 01:56:27,260
I gave them
your picture
