00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,341
(quietly) Mum? Mum?

4
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,473
Mum?

5
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,225
Mum?

6
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,145
Mum?

7
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,362
Mum?

8
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,982
Mum? Mum?

00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,740
Mum?

10
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,200
You all right?

11
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,380
I was just thinking about Poppy.

12
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,672
She was me only friend.

13
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,426
Aw, Mum. I'm your friend.

14
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:57,599
You're not a friend.
You're just a relative.

15
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,106
I'm 34 years old!

16
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,731
And I've found someone who likes me,
and I like him,

17
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,611
and I'm going on holiday with him.

18
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,940
You're running away

19
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,076
from your... guilt!

20
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,114
Don't do that with Poppy's lead, Mum.

21
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,638
<i>(Carol)
You've always had lovely hair, Tina.</i>

22
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,136
<i>(Tina) It is quite thick, isn't it?</i>

23
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,637
<i>(Carol) Yes.</i>

24
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:41,473
<i>I've always admired your hair
being thick, because mine's so thin.</i>

25
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:48,651
<i>I think you might have a few split ends.
Better watch that.</i>

26
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,822
- Any more bags you want taking?
- (Tina) Well,

27
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,821
- I might want a couple more towels.
- (Chris) No, not in there.

28
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,615
(Chris) You didn't tell me
your mum was an artist.

29
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,829
<i>(Tina) What?</i>

30
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,664
Look at these.

31
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,462
(whispers) Chris, don't go in there.

32
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,589
- (mumbles) Why not?
- Come out. Chris.

33
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,337
What's going on?

34
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,919
(Chris) I'm just admiring
your artwork, Carol. It's fantastic.

35
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,130
I don't want anyone in my room.

36
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,930
Chris was just saying how talented
he thinks you are, Mum.

37
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,226
(Carol) It's my private sanctum.
I don't want anybody looking.

38
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,850
Well, no one's looking
in your sanctum, Mum.

39
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,057
So I'll just... Shall I leave you, then,
to look at your brushes?

40
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,734
I'll just sit for a few minutes, yes.

41
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,187
- Okay.
- I could do with a cup of tea.

42
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,443
- I'll get you one, Mum.
- That'd be nice.

43
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,196
- I'm shutting the door now.
- That's okay.

44
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,697
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,779
Okay, Mum, bye.

46
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,284
Bye.

47
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,574
- All right?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,079
Good.

49
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,754
(both chuckling)

50
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,298
- I've always wanted a boy in my bed.
- Come on.

51
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,000
<i>- Have you?
- Yeah. I was never allowed.</i>

52
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,677
I've always wanted to be in this bed.

53
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,972
- This is Jonty.
- Oh, he's putting me off.

54
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,595
(Tina laughing)

55
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,100
- (Chris) I like this room.
- Do you?

56
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,935
- Mmm.
- I hate it.

57
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,358
Why?

58
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,653
<i>(Tina) Well, I like the bits.</i>

59
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,363
(Chris) Makes me think of you
when you were a kid.

60
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,072
<i>(Tina) At the same time, if it was
all destroyed, I'd be quite happy.</i>

61
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,122
(Chris) So what were you like
when you were a little kid, then?

62
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,872
<i>(Tina) Unhappy.
(Chris) You didn't like school?</i>

63
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,828
- (Tina exhales)
- I know, nor me.

64
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,789
What were you like at school, Chris?

65
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,716
I wasn't like anything.
I was, like, invisible.

66
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,419
<i>(Tina) What about you being ginger?</i>

67
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,596
<i>(Chris) Well, that's a problem, yeah.</i>

68
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,469
<i>(Tina) That's not invisible, is it?</i>

69
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,846
<i>(Chris) No, but I wanted to be.</i>

70
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,892
Oh, I don't think it's safe
going off with him.

71
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,814
It is safe!

72
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:52,770
I know about all kinds of people who've
had very bad experiences in caravans.

73
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,275
Like who?

74
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,652
Well, Louise.

75
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,825
<i>She fell out of it, didn't she?</i>

76
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,530
<i>Oh, I don't know. I mean, you've gone
far too fast with him far too soon.</i>

77
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,330
<i>You hardly know him.</i>

78
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,499
<i>(Tina) You look like you...
you don't trust him.</i>

79
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,080
<i>(Carol) I don't.</i>

80
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,709
<i>(Tina) Just let him get on with it.</i>

81
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,375
(Carol) Well, I'd like to know
what he's getting on with.

82
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,507
- Well, he's packing.
- How much of our stuff has he got?

83
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,676
Mum, he hasn't got any of your stuff.
Don't be silly.

84
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,936
<i>(Chris) All right, uh, toothbrush?
(Tina) Yeah.</i>

85
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,562
<i>- And a sponge?
- Yeah.</i>

86
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,735
- Umbrella?
- Yes.

87
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,402
- Uh, wash bag?
- Yes.

88
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,862
- What's that? What's that?
- Potpourri.

89
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,160
And what are you bringing that for?
We don't need potpourri.

90
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,660
I don't think I could cope
without potpourri, Chris.

91
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,117
You're gonna have a woman's touch
on this holiday, Chris.

92
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,746
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,328
(chuckles) Oh, Chris.
Don't look at my bum.

94
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,505
<i>- I'm not looking at your bum.
- You are.</i>

95
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,503

Milady.

98
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,935
- Bye, Mum.
- You'll be back.

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,933
I will, Mum, in a week.

100
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,308
Okay, well, we'll see you then, Carol.

101
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,189
I'll bring her back safe,
don't you worry.

102
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,317
Hey, I understand
you collect snow globes.

103
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,899
I don't like you.

104
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,778
Okay, well, see you, then.

106
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,161
Show me your world, Chris.

107
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,334
Well, I thought we'd start
with Crich Tram Museum.

108
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,878
- Great.
- Murderer.

109
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,082
It was an accident, Mum.

110
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,586
So were you.

111
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,501
(Chris) Don't listen to her.

Ah, sharpens the mind.

So, ladies and gentlemen,
this is, um,

00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,799
one of about 1,200 tram cars
of this type, of type E1,

built, um, by London County Council

Out of those 1,200 trams,
only two have survived.

the key to personal opportunity.

It's why I favour the Abbey Oxford
as a caravan.

141
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,904
So I'm the captain of me own fate.

142
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,536
Excuse me, you dropped your wrapper.

143
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,205
Your wrapper.

144
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,380
I said, you dropped your wrapper.

You see that? Do you see that?

146
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,416
(Chris sighs) You just
don't expect to see that, do you?

147
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,415
No. He was a pig, Chris.

148
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,124
He was a pig in clothes.
I don't want this to ruin our holiday.

something like that?

- Yeah, you don't expect it.
- Behaving like that in front of...

153
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,345

And we're in a place where there's...
It's a bloody heritage place.

- I know. Shh. I know.
- I just cannot...

156
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,766
Maybe you'll feel better
if you have a scone.

157
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,181
- No. No.
- Do you want a scone?

158
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,108
No! They've not been preserved
for hundreds of years

159
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,940
- so that wankers like that...
- Shh. Shh.

160
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,103
...can use them like a bloody toilet!

Stop telling me to shush.
It's putting me on edge.

163

your mother's on the phone.</i>

<i>(Tina) I'm gonna have to go
and see what's wrong.</i>

165
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,453
Yeah.

166
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,330
Wait here, won't you?

167
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,196
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy
the museum if you're in this state.

168
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,031
I'll have to come home, then.

169
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,411
Chris is up there, he's looking at me.
I don't...

170
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,989
Well, no! I'm gonna have...

171
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,042
Well, I'm gonna have to come back, Mum,
'cause I can't leave you in this state.

172
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,009
- Hey, what's up? Oh, come on, what's up?
-(sobbing)

173
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,092
Hey. What's happened?

174
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,223
- What'd she say?
-(sobbing) We have to go home.

175
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,767
Why? What, because of her?

176
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,400
Blue John mines tomorrow. Pencil Museum.

177
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,190
I know how much you wanted to see that.

178
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,903
Got some vouchers as well.
Two-for-one restaurant deal.

179
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,786
They expire in a week.
It's now or never.

(inaudible)

184
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,269
He just stepped out, Chris,
and it wasn't your fault.

185
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,437
(Chris sighs deeply)

186
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,280
Maybe you're right.

187
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:20,948
(voice trembling) I just feel so
devastated for his family, you know?

188
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,623
- Maybe your mother was right.
- About what?

189
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,333
About everything!

190
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,085
About everything.

191
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,749
- Chris...
- He's ruined the Tram Museum for me now.

192
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,144
Mint me.

193
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,772
What?

194
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,480
You heard me. Mint me.

195

(Chris) Um, he's going for Dingley Dell.

206

Chris, I want Dingley Dell.

207

I'm gonna get this bloody Dingley Dell.

- Can't we go around it?
- Just hold on, I'm gonna do it.

- We'll make it.

- Go that way.
- I will, just wait there, wait...

- Just go around it.
- Okay! Hold on.

Oh, Chris! Don't look at them, Chris.

-Y es.</i>

Plug that into that
little hole over there. Right?

220
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,425
Why?

221
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,724
You don't need to know why. Just do it.

222

- Okay?
- The little hole.

223
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,769
The little hole.

224
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,574
Turn it round so that fits
in that little bit there.

- No, I wanna do it.

-(Chris) There we go.

229
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,704
- I did it. (chuckles)
- Brilliant.

230
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,422
I'll just sort that out.

231
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,763
Chris?

232
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,633
What?

233
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,555
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?

234
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,553
Yeah, I suppose it is, yeah.

235
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,439
I didn't think it would kill him,
did you, Chris?

236
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,895
Well, there's loads of stuff
under a caravan that'll kill you.

237
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,894
I'll have nightmares
about that tonight now.

238
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,982
Oh, you're not gonna go under a caravan,
are you?

239
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,655
You're gonna be in the driving seat.

240
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,736
In the car, with me.

241
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,782
Well, not driving.
I mean, in the passenger seat.

242
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,746
I'll do the driving.

243
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,087
(Chris) Bit of a mess, actually.

244
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,007
There we go, good as new.

245
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,261
(Chris) This is exactly
how I imagined it.

246
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,769
There's no one sticking their nose in.

247
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,346
No one penetrating the mind.

248

<i>(sighing) I'll have to sort
all of this out all again.</i>

249
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,312
(Chris) Take the noble English oak,
Old Knobbley.

250
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,940
That won't stab you in the back
or belittle your five-year plan.

251
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,867
I mean, where am I supposed to put that?

252
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,531
- That tree won't...
- There isn't anywhere.

253
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,495
- There's just no surfaces.
-...steal things that belong to you

254
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,203
and put them in another place
just to piss you off.

255
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,661
That tree won't involve itself
in low-level bullying

256
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,293
that means you have to leave work.

257
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,717
I've got a confession to make.

258
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,337
Chris. Not a wheat intolerance?

259
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,679
No. It's, uh, it's not just
an erotic odyssey we're on.

260
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,685
(disappointed) Isn't it?

261
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,222
Well, it is.
I mean, that's a big part of it, but...

262
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,390
(inhales) Er, I'm writing a book.

263
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,983
- Are you?
- Yeah.

264
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,357
I thought I'd just have
a bit of a sabbatical.

265
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,069
You know, a bit of time off work
and, you know, find my voice.

266
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,492
But, uh, I've had a bit of a problem
with writer's block.

267
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,366
You know, been...
creative constipation.

268
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,076
I hooked up with you at capoeira

269
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,076
and I realised you were exactly
what I needed. You know, a muse.

270
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,043
- Am I your muse?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,247
- Chris!
- How do you feel about that?

272
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,919
I've never been a muse before.

273
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,637
No? I've never had a muse before.
It's great. Yeah.

274
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,679
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

275
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,928
- What's the book about?
-(drums playing faintly)

276
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:40,514
<i>Just sort of making inroads into
my own mind and taking notes as I go.</i>

277

Do you know what I mean? It's fantastic.

278
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,150
I'm really pleased with
what I've come up with so far.

281
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,524
(Chris) Yeah, we have, thanks.
Yeah, lovely spot.

282
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,029
- Not bad, is it?
- Yeah.

283
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,283
Just doing my rounds.
Sorry about the racket.

284
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,205
-(Chris) Yeah.
- Festival in the yurt field.

285
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,204
-(Chris) Who are they?
- Uh, well, they're shaman.

286
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,753
They're sort of priests. Shamans.
They're from Portsmouth, you know.

287
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,706
- Uh-huh.
-It's just a little festival.

288
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,382
Keeps them all happy, doesn't it?
You know.

289
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,175
And how long are they
gonna be drumming for?

290
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,219
Well, just this evening.

291
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,047
- Okay?
- Thanks a lot, mate.

292
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,348
- All the best.
- Yeah.

293
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,142
- Bye.
- Pleasure.

294

(disdainfully) Yurts.

296
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,665
(Chris) There's a stream
down here somewhere.

297
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,497
I need some proper boots, Chris.

298
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,332
(Chris) Yeah,
brought my last girlfriend.

299
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,837
Oh.

300
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,056
Yeah, I think this was it.

301
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,218
This is a ditch, Chris.

302

00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,869
Sorry?

00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,987
- There's something in me, Tina.
- I'll help you squeeze it out.

462
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,572
<i>(Chris) Choose anything you like, love.
(Tina) Anything?</i>

463
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,408
(Chris) Anything you like,
as long as it's under 10 quid.

464
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,906
How much is that?

465
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,040
-60 quid.
- No, you can't have that.

466
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,746
I need walking boots, don't I?

467
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,248
Well, we'll get
the walking boots as well.

468
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,581
<i>(woman) You want a good tread.</i>

469
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,086
Okay-

470
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,883
- You heard about the man, didn't you?
- No.

471
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,345
He slipped on the crag
and went off the cliff yesterday.

472
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,393
- Did you not hear about that?
- No! Did he hurt himself?

473
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,929
Head smashed like a pumpkin.

474
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,853
That's why I'd never have
stone flooring.

475
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,106
Although I do love
that French farmhouse look.

476
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,607
Yeah, it's terrible, isn't it,

477
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,780
when people don't have respect
for the power of nature?

478
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,448
Can't find his dog.

479
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,744
Well, it probably committed suicide.
Dogs will do that.

480
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,452
Tina, why don't you try these?
Look. Give them a go.

481
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,539
-(chuckles) Oh, Chris.
- Eh? Why not?

482
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,234
(birds squawking)

483
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,169
<i>(Tina) I've got some sad news.
It's about your father.</i>

484
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,670
He's dead.

485
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,641
(whimpering softly)

486
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,437
Hey. Don't dwell on it.

487
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,988
- How'd it go?
- I had a word.

488
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,986
How'd he take it?

489
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,988
Well, he's all right.
He's a bit shaken but...

490
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,570
- Is he?
- Come on. Come on.

491
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,704
This was a 13th-century ruin
founded by monks. (chuckles)

492
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:22,580
Yeah, maybe I should do
an abbot detective story or something.

493
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,423
What do you think
happened to Ian, Chris?

494
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,210
- Chris?
- Huh?

495
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,840
Chris.

496
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,551
- What do you think happened to Ian?
- What?

497
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,267
(camera clicking)

498
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,849
Do you think Banjo
had something to do with it?

499
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,768
Well, yeah, he's probably capable.
He's an animal, isn't he?

500
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,980
Do you think he might have pushed him?
'Cause he was an abused dog.

501
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,026
There might be, uh, blood
on the paws of that dog,

502
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,329
but it's smug complacency
that killed Ian, I tell you that.

503
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,038
Janice looked frigid as well,
didn't she?

504
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,332
(stone grinding)

505
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,632
Chris, look, it's coming out.

506
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,213
(bell tolling)

507
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,517
(Chris) I'm a monk.

508
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,186
<i>(man) Well, who's this little chap?
Let's have a look.</i>

509
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,686
Oh, POPPY-

510
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:27,736
- Oh, you're sweet, aren't you?
-(chuckles)

511
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,404
This is Barney.
Barney, come and say hello.

512

<i>(Tina) Barney.
(woman) Come and say hello.</i>

514
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:36,946
- Aw! They love each other. Don't they?
-(woman) Well, they're a bit shy.

515
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,703
Yeah, well, often it's like that
when it's love at first sight.

516
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,375
-Isn't it, Chris?
- What?

517
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,044
-It's like you and me when we met.
-(man) They're not fighting, anyway.

518
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,669
-(Tina) Speechless. Yeah, speechless.
- Speechless, yeah.

519
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,426
Look at that graffiti there.
"Rob loves Kerry."

520
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,062
My husband's researching for his book.

521
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,560
Oh, really?

522
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,983
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I am, yeah.

523
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,685
Actually, it's his third.

524
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,896
You've certainly picked
an interesting spot.

526

539
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,336
- Get off!
- What did I do?

540
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,084
Not you. Bloody Banjo.

541

Poppy!

00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,629
He's a fuckin' pervert.

543

Get in there. Get in there.
Go on, Banjo. Get in the bloody car.

00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,272
I can fly, Chris.

- Whoo!
-Vvhooamhool

551

Chris? Which button do I press?

Oh, it's okay, I've done it.

Yeah, Poppy!

Chris, there's quite
a nice one of you here.

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

Whoo! (chuckles)

557
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,006
Chris, these are a bit saucy,
these ones.

558

This is not my vagina!

559

This is not my vagina!

560

I don't know what you mean.

561
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,537
Janice doesn't look
very frigid to me, Chris!

562
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,492
In fact,
she looks like a very happy girl.

563

No, that's...

564
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,671
No wonder, when you look at Ian.

565
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,920
That's not Ian. That's me, that.

566

- Were you shagging Ian?

568
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,883
- Don't be stupid.
- Were you shagging both of them?

569
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,967
- Ah, come on.
- Are you gay?

570
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,430
- What? You know I'm not gay.
- Why are they at a wedding?

571
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,559
What wedding?

572
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,018
(sobs) Did you go to a wedding
with Ian and Janice, Chris?

- I didn't.
- Was... (sobbing)

I wouldn't look. Don't.

00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,614
Did you kill Ian?

578
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,460
Yeah. Well, I mean...

579
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,713
Why'd you do that?

580
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,133
I didn't mean to.
It was just an accident.

581
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,220
And that just happened.

582
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,389
Can't do things like that.

583
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,222
It's gonna ruin the holiday.

584

00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,238
(car driving away)

617
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,364
Oh, I think I've got a Iey line
running through me head. (chuckles)

618
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,704
(voice breaking) I thought you'd gone.

619
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,194
Chris, Poppy's stopping.

620
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,069
Poppy's stopping, Chris.

621
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,196
Yeah, good girl.

622
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,115
Aw! You having a little poo? Well done.

623
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,710
Excuse me.
You are going to pick that up?

624
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,370
Well, I haven't, I've... Chris?

625
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,757
This is a site of natural beauty
and geographical interest.

626
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,252
I think you need to sort that out.

627
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,888
- I didn't do that.
- Uh, you need to pick it up.

628
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,137
- I can't... Well, I can't.
- Why? Why can't you?

629
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,473
Well, I haven't got the proper things
to do it with.

630
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,222
Why didn't you bring the proper things
with you if you're out with your dog?

631
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,981
Well, I did bring the proper things...

632
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,100
(sobs)
...but I'm not having a very good day.

633
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,610
-(Chris) Good morning.
- Chris.

634
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,613
- Good morning.
- He's told me I've got to pick that up

635
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,944
-with my fingers.
-well, a dog does a shit.

636
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,817
You know, you can't do much
about that, mate.

637
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,660
You can pick it up
and you take it away with you.

638
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,280
Well, I would have the bags,
but they're in the bloody car

639
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:02,326
that you've left, drunk,
outside some pub that we can't...

640
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,669
- We don't even know where the pub is.
- Tina, I know where the car is.

641
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,332
- No, you don't.
- I do. I know where it is.

642
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,627
- We are lost, Chris! Lost!
- I know where it is.

643
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,466
- I know... Look, Tina.
- You don't.

644
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,843
Look, I'm sorry, but if you don't
pick up this excrement immediately,

645
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,633
then I'm gonna have to inform
the National Trust.

646
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,093
Actually, do you know what?
I don't think you are sorry, mate.

647
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,804
I don't think you're sorry, either.

648
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,468
- Did he touch you?
- What?

649
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,805
- Don't know. Wasn't concentrating.
- Have a think.

650
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,693
Can you remember everything?

651
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,274
Uh, yes. Yes, he did touch me.

652
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,486
- Oh... (stammers) This is preposterous!
- What else did he do?

653
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,119
-(softly) He, urn...
- Details.

654
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:42,783
(whispering) ...tried to put
Poppy's balls in his mouth.

655
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,494
- Did you go to a private school?
- That is totally irrelevant, but yes.

656
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,879
Yeah, I thought so. It's the tone.
It's the entitlement you got...

657
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,373
I'm entitled to walk
in the countryside...

658
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,045
- Yeah, you're superior.
-...without having to encounter

659
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,668
-dog excrement.
- You're not entitled

660
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,882
-to be a bloody bully, mate...
- Put your stick down, for starters.

661
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,676
-...bullying my girlfriend.
- Leave the turd where it is.

662
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,181
I will point this stick at you!

663
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,683
They still think
it's their country, don't they?

You know, 300 years ago

680
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,735
his ancestor would have strode
down a path just like this, you know,

681
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,530
and he'd have seen some common strumpet

and watched him.

684

'Cause I'd have been a serf and he'd
have been the bloody lord of the manor.

Oh, don't thank me,
thank the democratic process.

689

Never thought about murdering
innocent people like that before.

- Get your notebook out.

697

Come on, write down your ideas.

698
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,926
Just write down what's happened and
all your feelings and stuff like that.

- Yeah?
- Mmm!

700

- All right.
- Go on, get it down.

701

Oh, my God, Chris.

702

703
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,647
I'm musing right now. Do you feel it?

My God, I feel amazing.

(sighs) Christ, that was hard.

00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,828
I don't think I'll get
anything more out today.

707

I think you've found your oeuvre, Chris.

You're not gonna tell, are you?

709
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,332
No.

710
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,349
What are you looking at me
like that for?

711

Right, yeah, yeah. Nice one. Yeah.

Oh, they're all the same.

he'll want the opposite.

But now I'm not sure.

Never.

1080
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,759
He can be very controlling.

1081
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,758
- Really? Right. I...
- Very domineering.

1082
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:39,725
- Well, he's... Yeah.
- But you're not like that, are you?

1083
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:43,308
No, no. Me, I'm a pretty
easy-going guy really, yeah.

1084
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,688
Haven't you got lovely eyelashes?

1085
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,611
- Have I?
- Mmm.

1086
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,530
- Thanks very much. Yeah.
-(whispering) Kiss me.

1087
01:16:53,776 --> 01:16:55,744
Martin, did you hear me?

1088
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,203
- Kiss me, Martin.
- Um...

1089
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,875
Just quickly before he comes back.

1090
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,541
- All right, mate?
- All right?

1091
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,089
- What?
- Cheers.

1092
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,011
- Cheers, yeah.
- Cheers. Here's to you.

1093
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:18,388
What?

1094
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:23,188
Martin just said
some filthy things to me, Chris.

1095
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,275
Yeah? Well, do tell. (chuckles)

1096
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,274
He said I was a dirty, slutty bitch.

1097
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,402
And he wanted to fuck me.

1098
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,702
And he said he wanted to shit
in my mouth and in my underwear,

1099
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:42,826
<i>and he said he wanted to shit in my hand
and make me use it as a brown lipstick.</i>

(stammering) Mate, I... I...

1101
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,084
You know,
if Martin really said these things,

1102
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:55,968
then I've got no objection, in theory.

1103
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,431
- In theory?
- Yeah.

1104
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,264
What about practice, Chris?

1105
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,103
- Right. Um...
- Chris.

1106
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:15,366
Um, I'm gonna go to bed now, all right?
I'm... (exhales)

1107
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,614
Yeah, it's probably best,
actually, mate. Yeah, yeah.

1108
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,616
Yeah, it's been a long day.
Yeah, yeah, so I'll just...

1109
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,368
Yeah, I think we're probably
gonna turn in, too. So...

1110
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,701
Yeah, can I just...
Yeah, can I just, uh...

1111
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,286
Will you let Martin out, please?

1112
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,923
Right, cheers then, yeah.
See you in the morning.

(door closes)

1114
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:40,515
Why are you behaving
like that in front of Martin?!

1115
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:43,014
Why can't I have a friend?
You've got that bloody dog, Banjo!

1116
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:46,347
- POPPY!
-It's called Banjo!

,(squealing) poppy,
-Banjo! '

1118
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:51,402
Just stop saying that
in front of the dog.

1119
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,104
You're giving him an identity crisis.

1120
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:57,237
How is he gonna have an identity crisis,
Chris, when he's a stupid fucking dog?

1121
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,533
(whimpers)

You are a fucking liability, you are.

You're a liability.
You're just like your mother.
