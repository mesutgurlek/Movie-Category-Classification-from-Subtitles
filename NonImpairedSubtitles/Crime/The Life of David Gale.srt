He's the local DeathWatch

to end with riots and arrests.

1073
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,664
DeathWatch fired him because
he punched somebody at a rally.

But Constance kept him in
the organization. He adored her.

He testified against me.

- Against you?
- He testified about the drinking.

So good ol' Dusty starts to think
that an erroneous execution...

is a lot more politically useful
than a last-minute save.

So he'll release the whole tape

Death was pronounced at 6:12 this
evening at the prison in Huntsville.

1459
01:57:53,499 --> 01:57:55,990
<i>Since none of the victim's relatives</i>

01:58:38,177 --> 01:58:42,614

<i>Last night,</i> NEWS Magazine

1462
01:58:42,682 --> 01:58:45,242
<i>a video obtained</i>
<i>by reporter Bitsey Bloom.</i>

1463
01:58:45,318 --> 01:58:48,913
- The footage appears to show...
- Constance Harraway committing suicide.

1464
01:58:48,988 --> 01:58:52,788
Bloom reports that she received
the tape Friday morning in
a motel in Huntsville...

1465
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:56,192
<i>where she was staying while</i>
<i>conducting Gale's last interview.</i>

1466
01:59:01,367 --> 01:59:04,131
<i>Apparently, the tape has</i>
<i>been in the possession...</i>

1467
01:59:04,203 --> 01:59:08,003
<i>of former DeathWatch employee</i>
<i>Dustin Emil Wright.</i>

1468
01:59:10,476 --> 01:59:13,274
As you can see, police have been
in and out of his cabin all morning...

1469
01:59:13,346 --> 01:59:15,576
<i>looking for clues</i>
<i>to his whereabouts.</i>

1470
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:19,948
- Since his 1994 conviction...
- On death row awaiting execution.

1471
01:59:20,019 --> 01:59:24,217
Blacks and Latinos are
five times more likely to face
the death penalty than whites.

to stop the death penalty.

1473
01:59:26,726 --> 01:59:29,752
- It's all there?
- Actively seeking a Dustin Wright.

1474
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:33,959
- A Dustin Wright.
- It appears Wright
withheld a tape to make...

1475
01:59:34,033 --> 01:59:37,992
a political point
about the potential for error
in capital punishment cases.

Dana, what
everyone here is asking...

1478
01:59:43,676 --> 01:59:46,008
It's a terrible tragedy,
and there will be a full investigation.

01:59:46,078 --> 01:59:49,741
<i>And I assure you this man</i>
<i>Dusty Wright will be caught</i>
<i>and shown swift justice.</i>

1480
01:59:49,815 --> 01:59:53,182
- Justice for Christ's sake!
<i>- The people of Texas are not deterred.</i>

1481
01:59:53,252 --> 01:59:56,312
We're still solidly behind
the death penalty because it works.

1482
01:59:56,389 --> 02:00:00,325
<i>The system cannot be blamed</i>
<i>for the acts of one deranged</i>

The man who became
an unwitting martyr...
