1
00:00:51,301 --> 00:01:05,189
You came here to kill me.

2
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,750
From precinct 80: the suspect Niedermann
should be regarded as extremely dangerous.

3
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,753
Exercise extreme caution.

4
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:14,174
All patrols acknowledge.
81 -20, over.

5
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,285
81-20, are you receiving?
Over.

6
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,705
Eight - one - two - zero.
Are you receiving? Over.

7
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,153
Her name is Lisbeth Salander.

8
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,989
She is 27 years old.

9
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,119
In this edition of Millennium we reveal...

10
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,749
...how Swedish government officials
have conspired against her...

11
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,419
...to cover up a criminally insane murderer:

12
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,969
Alexander Zalachenko, a turncoat GRU agent
from the Soviet Union.

13
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:26,265
In Sweden he has committed serious crimes:

14
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:31,895
arms smuggling, drug dealing,
money laundering, assault.

15
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:37,234
Alexander Zalachenko is
Lisbeth Salander's father.

16
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:42,739
This edition of Millennium
tells her side of the story.

17
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,658
Hello.

18
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,411
Can you open your eyes?

19
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:53,250
My name is Anders Jonasson.
I am your doctor.

20
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,298
You are at the Sahlgrenska
hospital in Göteborg.

21
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,554
Can you count to ten?

22
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,685
One, two, three...

23
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,404
That's okay.

24
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,950
My article is about 40 to 50 pages long.

25
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,204
It will contain extracts from
Björck's investigation...

26
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,957
...to make it stronger, more convincing.

27
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,586
What images have we got?
- Not much.

28
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:42,591
We can get pictures of Gunnar Björck,
Teleborian and Zalachenko.

29
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,970
And some of St. Stephen's Hospital.
- Yes, and of Lisbeth.

30
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,224
It sounds like at least 75 pages.
- It may be more. It will be good.

31
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:56,188
Can we find more names?
- No, we must focus on what we have.

32
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,442
Let's hope that the publication
brings out other names.

33
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,819
That will be only a matter of time,
and then...

34
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,952
Let's get to work now.

35
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:17,125
Breaking news: police have mobilised extra forces
after the murder near Gosseberga this morning.

36
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,587
A massive manhunt is being undertaken
for the suspect.

37
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,507
Police have identified him...

38
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,885
...as Ronald Niedermann, a 35 year old German.

39
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:31,890
According to police he is armed
and very dangerous.

40
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,897
I am looking for Fredrik Clinton.
- Who shall I say is calling?

41
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,275
Evert Gullberg, an old colleague.

42
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,529
Dad is sleeping, but come inside please.

43
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:53,745
Zalachenko will do what is best for himself,
whatever the consequences.

44
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,039
It is also about my reputation.

45
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,545
We cannot risk him talking.

46
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,049
We need to silence him at any cost.

47
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,302
We agree. Like we usually do.

48
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,014
You can see what condition I am in.

49
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,895
Fredrik, we need you.
One last time.

50
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,189
I can't.

51
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,650
Every other day I stay five hours...

52
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:29,030
...at the hospital for haemodialysis.

53
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,160
I will die soon!

54
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,829
I cannot get a new kidney.

55
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,167
That's how it is, my friend.

56
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,469
Thank you, my dear.
- They are freshly baked.

57
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,851
I did not know you had a daughter.

58
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,354
No...

59
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,983
We don't know much about
each other's private lives.

60
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,363
Although we have worked together...

61
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,994
...oh yes, more than 35 years.

62
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,500
What about Lisbeth Salander?

63
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:25,378
The prosecution process has already started.
What will we do with her?

64
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,810
Hello Lisbeth.

65
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,939
How's it going?

66
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,195
Do you remember me?
Anders Jonasson is my name.

67
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,534
I understand if you're tired.

68
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,787
You were shot in the head.

69
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,207
We managed to remove the bullet.

70
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,711
It has not damaged any vital areas,
as far as we know.

71
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,423
You also had gunshot wounds in
your right shoulder and left hip.

72
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,218
But it will heal nicely.

73
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:17,722
What about brain damage?

74
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:23,103
Brain injuries are complex and sometimes
difficult to detect. Don't worry.

75
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,236
The police want to talk with you.

76
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,489
But I said no
because of your condition

77
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,494
They're bound to return, but right
now I will not let them see you.

78
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,627
Did Zalachenko survive?

79
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,214
He has been patched up and is stable.

80
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:54,259
But he is rather seriously injured.

81
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,017
Shit.

82
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,395
I was wondering when you would show up.

83
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,649
We have discussed how we can help you.

84
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,988
But to develop a strategy,
we must first hear your version.

85
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:23,163
What should the strategy look like?

86
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,874
We will find a way out together.

87
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,170
However, it will be hard to keep
you out of prison completely.

88
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,173
No shit?

89
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:38,011
We will help you with a lawyer
and everything else you need.

90
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,683
But you must cooperate
and give us some guarantees.

91
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:47,937
Niedermann...
Niedermann is the scapegoat.

92
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,565
It was he who shot Lisbeth.

93
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:56,446
There are serious allegations against you
which can be difficult to discount.

94
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,698
That's your problem...

95
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,534
...it's entirely your problem.

96
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,162
If you do not solve it...

97
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,332
...I will contact the press.

98
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:11,336
I have names, dates, events...
everything.

99
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,215
I can crush all of you completely.

100
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,345
I am a survivor,
you ought to know that by now.

101
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,599
Zalachenko, you do not understand...
- It is you who doesn't understand!

102
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,856
This conversation is over.

103
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,201
Just one more thing.

104
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,080
Lisbeth...

105
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,960
What is wrong with her?
- She has to be put out of the way, understood?

106
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,591
Good. Good...

107
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,140
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

108
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:09,018
My sister has arrived.
We'll talk later.

109
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,896
Is there no one at home?
- No.

110
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,405
However, Micke, she tried
to beat her father to death with an axe.

111
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,284
And that's attempted murder.

112
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,665
Or self-defence.

113
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,503
But she has been arrested for the attempted
murder of Zalachenko, right?

114
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,762
Therefore she will need a criminal lawyer.

115
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,891
Your practice is women's rights.

116
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:53,062
Lisbeth and her mother were exposed
to mistreatment and abuse...

117
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:58,693
...by Zalachenko and by the authorities.
It started long before Gosseberga.

118
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,197
Here are documents that confirm it.

119
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:15,460
A copy of the investigation, consolidated by
an agent of the Security Service: Gunnar Björck.

120
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:22,550
It proves how illegal it was to lock up
a twelve-year-old girl at St. Stephen's...

121
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,845
...and to silence her.

122
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,098
Is this confidential?

123
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:34,479
Just tell them you have it from a journalist
who doesn't want to reveal the origin.

124
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,110
You really want to go to that extreme
for Lisbeth Salander, don't you?

125
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,740
Yes.

126
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:55,435
SJ's X2000 No. 429 from Stockholm
has arrived at platform number 6.

127
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,718
I do not need a lawyer.

128
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,723
You will be accused of the attempted murder
of your father.

129
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,811
Micke thinks that they will try to
lock you away in a mental hospital again...

130
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,981
...so you will need a lawyer.

131
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,071
However, you do have a choice.

132
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:53,493
If you don't want the court to
appoint a public lawyer.

133
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:01,376
Does your silence mean
I should go?

134
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,098
You decide.

135
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,602
Do you have a cigarette?

136
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:25,274
Do you have a nicotine patch?
- Yes, one moment please.

137
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:39,163
I got this copy from Micke.
You know what's in it, don't you?

138
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,295
We will need to talk
with each other a lot.

139
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,924
So, I want you to be completely
honest with me.

140
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,431
Micke told me most of it,
but on some matters he wants you...

141
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,642
...to decide what you want to tell.

142
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,689
I assume you know what he means.

143
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,860
It's something to do with
computers and a DVD.

144
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,914
After everything we've done for you
over the years...

145
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,294
...you are threatening us.
That's a big risk.

146
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:32,008
I am a survivor. I do what I think is
necessary to survive.

147
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:37,555
No, you do it because you are an evil
and wicked man without honour.

148
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,807
Without morality.

149
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:47,023
I came here to give you our message.

150
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,902
We will not help you this time.
So there!

151
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,073
I have no choice.
Don't you understand that?

152
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:59,786
Life has taught me
that there's always a choice.

153
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,708
Idiots.

154
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,420
I crush you.
- You will not do anything.

155
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:17,095
No, lie still. Please!
I'll see what's going on.

156
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,725
Get out!

157
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,978
He has a gun!

158
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,980
What's going on?

159
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,317
Hurry!

160
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:41,452
Wait, I'm coming.
Hold me tightly.

161
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,747
Hold me.

162
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,584
Hold me tightly!

163
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:20,032
He pulled the door, but could
not open it. It was so surreal.

164
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,244
An old man with a gun.

165
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,540
Then I heard the shot
when he killed himself.

166
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,419
Are you sure that he tried
to get hold of Lisbeth?

167
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,173
Yes, it was awful!
I have never been so scared.

168
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,885
Do you want me to come down?
- No.

169
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:45,683
That's not necessary. I will stay with
my friend Vera Åkerlund in Kålltorp.

170
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,021
Press conference at police headquarters at 15.
- I'll have to run.

171
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,690
Look after yourself.
- Yes.

172
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,651
We'll talk later.
- Yes. Bye.

173
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,201
Why didn't the police
set up a better watch?

174
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,787
Absolutely incredible. You wouldn't think
such things could happen here.

175
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:12,668
To go armed into a hospital department and
kill a patient, is really unbelievable!

176
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,003
Well I never! Fredrik?

177
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,382
What in the world's happened?
Come in please, come in.

178
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,890
We're trying to get information
about it now.

179
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,783
What time was it?
Find out.

180
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,119
What the hell?

181
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,497
Do you know what happened?
- Zalachenko has been shot.

182
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,626
It seems Evert Gullberg shot him.

183
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,380
It's chaos down there.
Nothing has been confirmed.

184
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:44,760
Then I will confirm it.
It was Evert who shot him.

185
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,055
Just as planned.

186
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,893
Would you like coffee or something?
- No, not now.

187
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:03,195
What the hell are you talking about?
What plans?

188
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:09,201
Gullberg had only a few months
left to live. He had liver cancer.

189
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,832
He chose to make one last effort for us.

190
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,294
He died with honour.

191
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:25,676
Did you know he would kill Zalachenko?
- Of course.

192
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:31,349
His mission was to silence Zalachenko.

193
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,977
And Salander, like it was planned.

194
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:43,736
Are you as fucking deranged as Gullberg?

195
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:49,992
Watch your tongue, Hallberg.
It was the right decision.

196
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,246
We did what was necessary.
- Necessary? Decision?

197
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:59,627
You and Gullberg had no mandate to
take any decision at all, damn it!

198
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:05,383
Whatever happens: Zalachenko's death
will never be related to us.

199
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:09,595
Nor Evert Gullberg's.

200
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:18,396
Our task is to take decisions...

201
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,524
...that no one else dares.

202
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:27,154
Least of all politicians.
It's that simple.

203
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,492
One more thing...

204
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:37,039
I will return to action.

205
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,043
I will lead the operational activities...

206
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,171
...until this crisis is over.

207
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:50,136
The man who fired the deadly
shot and later took his own life...

208
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:56,016
...has been identified as a
78 year-old pensioner.

209
00:23:56,184 --> 00:24:01,647
He has worked as an accountant
and tax lawyer.

210
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,943
What was his name?
- We can not disclose that right now.

211
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,405
Is there a connection with
Lisbeth Salander?

212
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:14,076
We can firmly deny a possible link
with Lisbeth Salander.

213
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:18,456
It seemed to be a single assailant
who has acted...

214
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,960
...based upon his own paranoid
imagination.

215
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:29,175
He has sent confused messages,
to famous politicians and media...

216
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,679
...with death threats against
Alexander Zalachenko.

217
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:39,435
The Security Service has analyzed it,
but the man was probably mentally ill.

218
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,605
That concludes the police press conference.

219
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:48,235
We return to the incidents at
Sahlgrenska hospital in Göteborg.

220
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,112
No!

221
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,496
Dinner?
- Indeed. Salisbury steak today.

222
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,374
Go ahead.
- Thank you.

223
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:09,757
Lisbeth?

224
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,013
Do you need help?
- No thanks.

225
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,535
Eat up now.

226
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,833
I have a suggestion.

227
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,587
I'm not driving home.
I have booked a room.

228
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,214
Will you stay overnight?

229
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,970
I'm completely exhausted.
I slept poorly on the editorial shift.

230
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,598
Then we just sleep.

231
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,227
It's the fourth time that car
has been there.

232
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,855
Are you sure?
- Yes.

233
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,130
How do you propose to solve this?
- We could not anticipate everything.

234
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:19,386
The guarding of the hospital has been tightened.
- Fucking thanks for that!

235
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:24,141
How the hell are you going to
avoid a trial now?

236
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,602
I do not think we can.

237
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:46,372
Only locked doors and a psychiatric
assessment will confine her.

238
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,668
She must be punished for the
attempted murder of Zalachenko...

239
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,255
...and admitted to secure psychiatric care.

240
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,927
And why not here at St. Stephen's?
- Yes.

241
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,556
For no other reason than for her own sake.

242
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,935
What is the name of the prosecutor?

243
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,440
Ekström.
Not a star, but ambitious.

244
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,276
We can handle him.

245
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:20,823
And what about the copies of Björck's
investigation? - We're collecting them now.

246
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,951
You should be easily capable of that.

247
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,414
You worry too much.

248
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:35,170
And that blond muscleman
who worked for Zalachenko?

249
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:39,341
What happened to him?
- Ronald Niedermann.

250
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,468
He is on the run.

251
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,722
It's just a matter of time.

252
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:51,603
He is Lisbeth Salander's half-brother.

253
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:57,234
Zalachenko had an affair
with a woman in Hamburg.

254
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,456
It sounds like a goddamned Greek tragedy.

255
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:15,502
Zalachenko tried to kill his daughter
with the help of her brother.

256
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,130
Then she returned from the dead...

257
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:21,633
...and put an axe in her father's head.

258
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:34,271
Yes, you might think of it that way.

259
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,358
You will hear from me.

260
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,272
See you again, Vera. Bye.

261
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:29,076
Hey!
Give me back the bag!

262
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,954
Give me my bag!

263
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,834
What the hell...!

264
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,920
Someone on a scooter snatched my bag.

265
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,674
What? How are you then?
Are you okay?

266
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,428
I am fine. But Björck's investigation
was in the bag.

267
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,473
Don't worry. I'll make a copy.

268
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,560
Annika, I'll call you again.

269
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,766
Milton Security, Armanskij.

270
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,520
This is Mikael Blomkvist.
I need your help.

271
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,774
What is the problem?
- Someone has broken into my house.

272
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:47,154
We can help you with that.
Can I call you from my office?

273
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:51,116
Of course, call me from your mobile.
- Okay, bye.

274
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,412
The indictment against Lisbeth Salander
is not complicated.

275
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,416
Even if the plaintiff Zalachenko is dead.

276
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:06,381
However, if everything about Zalachenko comes out,
then it's going to be a very complicated trial.

277
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:12,429
It is about human lives, about our
relationship with a foreign power...

278
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,933
...and the secret contacts of
the Security Service.

279
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:20,187
Yes, I've read the report as
background material.

280
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:24,399
For the prosecution of Lisbeth Salander
the report has little relevance...

281
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,653
...and the Director of Public Prosecutions
has confiscated it.

282
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,656
Nevertheless, parts of it are useful.

283
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:35,452
Especially where Lisbeth Salander tried
to assassinate her father in the past.

284
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,830
I will see if you can have access
to that part.

285
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,668
Yes, it might be beneficial.

286
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,796
Then I will ensure that you get it.

287
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,343
Who is your superior?

288
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,432
My orders come from the very top.

289
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,728
This means that you cannot talk
to anyone about this but me.

290
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,567
I will be very discreet.

291
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,746
Anders Jonasson?
- Yes.

292
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,250
My name is Peter Teleborian.

293
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:28,380
I am a doctor at St. Stephen's
psychiatric clinic in Uppsala.

294
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,133
I need to talk to you.

295
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:35,637
It is about one of your patients,
Lisbeth Salander.

296
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:40,350
I see...
- Well... okay.

297
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:48,233
I have been dealing with her
since she was twelve years old...

298
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:52,529
...and I have a very good understanding
of her clinical picture.

299
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,284
What does it look like?
- Lisbeth is seriously mentally disturbed.

300
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:03,040
She has overt delusions
with paranoid and schizophrenic features.

301
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:08,545
And like all sociopaths
she completely lacks empathy.

302
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,673
To put it simply.

303
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:17,596
I perceive her as a closed person,
but not as a paranoid sociopath.

304
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,683
She is extremely manipulative,
which is part of the disease picture.

305
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,729
She shows what she thinks you want to see.

306
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,484
As you will understand, I feel great
concern about her mental condition.

307
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,444
Yes, I understand.

308
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:38,200
I'll have to see her to assess
her condition before the trial.

309
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,828
I cannot help you with that.

310
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,374
I am responsible for Lisbeth.

311
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:51,463
She is not strong enough to
meet anyone other than her lawyer.

312
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:56,259
I have been instructed by the
prosecutor to meet with her.

313
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:02,516
I had hoped to avoid being formal,
but now I suppose I'll have to be.

314
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,145
As a doctor you should know that
it's my assessment that applies...

315
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,482
...regardless of prosecutor decisions.

316
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,402
Therefore, you will have to be patient
and wait until I change my assessment.

317
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,034
Well...

318
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:28,041
I had hoped for a more
professional response.

319
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,632
Can we rule out government
knowledge of it?

320
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,388
They must have known that a Russian spy
defected to Sweden.

321
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:45,517
We had a conservative government in '76
when Zalachenko defected.

322
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,311
30 years and nothing has leaked out.

323
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,941
It could not be kept secret, if a lot
of politicians were aware of it.

324
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,819
A lot of them write biographies now.

325
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,949
The same goes for the Security Service.
It would have leaked out sooner or later.

326
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:07,164
There must be a small secret group
acting on their own.

327
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,708
With substantial resources and influence.

328
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:15,589
If nobody has leaked about the group in
30 years, where do we start digging?

329
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,717
The best lead we have is Evert Gullberg.

330
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,805
If we find out more about him, there is a
chance of getting somewhere.

331
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,350
However, it must not take too long
or Millennium will be in trouble.

332
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,188
The magazine must be out simultaneously
with the trial.

333
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,120
Keep your eye on this, please.

334
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:55,378
How am I doing?
- You are clearly improving.

335
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:03,845
I will ensure that you get help
to get started with rehabilitation.

336
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:08,850
I do not need help.
- You do. Don't scratch the scab.

337
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,647
Moreover, you should eat better.

338
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,983
You should do something about the food.

339
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,112
The food?
- Get me a pizza or something like that.

340
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:28,411
I doubt the budget is sufficient for pizza.

341
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:33,166
A Dr. Peter Teleborian wanted to see you.

342
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,797
He said that you'd had contact in the past.

343
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:45,387
Anyway, he had to leave empty-handed.

344
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,140
Good...

345
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,617
Apparently this is for you.

346
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:43,380
Hello. We met at the hospital the
night Lisbeth Salander was brought in.

347
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,550
Yes, I do remember.
- I want to talk to you about something.

348
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,679
I will not disclose information
about Lisbeth Salander.

349
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:57,936
No, I want to give you information about
Lisbeth. Important information.

350
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:05,151
A conspiracy like that... sorry,
but it sounds very unlikely.

351
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:10,532
I understand that you see it that way,
but I assure you: everything is true.

352
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,452
Everything can be documented
and I will publish the whole story.

353
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:19,207
I built Lisbeth's defence for her trial.
That's why I am here.

354
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:25,338
I'm only going to ask you about one thing.
- What?

355
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,591
Lisbeth has secrets.

356
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:34,097
Private ones. She may need them
for her defence.

357
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,934
To access the evidence she will need this.

358
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:46,109
The prosecutor has imposed restrictions.
- That's why I'm asking you.

359
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,324
Hi, how are you doing?
- Fine.

360
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,619
May I give you a brief examination?
- Yes.

361
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,581
Let's have a look...

362
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,626
Do you feel any pain?
- No.

363
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,882
What about headaches?
- Not bad.

364
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,218
They are disappearing gradually.
- That's good.

365
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,889
The Stockholm police called again.

366
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,643
Hans Faste was his name. He described himself
as in charge of the investigation.

367
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,646
He wanted to come here and interrogate you.

368
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,108
Can you bend your head slightly backwards?

369
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,780
Not too far. I was a little annoyed
that they are so persistent.

370
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:38,161
I cannot use your medical condition
to refuse him much longer.

371
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:42,916
You are improving rapidly.
Do you understand?

372
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,879
I told him that you need a couple of
weeks more to rehabilitate.

373
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:54,511
You will then be moved to
jail in Stockholm.

374
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:59,432
I saw the tattoo on your back.
It seems quite large.

375
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,144
Why did you get it done?
- Why do you ask?

376
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,814
Pure curiosity.
- For private reasons I will not discuss.

377
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,444
Okay. Sorry.

378
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,668
It must have hurt and taken time.

379
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,088
Yes, to both.

380
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,716
Excuse me.

381
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:10,837
Hello Lisbeth. With this you can tell
your version of what happened.

382
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,006
Your autobiography.

383
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:18,761
Annika doesn't know that you have your PDA now,
and it's better to keep it that way.

384
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:22,348
Should I give her the DVD?

385
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,977
We also need to know more about Teleborian.

386
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:30,273
I live in your apartment.
Mine is under surveillance and probably bugged.

387
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:46,789
Murder suspect Lisbeth Salander will be
transferred from Sahlgrenska in Göteborg...

388
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:51,502
...to Kronoberg prison in Stockholm
as soon as her condition allows...

389
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,297
...according to a police spokesman.

390
00:43:54,506 --> 00:44:00,511
The trial is scheduled for the beginning
of November this year.

391
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,689
Plague, are you there?

392
00:44:55,609 --> 00:45:01,114
It's okay to give the DVD to Annika.
However, I will write about the rape myself.

393
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,951
I have contacted Plague about Teleborian.

394
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,830
He will contact you if he finds something.

395
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,904
I have a link to the government.

396
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:47,785
Guess who visited the Prime Minister at the
Cabinet Office on October 5, 1976?

397
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:53,916
No takers? Evert Gullberg and a person named
Hans von Rottinger.

398
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,503
They were there three weeks after
Zalachenko defected.

399
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:02,175
How did you find out?
- I checked the visitor's book.

400
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:06,429
There was only one visit, on October 5, 1976.

401
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,016
Well done, Christer.

402
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:16,314
Nevertheless, it must be proved that they were
there to provide information on Zalachenko.

403
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:22,278
Were there any notes?
- No, just names and dates.

404
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:28,451
How do we proceed?
- We must check the Secretaries of State.

405
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:33,206
Two people who worked there might know something.
- Do we have any names?

406
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,834
One is dead and the other one is
a retired ambassador.

407
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,671
His name is Bengt Janeryd
and he lives outside Grisslehamn.

408
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:45,468
We should have a chat with him.
- Good. I'll take care of that.

409
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,722
I know the case better than you do,
so I am more dangerous to him.

410
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,440
It's just what I say.
- Yes, I heard what you said...

411
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,609
Address?

412
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,695
Okay.

413
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,076
And you...

414
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,328
...well done!

415
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:39,397
You must know that Gullberg
has shot Zalachenko, right?

416
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,275
Did you read it in the newspapers?
- Yes.

417
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:49,031
Why didn't you call the cops?
- I waited for them to call.

418
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:53,286
That sounds a little convenient.
- I knew nothing about his daughter.

419
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,539
What she suffered is terrible.

420
00:47:56,748 --> 00:48:00,418
However, the prime minister was not aware of it.

421
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,378
Neither was I.

422
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:07,383
You'd better convince me and
the Millennium readers about that.

423
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:12,179
I forbid you to use my name in this context.

424
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,433
I didn't have anything to do with it.

425
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,811
What I read here is new to me.

426
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:24,442
You have read only some of the material
we will publish. We have a lot more.

427
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,819
Everything can be proved.

428
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,824
I will not hang you out, but you have a
responsibility and a liability.

429
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:36,412
So either you tell me now, or you keep
hiding behind your confidentiality.

430
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,790
That's what I call blackmail.
- Call it whatever you want.

431
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:44,211
If you talk, I promise you
not to mention your name.

432
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:51,093
Did the prime minister have contact with
Evert Gullberg and Hans von Rottinger?

433
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,804
Did you also contact them?
- Yes.

434
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:58,809
There was one more, named Clinton,
like the American president.

435
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,603
Clinton?
- Yes.

436
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,814
How often did you meet?

437
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:08,569
A dozen times during my time as
a Secretary of State.

438
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,740
I didn't know anything.
Only that Zalachenko collaborated...

439
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:16,577
...and that the information he gave
was invaluable.

440
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,996
Who took over the connection then?

441
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,749
I do not know.

442
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,253
You did not brief anyone?
- No.

443
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,881
And you didn't write any report?

444
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,760
No, everything was top secret, of course.

445
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,514
I didn't even take notes during meetings.

446
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:41,477
So, no subsequent government
had any idea...

447
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:45,606
...that there was a Soviet defector
in Sweden?

448
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,653
It might sound strange,
but that's how it was.

449
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,543
What's up Plague?
- We have a problem.

450
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:10,297
I have checked Teleborian's hard disk
and e-mail but found nothing.

451
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,552
Nothing?
- Nothing about you or the trial.

452
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,180
The only thing that might be interesting
are two short e-mails...

453
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,434
...sent by Jonas through Hotmail.

454
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:28,274
"PSU 1 ready next week".
It is from September 20 this year.

455
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:33,821
The second is equally brief:
"PSU 2 ready tomorrow".

456
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:39,452
PSU? Psychiatric opinion?

457
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,538
Yes, it could be.

458
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,665
No files?
- No.

459
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:48,335
He did not send anything
from his work computer.

460
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:52,465
He probably has a laptop
with mobile broadband.

461
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:57,428
It may be difficult to access.
- But not impossible?

462
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,847
At the right time, anything is possible.

463
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:07,438
I will keep an eye on his mailbox.
- Do it. But don't call me again.

464
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,483
Send me an SMS or e-mail.
- Okay, bye.

465
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,736
Damn it!

466
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:41,722
Hello, Mikael Blomkvist. I am Monica Figuerola,
Constitutional Protection Unit.

467
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,768
Yes?
- I would like to invite you for a talk.

468
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:52,274
It is a friendly invitation.
You don't risk anything.

469
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:56,403
Can I get my mail first?
- Of course.

470
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:00,157
And a pair of clean underpants?
- Absolutely.

471
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,896
Torsten Edklinth, Constitutional Protection
Unit.

472
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,150
Blomkvist.
- Please, take a seat.

473
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:39,572
You probably understand
why we want to meet you.

474
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,575
So let's get to the point.

475
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:49,081
We have received confirmation that there
exists a secret group, a conspiracy...

476
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:53,544
...in an exceptionally sensitive area
of state administration.

477
00:52:54,963 --> 00:53:01,468
My meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday
evening has resulted in a full investigation.

478
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,346
Which means...?

479
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,974
A complete investigation.

480
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:15,316
The result will go to the General Prosecutor, who
will decide whether prosecution should be instituted.

481
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:25,075
However, we need time to identify
those who are involved.

482
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,829
I understand that.
Where do I have a part in it?

483
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,749
We want to know when you plan to publish.

484
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:36,629
If it takes place before the investigation is
completed, it could jeopardize the whole operation.

485
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,884
When do you think that I can publish?

486
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:45,638
Of course we cannot determine that yet.

487
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:50,267
It is entirely up to you, but I
ask you to cooperate.

488
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,653
Let me tell you this...

489
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,157
The state, the government, the Secret Service:
they all piss me off...

490
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:09,411
...and all the other fucking assholes
who locked up a twelve-year-old girl...

491
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:15,125
...in a mental hospital, for no reason at all,
and kept her legally incompetent.

492
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:19,421
I myself am very upset about
what happened to Lisbeth Salander.

493
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,800
But those who are responsible will be punished.

494
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:29,765
But before that, we must identify
who is involved.

495
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,017
That's exactly what I want as well.

496
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:38,565
But I also want to get Lisbeth Salander
acquitted and be declared legally competent.

497
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:44,154
Of course there will be no intervention by us
nor by the government, as you will understand.

498
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:03,340
Provided that I will get full access
to the results of your investigation...

499
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,219
...you can tell me what to publish and when.

500
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,222
Information in exchange for information.

501
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,686
This can be solved quite easily.

502
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:21,358
We decide which co-workers we
recruit for the investigation.

503
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:26,196
We can recruit Mikael Blomkvist
as an external consultant.

504
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:36,874
Evert Gullberg.
Do you have any other names?

505
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:41,378
Hans von Rottinger, Frederick Clinton.
One is dead, the other has retired.

506
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:46,008
Both were active in the group during the
'70 and '80s. - Group?

507
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:50,846
Can we give it a working title?
Maybe we should call it "the Section".

508
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,599
The Section? Okay.

509
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,603
How did you find out about them?

510
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,524
I have a reliable source.

511
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:08,030
Should it come up with the working title?
- Absolutely, I agree with that.

512
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:17,289
I was strapped onto the bed.
Peter Teleborian stood next to the bed.

513
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:22,294
He smelled of aftershave.
I hated his smell.

514
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:28,425
I heard his breathing change
and saw his mouth move.

515
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,428
But I didn't understand what he said.

516
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,390
I hated his mouth.

517
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,935
It was the night I became 13 years old.

518
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,541
Niedermann is your brother.

519
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,509
Come on Buster, search!

520
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,138
Yes, search.
- 80-1651 , come in.

521
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,016
Come in, 1651 .

522
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:03,020
We have searched the lower floor.
It's empty.

523
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:19,661
Someone has broken into the house
next-door, but the police are present.

524
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,664
Do you need something to help you sleep?

525
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:51,443
Lisbeth tried several times
to tell the social services...

526
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,696
...about Zalachenko's abuse
of her mother...

527
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:59,576
...but nobody took the ten year old
girl's accusations seriously.

528
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:04,581
To save her mother Lisbeth eventually tried
to kill her father...

529
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:09,211
...by throwing a milk carton
with petrol onto his face...

530
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:12,339
...and then a burning match.

531
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,967
Then society reacted.

532
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:19,054
But not by punishing
Alexander Zalachenko.

533
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,349
Instead, Lisbeth was punished.

534
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,689
Twelve years old, she was locked up at St. Stephen's
psychiatric hospital in Uppsala.

535
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:34,861
When she came out, she was declared legally
incompetent and placed under guardianship.

536
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,372
It's me.

537
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:49,835
Teleborian will meet with Jonas
at 1600 in the centre.

538
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,462
What time is it now?
- Nearly half past three.

539
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,381
Damn it!

540
00:59:56,884 --> 01:00:01,638
Hello. I have to take some blood tests.
- I just need to go to the toilet.

541
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,166
Yes, Christer.
- I'm in the middle of the staircase.

542
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:33,920
Yes, I see you now.
I'm just below.

543
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:41,261
I see Teleborian in the centre of the hall.
Christer, go ahead. I will stay here.

544
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,305
Okay.

545
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:47,934
You should see him soon.
Black jacket.

546
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,271
I see him now.
He's standing and waiting.

547
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:56,026
Keep an eye on him, but not too close.
- No, I'm just watching him.

548
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,696
Someone is coming. It must be Jonas.

549
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:03,158
Gray jacket, middle-aged.
I do not recognize him.

550
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:07,329
Now they are leaving. Should I tag along?
- Yes, follow them!

551
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:10,832
They're going out to Vasagatan.
- Keep following them.

552
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:25,722
Mikael here. Teleborian is meeting
someone who works for the Section.

553
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:29,601
Okay, where?
- At Vasagatan. Are you coming?

554
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,229
Okay. Yes, I'm coming.

555
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,875
Hi.
- Hello.

556
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,837
They are there.

557
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:23,238
Mikael here.
- They are leaving now.

558
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:27,159
Follow Teleborian.
We will follow the other one.

559
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:38,545
Monica here.
I need information on a car.

560
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:09,201
Guess who went through the same door
four hours ago.

561
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,661
Fredrik Clinton.

562
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:18,084
Teleborian's statement?
- It's a draft.

563
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:22,214
It needs to be edited,
but it looks good.

564
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:46,613
Did Teleborian go from a meeting with
Jonas Sandberg of the Section...

565
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:49,866
...to a meeting at the police station?

566
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,621
With whom?
- We'll find out.

567
01:03:55,206 --> 01:04:00,836
Jonas Sandberg joined the security department
in 1998. For counter-espionage.

568
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:05,882
In 2001 he was transferred
to a secret location abroad.

569
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:10,512
He should be working at the embassy in
Madrid, but they have never heard of him.

570
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:13,265
These are the Section's properties.

571
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,393
A block of apartments, six floors,
23 flats.

572
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:21,481
I have checked all tenants
but nothing unusual came out.

573
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:28,113
Additionally there is the top flat.
1 1 rooms and a kitchen.

574
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:32,659
A company named Bellona owns it.
The owners live abroad.

575
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,287
Can we get a camera up there?
- Do we have permission for that?

576
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:39,916
I will get permission for that,
if you manage to get a pot of tea.

577
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,546
Never mind, I'll make one at home.

578
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,142
Hello.
- Hi.

579
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,688
Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

580
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:05,525
I'll be back.
- I have nearly finished it.

581
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:21,291
I just wanted to warn you
that the police are coming tomorrow.

582
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,084
Okay.

583
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:29,049
I could delay a couple of days, but...

584
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:32,969
...my colleagues would wonder.
- So let it go.

585
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,305
Are you sure?
- Yes.

586
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:41,227
You do not seem particularly worried.
- No.

587
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:48,109
I have a present for you.

588
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,362
Why?

589
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:57,118
You have been one of my most
entertaining patients in a long time.

590
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:07,003
In case you should get bored in jail...
The latest clamour against DNA research.

591
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,012
Your mobile phone...
- It's in the chocolate box.

592
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:49,671
Teleborian will write an expert opinion.

593
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:54,551
He will conclude that you need
secure psychiatric care.

594
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,014
The prosecutor has requested the report.

595
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:05,395
So, we'll have to hire our own expert
who will come with his own opinion.

596
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,942
Lisbeth, it's for your own good.

597
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:16,531
I will not talk to any shrink.
I have already said that.

598
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,295
I hope they will fit.

599
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:37,343
The only one who will lose by it,
is you.

600
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,725
Lisbeth...

601
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,351
Stand back for Lisbeth Salander.

602
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:30,730
How are you, Salander?
- Lisbeth...

603
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,191
Do you have any comments?

604
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:04,848
Today murder suspect Lisbeth Salander has
been transferred under police escort...

605
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:09,853
...from Sahlgrenska in Göteborg
to Kronoberg prison in Stockholm.

606
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:14,023
According to prosecutor Richard Ekström
the trial...

607
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:16,985
...has been scheduled for November 6.

608
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,530
Lisbeth Salander was arrested...

609
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:24,784
...on suspicion of attempted murder of
her father, Alexander Zalachenko...

610
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:29,289
...who was brutally murdered at
Sahlgrenska Hospital subsequently.

611
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:34,377
There will be increased security
in connection with the trial...

612
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:38,631
...following threats during
the police investigation.

613
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,328
Sonny? When the hell did you get out?
- This morning.

614
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,789
Magge too?
- No, he'll have to stay a little longer.

615
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,791
Good to see you again.

616
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:17,587
The police raided us
the day you were arrested.

617
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:23,718
They found nothing. Later on that blond
bastard dropped in and wanted a hideaway...

618
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,846
...you know: your and Magge's buddy.

619
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,975
He is not my buddy, damn it!
He is wanted throughout Sweden.

620
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:36,356
So that's why he needed a hideout.
I have sent him to Viktor's place.

621
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,639
Fuck...

622
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,141
Sonny!

623
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,104
What the hell...

624
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,483
Jenny... Jenny!

625
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,736
Jenny!

626
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:35,039
Jenny? It's me, Sonny.

627
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,792
Who was it?

628
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,919
Nied...

629
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,422
Niedermann.

630
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,634
Viktor, Viktor...

631
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:55,059
Niedermann...
He will fucking die for this.

632
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,565
He will fucking die for this!

633
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:07,071
"Lisbeth Salander's autobiography"...

634
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:15,413
Can anyone prove what's written there?
- Impossible. They don't have any proof.

635
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:22,086
Blomkvist is no fool.
Nor is Erika Berger.

636
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:30,345
We must address it more thoroughly
to tie them up.

637
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:33,097
Press the green button.

638
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,935
We do not have much time.
We must increase the pressure.

639
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:42,231
Who's turn is it today?
- It's Malin's, right?

640
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,484
Hi. How's it going?

641
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:50,073
You want sushi?
- No fish. Chicken teriyaki for me.

642
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,826
Are you going to have lunch, Micke?
- No, I don't have time.

643
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:57,872
Okay. Erika, eight pieces?

644
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:03,586
Can I replace the battery with yours?
Mine is flat.

645
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:08,466
Micke... have a look.

646
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,348
It's someone anonymous. I think it's from
the same sender as last time.

647
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,976
Have you got many?
- I got one last week.

648
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,730
Why didn't you say anything?
- I didn't take it seriously.

649
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,988
We keep it between us. Let's talk more
about it later today.

650
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,658
May I take it then?
- Take it.

651
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,540
Would you like to have eight pieces?
- I'm not so hungry today.

652
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,042
I will skip a meal.

653
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,011
Time to go to the hearing.

654
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,948
Well, so we finally meet.

655
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:17,410
Ekström, prosecutor.

656
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,591
We see this initial meeting more
like a conversation than an interrogation.

657
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:35,970
A way to bring some order
in the complicated story.

658
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,224
I'm assuming that you don't have
anything against it.

659
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:45,104
The charges against you are serious.

660
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:51,486
However, as a prosecutor I have to take into
account all mitigating circumstances.

661
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:56,491
It is important that you are aware of that,
for your own sake.

662
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,749
This is a simple question.
Answer yes or no.

663
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:07,752
When you went to Gosseberga
to meet your daddy...

664
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:11,964
...did you already have plans then
to kill him?

665
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:19,639
Then I will ask the defence again
to encourage her client respond.

666
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:25,853
Then I repeat that my client decides
whether she wants to answer.

667
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:39,784
I must ask the defence to have a serious
conversation with Miss Salander.

668
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:45,164
I say this for the defendent's own sake.

669
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,798
Well...

670
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:59,178
I was surprised that she was so small
and delicate, like a little girl.

671
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:03,558
The trial begins on the 13th.
The magazine has to be ready then.

672
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,519
We need to go to press the week before.

673
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,690
How will we be able to do that?
- We must help each other.

674
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:17,822
You and Malin write about Teleborian's
background and a bit about St. Stephen's.

675
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:21,158
Approximately 30 pages. Is that okay?

676
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,578
Yes, that's fine.
- Good.

677
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:28,082
Well...

678
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:32,044
Then there is another thing.

679
01:16:34,464 --> 01:16:38,926
I have received two anonymous e-mails...

680
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:42,346
...during the past week,
which you should know about.

681
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:44,974
Threats?

682
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:53,482
Shit!
Which damned fool has sent them?

683
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:57,236
Did you notify the police about it?
- I don't want the police here.

684
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:01,073
It is a serious threat towards Erika.

685
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:06,704
We take it very seriously. But I don't want
to have the cops here at the office.

686
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:11,584
So, you just want to ignore it?
- That's not what I say.

687
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:14,253
I will solve it my way.
- How?

688
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,883
The police will not care about it.
They don't give a shit!

689
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:23,220
Please, stop! My God!

690
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:28,517
I didn't get any more of them, and no harm has
been done. So let's forget about it.

691
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,022
Next item.
- 30 pages.

692
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:37,276
What about Lisbeth Salander?
- She's doing fine, under the circumstances.

693
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:40,780
What do you say about the accusations?
- No comment.

694
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:44,742
You've got to defend her and
surely must have something to say.

695
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:53,626
Hello my sweethearts. You're eating there?
Sorry I'm late.

696
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,878
Good that you've eaten already.

697
01:17:56,046 --> 01:18:00,007
I'm sure you will enjoy this.
It's Lisbeth's autobiography.

698
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:03,803
What? When did she write it?

699
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,389
That doesn't matter.

700
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:13,562
"Bjurman"?
Is that Lisbeth's guardian?

701
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,402
What is this?
- It's a movie.

702
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:21,696
Have a look at it yourself.

703
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:28,577
Lisbeth approved it's use during
the trial, if it comes in handy.

704
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,525
You want some?

705
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:24,819
Is Lisbeth Salander healthy now?
- Yes, she can be interrogated now.

706
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:29,573
Physically she is fine.
- But maybe not mentally?

707
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:34,537
It is known that Lisbeth Salander has been
treated in mental hospitals for several years.

708
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:38,415
You think that Lisbeth Salander
is still mentally ill?

709
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,335
I'm not able to diagnose her case.

710
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:44,964
I have asked for a psychiatric
investigation to find the answer.

711
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:48,467
Who will be the doctor?
- Peter Teleborian.

712
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:52,304
He is chief psychiatrist
at St. Stephen's hospital.

713
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:56,350
Peter Teleborian...
what a surprise.

714
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,247
Christer?

715
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:28,132
Is it from the same sender?
- Yes.

716
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:36,473
"It's getting worse now. For all of you".

717
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,851
Is that about us?

718
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:42,771
Has Micke already tried to trace the sender?
- He called somebody.

719
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:46,609
That didn't help much.
We must call and report it.

720
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:51,405
We cannot just wait for something to happen.
- I want to talk to Mikael first.

721
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:56,535
I will call him right now.
- No. I am the responsible publisher.

722
01:21:56,786 --> 01:22:01,415
Moreover, I am the one who received those e-mails.
I will not act behind Mikael's back.

723
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:07,546
We must stick together.
And be united. Especially now.

724
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:13,552
I'll call Mikael.

725
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:27,191
Mikael Blomkvist. I cannot reply now,
but please leave a message.

726
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:32,446
Micke, where the hell are you?
I've received another e-mail.

727
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:36,784
Now it's not just about me.
It feels extremely uncomfortable.

728
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,078
Call me back!

729
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,837
Hello Lisbeth.

730
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:59,181
You should know that I am sorry
that you got into this situation.

731
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,852
I'll try to help you
in all possible ways.

732
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:11,819
I hope that we can cooperate,
you and me.

733
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:19,326
I thought we got acquainted
pretty well, you and me.

734
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,870
During that time.

735
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,708
You were a stubborn...

736
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:30,754
...and extremely difficult to treat
twelve-year-old girl.

737
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,343
You bit my finger once.

738
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:39,972
Do you remember?

739
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:47,146
You never understood that touch
was part of the treatment...

740
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:51,608
...and that it creates closeness and trust.

741
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:56,655
This applies in particular to children.

742
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:04,788
Do you realize that I am the person...

743
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:08,667
...who has the greatest potential
to help you?

744
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:15,507
Don't you?

745
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:28,562
Hi. Are you still here?
- I called your cellphone several times.

746
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:32,191
I was writing and had it turned off.

747
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:35,694
The same sender.

748
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:43,786
Christer tried to call the police today.
But I stopped him.

749
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:49,208
We must fix this right now, Mikael.

750
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:53,337
You and I are running the magazine.

751
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:58,342
We have responsibilities towards our employees.
It is not just about you and me now.

752
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:02,721
I've contacted one of Lisbeth's
hacker buddies, Plague.

753
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,349
So we don't have to report it to the police?

754
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,978
If anyone can find the sender,
then it's him, but it takes time.

755
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,981
It will be faster than the police.

756
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:16,568
Are we talking about days? Or weeks?

757
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,117
Frankly, I do not know.

758
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:30,707
If we assume that Millennium has
something to publish...

759
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:33,001
...then what can they possibly have?

760
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:39,216
The worst-case scenario is that they
have a copy of Björck's investigation.

761
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:45,139
But they may not know anything
about our business.

762
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:50,894
Nevertheless, he has high credibility.
And the same goes for the magazine.

763
01:25:55,984 --> 01:26:00,737
Maybe we could reduce the credibility somehow?

764
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:08,370
Anyway...

765
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:12,916
...we have to put an end to this,
once and for all.

766
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:54,208
She called us quarter past three in the morning.

767
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:58,045
She had locked herself up
in a room upstairs.

768
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:01,673
We were there 20 minutes later.
- Did you find any tracks?

769
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:06,929
The police took care of that.
We have installed alarms in the house now.

770
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,974
Erika told me about those e-mails.

771
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:14,228
They are probably linked with
what happened last night.

772
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,106
My contact is trying to track them down.
I do not want to involve the police.

773
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:22,736
You should do that now. It's about
physical threats towards you and Erika.

774
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:25,197
Towards me?
- Yes, even towards you.

775
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,742
The silent alarm in your apartment
went off last night.

776
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:40,504
We were there in 17 minutes.
When we searched the apartment...

777
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:45,384
...we found 180 grams of cocaine
hidden in one of your loudspeakers...

778
01:27:45,635 --> 01:27:50,138
...and 120,000 Swedish crowns in cash
in your wardrobe.

779
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:53,517
What the hell?!
- They're trying to set you up.

780
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:57,145
Since they cannot hit the magazine.

781
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:01,233
Is it still there?
- Only the money.

782
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,527
The cocaine has been taken away.

783
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:14,121
I have to call Erika.
- I think she's asleep.

784
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:24,923
Erika.
- It's me.

785
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,682
I know what has happened.
It sucks!

786
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:38,437
I want to see you. Can I come?
- No, don't come here.

787
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,690
We will talk about it later.

788
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:45,402
I want to see you now.
- I have to sleep a few hours.

789
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,074
At three o'clock then?

790
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,785
At Samir's Gryta?

791
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:59,708
Will you come or not?
- At three o'clock. I will come.

792
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:02,586
Good. Bye.
- Bye.

793
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:20,979
I'll print those three pages.

794
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:23,982
Have you heard anything from Erika?

795
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:28,987
I talked to her. She felt bad last night
and wanted to sleep during the day.

796
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:33,241
How is she now?
- Better. Damn, I've got to go.

797
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,994
Has she got more e-mail?

798
01:29:36,245 --> 01:29:41,083
We've really done a great job
with this edition, all of us.

799
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:45,712
Shall we have a beer later?
- No, I have a meeting at Samir.

800
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,592
There is uncertainty about
how many of these people...

801
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:54,262
...are connected to the Section's
activities.

802
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:58,392
After all, there may be more of them
we do not know of yet.

803
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:03,605
We have identified the key persons and they
will be arrested in a coordinated action.

804
01:30:03,856 --> 01:30:07,609
More information about this later.

805
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:15,033
It is ten to three now. We'll break now
and meet here again in an hour.

806
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:20,414
Has something happened today?
- Clinton has been on dialysis.

807
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,125
The other ones were coming and going.

808
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:26,795
Jonas Sandberg is probably the only one
who has been social.

809
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:32,551
At 10.30 he met with two persons at a
pizzeria in Bredäng.

810
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:36,430
Whom did he meet?
- I do not know them.

811
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,808
They looked like Eastern European guys.
- Those are the Nikolic brothers.

812
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:44,646
Tomi and Miro Nikolic. From Serbia,
but they have been living in Huddinge.

813
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:48,275
Very unpleasant types.
Sharpshooters during the Civil War.

814
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:53,029
Miro is wanted for assault, but of course
they live in Serbia most of the time, so...

815
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:55,282
Mikael...

816
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,793
Hello, Samir.

817
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:12,674
Sorry I'm late.

818
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:19,097
How are you?
- What do you think?

819
01:31:19,348 --> 01:31:22,350
Why didn't you call last night?
- What could you have done?

820
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:27,105
I called Milton Security
because I needed help.

821
01:31:34,363 --> 01:31:36,990
We have to back off, Micke.

822
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:44,206
Samir's Gryta on Söder.
Connect me quickly, please.

823
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:55,759
I have stopped the magazine and
I have called the printing office.

824
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:02,015
This also affects Malin's and
Christer's safety.

825
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:06,728
Did you call the printing office?
- I don't want to take the responsibility.

826
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:09,397
It's too dangerous.
- Damn it...

827
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:12,734
Micke, there's a call for you.
- No, not now.

828
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:15,237
They say that it's very important.

829
01:32:23,913 --> 01:32:25,622
Excuse me.

830
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:37,008
Get down!

831
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:39,928
They are shooting!
- Cut through the park.

832
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:46,935
What the hell!

833
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,212
Get down!

834
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:24,681
Police! Police!
Hands up!

835
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,727
Now!

836
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:33,565
Police! Hands up!

837
01:33:37,236 --> 01:33:39,237
How are you?

838
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,368
Are you okay?

839
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:51,458
Here, wipe yourself off.
- How are you?

840
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:56,004
Get Blomkvist and Berger
out as fast as possible.

841
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:59,215
Out through the kitchen!

842
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:03,511
The two police officers were
eating at the restaurant...

843
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:08,141
...and recognized the brothers, one
of whom is wanted for assault.

844
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:12,646
Gunfire broke out when they attempted
to arrest them, but no one was injured.

845
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:16,733
The two brothers are now charged
with attempted murder.

846
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:21,154
Damn it!

847
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:23,990
Goddamned!

848
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:33,500
I talked to Christer and Malin.

849
01:34:34,543 --> 01:34:38,171
They cannot stay at the office now.
- No...

850
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:46,304
We could have been killed today.

851
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:48,556
Both of us.

852
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:56,523
No job is worth dying for.

853
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:01,194
No.

854
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:12,080
We do not know if they just wanted
to kill you, Mikael, or Erika as well.

855
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:18,461
But the idea was that the police
would find drugs and money...

856
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:22,298
...and associate it with a
Yugoslav drug deal.

857
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:27,721
What about the others at the office?
- We're closing the office for a couple of days.

858
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:33,101
We will also postpone the publication
of the magazine.

859
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:37,731
Then I suggest personal protection
for you and Erika.

860
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:41,860
No, I don't want anyone following me.

861
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:48,450
We'll see how things develop now.
- Have you contacted with her?

862
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:51,494
What's going to happen?

863
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:54,998
I will insist firstly on psychiatric
care for Lisbeth Salander...

864
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:58,501
...and secondly a long prison sentence.

865
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:01,254
Shouldn't that be the other way round?

866
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:04,132
Yes, but in this case...

867
01:36:04,341 --> 01:36:08,261
...the psychiatric report is
so explicit...

868
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:11,264
...that I have no alternative.

869
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:13,391
Thank you very much.

870
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:19,522
The trial of Lisbeth Salander starts
here in Stockholm's District Court...

871
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:22,984
...at 1 p.m., in about an hour.

872
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:29,532
It is expected to last three days, before a
large audience, as you can see.

873
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:33,411
During preliminary investigation
the police and the prosecutor...

874
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:37,791
...have given information to the media,
while the defence has refused to comment...

875
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,419
My God. Is it time?

876
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:47,759
I did not sleep a wink last night.
- Everything will be fine.

877
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:50,011
Of course...!

878
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:56,142
It will be OK.

879
01:36:57,394 --> 01:37:01,689
Indeed!
- Thank you. See you later. Bye-bye.

880
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:25,356
A little more, a little more.

881
01:38:55,554 --> 01:38:57,513
I can only regret...

882
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:02,310
...that Lisbeth Salander didn't say
a single word during the seven hearings.

883
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:07,440
However, that fact does not weaken any
of the charges.

884
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:09,525
Thank you.

885
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:13,821
Then I give the floor to the defence.

886
01:39:14,073 --> 01:39:15,949
Thank you.

887
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:20,828
From the defence side we reject
all the charges.

888
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:25,291
We will prove that the prosecutor's
claims are incorrect...

889
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:29,462
...and that my client has been exposed
to serious legal violations.

890
01:39:29,713 --> 01:39:33,174
I will demand that my client be
declared innocent...

891
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:37,845
...that her guardianship be abolished
and that she be released immediately.

892
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,848
Thank you.

893
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:44,227
Does the prosecutor have anything to add?

894
01:39:44,478 --> 01:39:51,359
For several reasons I propose that this trial
be conducted behind closed doors.

895
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:56,114
The case is about the mental condition and
the welfare of a vulnerable person...

896
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:59,617
...and about material that is
classified as confidential...

897
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:04,247
...and in some areas may
impact on national security.

898
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:12,880
We'll talk tonight.

899
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:26,894
That looks good.

900
01:40:27,646 --> 01:40:32,900
I will start with an effort to bring
some clarity...

901
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:36,279
...to your reasons for going to Gosseberga...

902
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:41,159
...to try to kill your father,
Alexander Zalachenko.

903
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:51,169
Should we interpret your silence as a statement
that you will not answer questions?

904
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:54,255
I will happily answer questions.

905
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,677
Then maybe you can answer the question.

906
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:03,181
I have not heard any question.

907
01:41:05,267 --> 01:41:09,562
I asked if you went to Gosseberga
with the intention to kill your father.

908
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:13,274
No, you said you wanted to
try to shed light...

909
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:17,695
...on why I went to Gosseberga
in an attempt to kill my father.

910
01:41:17,946 --> 01:41:21,449
That was a general statement
in which you anticipated my answer.

911
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:25,078
Answer the question.
- No.

912
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:29,957
"No" what?
- That's the answer to the question.

913
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:40,802
Did you strike your
father's head with an axe?

914
01:41:40,969 --> 01:41:42,470
Yes.

915
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:47,600
He was seriously injured and I argue
that this is attempted murder.

916
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:50,561
What is your view?

917
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:54,732
Those were two allegations.
On which one should I have an opinion?

918
01:41:54,983 --> 01:41:58,986
If striking your father in the head
with an axe was attempted murder.

919
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:02,824
That was not attempted murder.
It was self-defence.

920
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:16,629
Thank you.

921
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:19,882
Tell me if you need anything.

922
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:23,845
Can you get cigarettes?
- Forget it.

923
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:36,899
Thank you.

924
01:42:48,162 --> 01:42:50,496
Hello.
- Hi.

925
01:43:00,757 --> 01:43:05,386
How does it feel to be guarded?
- Well, not bad.

926
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:08,681
As long as they stay outside.

927
01:43:16,064 --> 01:43:18,191
Erika...

928
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:23,321
I couldn't do it.

929
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:33,331
You are an egotist.

930
01:43:33,582 --> 01:43:35,833
And an idiot.

931
01:43:42,966 --> 01:43:48,054
I will stay at home this week.
And next week.

932
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:52,850
I want to be sure that I made
the right decision.

933
01:43:53,101 --> 01:43:54,727
Well...

934
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:04,362
About us or about Millennium?

935
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:07,198
About both...

936
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:09,450
...I think.

937
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:13,329
I'll be in touch.

938
01:44:19,127 --> 01:44:21,128
Take care of yourself.

939
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:25,883
Damn it.

940
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:42,149
Salander, it's time.

941
01:44:46,488 --> 01:44:50,783
Lisbeth Salander's so-called
autobiography...

942
01:44:50,993 --> 01:44:53,661
...lacks any credibility.

943
01:44:55,038 --> 01:44:58,666
There are a number of allegations
against different people...

944
01:44:58,917 --> 01:45:01,502
...each one more absurd than the other.

945
01:45:02,546 --> 01:45:05,298
Everything is an expression...

946
01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:10,678
of the paranoid schizophrenia
Lisbeth Salander is suffering from.

947
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,764
Can you give an example?

948
01:45:13,932 --> 01:45:20,313
The most obvious is the portrayal of rape...

949
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:22,940
...of which - she alleges -...

950
01:45:23,191 --> 01:45:28,070
...her guardian, advocate Bjurman,
would be guilty of.

951
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:33,326
The whole story, with all the details...

952
01:45:33,535 --> 01:45:39,457
...is a classic example of
the grotesque fantasies...

953
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:43,336
...which children tend to exhibit.

954
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:48,966
But Lisbeth Salander is not a child anymore,
she is an adult woman.

955
01:45:49,217 --> 01:45:51,552
It still remains to be decided...

956
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:58,225
...on what exact mental level she is now.

957
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:02,355
However, in principle you are right.

958
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:05,733
I understand.

959
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:14,116
In 1993 Lisbeth Salander underwent
forced admission at St. Stephen's hospital.

960
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:18,621
During the years she lived there,
you were responsible for her.

961
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:21,499
Is that correct?
- Yes.

962
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:26,379
How many days did she lie tied up?

963
01:46:26,588 --> 01:46:29,215
In other words: clamped to the bed.

964
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:33,135
I cannot quite remember.
But not very many.

965
01:46:34,012 --> 01:46:36,013
How many approximately?

966
01:46:37,265 --> 01:46:42,478
Possibly... thirty times. But I don't
understand the relevance of this question.

967
01:46:42,729 --> 01:46:46,899
Lisbeth Salander herself claims
it was 381 days.

968
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:51,112
That is pure fantasy.
It doesn't make any sense.

969
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:54,782
So you're telling me, she did not
lie tied up more than one year...

970
01:46:55,033 --> 01:46:58,411
...of the two years she lived there?
- Of course not.

971
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:05,668
The defence has repeatedly tried
to get Lisbeth Salander's files...

972
01:47:05,919 --> 01:47:10,798
...covering the years of her forced admission
at St. Stephen's, but without success.

973
01:47:11,049 --> 01:47:15,428
Can you explain why?
- Because it's classified as confidential.

974
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:19,932
That is a general rule for this kind
of study.

975
01:47:20,183 --> 01:47:23,060
You as a lawyer should know that.

976
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:28,190
Here I have a copy of Lisbeth Salander's
dossier, regarding two years:

977
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:31,569
1993 and 1994.

978
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:38,659
Here it's clearly stated that Lisbeth
Salander was tied up for 381 days.

979
01:47:38,827 --> 01:47:44,206
Advocate Giannini, what is the relevance
of that for this trial?

980
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:49,712
I want to prove that Peter Teleborian is
not telling the truth on this subject.

981
01:47:49,963 --> 01:47:57,219
Advocate Giannini, records from
1993 and 1994 cannot be used today...

982
01:47:57,429 --> 01:48:02,558
...to question Peter Teleborian's credibility.

983
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:07,480
I understand.

984
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,903
I felt like an idiot.

985
01:48:56,112 --> 01:49:02,409
When the prosecutor submits Teleborian's
new report, I will have gained nothing.

986
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:08,916
She will end up in the mental hospital again
and I can't do a damn thing.

987
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:53,085
Welcome to your private young girls.

988
01:50:33,001 --> 01:50:34,752
Who are you?

989
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:36,962
Plague.

990
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:41,717
What is this?

991
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:46,138
Peter Teleborian's private PC.
A USB copy.

992
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:51,393
I'm sorry. Come in.

993
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:57,149
What does it contain?

994
01:50:57,359 --> 01:50:59,860
Everything you need.

995
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:05,491
Plus some nasty shit.

996
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:29,306
Annika, I have everything you'll need
right here. Cooperation with the Section...

997
01:51:29,557 --> 01:51:33,686
...the psychiatric report in several versions,
fake dates...

998
01:51:33,895 --> 01:51:37,940
...e-mail correspondence, everything.

999
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:40,776
Well, there you are. Excellent.

1000
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:44,571
Here.
- I will never have time to read all this.

1001
01:51:44,823 --> 01:51:48,575
Read it during lunch.
The dates are important.

1002
01:51:48,785 --> 01:51:53,706
Good, great!
See you later. Bye-bye.

1003
01:51:57,836 --> 01:52:00,295
You ended up at St. Stephen's...

1004
01:52:00,463 --> 01:52:03,841
...after pouring petrol onto your father
and lighting it.

1005
01:52:04,092 --> 01:52:07,052
Yes.
- Why did you do that?

1006
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:13,100
Because he had abused my mother
for several years.

1007
01:52:13,351 --> 01:52:17,730
On June 12 1993, he assaulted her
so brutally that she became disabled.

1008
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:22,860
She had permanent brain damage.
- Did you tell anyone?

1009
01:52:23,737 --> 01:52:27,197
Yes, to the police officer
who interrogated me...

1010
01:52:27,365 --> 01:52:32,494
...to the Social Welfare Board, various
doctors, a priest and that pig over there.

1011
01:52:38,126 --> 01:52:42,629
When I came to St. Stephen's,
I tried to explain what had happened.

1012
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:46,884
But he claimed that I fantasized.
As punishment I was tied up.

1013
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:51,597
That's pure nonsense.
Again, an example of the fact...

1014
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:56,101
...that your client lacks the ability
to separate fantasy from reality.

1015
01:52:56,269 --> 01:53:02,274
You lie, you fucking pig.
- Lisbeth, in court we use proper language.

1016
01:53:04,152 --> 01:53:08,739
I would like to proceed now
with the sexual abuse...

1017
01:53:08,907 --> 01:53:13,410
...to which advocate Nils Bjurman
exposed my client.

1018
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:16,288
That is not part of the case.

1019
01:53:16,539 --> 01:53:21,168
Those are absurd allegations
without any shred of evidence.

1020
01:53:21,377 --> 01:53:27,424
It is an example of the abuse of legal power
to which Lisbeth has been exposed.

1021
01:53:27,675 --> 01:53:31,512
With respect to Frederick Clinton:
he might be on dialysis...

1022
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:34,765
...in this case, at Karolinska Hospital.

1023
01:53:35,016 --> 01:53:39,686
Everyone here will receive all
necessary information.

1024
01:53:39,938 --> 01:53:43,941
I repeat.
Group 1 : Bublanski.

1025
01:53:44,150 --> 01:53:46,276
Group 2: Svensson.

1026
01:53:46,444 --> 01:53:48,529
Group 3: Modig.

1027
01:53:48,696 --> 01:53:51,031
Group 4: Figuerola.

1028
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:54,034
Group 5: Holmberg.

1029
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:59,832
In case of questions or ambiguities you can
contact your chief of division.

1030
01:54:01,584 --> 01:54:03,210
Good luck.

1031
01:54:04,212 --> 01:54:09,466
You have declared that advocate Nils Bjurman
has raped you? - Yes.

1032
01:54:09,717 --> 01:54:13,303
When did that supposedly happen?
- Not "supposedly".

1033
01:54:13,471 --> 01:54:16,473
It happened Tuesday, February 18, 2008...

1034
01:54:16,724 --> 01:54:21,478
...and Friday, March 7 of the same year.
It is clearly written in my biography.

1035
01:54:21,729 --> 01:54:24,731
Did you report the rape to the police?
- No.

1036
01:54:24,983 --> 01:54:29,361
Why not?
- The police had never listened to me.

1037
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:36,493
Did you search medical help for your injuries?

1038
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:38,745
No.

1039
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:43,333
Did you talk to someone about it?
- No.

1040
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:53,635
The late Nils Bjurman has
never been convicted of any crime.

1041
01:54:53,845 --> 01:54:58,849
He has never been reported to the police
nor has he been the subject of any investigation.

1042
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:03,520
However, it's my task to remind you
that Salander...

1043
01:55:03,771 --> 01:55:07,608
...has been diagnosed as paranoid
schizophrenic.

1044
01:55:09,235 --> 01:55:12,237
She has spent several years in a
psychiatric clinic for children...

1045
01:55:12,405 --> 01:55:16,491
...and has been under guardianship
since her eighteenth birthday.

1046
01:55:16,659 --> 01:55:21,788
However regrettable that may be,
it has its reasons of course.

1047
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:30,380
Lisbeth Salander has her
very own confused world-view...

1048
01:55:31,299 --> 01:55:37,179
...which appears very clearly
in her "autobiography".

1049
01:55:37,388 --> 01:55:41,934
Nowhere else has her lack of contact with
reality been demonstrated so clearly.

1050
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:44,019
In this context...

1051
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:49,816
...we will try to assess the credibility
of her words and statements.

1052
01:55:52,445 --> 01:55:56,198
Has the prosecutor finished?
- Yes.

1053
01:55:56,407 --> 01:56:00,911
Then the defence may present her evidence.
- Thank you.

1054
01:56:03,915 --> 01:56:09,586
Peter Teleborian claims that
Lisbeth Salander is lying...

1055
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:14,925
about her allegations that she was sexually
abused by advocate Bjurman.

1056
01:56:15,969 --> 01:56:19,596
The prosecutor is of the same opinion.

1057
01:56:20,848 --> 01:56:27,104
I will now demonstrate that Lisbeth's
assertion is absolutely true.

1058
01:56:28,481 --> 01:56:31,358
When was this recording made?

1059
01:56:31,567 --> 01:56:35,487
On March 7, 2008.
I used a hidden camera.

1060
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:51,003
If you are nice ...

1061
01:56:51,254 --> 01:56:53,839
If you...

1062
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:56,883
If you are nice...

1063
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,891
...Then I'll be nice.

1064
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:09,021
Are you going to be nice?

1065
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:12,274
Are you nice? Are you being nice?

1066
01:57:15,778 --> 01:57:17,988
It is too late now.

1067
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:30,500
Stop the film!

1068
01:57:30,668 --> 01:57:32,669
That's enough!

1069
01:57:43,181 --> 01:57:46,933
Why did you film it?
- Nils Bjurman had raped me before.

1070
01:57:47,185 --> 01:57:49,311
He had forced me to give him oral sex.

1071
01:57:49,562 --> 01:57:53,315
He demanded more sex if I wanted my money.

1072
01:57:53,524 --> 01:57:56,693
It was the only way to obtain evidence
against him.

1073
01:57:56,944 --> 01:58:00,822
The only way to make him stop.

1074
01:58:01,908 --> 01:58:05,452
We'll take a break. A one hour break.

1075
01:58:50,498 --> 01:58:54,584
Sorry I am late.
- It's okay. Thank you.

1076
01:58:57,130 --> 01:59:00,382
Are you presenting new documents?

1077
01:59:00,591 --> 01:59:05,887
No, they are the same as the court already has,
however, with minor but crucial differences.

1078
01:59:06,097 --> 01:59:08,515
I will come to it later.

1079
01:59:08,766 --> 01:59:12,477
Then I give the floor to the defence.
- Thank you.

1080
01:59:15,022 --> 01:59:16,857
Well...

1081
01:59:18,526 --> 01:59:21,278
No one can deny any longer that
Lisbeth was the victim...

1082
01:59:21,529 --> 01:59:27,409
...of serious sexual abuse by her guardian,
advocate Nils Bjurman.

1083
01:59:27,618 --> 01:59:31,121
A person she thought that she could trust.

1084
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:38,628
As I have said, it illustrates the
type of assaults against Lisbeth.

1085
01:59:39,881 --> 01:59:44,426
The attacks have been both
psychological and judicial.

1086
01:59:45,678 --> 01:59:51,683
The person who bears a major responsibility
for this, is Dr. Peter Teleborian.

1087
01:59:53,019 --> 01:59:56,897
In 1993 he has written a psychiatric report...

1088
01:59:57,064 --> 02:00:02,527
...together with Gunnar Björck...

1089
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:06,281
...- who was a member of an illegal group inside
the Security Service -...

1090
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:11,661
...in order to silence a dangerous witness...

1091
02:00:11,829 --> 02:00:18,043
...and thus Lisbeth Salander got locked up
in a secure psychiatric unit.

1092
02:00:18,211 --> 02:00:22,172
There must be a limit to these allegations...

1093
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:24,925
Excuse me, but now I have the floor.

1094
02:00:25,968 --> 02:00:29,429
This happened after Lisbeth had poured petrol
on her father...

1095
02:00:29,597 --> 02:00:35,101
...Alexander Zalachenko, in a
desperate attempt to save her mother.

1096
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:39,439
But those who protected Zalachenko...

1097
02:00:39,607 --> 02:00:44,319
...made sure to cover it up
and classified the investigations.

1098
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:48,990
And with Peter Teleborian's help...

1099
02:00:49,242 --> 02:00:53,495
...they imprisoned Lisbeth at St. Stephen's
Hospital in Uppsala.

1100
02:00:53,704 --> 02:00:56,748
That's an outrageous accusation!

1101
02:00:56,999 --> 02:01:02,379
I have tried to help Lisbeth
Salander in every way. She attempted...

1102
02:01:02,588 --> 02:01:08,134
Yesterday Peter Teleborian presented
his new forensic psychiatric report.

1103
02:01:08,344 --> 02:01:10,387
Once again, he proposes..

1104
02:01:10,638 --> 02:01:15,016
...compulsory detention and imprisonment
of Lisbeth Salander.

1105
02:01:15,643 --> 02:01:18,979
But just like in 1993 this is
also a forgery.

1106
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:20,897
That is completely...

1107
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:25,777
I must ask you to allow the defence
to finish her speech!

1108
02:01:30,366 --> 02:01:32,284
Thank you.

1109
02:01:35,997 --> 02:01:41,167
His opinion is based on the "observation"
of my client.

1110
02:01:43,921 --> 02:01:48,425
That must have happened after she was
transferred to Kronoberg prison...

1111
02:01:48,676 --> 02:01:53,638
...on October 6, and completed on November 5.

1112
02:01:54,682 --> 02:01:57,684
Is that correct, Peter Teleborian?

1113
02:02:02,398 --> 02:02:04,441
I would like to call in two witnesses.

1114
02:02:10,948 --> 02:02:13,074
No!

1115
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:24,210
Police! Drop your weapon!

1116
02:02:28,924 --> 02:02:32,677
Well... do you know this document?

1117
02:02:37,725 --> 02:02:39,684
Yes.

1118
02:02:41,228 --> 02:02:46,941
It is the psychiatric report on
Lisbeth Salander by Peter Teleborian.

1119
02:02:48,486 --> 02:02:51,446
There are three versions.

1120
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:56,368
The first dated September 20,
the second October 1 ...

1121
02:02:56,619 --> 02:03:00,747
...and this one is the third,
dated October 6.

1122
02:03:01,749 --> 02:03:04,626
You gave me the documents.

1123
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:09,631
And I have noticed that the first
report of October 1 ...

1124
02:03:09,882 --> 02:03:16,221
...is identical to the report which
Peter Teleborian presented yesterday.

1125
02:03:16,389 --> 02:03:19,140
Dated November 5.

1126
02:03:19,392 --> 02:03:22,018
Very odd, to put it mildly.

1127
02:03:23,145 --> 02:03:27,482
My conclusion is that Peter Teleborian
has written the reports...

1128
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:30,902
...before he observed Lisbeth Salander.

1129
02:03:32,154 --> 02:03:35,657
For this reason it lacks all credibility.

1130
02:03:39,245 --> 02:03:41,996
Superintendent Edklinth, it is true...

1131
02:03:42,164 --> 02:03:47,127
...that you have received these reports
about Salander from Mikael Blomkvist?

1132
02:03:47,294 --> 02:03:48,753
Yes.

1133
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:53,425
What are your overall conclusions?
- They are false.

1134
02:03:54,301 --> 02:03:57,137
They were written long before...

1135
02:03:57,304 --> 02:04:03,017
...Peter Teleborian had the opportunity
to meet Lisbeth Salander in prison.

1136
02:04:03,269 --> 02:04:08,273
Moreover, they were completed with the
collaboration of a certain Jonas Sandberg.

1137
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:10,567
That's a lie.

1138
02:04:11,652 --> 02:04:14,654
Is it a lie?
- No, not at all.

1139
02:04:14,822 --> 02:04:18,575
The documents are dated
and there is e-mail correspondence...

1140
02:04:18,784 --> 02:04:23,455
...between Peter Teleborian and
Jonas Sandberg that proves it.

1141
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:29,794
He is part of a clandestine group
within the Security Service...

1142
02:04:29,962 --> 02:04:33,047
...who have protected Alexander Zalachenko
since the late 70's.

1143
02:04:33,215 --> 02:04:36,217
The group was responsible for the decision...

1144
02:04:36,469 --> 02:04:41,473
...to lock up Lisbeth Salander at
St. Stephen's hospital in 1993.

1145
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:46,478
Jonas Sandberg is one of a dozen people...

1146
02:04:46,729 --> 02:04:50,106
...who were arrested today by order
of the General Prosecutor.

1147
02:04:50,316 --> 02:04:54,819
Sandberg is suspected of involvement in
the murder of Gunnar Björck...

1148
02:04:54,987 --> 02:05:00,867
...and probably another murder.
We have evidence and several statutory declarations.

1149
02:05:09,627 --> 02:05:13,129
Would Peter Teleborian like to
comment on this?

1150
02:05:23,724 --> 02:05:26,893
Two policemen are waiting outside
the courtroom.

1151
02:05:27,144 --> 02:05:31,981
They want to take away Peter Teleborian
for interrogation.

1152
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:33,775
Why?

1153
02:05:34,026 --> 02:05:40,156
He will be arrested on suspicion of serious
violation of the law on child pornography...

1154
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:46,913
Specifically, for possession of 8,000
child pornography images and movies...

1155
02:05:47,122 --> 02:05:50,041
...found on his computer.

1156
02:06:05,391 --> 02:06:08,059
This computer is confiscated.

1157
02:06:09,395 --> 02:06:12,063
Please follow us.

1158
02:06:46,849 --> 02:06:49,601
Please sit.

1159
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:58,985
The court has not been able to assess
all the information yet...

1160
02:06:59,236 --> 02:07:05,325
...but finds no reason to keep
Lisbeth Salander in custody.

1161
02:07:06,243 --> 02:07:09,495
Therefore, you are free
pending the verdict.

1162
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:28,640
Are you sure that you don't want to
go with me to Millennium?

1163
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:32,268
You can drop me here on Folkungagatan.

1164
02:07:36,023 --> 02:07:39,651
You know that you owe this
to Micke, right?

1165
02:07:41,236 --> 02:07:43,529
Yes. But...

1166
02:07:45,157 --> 02:07:47,033
Yes.

1167
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:04,258
I must be able to get hold of you.
- You can reach me by e-mail.

1168
02:08:05,552 --> 02:08:07,553
Okay.

1169
02:08:31,578 --> 02:08:33,204
See you.

1170
02:09:22,004 --> 02:09:25,882
How did it go?
- Justice prevailed.

1171
02:09:26,091 --> 02:09:29,510
So now there is a party?
- Now there is a party.

1172
02:09:29,762 --> 02:09:33,347
What will you do now?
- Now it starts!

1173
02:09:33,515 --> 02:09:36,476
...suspected of murder, among other things.

1174
02:09:36,643 --> 02:09:40,980
The organization that carried out its activities
from this apartment in Stockholm...

1175
02:09:41,148 --> 02:09:45,526
...was responsible for serious legal assaults
against Lisbeth Salander.

1176
02:09:45,736 --> 02:09:48,404
However, the story started in the 60's.

1177
02:09:48,655 --> 02:09:54,160
The Section was founded then to
watch over the nation's interests.

1178
02:09:54,369 --> 02:10:01,000
Officially they never existed and
operated from this apartment.

1179
02:10:01,168 --> 02:10:06,672
Evidence suggests that even the head of the
National Police was not aware of the group.

1180
02:10:06,924 --> 02:10:13,638
In the mid-70's the Section recruited
a top Soviet spy...

1181
02:10:13,806 --> 02:10:17,308
Lisbeth has been released
pending the verdict.

1182
02:10:17,559 --> 02:10:21,938
So, she will either be acquitted or
receive a suspended sentence.

1183
02:10:46,964 --> 02:10:50,299
Here you are!
- What is this, "Estate inventory"?

1184
02:10:50,467 --> 02:10:52,844
It's the legacy of Zalachenko.

1185
02:10:53,095 --> 02:10:56,347
I don't want anything from that pig.

1186
02:10:58,225 --> 02:11:01,227
No, but you are of legal age now.

1187
02:11:01,478 --> 02:11:05,982
Therefore, I need your signature to prove
that you received it.

1188
02:11:09,236 --> 02:11:11,737
Securities with a value of 300,000...

1189
02:11:11,989 --> 02:11:15,575
...plus property in Gosseberga
valued at 1 ,5 million.

1190
02:11:15,742 --> 02:11:19,078
I don't want to have anything
to do with it.

1191
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:22,707
Then there is this...

1192
02:11:23,625 --> 02:11:27,003
An abandoned brickyard somewhere
outside Norrtälje.

1193
02:11:27,212 --> 02:11:30,756
Only the plot has been valued
at 150,000.

1194
02:11:31,592 --> 02:11:33,509
Okay.

1195
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,013
Sell all the shit and give
the money away.

1196
02:11:41,393 --> 02:11:44,395
I think you should read it.

1197
02:11:44,646 --> 02:11:47,899
I can sell it for you later.

1198
02:11:58,035 --> 02:12:00,536
Micke says hello to you.

1199
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:22,558
Pizza Bussola? Here you are!
- Thank you. Bye.

1200
02:12:35,322 --> 02:12:37,698
What is this shit?

1201
02:18:25,422 --> 02:18:29,174
You deserve to die, you fucking freak.

1202
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:49,987
Telephone information service.
- Yes, hello.

1203
02:18:50,196 --> 02:18:54,491
Please give me the number of the
Svavelsjö motorcycle club.

1204
02:19:03,126 --> 02:19:07,254
Who is there?
- Are you interested in Niedermann?

1205
02:19:07,505 --> 02:19:09,214
I'm listening.

1206
02:19:32,489 --> 02:19:34,031
Emergency.

1207
02:19:34,282 --> 02:19:39,119
Cop killer Ronald Niedermann is
at Skederyd's brickyard in Norrtälje.

1208
02:19:39,287 --> 02:19:43,665
A motorcycle gang is going to kill him.
They are heavily armed.

1209
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:25,290
Am I interrupting you?

1210
02:20:26,209 --> 02:20:29,962
I was having a bath.
- Oh, I see...

1211
02:20:31,423 --> 02:20:34,091
Have you seen the news?
- No.

1212
02:20:34,717 --> 02:20:40,222
Ronald Niedermann is dead. A gang
from Svavelsjö has killed him.

1213
02:20:41,099 --> 02:20:44,935
Then the police came and arrested
the whole lot.

1214
02:21:10,628 --> 02:21:12,963
Thanks for everything.

1215
02:21:15,133 --> 02:21:16,967
Don't mention it.

1216
02:21:20,889 --> 02:21:22,973
Thanks yourself.

1217
02:21:29,898 --> 02:21:32,107
See you.

1218
02:21:34,402 --> 02:21:37,529
See you.
- Definitely.
