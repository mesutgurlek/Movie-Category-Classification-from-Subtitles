00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,713
What happened boss?

3
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,613
Some one's dead.

4
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:37,313
Whose?

5
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,993
That same guy who used to fight
with the newspaper..

6
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:40,660
.. vendor every morning,
he has a daughter..

7
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:43,422
.. who has a healthy figure,
she's not to be seen today?

8
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,764
He used to buy fruits for Rs 30..

9
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,128
.. and he used to complain about it 300 times.

10
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:51,863
Oh, God, God, God,
we shouldn't criticize the dead.

11
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:55,133
Who criticizes when alive?
This is the best opportunity.

12
00:02:56,444 --> 00:03:01,746
Everything is by God's grace sister, the bill.
- 120 Rupees?

13
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,383
20 and 20 makes 40 and..
OK, now that he isn't alive..

14
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,449
.. doesn't mean you could give any calculation.

15
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,979
Do you know? He used to keep an account..

16
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,678
.. of each and everything on the
Chinese calculator.

17
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,415
Mummy.. is it matching?

18
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:14,993
Child, at least today u should have
worn a salwar kameez, isn't it?

19
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,061
Mummy, this Sunday there are
many dead bodies coming at..

20
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:17,993
.. the ghat, and so there would be
many people too..

21
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,223
.. coming there, I can't wear salwar suit there.

22
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,129
Is he going to be alive again
if she wears a salwar Kameez?

23
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,997
See, I am telling you nothing has happened.

24
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,673
Nothing happened?
I have to cook food for so many people..

25
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,842
.. it's eleven o'clock.
Nothing's done yet?

26
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,839
I say cook some kidney beans and rice.

27
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,036
Instead of two,
cook it till it whistles four times.

28
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,580
And add a bit of soda to it.
It will cook faster. Simple.

29
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,081
Kidney beans and rice?

30
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:42,188
The kidney beans spoon was in one hand
and the remote in the other

31
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:43,023
Is that all?

32
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,521
Sachin's sixer

33
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,259
OK,OK, but what happened to Khosla saab?

34
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,190
We have no idea uncle.
He's never told us..

35
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,523
.. what he is up to...
soon after watching the match..

36
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,426
.. we saw him fallen on the sofa itself.

37
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,360
This watch of yours is nice...
is it an imported one?..

38
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,497
.. I too was thinking of buying one.

39
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,869
Hey bunty dear, how are you?
- I am fine, uncle. How are you?

40
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,907
How much is it for uncle?
- Maybe 3700.

41
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:08,705
He was my companion for 8 years
in the chartered bus..

42
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,214
.. and was thinking of buying some plot.

43
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,149
Lets see who sits next to me
henceforth in the adjoining seat.

44
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,653
Cherry, have you made arrangements
for some tea?

45
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,721
No idea uncle,
you may please have a look yourself.

46
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,449
Mummy... Mummy where are the car keys?

47
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,490
Dear, it must be in his pocket..

48
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:23,823
.. he had got the car reversed for you last night.

49
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,600
I'll be late from the office in the evening,
got a presentation. Bye.

50
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,297
No problem - The boy is very busy..

51
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,600
.. he is the apple of Khosla sir's eye.

52
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,075
This picture is made very well by her isn't it?

53
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,910
You too, early in the morning.

54
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,380
I've been requesting you from the
last 20 yrs not to give me..

55
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:27,823
.. kidney beans at night,
see I've ended with a gas problem..

56
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,730
.. and I have to visit the plot too.

57
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,957
Oh, you have to go to the plot at 9 o'clock..

58
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,659
.. but you have woken up at five
in the morning itself.

59
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,672
Neither do you sleep
nor do you allow others to sleep.

60
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,339
Why should I allow everyone to sleep?

61
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:37,054
You must be making preparations
to move to the new plot.

62
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:38,830
Mr. Khosla, now you people will be known..

63
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,398
.. as the family from south Delhi.

64
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,728
Your family must be very excited, isn't it?

65
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,234
We are going for the very first time.
We will be going at two.

66
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:53,212
Breathe in, breathe out.
Breathe, inhale again.

67
00:06:53,681 --> 00:07:12,056
Now start, Ha ha ha..

68
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:23,767
What happened?

69
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,708
Cherry was saying,
he won't go to see the plot.

70
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,710
Why? The whole family is going..

71
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,214
.. is he a big joint secretary that he is refusing?

72
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,613
That you ask him only.

73
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,482
Why should I ask him?
Is he doing any favor to me by coming?

74
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,586
Let him not come if he is not coming.

75
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:46,760
Why should I spoil my Sunday
because of others?

76
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:52,933
I will also not go, no one will go.

77
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,547
Once this gate opens,
there's a garden in front.

78
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:10,417
Ok? And in front of the garden
like this the stairs are going..

79
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,385
.. and from there when you go ahead..

80
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,892
The house is yet to be made
and the thieves have already come..

81
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,085
.. yes, then, in front of the garden
will be our drawing room.

82
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,424
What should I do with this?

83
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,661
Pick it up and throw it out.

84
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:26,598
Please concentrate a bit,
you are the engineer..

85
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,274
.. of the full house,
you are going to construct it, look here.

86
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:30,774
Papa, I'm a computer engineer.

87
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,038
I don't know about these bricks and stones,
I'm watching, you continue.

88
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,547
Ok. I'll explain you the
meaning of south facing plot.

89
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,343
But from here, where does the south fall?

90
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,483
Just make him understand.

91
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,450
There.

92
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,717
And from our present house?

93
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,786
From there also it is there only.

94
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,217
Oh! Then why have we taken the land..

95
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:48,622
.. thirty kilometers far from there?

96
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,554
Where are you going there?

97
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,422
Two minutes papa.

98
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,155
Afterwards you play with that.. what I mean is..

99
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,663
He's not playing, he's reading message.

100
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,496
Papa I'm telling you this,
you're becoming illiterate day-by-day.

101
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,833
Papa, I have to leave.

102
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,030
Leave! Where to?

103
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:02,641
I have to go to office.

104
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,071
Go to office? On Sunday?

105
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,769
I know you're working for a
multinational company,..

106
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,643
.. but Sunday is for every country.
Tell them it's a holiday.

107
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,614
No papa, I'll have to go. I'm leaving.

108
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,287
we have to decide everything..

109
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,854
.. what marble is to be put
on the floor and for the walls?

110
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,649
That you all decide, I'm getting late.

111
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,884
Come on! Your floor
we'll have to discuss with you only.

112
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,893
Papa, whatever floor you'll decide,
I'll stay in that, but now..

113
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,258
Bunty, drop me.

114
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,728
Sunday also he doesn't have time.

115
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,862
Company people are sucking his blood.
Poor thing.

116
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,574
Three parties were interested
for this property uncle..

117
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,438
.. one had even given the money in cash..

118
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,511
.. but I withdraw it in between, isn't it?

119
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,415
Dear hard work has to done.

120
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,106
Yes, yes.

121
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:48,277
Vijender, frankly speaking
I have spent all my life's earning..

122
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,753
.. in this.. this location that is.

123
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:53,687
The main thing is that
my younger son Cherry's office..

124
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,452
.. is very close to this place.

125
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,130
Yes, yes.

126
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,129
.. these multinational companies
catch the intelligent persons..

127
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,199
Uncle you brought the cash, isn't it?

128
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,871
Cash? - Cash.. - Oops..

129
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,835
Actually Cherry used to look after it.

130
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,770
But he works even on a Sunday.

131
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,038
Thirty two thirty two thirty two thirty three..

132
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,306
.. thirty three thirty three thirty four thirty four-

133
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:19,953
Vijender, count carefully,
it's my whole life's earning.

134
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:24,815
Don't bother uncle,
it's my daily job, thirty four thirty..

135
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:30,053
.. four thirty five... take this, it's complete now.

136
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,223
Congratulations uncle.

137
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,509
And uncle, when you are constructing your home?

138
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:52,243
Dear, I have done my job,
now who wants to stay there..

139
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:55,820
.. let them worry.
I told to my younger son Cherry..

140
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,150
.. what we say in English that it's your baby now?

141
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,254
Now, can we go?

142
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:01,826
Now my sons will take it further.

143
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,394
Yes, yes, sons are there for what matter.

144
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:24,213
Meghna? Meghna? Meghna!

145
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,790
Hi, Bill Gates

146
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:31,950
Hey, what are you doing?

147
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,217
Just like that.

148
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:34,286
What?

149
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:37,888
Sometimes you should do
like this it's good for health.

150
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,827
Will you try? Should I teach?

151
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,528
No, Thank you

152
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,195
Cherry, why you are so boring?

153
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:48,364
Ok. Come here, come on, hold the leg.

154
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,045
Oh God, look at your face.

155
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:05,552
Don't worry, I am not going to kiss you.
Shall we move?

156
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,158
Shall we go for the rehearsal?

157
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,414
Ok. Come hold me.

158
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:31,512
Why?

159
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,612
Hey what happened just hold me

160
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:34,854
But why?

161
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,750
Because you are my boy friend.

162
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:42,753
Now hold me, just hold me!
Otherwise you will fall.. like this.

163
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,426
Like this!

164
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:09,723
And Bill Gates, celebrating Sunday?

165
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,220
Hey! Leave it.

166
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,050
What?

167
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,227
I told you to stop smoking, isn't it?

168
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:21,033
She knows, I can't refuse,
she is taking disadvantage of the same.

169
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:22,793
Yes I do, leave it.

170
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,300
Thank you!

171
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:29,635
Next month there is Bangalore theatre festival..

172
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:30,969
.. will you come along with us?

173
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,910
There is a problem for next month, Bapu.

174
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:37,817
She is working too hard,
give her moral support by coming.

175
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,816
This coward will give me moral support? This?

176
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,088
Take two days leave dear.

177
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,756
It's not the matter of leave, Bapu..

178
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,016
.. actually I won't be here at that time.

179
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,284
Then where will you be?

180
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,119
New York.

181
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,491
New York? Wow! On tour?

182
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:55,099
No, I had applied to a software company..

183
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:59,170
.. if everything goes well,
then from next month I have to join.

184
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,069
How come you never told me?

185
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,439
You two really keep it close, don't you?

186
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:09,375
Anyways, very good,
I will always wish you to be successful..

187
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,780
.. keep climbing higher,
but don't forget us after reaching there.

188
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,649
Don't be stupid, Bapu,
how can some one forget you.

189
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:18,252
She will forget..

190
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,254
Yes.

191
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:21,988
Bapu! -What is it?

192
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:24,764
There was a call from Bangalore..

193
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:25,932
.. they were asking about the next months show.

194
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,464
New York, is it?

195
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,095
Actually I thought,
it wouldn't be right telling anyone..

196
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,866
.. before things got finalized.

197
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,674
What's the use of telling some one?

198
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,048
Every body at home would be happy.

199
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,014
Their son is going to be an N.R.I.!

200
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,792
You didn't tell at home?

201
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,696
Cherry you are going away..

202
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:05,268
.. and you didn't inform at your home.
Are you mad?

203
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,377
Meghna, you how my papa is,
I just don't know how to tell him.

204
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:19,211
Why, what's the problem?
The way you told me, tell him too..

205
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,536
Hello. -Where are you, sir?

206
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,173
The queue is about to finish. Where are you?

207
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,505
I was about to leave, Asif.

208
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:51,275
Iqbal. Asif Iqbal. Do one thing,
get 1 photo and reach here immediately.

209
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:53,385
But you said, six will do.

210
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:56,021
If the US embassy did what I wished..

211
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,851
.. then whole Karol Bagh would be California!

212
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,458
Everything will be closed after 1'Oclock..

213
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:02,720
.. and they are closed for 1 week then.

214
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,921
And then these guys will be in a war then..

215
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,429
.. and you will be sitting here forever.

216
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:09,634
If you want a visa in 30 days,
then come with a photo in 10 minutes.

217
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,532
See you. - But.. Asif!

218
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,029
You are right on time!

219
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,791
Looks like you will reach America also on time.

220
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,728
These are the papers you asked for the visa.

221
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,564
Will you have tea? - No, thank you.

222
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,909
There! You screwed up!

223
00:16:56,383 --> 00:17:00,342
Mixed your name with your dad's in the hurry.

224
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,785
No, it is the way it is.

225
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,781
What does it mean?

226
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,789
You mean that your Dads name is
Kamal Kishore Khosla..

227
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,989
.. and your name is Chiraunjee Lal Khosla?
- Yes.

228
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:23,335
To think what they are going to
do to your name in America!

229
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,010
You check the papers!

230
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,544
Chiraunjee! Isn't it something
that is to be eaten?

231
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:33,842
Whoever has named you,
surely he must be your enemy.

232
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:38,319
Cherry brother, Papa is here.

233
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,856
Cherry, come here.
Everyone is waiting for you.

234
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,858
All the decisions are
waiting for your arrival.

235
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,199
Where is the name plate, Bunty?
- It's in your lap!

236
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,195
This is the nameplate. Look at it.

237
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,366
Well, here it is. K. K. and Sudha Khosla..

238
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,334
.. that is me and your mother.

239
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,334
This is B.K Khosla. That is Bunty.

240
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:58,705
And this Ciraunji Khosla, that is you!
- How is it?

241
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,280
I told you not to make it in gold..

242
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,719
.. these cheap things are
not liked by all, Bunty.

243
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,692
We will redo it in marble.
But the names look good, don't they?

244
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:21,900
Papa, this will change.
- This will change.. what?

245
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:25,534
Papa, I am changing my name.

246
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,400
Changing your name?
What do you mean?

247
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,074
I didn't understand.

248
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,043
I am changing my name.

249
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:32,375
He has just come from the office.

250
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,810
And you are discussing the name plate.
Take, drink water.

251
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,208
Water? Let him drink water.
But I did not understand.

252
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,389
Papa, I don't want to be named
Chiraunji Lal Khosla.

253
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,150
Why? - Because I don't like this name!

254
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:50,890
You don't like? It is your name.
There is no question of like and dislike!

255
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,655
Because.. you won't understand, papa.

256
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,667
Sit down for a minute!
You aren't drunk, are you?

257
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:01,135
You are the limit.
If he wishes to say something, listen!

258
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:06,102
Listen to him?
Today he says I am changing my name!

259
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,507
Then he'll want to change his home!

260
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,147
Then he will want to change his family!

261
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,247
And you are speaking for him!

262
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,542
What's there to speak for, papa?

263
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,845
I just want to change my name,
what's so great in it?

264
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:19,115
Ok. Ok. You don't change your name,
you just shorten it.

265
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,088
C. L. Khosla?

266
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:22,784
This is fine, you get to keep your name,
and also the change!

267
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:26,264
I don't wish to shorten my name,
I wish to change it.

268
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,369
But what is wrong with a short name?

269
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,230
Take mine for instance.

270
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,600
K.K.Khosla, short for Kamal Kishore Khosla.

271
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:37,368
Papa, you like Kamal Kishore
from head to toe.

272
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:40,341
But do I look Chiraunji Lal from any angle?

273
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,275
Let me suggest, Hrithik is a hit these days.

274
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,143
You name yourself Hrithik.

275
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,842
No, no. Vivek.

276
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:52,387
Talk softly.
By the way, how will Yuvraj be?

277
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,288
These sport stars aren't safe
to be named after.

278
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,487
He stops scoring runs,
and this guy will be kicked.

279
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:02,301
Why don't you take up an English name?

280
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,299
That really impresses folks these days.

281
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,971
What? - Like Ricky Martin?

282
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:10,109
Yes. Ricky Martin. That's good.

283
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:19,946
"Living the Vi Da Loca. "

284
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,256
Mr. Khosla. What difference does a name make?

285
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,328
Even if he changes name,
he will remain your son!

286
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,359
Actually, Chiraunji Lal sounds like a...

287
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,627
.. street peddler than a software engineer.

288
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:43,171
These guys nowadays think in a
multi-national manner.

289
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:48,709
They don't like these Indian names,
to them it is a bad joke!

290
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,383
He was named Chiraunji Lal
by my mother, Sahani sir.

291
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,644
You know how they used to
name kids those days.

292
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,014
Now the mother is no more.

293
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:58,953
She won't come back and
check if the name is changed!

294
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,459
You change it.
Don't take cudgels with youth.

295
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,722
You need to compromise with him. Compromise!

296
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:06,728
Compromise?

297
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,198
The whole country is running
because of compromise.

298
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:16,571
Just compromise a bit,
it will insure your old age.

299
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,744
I don't need insurance, Sahani sir!

300
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,577
You know how the elder one turned out?
- I know.

301
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,113
I have high hopes from this second one.

302
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,979
That's why I am saying,
make friends with him.

303
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:30,987
Sahani sir, how can I make friends with a boy..

304
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:32,751
.. who does not like his own name?

305
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:37,487
You want to teach me,
how to make friends with an young son?

306
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,636
I have heard, that first you put the ice,
then the soda..

307
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,075
.. and then the whisky!

308
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:35,380
No. You pour the whisky first..
then ice.. and then soda.

309
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:40,082
No, first you put the ice,
that's why they call it on the rocks.

310
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,756
Then do it in your own way.
- Buddy, why are you touchy?

311
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:51,769
You go and get some Coke
for yourself and mummy.

312
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,565
Why Coke? Can't we drink 'Whisky'?

313
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,503
Sudha, call her in the kitchen.

314
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,304
Sudha, there is no need of
calling me in the kitchen.

315
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,740
You also come here and have a drink!

316
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,471
You can fry the snacks later!

317
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,613
Ok, Ok. Granted.
Go ahead and have your drinks.

318
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,196
Shall we start? - Slowly.

319
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,601
These things should be enjoyed slowly.

320
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:33,438
I have seen Sahani sir while drinking. Slowly.

321
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,876
It's called, Hold The Drink.

322
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:45,090
Now, shall we start?
- Buddy, let Cherry come!

323
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,857
Isn't he late?
Check out, if he is waiting outside.

324
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,257
Why should he be waiting outside?

325
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,827
You just go and look, please.

326
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:54,393
Start drinking please.
You are already pissed.

327
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,362
Look. You have a long life ahead.
He has come.

328
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,766
Come here Cherry. Start frying the snacks.

329
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:01,998
Cherry has arrived.

330
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:07,277
Aren't you a bit late today?

331
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,809
No, papa. This is when I come every day.

332
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,278
Papa has thrown a party for the Plot!

333
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,384
Let's have that list of names.

334
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:18,414
We couldn't finish the discussion
of your name that day.

335
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,455
I have tried changing it.

336
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:23,059
Chiraunji Lal could be Chiraunji Kumar.

337
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:26,460
But no. This is a good name.

338
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,428
Chandankumar(Sandalwood)

339
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,467
Then there is Chanakya kumar,
Chanchal kumar..

340
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,433
Papa, I need to check my e-mails..

341
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:35,472
Buddy, you work so hard.
Also try to celebrate..

342
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,371
Is the drink ready? Come, lets start.

343
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,277
Take it. 3 cheers for New Khosla Kunj.

344
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,610
Plot no. 32, Sapna Vihar. Cheers!

345
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,481
What happened?
- Papa, I don't drink this drink.

346
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,451
Then what do you drink? Beer?
Bunty, go and get beer.

347
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:01,293
Papa, I don't drink.
- You don't drink?

348
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,865
No mater, come, have 1 drink with us
for good time's sake.

349
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:06,833
By the way, too much drinking
is not good, Bunty.

350
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,066
Papa, when I said I don't drink, I mean it!

351
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,580
Do you think we are fools here,
that we are drinking?

352
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,607
Is Mr. Sahani a fool, that he drinks every evening?

353
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,014
Is the whole world a bunch of drunks,
and you alone are wise?

354
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:22,950
What is this you are doing?

355
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:26,592
What am I doing?
I am trying to have a drink with my young son.

356
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,394
But he is feeling ashamed to drink with me,
don't I understand?

357
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:31,826
You go inside. - He won't go.
I need to talk with him.

358
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,623
What is there to talk?
- There are 100 things.

359
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,358
A new home is being built,
there are 100 things to do, to plan.

360
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,467
I don't want to do any planning!

361
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,036
No! You have to!
If you wish to stay in this home..

362
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,207
.. you have to do what everything is doing!

363
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,965
I don't want to live in this house.
- Shut up. -Why?

364
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:44,575
Are the Multinationals giving you
a big mansion?

365
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,267
Or this house is not your worth?

366
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,173
Papa, I am going.
- Where are you going?

367
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,245
I am going to America!
- He is going to America?

368
00:25:49,516 --> 00:25:50,608
How can you go to America?
It is not an easy thing!

369
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:51,681
Stop dreaming big, and stay on the ground.

370
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:52,510
Papa, I have got an job there!

371
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,517
Watch out for what you have.
Or you will loose that also!

372
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:00,215
You will fall so hard that
you will lose that big mouth of yours!

373
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,393
Take care for what you have!

374
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:03,391
And who is waiting to roll out
a red carpet for you there?

375
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:22,175
Papa I have got a job in America.
I had applied to a company.

376
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:28,611
They have appointed me.
I have to leave in a month.

377
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,885
And what about your floor?

378
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,062
There's Bunty.

379
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:28,103
Brother, can I come in?

380
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:33,947
Your Milk.

381
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,598
When are you going to America?

382
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:56,999
I have applied now.
The interview has to be given.

383
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,171
Your interview will be nice.

384
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,888
You will be visiting during vacations?

385
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:25,229
Hey, are you sleeping?
- No. I am dancing.

386
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:28,607
Dude, why taking out Papa-ji's anger on me?

387
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:32,938
Are you really going to America?

388
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,985
You made it dude. Call us also sometime.

389
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,380
Let me go first.

390
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,148
I thought of applying an advance.

391
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,754
How are your shares doing?

392
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,222
Same as old.

393
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:57,962
I am planning to get into real estate
once the house is finished.

394
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,505
'Khosla Estate Agency'

395
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:05,242
What do you say? - check it out.

396
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,255
Get some sleep. I have some left.

397
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:26,229
Dude! Don't forget after going to America.

398
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,098
Shall I serve the dinner?

399
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:38,041
No mama.

400
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,642
You didn't tell before.

401
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,451
I was about to, mama.

402
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,816
Your current job is not Ok?

403
00:29:55,561 --> 00:30:00,521
No mama, it's not that.
But I cant do with just Ok.

404
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:03,201
You all can join me in a few years.

405
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,497
What will we do there at this age?

406
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:07,900
What are you doing here?

407
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,101
Your papa is building a new house.

408
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,972
What is the need? For all this fuss, mess?

409
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:17,342
He is thinking about your needs.

410
00:30:17,884 --> 00:30:19,215
There should be a big house.

411
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,316
Everyone has own independent room.

412
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,612
even I am..

413
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:29,954
Forget. You are here for a month more.

414
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:38,402
Tomorrow is the consecration.
Don't refuse..

415
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,263
Papa will feel better if you come along.

416
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:05,890
"The thing that you planned,
the world does not agree. "

417
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:09,158
"The dream is not there anymore. "

418
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,430
"You kept laughing, never knew any sorrow. "

419
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,437
"But no one remains your own now. "

420
00:31:16,776 --> 00:31:20,473
"Understand gradually, know this world. "

421
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,309
"Something can be done even now. "

422
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,814
"What will I do now Buddy. "

423
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,719
You haven't forgotten the way, I hope?

424
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:38,625
"What will I do now Buddy. "

425
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:43,466
I don't know where are we going?

426
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,637
Stop. Stop for a minute.

427
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:47,838
Go back, buddy.

428
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:58,206
Hold it! I find all the plots as same.

429
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:04,183
All the plots appear the same.

430
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:06,291
Where is the south?

431
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:09,052
This is the same place. Look, the board.

432
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,559
Yes, I had also seen the board.

433
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,405
But how come there is a wall here?

434
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:26,402
It's written "Do not pee here".

435
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,441
Have we come to pee here?

436
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,983
I think we have come to a different sector.

437
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:37,214
This way the whole day will pass away.

438
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:38,822
Can't we ask someone?

439
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:42,756
Hello. Hello.

440
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:44,126
Is any one here?

441
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:49,559
What is it?

442
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:54,600
Buddy, sector 30.. plot number.. - 32.

443
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,105
What?
- Where would plot number 32 be?

444
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,534
It is this same here.

445
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:02,412
Sector 30, plot number 32 is this same?

446
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,512
I told you it this one.
By the way, what do you want?

447
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,476
What do you mean what we want?
This plot belongs to us!

448
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:09,677
And who are you? -What?

449
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:12,824
Hey, who are you?
- I am the watchman.

450
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:16,186
Your plot?
This plot belongs to our Khurana sir.

451
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,557
Which Khurana sir? Who the hell is Khurana?

452
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:18,661
What is going on here?

453
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,297
He is the owner of this plot, who else?

454
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,124
You watch your mouth or..

455
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:24,963
Sir, why are you fighting with me?
I am just a guard.

456
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:26,604
Where will we find him?

457
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:29,366
I don't know that.
He comes over once a while.

458
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,873
You.. -Wait, wait, wait.

459
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:35,910
Lets go to Vijender, seems like a confusion.

460
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,013
He only can tell us.

461
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,309
Shall I wait, or leave?
- You keep sitting behind.

462
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,679
Two minutes and he wants to catch a flight.

463
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,722
Where is this Vijender?

464
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:51,493
Uncle, how do I know who is this Khurana?

465
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,621
What is this Vijender?

466
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:57,166
We bought the plot from you,
and you are saying you don't know?

467
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,371
Uncle, there are thousands of plots.

468
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:01,301
You cant expect me to keep tabs
who is building a wall on which plot.

469
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:03,338
How can I know? -Why?

470
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:06,907
Once you receive the money,
your responsibility is over?

471
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:09,343
Aunty.. - Forget aunty, speak with me!

472
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,516
That day you were banging away
counting the cash!

473
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,014
Politely tell us what the matter is,
otherwise we have..

474
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,413
.. other means to get the truth out of you.

475
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:19,981
Uncle-ji, the plot is in your name? -Yes!

476
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,351
Are the documents in your name?

477
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,357
The documents are there that is why..

478
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:27,362
You had taken the possession
by checking yourself?

479
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,690
What do you mean by taken?

480
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:29,993
You only had given us yourself.

481
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,737
Then uncle-ji, my job is done, isn't it?

482
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,843
It is your plot of land, so you will look after it.

483
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:39,511
But you..

484
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,509
Uncle-ji, please forgive me;
it is my lunchtime.

485
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,079
If you need any other help.
You let me know.

486
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:47,477
As it is you have other means too,
you can try them.

487
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,847
Hey come out!

488
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,884
Hey watchman! Come out!

489
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,927
Hey watchman!
Open the gate and come out.

490
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:09,568
What is the matter, sir?
Why are you shouting so much?

491
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,305
Brother, there was a watchman here..

492
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:14,638
.. where did he go? - No!

493
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:16,678
There is no watchman here! Only I am here.

494
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,577
You tell me, what is the matter?

495
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:23,153
One minute! Look here sir,
we do not have any enmity..

496
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,219
.. against you, but what I wanted to say is that..

497
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:26,015
Oh uncle, by having enmity with me..

498
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:27,317
.. are you going to thrash me?

499
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,290
Listen to me! Just go back two steps.

500
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:32,361
Go back! Go!

501
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,932
Brother, I would like to make a request to you.

502
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,364
This plot is mine on which at the moment you..

503
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:41,039
Brother, if this plot would have been yours..

504
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,105
.. then you would be standing here in my place.

505
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,936
And I would have been standing in your place.

506
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:45,838
Understood!

507
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,772
This plot belongs to Khurana sir.
- What? -Yes!

508
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,312
Where do we find him? -What?

509
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:00,190
My brother, you may find him anywhere else..

510
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,724
.. but he is not here. Understood!

511
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:04,895
Who are you?

512
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:08,129
I am your uncle, Ombir!

513
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:09,995
Now tell me what are you going to do?

514
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,329
Brother, when we are telling you that..

515
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:15,996
Hey uncle, when I do not want to listen to your talk..

516
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,774
.. what is the use of talking?

517
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:21,072
You will understand only
when your hands and legs will..

518
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,043
.. be broken in front of these ladies, is it?

519
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,382
"What shall we do now?"

520
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,288
"Where shall we go now?"

521
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,828
"What shall we do,
what shall we do now, my brother!"

522
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:42,431
What is the matter?

523
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,492
You saw how Vijayender was talking?

524
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:46,468
That day he was so nice and today you heard..

525
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:47,536
.. how he sounded?

526
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:51,509
What is there to see?
No, I want to know what is there to see?

527
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,011
You all have still not understood?

528
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:57,340
The whole day you are just talking
of the plot and nothing else.

529
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,607
Now go and do whatever you want.

530
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,614
The plot has been seized.

531
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:10,293
Yes, Mr. Vijayender,
what I was trying to tell you that..

532
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:12,862
.. in the morning we were in tension that is why..

533
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,464
.. we spoke a little rudely.

534
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,761
And you too unnecessarily took it to heart.

535
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:21,404
No! No, we had gone to the site.

536
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:23,798
Okay, are you in a hurry?

537
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:28,443
The thing is that if you could
introduce us to Mr. Khurana..

538
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,638
.. we could solve the misunderstanding.

539
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,339
I know that we are troubling you.

540
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,109
But you know when someone is in trouble..

541
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:38,950
.. then we think of only our near ones.

542
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:46,124
I am obliged, thank you!
Thank you! Thank you.

543
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,532
What was he saying?

544
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,997
He was a little angry
because of the afternoon talk.

545
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:55,233
Nobody has seized the land.

546
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:57,173
There is a misunderstanding.

547
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,378
Someone has taken it to be their land..

548
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,206
.. and built a wall there. - Papa!

549
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,876
Vijaynder was saying that every month someone..

550
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,945
...or the other does this blunder.

551
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,311
And then he apologizes.

552
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,451
Papa I think..

553
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:11,282
You have already voiced your thoughts.

554
00:38:11,924 --> 00:38:13,551
You go, you go to America!

555
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,052
As it is you know everything!

556
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:19,261
You already made a statement that
the land is seized.

557
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:21,830
Now you leave the rest to me.

558
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:24,160
You go and make arrangements..

559
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:26,434
.. to go back to America.

560
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:41,385
Then? -What then?

561
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,915
He must have again gone to that agent to beg.

562
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:46,346
You did not go?

563
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:48,254
What difference would it make me going there?

564
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,290
I don't know anything of all about this.

565
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:54,531
Anyway, I am going now.

566
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,223
What is the use of involving in all this now?

567
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:03,130
You tell me! You do not have
any rehearsals today? - No!

568
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,071
The Bangalore festival is going to
take place, isn't it?

569
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:08,707
Which play are you going to perform?

570
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:13,974
Cherry! How can you leave them
in the lurch and walk away?

571
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:15,317
Now what is wrong with you?

572
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:18,456
No! How can you just go?

573
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:22,354
Meghna, this job is of the
property agents and the brokers.

574
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,623
By me staying here,
nothing is going to get solved.

575
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,998
As it is the date of my return is almost fixed.

576
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:33,071
Cherry, you are right! You should go!

577
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,398
Meghna! - I am getting late; I have to go.

578
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,974
But you said that you don't have
any rehearsals today.

579
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:40,941
So can't I go anywhere else besides my rehearsals?

580
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:43,205
Where? - How does it matter to you?

581
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:44,245
Meghna, what is this?

582
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,645
Cherry, why are you wasting your time?

583
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:51,420
You have nothing left over here.
- Meghna! Meghna!

584
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:10,001
Yes, Mr. Vijayender-ji! Yes, one minute!

585
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:12,205
One minute! One minute! Yes, tell me

586
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:16,276
Go get a pen! Yes, one minute!
Please hold the line.

587
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,240
Bunty has gone to get the pen.

588
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:20,477
Yes, what were you saying?

589
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,352
Go take the car out.

590
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:27,184
"How much you were troubled?"

591
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:29,623
"How much work you have done?"

592
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,695
"Keep your heart tied down. "

593
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:34,927
"Now whatever has happened my brother. "

594
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:36,726
"Now what are we going to do?"

595
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,869
'Now we have to think of something. "

596
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:40,060
This is the Kharbanda farm.

597
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:44,801
"If you are smart enough
you will think of something. "

598
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,307
Baweja.. Baweja farm.

599
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,272
We are finding all the names, but we cannot find..

600
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:52,541
.. the name that we are searching.

601
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,819
Khurana farm! Khurana farm!

602
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,346
Is Mr. Khurana there?

603
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:00,289
Is Mr. Khurana there?

604
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:03,921
Yes, he is there; come we will go.

605
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,731
You do not reach on time.

606
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,493
Don't you have any work to do?

607
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,129
As it is you do not work and on top of that..

608
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:13,827
.. you give excuses.

609
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,472
I will not spare any one of you.

610
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,470
I will just have a word with Mr. Khurana.

611
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:20,110
No, he is not the one.

612
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:21,108
What do you think of yourself?

613
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:47,904
Madam-ji! -Yes!

614
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,308
How much more time will Mr. Khurana take?

615
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,902
You should have taken an appointment
and then come.

616
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:53,805
Madam, what are you talking?

617
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,105
I think he must be busy in some important work.

618
00:41:56,315 --> 00:41:57,509
He is doing the veneration.

619
00:42:00,419 --> 00:42:02,046
Uncle, please be seated.

620
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:10,325
Go and ask her, where shall we get water?

621
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,389
This time you go and ask.

622
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:18,696
And at least comb your hair.

623
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:25,135
What was I saying..

624
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:27,439
Who is Mr. Khosla here? -Yes!

625
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:30,138
Mr. Khurana! - No! My name is Munjal.

626
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:31,213
You did not meet him?

627
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,547
Go up and then go to the right
and then to the left.

628
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:34,241
Why are you sitting here?

629
00:42:34,453 --> 00:42:36,318
He was saying that they had
cut many vulgar scenes.

630
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:03,345
Uncle-ji! Kishen Khurana!

631
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:06,844
Kishen Khurana! K.K. Khosla!

632
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:09,686
How are you? - I am fine sir, you?

633
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:11,378
Has anyone offered you tea or coffee?

634
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:16,192
They did not ask you? Didn't they ask you?

635
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:17,920
Did they ask you or not?

636
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:18,755
No!

637
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:24,199
Sarvesh! Come! Come!

638
00:43:25,137 --> 00:43:26,570
How much do I pay you?

639
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:28,898
Tell me, how much do I pay you?

640
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,005
Three thousand!

641
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:32,267
Three thousand! Three thousand!

642
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,612
You scoundrel, will you take
fifty thousand to offer water?

643
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,213
All lazy people stay in this house.

644
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:41,349
Order me, uncle-ji! What would you like to have?

645
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,251
No! You have come here for the first time.

646
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,320
You will definitely have to take something.

647
00:43:45,524 --> 00:43:48,789
Water! -And you? - Pepsi!

648
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:05,899
Uncle-ji, tell me! What can I do for you?

649
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:11,071
Yes sir, that plot in New Sapna Vihar sector 30..

650
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:15,743
.. plot number.. - 32. -Yes 32.

651
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:17,255
That is ours sir!

652
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:18,920
That is yours?

653
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:28,593
Then take it! If it is yours, then take it.

654
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,437
Look here sir, that plot is in our name.

655
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,766
If you want you can check the documents.

656
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,271
Whom are you showing the documents to?

657
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,777
I can show you 100 documents..

658
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:41,605
.. against your one document.

659
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:43,610
Do you want to see?

660
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,948
Sir.. that plot..

661
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,619
What is there in the plot?

662
00:44:52,324 --> 00:44:54,952
It is just a piece of land. Am I going to take it away?

663
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:57,454
As you can see by the grace of 'Matarani'..

664
00:44:57,663 --> 00:44:59,290
.. I have everything here.

665
00:44:59,665 --> 00:45:00,962
There is nothing less!

666
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:04,791
This money, this land, everything will be left back.

667
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:08,305
We have come empty handed
and we will go also empty handed.

668
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:10,475
What do you say? -Yes, that is true.

669
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:14,138
The main happiness are the children.

670
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:20,142
We spend our entire life slogging
for the children.

671
00:45:20,352 --> 00:45:20,977
Yes sir, you are right!

672
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:23,154
My other son is a computer engineer.

673
00:45:23,355 --> 00:45:24,481
Sir, actually we are in a hurry.

674
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:26,485
Papa-ji has also left the car open.

675
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:28,319
So if we could please speak to the point.

676
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:29,994
Is it necessary for you speak in between?

677
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:40,999
Is he your son? He is good! Good!

678
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,509
He is short tempered!

679
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:48,345
Tell him to pray and meditate.

680
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:51,512
Twice a day you recite
'Vaishanav devi's' name.

681
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,013
It will help you.

682
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:58,386
I will tell you one thing, uncle.

683
00:45:58,657 --> 00:46:00,056
Your son is at least sitting with you.

684
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:05,226
My son feels ashamed to sit with me.

685
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:09,733
We have given birth to you;
we have brought you up.

686
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:11,227
Nursed you when you were sick.

687
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,734
And you feel ashamed to sit
with your father?

688
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,068
Bloody snakes!

689
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:23,576
Khosla sir, you and me will talk, okay?

690
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:28,084
You go and see what happened
to your Pepsi, go!

691
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:45,394
Sir, actually I..

692
00:46:45,604 --> 00:46:47,731
Who gave you the address
of the friend's colony?

693
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:52,239
Mr. Vijayendra-ji, of the world
famous properties.

694
00:46:52,444 --> 00:46:56,574
Vijayender! Vijayender! How is he?

695
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:59,578
He is absolutely fine! We have become
good friends now.

696
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:01,910
He was the one who did the deal of our plot.

697
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,917
Very good!

698
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:06,749
So uncle-ji! You do like this!

699
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,426
You talk to Vijayender only.

700
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:15,600
I did not understand?

701
00:47:19,805 --> 00:47:21,432
Uncle-ji, your work is done.

702
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,765
This is the first time in so many years..

703
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:25,772
.. that Mr. Khurana in the first meeting
has told someone..

704
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:26,944
.. that this is your plot.

705
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:29,273
He was praising you a lot.

706
00:47:29,481 --> 00:47:31,779
He said that whatever Vijayender
says would be done.

707
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:35,116
How much is the worth of this plot?

708
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,778
You know it! All together it must be
around 30 lacks.

709
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:45,623
30 lacks! So we should start from 15.
- What? What?

710
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:47,125
Do you want us to pay 15 lacks
for our own land?

711
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:52,463
You just forget that this is your plot.

712
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:55,306
Now you have to think that you are
buying the plot..

713
00:47:55,507 --> 00:47:56,474
.. from Mr. Khurana again.

714
00:47:57,843 --> 00:48:00,311
Look here! If you get this 15 lacks.

715
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:02,480
That means you have got half the rate
from the market price.

716
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:04,478
And what better deal can you ask for?

717
00:48:04,683 --> 00:48:05,650
Do you know what you are saying?

718
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:08,649
You mean to say that we have to pay
15 lacks for our own land?

719
00:48:08,854 --> 00:48:10,481
Your land? And put your hand down.

720
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:11,485
What do you mean by put your
hands down?

721
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,315
You think we are fools?

722
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:13,489
You listen to me.. you keep
your hand down.

723
00:48:13,692 --> 00:48:15,489
You are showing me your hand
every now and then.

724
00:48:15,694 --> 00:48:16,991
This is our everyday job! Understood.

725
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:18,490
Uncle-ji, please make him understand.

726
00:48:18,697 --> 00:48:19,493
Rest I your wish.

727
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:24,165
And in such a price where do you get
a land like this?

728
00:48:26,705 --> 00:48:28,832
You think and let me know. 15 lacks.

729
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,007
For what are we supposed
to pay 15 lacks?

730
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,176
As if he will demand and we will give him.

731
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:33,844
If you listen to me, then there is only one way..

732
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:35,012
.. to handle such people.

733
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:36,009
What is it?

734
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:38,011
There is a community of wrestlers in Dev Nagar.

735
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:39,342
They have a very good reputation.

736
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:41,678
They can vacate anything, house, building or land.

737
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:43,013
If you say so, then I will go and find out.

738
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:44,848
My dear son, we are middle class people.

739
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:47,024
All this fight and quarrelling is
not our cup of tea.

740
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,022
Then give 15 lacks if you have.

741
00:48:50,729 --> 00:48:53,857
Khosla sir! Khosla sir!

742
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,033
No! Please do not get depressed.

743
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,032
Bhabhi, at least you make him understand.

744
00:49:02,908 --> 00:49:05,877
They have snatched away the savings
of my life, Mr. Sahani.

745
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:07,708
My land!

746
00:49:07,913 --> 00:49:11,041
It will not go anywhere! Nothing
will happen to our plot.

747
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:15,879
Cherry dear, you get ready!

748
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:17,054
We will go to the police station.

749
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:18,889
We are going to the police station.

750
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:26,563
Now sir-ji, you only tell us

751
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:29,893
If some comes and seizes your property.

752
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:31,227
Then what will a decent man do?

753
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:33,233
First of all you stop calling me Sir-ji.

754
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,565
Khosla sir is like my father.

755
00:49:35,774 --> 00:49:37,742
Thank you! Thank you my son! Thank you!

756
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:40,912
Uncle, even I am from a middle class
family like you.

757
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:42,238
Even I am earning a salary.

758
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,573
I can understand your pain.

759
00:49:43,782 --> 00:49:47,411
Actually after listening to some
rumours about the police..

760
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:48,244
.. people do not come to us for help.

761
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:50,421
And finally they have to bear their own loss.

762
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:52,589
These are very normal cases.

763
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:54,918
In this you have to go once and be a little stern..

764
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,594
.. to the party who has seized the land. That's it!

765
00:49:57,796 --> 00:49:59,923
What is the price of your land?

766
00:50:00,465 --> 00:50:02,933
Including the registration and everything..

767
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:06,103
.. it comes to around 30 lacks.

768
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:07,931
Ad how much is he demanding?

769
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,106
15 lacks!

770
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:15,112
What is his address?

771
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,610
You come along with me right away.

772
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:18,950
I will slap him and finalise the deal in 10 lacks.

773
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:21,782
You give me 2 lacks.

774
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:25,285
10 plus 2 is 12! So your deal
will be finalised in 12 lacks.

775
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,616
Even then you are still in profit with 3 lacks.

776
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,625
You are happy and I am happy.

777
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,955
Uncle you will be finished, but the case wont be.

778
00:50:33,832 --> 00:50:35,459
It is better to pacify Khurana in 15 minutes..

779
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,464
.. rather than to pacify the judge in 15 years.

780
00:50:38,837 --> 00:50:40,805
If you say so then I can talk it out in 14 lacks.

781
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:43,975
Khosla sir, there is nothing to worry.

782
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:46,303
Khurana is our man.

783
00:50:47,178 --> 00:50:49,146
I will finalise your deal in 12 or 13.

784
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:51,982
The rest you can donate to the party fund.

785
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,980
We will do as much as we can.

786
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:59,316
Strikes, agitations, public interest litigations.

787
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:01,992
Then they will automatically
come down to 12 lacks.

788
00:51:02,193 --> 00:51:06,323
And then you can decide how much
of donation to give.

789
00:51:23,715 --> 00:51:24,181
Hello!

790
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:26,509
Mr. Chironjilal! Aasif Iqbal!

791
00:51:26,718 --> 00:51:27,844
Do you want to go to America or not?

792
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:36,226
They must have built a wall.

793
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,224
Only with mud or with bricks?

794
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,069
Here! Sign here!

795
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:51,571
How much have they demanded?
Fifty percent?

796
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:58,349
Are you going to give them?

797
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,147
From where are you too going to give?

798
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,989
What is your fathers age? - 56.

799
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:11,495
He must be about to retire?

800
00:52:11,763 --> 00:52:13,822
He has one more year.

801
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,328
He must have invested all
his provident fund money.

802
00:52:20,038 --> 00:52:21,665
And you too are going to America.

803
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:23,498
You are going to America, isn't it?

804
00:52:23,775 --> 00:52:26,676
What do you think that I am filling
this form for nothing?

805
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:28,838
Yes, sign here!

806
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:32,511
What name did you say? Khurana!

807
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:37,017
It may be, Khurana or it may be Baweja.

808
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:38,348
What are you going to do about it?

809
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:41,191
I do not know about, Baweja.

810
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:44,354
But if it is, Khurana, then I can do
a lot many things.

811
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,701
Look here, boss! Your job is to
issue a visa to me.

812
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:52,870
I am paying you the concerned money.

813
00:52:53,071 --> 00:52:55,369
Do not try and interfere in between.

814
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:56,540
You will not get anything.

815
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:15,558
And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Oh my God!

816
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,556
I don't think I will be able to do it.

817
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:18,558
Don't be silly! You will get it
in 5 minutes.

818
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:20,726
No, I will not be able to do it.

819
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:21,891
Meghna, listen!

820
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:24,060
I have a friend in New York.

821
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,066
He has an Indian Theatre Group there.
- So?

822
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:27,563
You did not understand?

823
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,739
He needs actors like you.

824
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:33,068
Don't you? Don't you need me?

825
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:34,240
Do you or don't you?

826
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:36,409
No, you don't!

827
00:53:48,193 --> 00:53:49,091
Come we will go!

828
00:53:49,294 --> 00:53:50,261
Why sir, don't you want to go?

829
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:52,429
No, it is okay! We will go!

830
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,096
Where are you barging inside?

831
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,096
Do you think it is your fathers house?

832
00:54:03,141 --> 00:54:05,439
Hey Dharampal brother, he is my brother,
let him come in.

833
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:06,268
He is my brother.

834
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:08,945
Is he your brother? Okay! Come in.

835
00:54:13,151 --> 00:54:13,776
Come in! Come in!

836
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:21,124
Hey you wrestlers, what is this?

837
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:22,122
Your plates are empty.

838
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:23,294
Take some more! Take some more!

839
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,119
Hey you all do not fill your stomach
too much.

840
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:28,290
At night you all have to stay awake.

841
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:29,966
Guru-ji, one sweet will not matter much.

842
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:36,463
A wrestler should always stay fit.

843
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:38,308
You go in! -What is this mummy?

844
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:39,969
I said you go in!

845
00:54:42,013 --> 00:54:43,640
Aunty-ji! - Not now later!

846
00:54:43,915 --> 00:54:46,475
Mr. Khosla! Come here!

847
00:54:49,254 --> 00:54:51,154
Come and sit down.

848
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,324
See, I will show you.

849
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:55,818
See this, this is 300 square feet bungalow.

850
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:57,494
We emptied it in three days.

851
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:59,159
Three lacks fees!

852
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:03,997
And this is two rooms flat;
we emptied it in 8 hours.

853
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,499
And this is the bungalow
of the MP.

854
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:08,331
We emptied it in 3 hours.

855
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:12,506
But for this our Balbir Singh
had to go to jail.

856
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,508
Now it is okay that you do not
have the money.

857
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:17,180
But give us the money for winning.

858
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:21,852
Uncle-ji, you do not worry!

859
00:55:22,053 --> 00:55:24,021
Even Hanuman could not lift
a mountain so quickly..

860
00:55:24,222 --> 00:55:25,348
.. as quickly as we can vacate a land.

861
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:26,523
Hail Lord Human!

862
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:28,521
Break the enemies bones.

863
00:55:33,231 --> 00:55:35,028
"These damsels are gorgeous. "

864
00:55:35,233 --> 00:55:37,201
"The monkeys went and sat there. "

865
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:39,370
"They think that they are very great. "

866
00:55:39,737 --> 00:55:45,869
"These gorgeous girls care
a damn for the world. "

867
00:55:46,077 --> 00:55:47,704
Uncle, what do you do?

868
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:49,880
I am doing a job!

869
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:50,877
Will you drink milk?

870
00:55:56,254 --> 00:55:59,052
Here take uncle; you strike first! - Me?

871
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:02,722
Why don't you do it?

872
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:04,224
A rule is a rule!

873
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:05,555
Come on hit hard!

874
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:13,070
Oh uncle-ji! If you hit like this,
then your hand will break.

875
00:56:13,271 --> 00:56:15,239
See, this is how you hit!

876
00:56:28,286 --> 00:56:29,753
Hit hard! Hit hard! Very good!

877
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:54,000
You go and sit in the car, I will get you some water.

878
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:17,334
Uncle-ji, what do you say?

879
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:18,331
Is it as it was before?

880
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:20,333
It is the same!

881
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:21,835
Hail Lord Hanuman!

882
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:23,666
Break the bones of the enemy.

883
00:57:39,056 --> 00:57:42,355
Mr. Khosla! You did an amazing job
in the night.

884
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,686
You did not even inform me?

885
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,029
He did not even give me the time.

886
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:49,358
Everything was over before I
could even think.

887
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:51,865
And Khurana's men?

888
00:57:52,737 --> 00:57:54,034
You should have seen their state.

889
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:57,206
They thought that their wall
has collapsed on their head.

890
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:58,542
They all ran away.

891
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:00,369
You take a wash!

892
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:01,203
Had Cherry also gone with you all?

893
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:02,208
Of course he too had come.

894
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:03,038
Now he is having a shower.

895
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:04,214
He does not like mud!

896
00:58:05,082 --> 00:58:07,380
He too had gone?
What did I tell you?

897
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:12,211
K.K. Khosla! -Yes!

898
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:13,390
Who is Mr. K. K. Khosla?

899
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,061
I am Balwant Khosla.

900
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:19,729
I am K. K. Khosla! Tell me!

901
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:20,898
Come with me to the station.

902
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:23,233
For what?

903
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:25,068
There is a report against you.

904
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:26,395
Regarding what?

905
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:29,232
To capture Kishen Khurana's
land last night.

906
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,739
Inspector sir, from where did you
get this wrong report?

907
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:34,411
He owns this land.

908
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:36,239
The land is mine.
I have purchased it.

909
00:58:36,447 --> 00:58:38,074
If you want I can show you
the documents.

910
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:38,748
I have them with me.

911
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,247
Leave the documents aside
and come along with me.

912
00:58:40,485 --> 00:58:41,076
But I..

913
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,912
Inspector sir.. -You stay away.
Stay away!

914
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:45,088
I told you to stay away!

915
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:50,823
Cherry!

916
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,495
"Now you will have to pay. "

917
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,665
"You may live or you may die. "

918
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:57,994
"You will have to struggle for life. "

919
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:01,831
Cherry! Cherry!

920
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:07,339
Khosla sir! Khosla sir!

921
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:09,342
"Now what will you do my brother?"

922
00:59:09,547 --> 00:59:11,344
"Where will you go my brother?"

923
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:29,399
"Now what will you do?
What will you do my brother?"

924
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:43,510
False documents.. attempt to murder..

925
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,517
.. and two counts of horticulture act.

926
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:50,016
I have heard, he has cut down
two trees also.

927
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:52,348
But sir. -Already so many charges.

928
00:59:52,557 --> 00:59:55,355
And the other party is yet
to let loose there lawyer!

929
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,358
This is absurd! It's them who
has illegally occupied.

930
00:59:58,563 --> 00:59:59,860
So did you file the report?

931
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:01,361
Yes, we had gone to the headquarter.

932
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:03,533
Then why have you come here?

933
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:06,862
Go there! Do you have any relative there?

934
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:10,040
The trouble happened in our area,
we got to be involved.

935
01:00:10,308 --> 01:00:11,866
Do I have to spell it out to you?

936
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:12,872
Excuse me, just a minute.

937
01:00:13,578 --> 01:00:15,375
The plot is ours, and the papers
are in our name.

938
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:18,377
Then how can you lock him
on their complaint?

939
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:21,550
I can lock him without any complaint,
what can you do?

940
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:23,045
What do you mean?

941
01:00:23,254 --> 01:00:25,552
I'll tell you the meaning inside,
in the language you understand!

942
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:28,224
Don't boast of your English,
you impertinent fool!

943
01:00:28,426 --> 01:00:29,222
You can't talk to me like that!

944
01:00:29,427 --> 01:00:30,553
What do you think of yourself?

945
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:31,557
I'll show you the way you talk, you punk!

946
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,059
Get out! - Bloody corrupted,
bribe takers!

947
01:00:33,264 --> 01:00:34,231
You call yourself the Police!

948
01:00:34,432 --> 01:00:35,399
What do you think of yourself!

949
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,396
I am taking your age into consideration.

950
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,231
Or it will be the father and son
in the slammer!

951
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:45,405
This is a lock up, not an zoo.

952
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,078
Go away from here. Go!

953
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:50,080
Please, cool down, sir. - Sorry

954
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:52,579
What sorry?
- He's a kid, sir. A kid.

955
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:55,251
If he is a kid, leave him at home,
not on my head.

956
01:00:55,453 --> 01:00:57,080
Now everything is in your hands,
only you can do something.

957
01:00:57,288 --> 01:00:58,915
You say what needs to be done.

958
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:00,920
What is there to do? We will keep him
in the lock up..

959
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,422
.. till the other party arrives.

960
01:01:02,627 --> 01:01:06,427
No sir, can't you let him go now,
and call us when they arrive?

961
01:01:06,631 --> 01:01:08,599
Is it not possible I break your leg?

962
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,936
Give them an inch and they want a mile?

963
01:01:13,704 --> 01:01:14,762
Go and wait outside!

964
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,608
It's all my fault.

965
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:24,944
I should not have got the wrestlers..

966
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:26,275
.. then this complaint wouldn't
have been there.

967
01:01:35,326 --> 01:01:39,285
Papa has not even had a drop of water.
- Did he eat?

968
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:41,957
I offered, but he did not eat.

969
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:48,968
Papa is inside the lock up
because of me.

970
01:01:59,016 --> 01:02:00,984
Cherry.. I am telling you as an elder brother.

971
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:04,150
You take off for America..

972
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,658
.. you don't get involved
and spoil your career.

973
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:12,988
These problems will keep going on..

974
01:02:17,535 --> 01:02:19,162
I will take care of this.

975
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:23,332
You go.

976
01:02:41,669 --> 01:02:44,866
Are you K.K.'s son? -Yes.

977
01:02:45,606 --> 01:02:48,234
I am Munjal. Khurana sir
has sent me.

978
01:02:48,576 --> 01:02:51,044
Come, lets get your papa
released, come.

979
01:03:01,755 --> 01:03:03,222
Khosla sir, good morning. Sir.

980
01:03:10,264 --> 01:03:13,062
O Khosla sir, I am sorry.

981
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:16,569
I am sorry, Khosla sir. I am sorry.

982
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:18,902
Did you have some tea?

983
01:03:20,608 --> 01:03:23,076
Khurana sir has personally called
from Vaishnodevi.

984
01:03:23,277 --> 01:03:27,077
Nothing wrong should happen
with Khosla sir.

985
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:29,908
He sent me here to settle things
and then call him.

986
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:33,586
But even you committed a mistake.

987
01:03:33,787 --> 01:03:34,583
By calling wrestlers to settle things.

988
01:03:34,788 --> 01:03:37,916
When the matter could be solved
by talking, what was the use?

989
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:41,420
Khosla sir, these property matters
are complicated..

990
01:03:41,629 --> 01:03:42,596
.. that they cannot be settled later.

991
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:45,257
Khurana sir has 20 cases going on.

992
01:03:45,466 --> 01:03:47,263
He will appoint one lawyer

993
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:51,104
You have done magic on Khurana sir.

994
01:03:51,305 --> 01:03:57,608
He loves you. He said if Khosla
is ready to offer..

995
01:03:57,811 --> 01:04:01,269
.. 12 lakhs, he personally will come
for the house warming ceremony.

996
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:03,645
12 lakhs! Great discount!

997
01:04:03,784 --> 01:04:05,012
Papa.

998
01:04:06,654 --> 01:04:08,451
Now finish off this drama. Ok?

999
01:04:12,993 --> 01:04:14,119
Khurana sir loves you.

1000
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:20,960
Doesn't matter, you are back home,
even the plot will come.

1001
01:04:21,669 --> 01:04:24,968
Sahani sir, I don't want the plot.

1002
01:04:25,172 --> 01:04:26,969
But, papa. Why don't you want the plot?

1003
01:04:27,174 --> 01:04:28,300
I said, that's it!

1004
01:04:34,848 --> 01:04:35,974
Cherry is anyways leaving..

1005
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:39,318
.. even Nikki will get married and leave.

1006
01:04:41,522 --> 01:04:46,482
This house is big enough for us both.
We don't need any plot.

1007
01:04:46,694 --> 01:04:48,662
Papa, just one minute.. - Enough.

1008
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:56,495
Cherry brother, there is some one
to meet you.

1009
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:06,835
The other day you came home,
but didn't come up?

1010
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:10,009
Sorry, I saw you.

1011
01:05:11,218 --> 01:05:14,847
Dad ran into a spot of trouble..

1012
01:05:15,889 --> 01:05:17,186
What about the plot?

1013
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,537
I don't know why..

1014
01:05:35,576 --> 01:05:37,703
If papa does not get the land back,
he will be a broken man.

1015
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,377
I have to get the plot for him.

1016
01:05:44,084 --> 01:05:45,381
Before I go to New York.

1017
01:05:48,255 --> 01:05:51,053
Good. Need help?

1018
01:05:56,263 --> 01:05:59,892
Cherry, are you sure?
You think this man can help you?

1019
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:03,728
I don't know, he was saying
something about Khurana.

1020
01:06:07,775 --> 01:06:09,402
Mr. Chironji Lal?

1021
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:13,739
This is Asif. - Iqbal Asif.

1022
01:06:14,181 --> 01:06:15,580
There is time for you to leave?

1023
01:06:17,518 --> 01:06:19,418
Kiddo, park it.

1024
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:25,918
It's my own. Easy for conveyance.

1025
01:06:28,896 --> 01:06:30,329
Tell me how can I help you?

1026
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:39,533
You had said.. you had offered help
in Khurana matter.

1027
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:42,105
If you need help, just ask.

1028
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:44,002
Will you have tea?

1029
01:06:45,379 --> 01:06:47,176
Whatever Khurana has done with you..

1030
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:52,512
.. Khurana and me used to do
the same with others.

1031
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:54,516
I have worked with him for seven years.

1032
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:56,848
Were you working with
Khurana previously?

1033
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:00,686
That's what I thought.

1034
01:07:02,896 --> 01:07:05,194
But that devil has never any kin.

1035
01:07:08,102 --> 01:07:10,536
I had an ancestral land
in Saharanpur.

1036
01:07:12,573 --> 01:07:14,370
His eyes fell on that,

1037
01:07:15,742 --> 01:07:17,039
And I could not do anything.

1038
01:07:17,878 --> 01:07:19,709
he took it away in front of my eyes.

1039
01:07:22,082 --> 01:07:24,050
Then.. Khurana continued climbing..

1040
01:07:30,757 --> 01:07:32,224
.. and I started slipping down.

1041
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:40,396
Anyway, forget about me.
Do you need help?

1042
01:07:46,607 --> 01:07:51,067
If Khurana has your land,
he must have the papers too.

1043
01:07:51,278 --> 01:07:53,246
When we have the papers,
how can they be with him?

1044
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,748
I used to get the papers
made for him then.

1045
01:07:55,949 --> 01:07:58,577
Now it must be some one else.
It's easy.

1046
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:01,917
Because you don't have any option
in the legal war.

1047
01:08:03,123 --> 01:08:06,923
The fastest way is to pay and get it
back from him.

1048
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:10,927
Wow! That's some help. We wouldn't be here
if we had the money.

1049
01:08:11,965 --> 01:08:15,093
Where will we get it from?
We will rob some one.

1050
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:21,930
Good idea. Why don't you rob
Khurana itself?

1051
01:08:22,142 --> 01:08:24,440
Come on, Asif dear. One second,
one second.

1052
01:08:24,811 --> 01:08:25,937
How?

1053
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,608
Look, Khurana weakness is
his greed for land.

1054
01:08:29,983 --> 01:08:32,781
Why don't you sell him a dinky little
chunk of land?

1055
01:08:33,053 --> 01:08:34,953
If we had land to sell with us, then..

1056
01:08:35,155 --> 01:08:38,283
Sir, India is the worlds seventh largest
country in terms of land.

1057
01:08:38,492 --> 01:08:40,960
There's land every where,
you leave it to me.

1058
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:43,129
You mean we sell him any plot of land?

1059
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:45,298
Why any? We will sell him a nice one.

1060
01:08:45,499 --> 01:08:46,295
But who will sell it?

1061
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:53,803
Not sell.. pretend to sell.
We did it often.

1062
01:08:54,841 --> 01:09:01,144
Just find a sophisticated looking guy,
who can also act.

1063
01:09:01,348 --> 01:09:04,476
Asif buddy, we came to you
to solve our problem..

1064
01:09:04,685 --> 01:09:06,312
.. and you are involving us in a new problem.

1065
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,987
From where could we find such a man...

1066
01:09:14,027 --> 01:09:18,487
Dear Chiranuji Lal.. you have to find
the right solution to the right problem.

1067
01:09:19,433 --> 01:09:21,333
Think. Think.

1068
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:29,835
You.. are you Ok?

1069
01:09:30,377 --> 01:09:33,005
Bapu, are you afraid of acting?

1070
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:35,681
No, I am afraid of consequences.

1071
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:39,010
What you are planning, it is called fraud!

1072
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:41,346
And what Khurana has done with us,
what will you call that?

1073
01:09:43,056 --> 01:09:44,683
Bapu, you yourself say..

1074
01:09:44,891 --> 01:09:48,520
.. that don't act just for money,
but for a cause.

1075
01:09:48,895 --> 01:09:53,696
Bapu, Cherry's dad.. what could be
an better cause?

1076
01:09:54,067 --> 01:09:56,695
Bapu, you are acting for nothing
since 30 years.

1077
01:09:56,903 --> 01:09:59,201
Now, act for some ones good.

1078
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:04,536
What if something goes wrong?

1079
01:10:05,078 --> 01:10:08,707
Bapu, I have never seen you making
mistakes while acting.

1080
01:10:08,915 --> 01:10:10,883
A person who himself stays
in a rented home..

1081
01:10:11,084 --> 01:10:13,552
.. what will he know about land
and property?

1082
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,717
You leave that on me.

1083
01:10:16,423 --> 01:10:17,720
This is Asif.

1084
01:10:30,404 --> 01:10:32,804
Can I smoke? - Ok.

1085
01:10:47,888 --> 01:10:54,020
Bill Gates, look. I am doing this
for her. - Thank you.

1086
01:10:54,227 --> 01:10:55,353
And she is doing it for you.

1087
01:11:04,071 --> 01:11:06,869
The man who cons 100 people in a day..

1088
01:11:08,241 --> 01:11:10,368
.. you want to con that man.

1089
01:11:13,246 --> 01:11:18,206
I had always thought of you as
a sensible person, if nothing else.

1090
01:11:20,253 --> 01:11:23,552
Now that everything is over,
he has come to his senses.

1091
01:11:23,924 --> 01:11:25,551
I don't want anybody's favor.

1092
01:11:25,926 --> 01:11:27,223
The question of favor doesn't arise.

1093
01:11:27,427 --> 01:11:29,224
He wants to help you. And you..

1094
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:30,555
You call this as help?

1095
01:11:31,098 --> 01:11:33,225
We still haven't recovered
from the wrestler's trouble.

1096
01:11:33,433 --> 01:11:35,401
And now he wants to bring
a travelling circus.

1097
01:11:35,602 --> 01:11:37,229
This is not help.
This is foolishness!

1098
01:11:37,437 --> 01:11:39,064
And who told him to help me?

1099
01:11:39,339 --> 01:11:41,569
He has already decided!

1100
01:11:41,775 --> 01:11:42,571
Where he wants to live,
what he wants to do..

1101
01:11:42,776 --> 01:11:43,902
.. where he wants to go?

1102
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:44,907
Then let him do as he wishes!

1103
01:11:45,112 --> 01:11:46,409
There is no need to increase our..

1104
01:11:46,613 --> 01:11:48,410
.. and his troubles by helping us!

1105
01:11:59,493 --> 01:12:00,289
What has happened to you?

1106
01:12:00,494 --> 01:12:02,462
Me? What has happened to me?

1107
01:12:02,662 --> 01:12:03,788
Why did you talk to him like this?

1108
01:12:03,997 --> 01:12:07,125
I will talk to him the way I want!
I have lost my land!

1109
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:08,301
My house has not being built!

1110
01:12:08,502 --> 01:12:11,960
I had to go to the prison! Now you will
teach me how to talk?

1111
01:12:12,172 --> 01:12:14,140
You always misunderstand him.

1112
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:17,799
I don't care what he means to say!
Now you listen to me!

1113
01:12:18,512 --> 01:12:21,640
I have decided that I don't want
that land!

1114
01:12:21,848 --> 01:12:23,816
I don't want it! I don't want it!
That's it!

1115
01:12:24,184 --> 01:12:27,153
The matter is over! Understood!

1116
01:12:31,024 --> 01:12:34,323
There is no harm in listening to
what he is saying.

1117
01:12:34,694 --> 01:12:37,663
Mr. Sahani, there is no harm to me.
He will be harmed.

1118
01:12:38,532 --> 01:12:41,160
The whole of his childhood he studied
and reached to this level.

1119
01:12:41,368 --> 01:12:43,165
Now he wants to go to America.

1120
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,167
And look what is going on in his mind.

1121
01:12:46,039 --> 01:12:48,007
I lost my plot. Fine, I have forgotten it.

1122
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:51,173
But I can't endure to see his career
being ruined.

1123
01:12:51,378 --> 01:12:53,005
His career is not being ruined.

1124
01:12:53,213 --> 01:12:54,510
Yes, Mr. Sahani.

1125
01:12:55,715 --> 01:12:58,684
If a professional is caught doing
such a thing..

1126
01:12:58,885 --> 01:13:00,682
.. then he has to carry the stigma
for the rest of his life.

1127
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:04,015
What's stigma! What's wrong in recovering
what belongs to you?

1128
01:13:04,224 --> 01:13:06,351
And nowadays nobody think
about such things.

1129
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,187
Everybody is concerned about
themselves.

1130
01:13:08,728 --> 01:13:13,028
Mr. Sahani, he doesn't know how
these people are. I know.

1131
01:13:14,734 --> 01:13:18,192
Mr. Khosla, the whole life you grieved
that your son..

1132
01:13:18,405 --> 01:13:21,033
.. doesn't support you in your good
and bad times.

1133
01:13:21,508 --> 01:13:25,342
When he's extending support now
why are you suspecting his intention?

1134
01:13:25,579 --> 01:13:28,207
What has to happen, it will happen
in front of you.

1135
01:13:28,415 --> 01:13:31,384
Just wait and watch. But let him try.

1136
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:41,053
Papa, he is Bapu. He is Asif. Asif Iqbal.

1137
01:13:41,261 --> 01:13:43,388
And this is Meghna. - Greetings.

1138
01:13:53,773 --> 01:13:55,240
You are with Khurana?

1139
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:58,578
Yes. - Then..

1140
01:13:58,812 --> 01:14:02,077
Papa, even he had a plot like us.

1141
01:14:08,622 --> 01:14:12,752
And you? Sir, you.. at this age too
you are listening to them?

1142
01:14:13,026 --> 01:14:17,759
There is no age to pay heed
to your children, Mr. Khosala.

1143
01:14:20,133 --> 01:14:24,763
And you.. why are you doing
so much for us?

1144
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:26,268
I.. I.. -What?

1145
01:14:26,473 --> 01:14:28,600
I.. uncle.. I mean..

1146
01:14:28,842 --> 01:14:33,279
Papa.. she is my friend. - Thanks.

1147
01:14:50,463 --> 01:14:52,431
I've been to the prison once.

1148
01:14:54,968 --> 01:14:57,766
I don't have the strength to go
to the prison again.

1149
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:02,099
And I can't face any other hardship
in my house.

1150
01:15:04,144 --> 01:15:05,771
The rest is up to you.

1151
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:18,787
No matter what papa says.
But listen to one thing.

1152
01:15:19,926 --> 01:15:20,790
Before doing anything arrange for..

1153
01:15:20,994 --> 01:15:23,462
.. a shack in Rishikesh for
papa and me.

1154
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:26,130
So that if the police comes,
then we will have a hideout.

1155
01:15:32,339 --> 01:15:35,797
You want some tea? - No. Just
some water please.

1156
01:15:45,418 --> 01:15:49,821
The plot owner should look like
an affluent man.

1157
01:15:51,024 --> 01:15:54,824
And somebody who can't be traced.
NRl type.

1158
01:15:57,364 --> 01:15:58,331
America.

1159
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,827
Canada. Australia!

1160
01:16:07,073 --> 01:16:07,539
Dubai!

1161
01:16:10,877 --> 01:16:12,504
Dubai!

1162
01:16:12,779 --> 01:16:16,840
Wow, Buntu! Not bad!

1163
01:16:17,884 --> 01:16:19,681
Don't people have beard in Dubai?

1164
01:16:19,886 --> 01:16:21,854
They do. But you don't have one.
- Why?

1165
01:16:22,822 --> 01:16:25,290
Because you look smarter like this.

1166
01:16:25,358 --> 01:16:27,258
Now shut up and shave

1167
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,657
What are you doing?

1168
01:16:29,663 --> 01:16:34,157
We need to hire a luxurious car.. and a driver.

1169
01:16:35,168 --> 01:16:36,260
I'll arrange for it.

1170
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:47,005
And his name will be.. Sethi. NRl Sethi.

1171
01:16:49,282 --> 01:16:53,048
He has come from Dubai.
He is staying in a 5 star hotel.

1172
01:16:55,055 --> 01:16:55,885
He has 2 mobile phones.

1173
01:16:56,489 --> 01:16:57,979
But that number can be traced.

1174
01:16:59,259 --> 01:17:00,749
We'll get 2 SIM cards from Dubai.

1175
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,987
If we called anybody, then
the number of that place will be flashed.

1176
01:17:03,129 --> 01:17:03,686
Brilliant!

1177
01:17:05,165 --> 01:17:08,464
I know guys there. But why two?

1178
01:17:09,502 --> 01:17:11,902
Such a big party doesn't talk to
a person directly.

1179
01:17:12,305 --> 01:17:18,266
He tells others. We need a secretary!
Am I right, ma'am?

1180
01:17:18,645 --> 01:17:21,375
Bapu, there was a call from Bangalore.

1181
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:22,640
They need 2 more shows.

1182
01:17:22,882 --> 01:17:24,577
And that Govind's mother is still not well.

1183
01:17:24,751 --> 01:17:25,877
So I have fixed Kishore.

1184
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:27,984
I still haven't spoken to the hotel guys.

1185
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:34,754
What?

1186
01:17:36,162 --> 01:17:38,426
We have got a nice role for you.
Will you do it?

1187
01:17:38,965 --> 01:17:43,334
The costumes have arrived.
Mercedes is also there.

1188
01:17:45,805 --> 01:17:48,035
Now its up to you and Bapu, Mani.

1189
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:50,402
I will handle it. Don't worry.

1190
01:17:51,845 --> 01:17:52,937
Thanks.

1191
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,110
What thanks? If not for Bapu,
then I would have been..

1192
01:17:55,315 --> 01:17:57,442
.. selling eggs at Mughalsarai station.

1193
01:17:58,151 --> 01:17:59,948
Come on. This is better.

1194
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,781
If you want to trap the big fish..
then first trap the small fish.

1195
01:18:05,425 --> 01:18:07,154
The big fish will come on it's own.

1196
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:10,190
What do you mean? -Vijayander.

1197
01:18:13,733 --> 01:18:15,667
Sir, you have called at the right place.

1198
01:18:15,902 --> 01:18:17,369
Yes, sir. You don't worry.

1199
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:18,867
There will be a queue of buyers, sir.

1200
01:18:19,072 --> 01:18:20,369
Sir, I am a genuine party.

1201
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:22,268
Yes! What?

1202
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:25,273
Party, sir? Yes, sir.

1203
01:18:25,812 --> 01:18:27,712
Sir, the party will come. Yes, sir.

1204
01:18:27,947 --> 01:18:30,939
Whenever you want! No, no, sir!

1205
01:18:31,518 --> 01:18:33,952
10 means 10! Okay, sir!

1206
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:36,450
Okay, sir! Okay!

1207
01:18:41,995 --> 01:18:45,396
"Something is happening. "

1208
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:47,395
"Something is happening. "

1209
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,465
"Something is happening. "

1210
01:18:49,669 --> 01:18:51,398
"Day! Day! Day! Day. "

1211
01:18:51,604 --> 01:18:52,764
"Something is happening. "

1212
01:18:52,972 --> 01:18:56,772
Remember.. broker.. party. Broker.. party.

1213
01:18:56,976 --> 01:19:00,776
Its 10:10! Go! - Mobile!

1214
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,038
"Something is going on. "

1215
01:19:02,248 --> 01:19:04,716
What if it rings? -Who knows the number?

1216
01:19:04,918 --> 01:19:07,512
Have you seen the clock?
He is waiting. Let's go.

1217
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,153
Let's go! Come on!

1218
01:19:14,294 --> 01:19:15,591
All the best.

1219
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:18,857
You are looking perfect.
You are looking perfect.

1220
01:19:19,065 --> 01:19:20,396
Don't feel nervous.

1221
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:24,029
You have performed such great roles
and this NRl Sethi..

1222
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:25,101
.. it's nothing, sir.

1223
01:19:25,305 --> 01:19:25,771
It's nothing!

1224
01:19:25,972 --> 01:19:27,872
I am feeling so nervous.

1225
01:19:28,241 --> 01:19:29,674
Then let's go back. - Okay.

1226
01:19:29,943 --> 01:19:33,538
You have won 135 awards.
135 awards! This..

1227
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,507
Good morning, sir! - Good morning.

1228
01:19:35,849 --> 01:19:36,577
At least say good morning.

1229
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:40,378
No problem. He is sitting there. Go! Go!

1230
01:19:50,463 --> 01:19:53,523
Hello, sir. I am Vijayander Kumar.

1231
01:19:55,668 --> 01:19:57,795
I was talking to you only.
Welcome to India, sir.

1232
01:19:58,004 --> 01:19:58,527
Sir, come. Have a seat.

1233
01:19:58,738 --> 01:20:00,262
Are you the broker or the party?

1234
01:20:00,473 --> 01:20:01,599
Sir, at least have a seat.

1235
01:20:01,808 --> 01:20:03,002
Are you the broker or the party?

1236
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:03,903
Sri, we will talk about that later.

1237
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:06,601
What am I asking you!
Are you the broker or the party?

1238
01:20:08,047 --> 01:20:09,105
Sir, I am the broker.

1239
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,115
What did I tell you?
I don't want to talk to a broker.

1240
01:20:11,317 --> 01:20:11,783
Didn't I tell you?

1241
01:20:11,985 --> 01:20:13,145
Sir, he was supposed to come with the party.

1242
01:20:13,353 --> 01:20:14,217
Sir, hear me out.

1243
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:15,978
You want me to lose my job?

1244
01:20:16,556 --> 01:20:18,421
Call me if you find a buyer by evening.

1245
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:19,353
Otherwise get lost!

1246
01:20:24,697 --> 01:20:26,164
Bapu, you were terrific!

1247
01:20:26,599 --> 01:20:28,226
Don't look back! Don't look back!

1248
01:20:28,701 --> 01:20:29,668
Do you have a handkerchief?

1249
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:31,393
Don't wipe now. He is still there.

1250
01:20:33,139 --> 01:20:35,039
Bapu was fantastic!

1251
01:20:35,241 --> 01:20:37,675
The style he used to
turn around and walk..

1252
01:20:37,877 --> 01:20:39,310
.. I felt as if Vijayander
will get a heart attack.

1253
01:20:39,512 --> 01:20:41,503
I don't know about him.
But I surely was going to get one.

1254
01:20:41,714 --> 01:20:42,408
Shut up!

1255
01:20:42,782 --> 01:20:47,685
I think I overdone it. Now he won't call.

1256
01:20:47,887 --> 01:20:50,583
Even his father will call.

1257
01:20:51,357 --> 01:20:53,484
If he has reached to his father.

1258
01:20:56,529 --> 01:21:00,590
How many acres he said? - 9.

1259
01:21:02,969 --> 01:21:05,062
On the highway? -Yes.

1260
01:21:06,005 --> 01:21:08,872
Sir, if what he is saying is true..

1261
01:21:09,075 --> 01:21:11,100
.. then the rates will double up
after the highway is built.

1262
01:21:14,781 --> 01:21:16,373
It will triple.

1263
01:21:18,418 --> 01:21:19,282
Who is the party?

1264
01:21:19,652 --> 01:21:23,986
Party.. forget the party.
For you I am the party.

1265
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:26,715
You will become the party for us? Fool!

1266
01:21:26,926 --> 01:21:29,019
Look, he is an NRl party.

1267
01:21:29,228 --> 01:21:31,287
He has come from Dubai.
He wants to sell it quickly and return.

1268
01:21:31,497 --> 01:21:33,328
That's why I was saying this.

1269
01:21:38,871 --> 01:21:39,997
How much do you want?

1270
01:21:46,913 --> 01:21:49,677
Look.. look, sir.. according to me..

1271
01:21:49,882 --> 01:21:51,747
.. it will be a deal of at least 1-1.5 crores.

1272
01:21:51,951 --> 01:21:56,149
So even I will earn some money.

1273
01:22:03,663 --> 01:22:08,191
Nowadays you have started
demanding too much. Fool!

1274
01:22:15,641 --> 01:22:17,609
What is this? - Cherry has ordered it.

1275
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:18,777
He was saying there are
many people in the house.

1276
01:22:18,978 --> 01:22:20,536
So don't cook.

1277
01:22:22,582 --> 01:22:24,345
Shall I cook some vegetable for you?

1278
01:22:24,684 --> 01:22:25,548
Let it be.

1279
01:22:31,991 --> 01:22:32,457
Now will the food not be cooked..

1280
01:22:32,658 --> 01:22:34,125
.. in the house because of them!

1281
01:22:34,827 --> 01:22:37,591
And what are they doing?
- They are working hard.

1282
01:22:37,797 --> 01:22:40,698
They are booking for a room in a
5 star hotel for Khurana's meeting.

1283
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,629
A room in a 5 star hotel!

1284
01:22:43,036 --> 01:22:44,731
Are they their relatives?

1285
01:22:46,105 --> 01:22:49,233
Or these actors have put up
a set for them too?

1286
01:22:49,675 --> 01:22:50,573
Who will pay for it?

1287
01:22:50,777 --> 01:22:53,302
Cherry. - He has gone mad!

1288
01:22:53,613 --> 01:22:55,103
It's futile to splurge money on something..

1289
01:22:55,314 --> 01:22:56,645
.. that we have already lost!

1290
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:58,847
How much have they spent?

1291
01:22:59,052 --> 01:23:02,852
Bunty was saying around 15,000-20,000.

1292
01:23:03,056 --> 01:23:06,753
15,000-20,000!
Tell him to stop this madness!

1293
01:23:06,959 --> 01:23:08,085
It's futile to splurge money on something..

1294
01:23:08,294 --> 01:23:10,091
.. that we have already lost!

1295
01:23:10,296 --> 01:23:10,853
Tell him that!

1296
01:23:11,064 --> 01:23:12,497
Why don't you yourself tell him?

1297
01:23:12,698 --> 01:23:16,065
Me? Why should I tell him?
Let him splurge!

1298
01:23:16,302 --> 01:23:17,360
It's his money. Let him splurge!

1299
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:18,332
It's none of my business.

1300
01:23:18,538 --> 01:23:20,267
Then why are you worried?

1301
01:23:20,473 --> 01:23:22,498
I.. I.. this..

1302
01:23:26,245 --> 01:23:27,542
Do you have some chutney?

1303
01:23:28,381 --> 01:23:30,872
When I reached home I saw it
was locked.

1304
01:23:31,084 --> 01:23:32,847
It's 9. And they haven't called.

1305
01:23:33,986 --> 01:23:36,181
It's only 9. It will surely come.

1306
01:23:36,389 --> 01:23:39,051
I can't even eat.

1307
01:23:39,258 --> 01:23:42,785
You mean you lived all alone?
- Yeah.

1308
01:23:42,995 --> 01:23:43,654
Wow!

1309
01:23:43,863 --> 01:23:45,023
What about your parents?

1310
01:23:45,231 --> 01:23:47,529
Mummy is in Kolkatta.
And daddy is in Bangalore.

1311
01:23:47,733 --> 01:23:50,065
I see! Your daddy must have
got transferred.

1312
01:23:50,269 --> 01:23:51,702
No, he lives there.

1313
01:23:52,338 --> 01:23:55,000
Then why does your mummy
reside in Kolkatta?

1314
01:23:57,777 --> 01:23:59,438
Actually they are divorced.

1315
01:24:01,013 --> 01:24:03,174
I'll take it. - No, aunty. I will keep it. You..

1316
01:24:03,382 --> 01:24:04,110
Cherry.

1317
01:24:06,619 --> 01:24:07,483
Mr. Khosla, come. Have a seat.

1318
01:24:07,687 --> 01:24:10,588
No, please. You remain seated.
One moment.

1319
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:12,054
Tell me, papa.

1320
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:17,057
I have heard that you have
spent 10,000-15,000.

1321
01:24:17,263 --> 01:24:19,788
Yes, we needed some things.

1322
01:24:19,999 --> 01:24:21,466
I know what you needed.

1323
01:24:22,034 --> 01:24:23,729
SIM card is coming from Dubai!

1324
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,337
Hired cars! Rooms in 5 star hotel!

1325
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,700
Papa, its okay. I am handling it.

1326
01:24:28,908 --> 01:24:32,207
Are you doing.. are you doing
a favour on me!

1327
01:24:32,545 --> 01:24:33,773
There is no need to act like a tycoon.

1328
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:36,676
Stop dreaming. He is Khurana!

1329
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:38,441
He is smarter than you. Nobody is
going to call you.

1330
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:41,211
Papa.. - Look, Cherry. I am your father.

1331
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,387
Even I know certain things.

1332
01:24:42,588 --> 01:24:44,055
No phone is going to come. I know it.

1333
01:24:44,557 --> 01:24:46,457
Cherry! Cherry, the call!

1334
01:24:46,659 --> 01:24:48,593
Cherry, the call!

1335
01:24:48,828 --> 01:24:50,523
Phone! Phone! Phone!

1336
01:24:52,064 --> 01:24:54,532
No, you take it. -You talk.

1337
01:24:54,734 --> 01:24:55,826
Come on!

1338
01:24:59,505 --> 01:25:00,199
Hello.

1339
01:25:02,074 --> 01:25:02,699
Yes.

1340
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:05,944
Yes, yes, yes.

1341
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:12,980
Bring them.. to Surya hotel. At 3 o'clock.

1342
01:25:14,086 --> 01:25:16,611
Yes, Mr. Sethi has a suite there.

1343
01:25:17,256 --> 01:25:18,848
You want to meet him alone?

1344
01:25:19,358 --> 01:25:22,521
No! No! No!

1345
01:25:23,129 --> 01:25:25,097
No, you can't meet him alone.

1346
01:25:25,231 --> 01:25:27,495
Look, I will fix this meeting for you.

1347
01:25:28,201 --> 01:25:29,691
I don't want any commission.

1348
01:25:29,835 --> 01:25:35,899
And don't even talk to me like this.
Understood?

1349
01:25:36,475 --> 01:25:37,339
Goodbye.

1350
01:25:42,215 --> 01:25:42,977
What?

1351
01:25:43,549 --> 01:25:44,709
What happened?

1352
01:25:44,984 --> 01:25:45,916
What?

1353
01:26:04,537 --> 01:26:05,561
Great!

1354
01:26:06,305 --> 01:26:06,930
It was great fun!

1355
01:26:10,977 --> 01:26:14,538
"The scene is gradually being created. "

1356
01:26:18,584 --> 01:26:22,611
"The twilight is getting
converted into dawn gradually. "

1357
01:26:26,592 --> 01:26:30,460
"The world is sleeping.
Somebody is awake. "

1358
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:34,088
"Something is getting destroyed. "

1359
01:26:34,634 --> 01:26:40,903
"Look, look, something is happening. "

1360
01:26:42,008 --> 01:26:43,600
"Day! Day! Day! Day. "

1361
01:26:43,809 --> 01:26:45,276
"Something is happening. "

1362
01:26:45,478 --> 01:26:47,207
"Something is happening. "

1363
01:26:47,413 --> 01:26:49,313
"Something is happening. "

1364
01:26:49,515 --> 01:26:51,380
"Day! Day! Day! Day. "

1365
01:26:51,584 --> 01:26:52,983
"Something is happening. "

1366
01:26:53,185 --> 01:26:54,812
"Something is happening. "

1367
01:26:55,021 --> 01:26:57,046
"Something is happening. "

1368
01:26:57,256 --> 01:27:01,090
"Day! Day! Day! Day. "

1369
01:27:02,528 --> 01:27:03,995
They must have reached
the suite by now.

1370
01:27:04,196 --> 01:27:04,992
I am scared.

1371
01:27:05,197 --> 01:27:08,064
Forget suite, Bapu has never been
to a coffee shop.

1372
01:27:11,037 --> 01:27:12,595
150 bucks for tea!

1373
01:27:13,372 --> 01:27:16,068
Such a grand hotel and
a printing mistake. Look!

1374
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:17,607
Look at this!

1375
01:27:18,944 --> 01:27:20,809
No, Bapu. I don't think it is a mistake.

1376
01:27:21,213 --> 01:27:22,840
Maybe it must be costing 150 bucks.

1377
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,945
Forget it! We don't have to order for it!

1378
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:27,583
We will have to order something..

1379
01:27:27,787 --> 01:27:29,049
.. otherwise it will look very odd.

1380
01:27:29,555 --> 01:27:32,956
Order the cheapest thing for me.
What's the cheapest thing?

1381
01:27:33,726 --> 01:27:34,420
Tea.

1382
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,400
Listen.. I don't think they will come.
Let's go.

1383
01:27:43,602 --> 01:27:47,060
Bapu! Why are you shaking
your legs!

1384
01:27:47,506 --> 01:27:49,440
I can shake whatever I want!
It's none of your business!

1385
01:27:49,909 --> 01:27:51,206
Don't I have this much freedom?

1386
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:52,604
Bapu, don't get nervous.

1387
01:27:53,446 --> 01:27:54,344
I will handle everything.

1388
01:27:54,547 --> 01:27:56,208
You just be in your character.

1389
01:27:56,916 --> 01:27:59,043
Let's do one more rehearsal.
- Okay.

1390
01:27:59,251 --> 01:28:01,811
Name. - M. L. Sethi.

1391
01:28:02,021 --> 01:28:04,080
Yeah. Where do you stay?

1392
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:09,050
Noida. Afsal street, Hamza, Dubai.

1393
01:28:09,428 --> 01:28:10,622
Yes. Business?

1394
01:28:12,431 --> 01:28:13,830
Hotel! - Hotel! Hotel!

1395
01:28:14,033 --> 01:28:15,125
Textile! - Textile!

1396
01:28:15,334 --> 01:28:17,598
Software! - Software!

1397
01:28:18,037 --> 01:28:19,129
Sorry! Sorry!

1398
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:25,136
I will handle everything! You just do
what Asif has told you.

1399
01:28:27,947 --> 01:28:29,244
What are you doing?

1400
01:28:29,448 --> 01:28:31,814
You should have gone earlier!

1401
01:28:38,557 --> 01:28:41,321
Welcome! Welcome! Come! Come!

1402
01:28:41,527 --> 01:28:43,324
He is Mr. Khurana. He is
Mr. Munjal. - Greetings.

1403
01:28:43,529 --> 01:28:44,655
He is Mr. Sethi's secretary.

1404
01:28:44,864 --> 01:28:45,694
Come. Come.

1405
01:28:45,898 --> 01:28:46,990
Please come.

1406
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:47,756
Come! Come!

1407
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:48,763
Please have a seat!

1408
01:28:48,968 --> 01:28:49,434
Come!

1409
01:28:49,635 --> 01:28:50,966
Make yourself comfortable.

1410
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:51,932
Come! Come!

1411
01:28:52,138 --> 01:28:53,332
Shall I order something?

1412
01:28:53,806 --> 01:28:54,898
Nothing.

1413
01:28:55,241 --> 01:28:57,869
Mr. Sethi is in a conference call.

1414
01:28:58,077 --> 01:28:59,635
Ministry on one hand and Dubai
on the other.

1415
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:01,503
Have a seat.

1416
01:29:02,181 --> 01:29:04,411
Here! Have the offerings.
- What is this for?

1417
01:29:04,617 --> 01:29:05,743
Mr. Khurana has got it.
- Is that so?

1418
01:29:05,951 --> 01:29:07,976
He goes to Tirupati before
making a big deal.

1419
01:29:08,187 --> 01:29:11,850
Great! And where does he go
after the big deal?

1420
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:25,637
Mr. Mujal, what do I tell you
about Mr. Sethi?

1421
01:29:25,838 --> 01:29:26,805
I have already met him.

1422
01:29:27,006 --> 01:29:28,633
He looks just like a film star.

1423
01:29:28,841 --> 01:29:30,638
Hello, everybody.

1424
01:29:30,843 --> 01:29:32,868
Hello, sir. He is Mr. Khurana.

1425
01:29:37,683 --> 01:29:39,014
Hello. - Hello.

1426
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:45,056
Sir, Mr. Khurana is interested
in buying your land.

1427
01:29:45,858 --> 01:29:48,554
Are you a party or a broker?

1428
01:29:49,695 --> 01:29:51,356
Sir, what are you saying?

1429
01:29:51,697 --> 01:29:57,533
I am not talking to you at all.
Are you a party or a broker?

1430
01:30:00,773 --> 01:30:01,933
Party.

1431
01:30:04,877 --> 01:30:06,674
Good! Good!

1432
01:30:08,047 --> 01:30:10,174
Then shall we come to the point?

1433
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:25,357
The minister is very happy.
The deal is through.

1434
01:30:26,799 --> 01:30:28,266
Great, sir! Great!

1435
01:30:29,969 --> 01:30:31,402
So..

1436
01:30:32,905 --> 01:30:35,874
Sir, Khurana. -Yes. Mr. Khurana.

1437
01:30:36,075 --> 01:30:38,600
I talk clearly.

1438
01:30:39,778 --> 01:30:41,746
I come to India twice a year.

1439
01:30:41,947 --> 01:30:46,543
Once I go to visit Tirupati.
And once to visit Vaishnodevi.

1440
01:30:46,752 --> 01:30:49,152
Mr. Sethi is a great devotee
of Goddess Vaishnodevi.

1441
01:30:49,355 --> 01:30:50,788
He offers lakhs every year.

1442
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:52,116
Wonderful!

1443
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:57,186
When the Goddess calls,
then I can't stop myself.

1444
01:30:57,396 --> 01:31:01,355
You might find this strange.
Am I right?

1445
01:31:01,734 --> 01:31:03,929
No, no. Please continue.

1446
01:31:05,838 --> 01:31:08,306
What is there to say, Mr. Khurana?

1447
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:10,800
It is a small piece of ancestral land.

1448
01:31:11,277 --> 01:31:14,838
I just want somebody who will
take good care of it.

1449
01:31:15,047 --> 01:31:16,639
But nowadays you don't find
such people..

1450
01:31:16,849 --> 01:31:18,510
.. who love their land.

1451
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:23,754
Sir, Mr. Khurana loves land so much..

1452
01:31:23,956 --> 01:31:27,221
Will you take tea or something? - No.

1453
01:31:27,426 --> 01:31:29,417
Something cold? - No.

1454
01:31:29,628 --> 01:31:31,721
Then what will you take to keep quiet?
- No, no..

1455
01:32:02,628 --> 01:32:04,960
They are taking so much time. I am sure
something is wrong.

1456
01:32:05,164 --> 01:32:08,065
It's all my fault! I shouldn't
have forced Bapu!

1457
01:32:08,267 --> 01:32:09,029
I will call up on the cell.

1458
01:32:09,234 --> 01:32:12,260
No, no! We will wait.

1459
01:32:12,471 --> 01:32:16,237
Only land is worth to be loved.
What else is left nowadays?

1460
01:32:17,109 --> 01:32:21,546
Amazing! I am searching for the man..
and he is in front of me!

1461
01:32:21,747 --> 01:32:23,146
So shall I consider the deal as final?

1462
01:32:23,349 --> 01:32:25,374
Of course.

1463
01:32:26,352 --> 01:32:29,719
I just had..
a small request.

1464
01:32:29,922 --> 01:32:31,048
Tell me.

1465
01:32:32,191 --> 01:32:34,284
I just wanted to see the plot once.

1466
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:43,999
Yes, why not.
When do you want to have a look?

1467
01:32:44,737 --> 01:32:45,704
Now.

1468
01:32:46,005 --> 01:32:47,302
Now?

1469
01:32:50,943 --> 01:32:52,240
Why? Any problem?

1470
01:32:52,444 --> 01:32:55,607
No, no.. no.. problem..

1471
01:32:55,814 --> 01:32:57,975
There is no problem
in having a look.

1472
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:01,917
Actually.. actually sir
doesn't want to say it.

1473
01:33:02,121 --> 01:33:06,490
He finalizes all big deals
on Fridays.

1474
01:33:07,459 --> 01:33:09,051
It's the blessing of
the Goddess.

1475
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,764
It's just a request.

1476
01:33:16,201 --> 01:33:18,761
Mr. Sethi, if the Goddess
doesn't give me..

1477
01:33:18,971 --> 01:33:21,269
.. the permission then how can I
dare to look at it?

1478
01:33:23,642 --> 01:33:26,110
I will come whenever you say.

1479
01:33:28,647 --> 01:33:30,114
But then it will be mine.

1480
01:33:36,388 --> 01:33:39,414
Friday! Blessing of the Goddess!

1481
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:43,685
Keep quiet! He wants to see the plot!

1482
01:33:43,896 --> 01:33:47,195
And that is the problem.
Where will we bring the land?

1483
01:33:47,399 --> 01:33:48,957
Has anybody thought of that?

1484
01:33:51,236 --> 01:33:54,763
There is a land. -Which one?

1485
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:58,604
There is one in that area.

1486
01:33:58,944 --> 01:34:00,673
I have saved it for my retirement.

1487
01:34:02,414 --> 01:34:04,678
You mean you are the owner
of such a big plot?

1488
01:34:05,484 --> 01:34:06,382
No.

1489
01:34:06,819 --> 01:34:08,844
Then how did you save it
for your retirement?

1490
01:34:12,891 --> 01:34:14,688
I understood! I understood!

1491
01:34:15,427 --> 01:34:17,361
But who is the owner?

1492
01:34:18,664 --> 01:34:22,794
Fish. It is the fisheries
department land.

1493
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:25,629
A fish research institute was
going to be built there.

1494
01:34:25,838 --> 01:34:27,897
But government doesn't have
the time for humans..

1495
01:34:28,107 --> 01:34:29,836
.. then why will they think about
the fishes?

1496
01:34:30,142 --> 01:34:31,541
It has been lying vacant for 8 years.

1497
01:34:31,744 --> 01:34:33,644
There is nothing except a board.

1498
01:34:35,347 --> 01:34:36,974
But we will have to do the
make up of that land.

1499
01:34:37,182 --> 01:34:37,978
Make up?

1500
01:34:38,183 --> 01:34:41,710
So that everything in that plot
should look like ours.

1501
01:34:46,525 --> 01:34:54,398
The trees.. the plants.. the birds..
the luggage.. and people.

1502
01:35:04,009 --> 01:35:05,340
"Day! Day!"

1503
01:35:05,878 --> 01:35:07,175
"Count! Count!"

1504
01:35:11,216 --> 01:35:12,911
"Day! Day!"

1505
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:14,312
"Count! Count!"

1506
01:36:19,017 --> 01:36:20,917
Welcome, Mr. Khurana!

1507
01:36:21,453 --> 01:36:22,511
How are you, Mr. Sethi?

1508
01:36:22,955 --> 01:36:24,650
Come, Mr. Khurana!

1509
01:36:24,957 --> 01:36:26,754
Did you have any problem
in finding the land?

1510
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:29,658
I never have problem in
finding the plot.

1511
01:36:30,028 --> 01:36:31,791
This is what I have.
Have a look.

1512
01:36:31,997 --> 01:36:34,966
Sir, he is Insaan Singh.
He is the caretaker.

1513
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:36,964
And she is his mother.

1514
01:36:39,471 --> 01:36:41,132
If you don't mind,
can I look around?

1515
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:42,364
Yes. Why not?

1516
01:36:42,574 --> 01:36:43,939
No, you sit. You sit.

1517
01:36:44,142 --> 01:36:45,439
Yes, you sit. I will show him
around.

1518
01:36:45,644 --> 01:36:48,010
You go and have buttermilk.

1519
01:36:48,313 --> 01:36:49,871
Insaan Singh will show me
around. Fine?

1520
01:36:50,082 --> 01:36:52,949
Okay. - Me?

1521
01:36:53,151 --> 01:36:56,279
Yes, you. You know the plot well.
- Is that so?

1522
01:36:56,488 --> 01:36:58,422
Yes. Now go.

1523
01:36:59,825 --> 01:37:00,450
Go!

1524
01:37:00,726 --> 01:37:01,750
Go! Come, sir.

1525
01:37:10,269 --> 01:37:12,635
Come on, Satan Singh!
- Sir, Insaan Singh.

1526
01:37:12,838 --> 01:37:13,770
Okay.

1527
01:37:17,809 --> 01:37:19,970
How long have you been here?
- Since the morning.

1528
01:37:20,178 --> 01:37:20,735
What?

1529
01:37:20,946 --> 01:37:24,541
I mean since years.
But I arrived this morning.

1530
01:37:25,684 --> 01:37:27,276
Tell me about the plot.

1531
01:37:27,486 --> 01:37:31,252
What should I tell you..
about the plot, sir?

1532
01:37:31,456 --> 01:37:37,554
It's a big plot. There are stones..
trees.. mud.. temple.

1533
01:37:37,763 --> 01:37:40,061
Temple? Where is the temple?

1534
01:37:40,265 --> 01:37:44,702
Temple.. it's far away, sir.
its' a big plot.

1535
01:37:46,038 --> 01:37:47,403
Then why is he selling it?

1536
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:49,066
Why he wants to sell it?

1537
01:37:49,274 --> 01:37:51,606
That is what we don't know, sir.
Why he wants to sell it?

1538
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:53,209
It's such a lovely plot of land.

1539
01:37:54,446 --> 01:37:57,040
It's his land. He wants to sell it.
Why are you concerned?

1540
01:37:57,783 --> 01:38:02,846
Greetings. They are Mr. Sethi's men.

1541
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:04,179
Okay! Let's move!

1542
01:38:05,724 --> 01:38:07,521
Who named you Satan Singh?

1543
01:38:07,726 --> 01:38:09,887
No, sir. My name is Insaan Singh.

1544
01:38:10,095 --> 01:38:11,995
You forgot your name? -What?

1545
01:38:12,197 --> 01:38:14,188
They were calling you
Satan Singh.

1546
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:16,128
No, sir. I am Insaan (human) Singh.

1547
01:38:16,335 --> 01:38:19,361
I know you are a human. But why is
your name Satan Singh?

1548
01:38:19,604 --> 01:38:20,696
Sir, what can I say?

1549
01:38:20,906 --> 01:38:21,873
It's a good name.

1550
01:38:22,941 --> 01:38:24,602
Katori! - Oh God!

1551
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:25,936
How are you?

1552
01:38:27,212 --> 01:38:29,544
Greetings, sir! - Greetings.

1553
01:38:29,848 --> 01:38:33,750
Katori, is everything well?
- Sir, it is going on.

1554
01:38:33,952 --> 01:38:36,182
You hardly come here nowadays.

1555
01:38:37,422 --> 01:38:40,050
Just like that. Sir, come.

1556
01:38:42,995 --> 01:38:44,792
She comes to cut the grass, sir.

1557
01:38:45,163 --> 01:38:47,723
She takes more than what she works.

1558
01:38:47,933 --> 01:38:50,834
Let her do it! Go on! Take
as much as you want.

1559
01:38:51,036 --> 01:38:54,631
Okay, sir. Scoundrel!

1560
01:39:05,884 --> 01:39:10,253
Sir, you have seen everything.
Nothing else..

1561
01:39:13,258 --> 01:39:15,783
Yes! Sir, there is a well!

1562
01:39:16,628 --> 01:39:17,822
You want to take a bath?

1563
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:21,832
This man is mad!

1564
01:39:24,202 --> 01:39:26,363
Sir, what happened?
You want to take a bath?

1565
01:39:27,205 --> 01:39:28,604
Come. Let's go.

1566
01:39:42,187 --> 01:39:44,155
Sir, buttermilk.

1567
01:39:44,523 --> 01:39:46,354
Sir, have it. Buttermilk.

1568
01:39:48,894 --> 01:39:50,156
How is it?

1569
01:39:54,566 --> 01:39:57,967
Mr. Sethi, it is the business's norm.

1570
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:01,264
You shouldn't praise a thing
before buying it.

1571
01:40:04,209 --> 01:40:08,373
You didn't tell me that you have
built a Goddess temple.

1572
01:40:09,347 --> 01:40:11,975
Who am I to build a Goddess temple?

1573
01:40:12,217 --> 01:40:15,277
Where Goddess wills, the temple
is made there.

1574
01:40:16,855 --> 01:40:22,851
We just pile up the bricks.
Nothing else.

1575
01:40:23,662 --> 01:40:26,062
Mr. Sethi, I want to sit with you some day.

1576
01:40:27,432 --> 01:40:29,366
First give me the land.

1577
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:32,731
It's all yours. It's just a burden for me.

1578
01:40:33,004 --> 01:40:35,666
Then I will shed your burden.
Let's have a look at the paper.

1579
01:40:36,374 --> 01:40:40,333
Papers? - It's just a formality.
But we have to do it.

1580
01:40:40,612 --> 01:40:43,080
Mr. Khurana is very strict
about these things.

1581
01:40:43,548 --> 01:40:45,015
Then when?

1582
01:40:45,717 --> 01:40:47,878
Whenever you want.
I will call you.

1583
01:40:48,153 --> 01:40:50,178
Mr. Sethi, permit me to leave.

1584
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:53,253
Come on!

1585
01:40:54,392 --> 01:40:55,757
Sir, be careful.

1586
01:40:57,929 --> 01:41:00,363
Sir, the lady is greeting you.

1587
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:08,596
Papa.. here are the papers.

1588
01:41:10,242 --> 01:41:10,867
Oh God!

1589
01:41:11,076 --> 01:41:13,044
Power cut!

1590
01:41:14,379 --> 01:41:15,641
Where is the torch?

1591
01:41:25,257 --> 01:41:26,554
Where did you get this document?

1592
01:41:26,758 --> 01:41:28,385
Papa, somehow we got it.

1593
01:41:28,693 --> 01:41:33,494
Just think that all the people
who have worked for Khurana..

1594
01:41:33,698 --> 01:41:35,563
.. for so many years, a gift to
Khurana on their behalf.

1595
01:41:36,268 --> 01:41:38,736
Even Khurana's father can't find
a mistake in this.

1596
01:41:38,937 --> 01:41:40,996
You are great! Make me your student!

1597
01:41:41,206 --> 01:41:44,937
No need for that. Now tell me the truth.

1598
01:41:45,143 --> 01:41:46,303
Where did you get the papers?

1599
01:41:46,511 --> 01:41:48,069
Papa, I am telling you.

1600
01:41:48,313 --> 01:41:51,578
Mr. Khosla, if I told you the truth..

1601
01:41:51,783 --> 01:41:53,978
.. then you won't allow us
to use this paper.

1602
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:59,088
And if we don't use it, then Khurana
will never buy the land.

1603
01:41:59,357 --> 01:42:02,758
And if he doesn't buy the land,
then you won't get the plot back.

1604
01:42:04,529 --> 01:42:08,295
Now you decide. You want
the truth or the plot?

1605
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,330
Plot.

1606
01:42:13,071 --> 01:42:18,099
Mr. Khosla, the iron is hot..
and this is the hammer.

1607
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:19,641
Hit it.

1608
01:42:49,374 --> 01:42:57,247
Mr. Sethi.. only I can make
such authentic papers.

1609
01:42:58,450 --> 01:42:59,474
I hope its not forged.

1610
01:43:00,819 --> 01:43:02,218
Sir, what are you saying?

1611
01:43:03,021 --> 01:43:05,751
Will Mr. Sethi give you fake papers?

1612
01:43:05,957 --> 01:43:09,154
No, no. Even if it's fake,
then we will make it authentic.

1613
01:43:10,462 --> 01:43:12,487
You tell me. What's the price?

1614
01:43:12,697 --> 01:43:13,789
Tell me, Mr. Sethi.

1615
01:43:14,132 --> 01:43:16,896
Whatever you think is fair.

1616
01:43:17,102 --> 01:43:19,662
No, no. You must be
expecting something.

1617
01:43:19,871 --> 01:43:23,432
No, no. I don't have
any expectations.

1618
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:26,139
Still. - 1.5.

1619
01:43:26,378 --> 01:43:30,178
No. 1.5 is too much. Reduce it a bit.

1620
01:43:30,382 --> 01:43:31,508
Think something about us too.

1621
01:43:32,217 --> 01:43:34,685
A bit. - 1.25.

1622
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,088
Okay. - 1.35.

1623
01:43:38,556 --> 01:43:39,523
No, no..

1624
01:43:40,992 --> 01:43:43,927
Okay. Mr. Sethi.
What will I bargain with you?

1625
01:43:44,129 --> 01:43:48,225
Neither mine, nor yours.
1 crore 30 lakhs.

1626
01:43:48,433 --> 01:43:49,457
Half in cash.

1627
01:43:50,101 --> 01:43:50,829
No problem.

1628
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,095
So, Mr. Sethi.
This is the advance.

1629
01:43:54,406 --> 01:43:57,603
It's 35 lakhs.
The rest after getting the land.

1630
01:43:57,842 --> 01:43:58,467
Count it.

1631
01:44:04,082 --> 01:44:05,811
No, please count it.

1632
01:44:06,918 --> 01:44:08,078
No, I will make a move.

1633
01:44:09,254 --> 01:44:10,221
No, I have to go.

1634
01:44:10,422 --> 01:44:11,446
Mr. Sethi, at least take the cash.

1635
01:44:11,656 --> 01:44:12,850
I will leave.

1636
01:44:13,091 --> 01:44:15,150
Mr. Sethi! Mr. Sethi!

1637
01:44:15,927 --> 01:44:18,157
Mr. Sethi! Mr. Sethi!

1638
01:44:30,975 --> 01:44:33,307
You didn't bring the money? -Why?

1639
01:44:34,512 --> 01:44:36,207
Why are you asking me? Ask him.

1640
01:44:36,581 --> 01:44:38,913
Him? What to ask him?

1641
01:44:39,017 --> 01:44:40,609
What have you done!
You spoiled a finalized deal!

1642
01:44:40,785 --> 01:44:41,877
Papa, what the hell!

1643
01:44:42,687 --> 01:44:47,249
35 lakhs! Leaving Khurana's 12 lakhs,
we still had 23 lakhs.

1644
01:44:47,459 --> 01:44:48,426
23 lakhs in cash!

1645
01:44:48,626 --> 01:44:51,186
Cash! The man who has not seen 35 rupees..

1646
01:44:51,396 --> 01:44:53,193
.. you are telling him to bring 35 lakhs in cash!

1647
01:44:53,465 --> 01:44:54,591
Aren't you all ashamed!

1648
01:44:54,799 --> 01:44:56,289
Papa, what are you saying?

1649
01:44:57,068 --> 01:44:58,865
Hang on! Hang on!

1650
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,538
Have this.

1651
01:45:13,251 --> 01:45:13,979
You want more?

1652
01:45:14,652 --> 01:45:15,346
No. Thanks.

1653
01:45:18,289 --> 01:45:20,621
Mr. Khosla, I am very sorry.

1654
01:45:21,259 --> 01:45:24,490
What you have done..
nobody would have done even that.

1655
01:45:25,897 --> 01:45:27,762
You are blaming him for ruining it!

1656
01:45:29,267 --> 01:45:31,394
If he had not taken so much trouble..

1657
01:45:31,636 --> 01:45:32,864
.. then we couldn't have even achieved that.

1658
01:45:32,937 --> 01:45:35,064
What are you saying!
The plan has been sabotaged!

1659
01:45:35,273 --> 01:45:40,074
What plan? Phoney land..
phoney papers.. everything phoney!

1660
01:45:40,779 --> 01:45:42,406
Is this what you all have learned
in this house?

1661
01:45:42,614 --> 01:45:43,876
Papa, even Khurana uses phoney papers..

1662
01:45:44,082 --> 01:45:45,811
I don't care what Khurana does!

1663
01:45:46,284 --> 01:45:47,751
But I am not Khurana! Do you understand!

1664
01:45:47,952 --> 01:45:49,078
I am not Khurana!

1665
01:45:49,287 --> 01:45:50,948
Calm down. - I am fine!

1666
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:54,080
Had I been in his place, then I would have done..

1667
01:45:54,292 --> 01:45:55,190
.. exactly what he did!

1668
01:45:56,261 --> 01:45:59,890
This is called decency!
If you remember this word!

1669
01:46:00,732 --> 01:46:02,199
Or else even you have become..

1670
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,765
.. like those who called me uncle and..

1671
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:13,074
Please end this now. End it.

1672
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:22,886
Tell him to fill his visa form tomorrow.

1673
01:46:28,927 --> 01:46:29,825
Khurana!

1674
01:46:33,832 --> 01:46:37,859
Hello. Yes. Yes.

1675
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:43,330
Yes! No! What?

1676
01:46:44,776 --> 01:46:47,904
Okay. Okay.

1677
01:46:50,048 --> 01:46:50,912
Okay.

1678
01:46:56,254 --> 01:46:57,915
It was Khurana's secretary's call.

1679
01:46:59,357 --> 01:47:02,224
He said that after Mr. Sethi left..

1680
01:47:02,427 --> 01:47:07,922
.. then we realized that maybe
we have offered very less money.

1681
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:13,334
Khurana is ready to give 1 crore 40 lakhs.

1682
01:47:16,941 --> 01:47:19,000
Whatever Bapu does, it is right!

1683
01:47:19,210 --> 01:47:21,041
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!

1684
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:26,473
But he wants to pay the advance on the plot.

1685
01:47:26,684 --> 01:47:29,346
He wants to see the plot again.

1686
01:47:29,621 --> 01:47:33,717
On the plot. It means again..

1687
01:47:33,958 --> 01:47:35,516
Everybody has gone to Bangalore.

1688
01:47:35,727 --> 01:47:37,627
Only Ghanshyam-ji is here.

1689
01:47:39,797 --> 01:47:40,695
Another theatre crew?

1690
01:47:40,899 --> 01:47:43,732
No! No!

1691
01:47:44,969 --> 01:47:47,062
It is not safe to take any outsider.

1692
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:52,670
Apart from Ghanshyam
we need 3 labourers.. another one..

1693
01:47:53,244 --> 01:47:55,804
.. an old lady.. she is inside the house..

1694
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:57,980
.. so we need at least 5 people.

1695
01:47:58,283 --> 01:47:59,978
If anything is changed drastically..

1696
01:48:00,184 --> 01:48:01,549
.. then Khurana will come to know.

1697
01:48:02,186 --> 01:48:04,484
So whatever we have to do,
we have to do it amongst ourselves.

1698
01:48:07,659 --> 01:48:12,790
Papa.. please give us the permission.

1699
01:48:13,865 --> 01:48:15,162
It is our last chance.

1700
01:48:31,883 --> 01:48:32,872
Bapu, it's a last chance.

1701
01:48:39,490 --> 01:48:41,424
Mr. Sethi! - Mr. Khurana!

1702
01:48:41,626 --> 01:48:43,150
Sir, I made a mistake. - No, no.

1703
01:48:43,361 --> 01:48:44,123
Forgive me.

1704
01:48:44,329 --> 01:48:48,425
No, no. It is my fault.
- No. It's my fault. It's my fault.

1705
01:48:48,633 --> 01:48:50,692
No, no. - Sir, it's my fault.

1706
01:48:50,902 --> 01:48:54,065
If you found the offer less,
then you should have said.

1707
01:48:54,272 --> 01:48:56,172
It's okay. It's okay.

1708
01:48:56,374 --> 01:48:57,671
That Satan Singh is nowhere to be seen.

1709
01:48:57,875 --> 01:48:58,933
Satan Singh!

1710
01:48:59,143 --> 01:49:00,041
Insaan Singh!

1711
01:49:00,612 --> 01:49:02,512
Insaan Singh!

1712
01:49:05,617 --> 01:49:06,606
Insaan Singh!

1713
01:49:12,023 --> 01:49:14,890
Greetings. Actually my mother is not well.

1714
01:49:15,093 --> 01:49:16,617
She has given her greetings from inside.

1715
01:49:17,295 --> 01:49:18,887
I had one wish.

1716
01:49:19,097 --> 01:49:21,930
Before the deal, I wanted to
visit the temple with you once.

1717
01:49:22,133 --> 01:49:23,896
Let's go. -What are you saying?

1718
01:49:24,302 --> 01:49:24,961
I am not saying. He is saying it.

1719
01:49:25,169 --> 01:49:26,295
He is saying it, but you too understand.

1720
01:49:26,504 --> 01:49:27,266
You are not saying anything.

1721
01:49:27,472 --> 01:49:28,803
Is there a problem?

1722
01:49:30,174 --> 01:49:31,334
Tell me.

1723
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:34,340
Actually Mr. Sethi had a
omelette in the morning.

1724
01:49:34,545 --> 01:49:36,240
So he can't visit the temple
after eating non-vegetarian.

1725
01:49:36,447 --> 01:49:38,540
That too on a great day like today.

1726
01:49:40,284 --> 01:49:44,186
Forget it. The land is now mine.
We will go anytime.

1727
01:49:44,389 --> 01:49:48,257
You get that buttermilk ready.
I will have a round with Insaan Singh.

1728
01:49:48,459 --> 01:49:49,084
I will also come.

1729
01:49:49,293 --> 01:49:50,487
Why are you taking the trouble?

1730
01:49:50,695 --> 01:49:54,529
I have already troubled you so much.
Come, Mr. Satan.

1731
01:49:55,266 --> 01:49:56,358
Come.

1732
01:49:56,934 --> 01:49:57,958
Satan Singh!

1733
01:50:02,907 --> 01:50:04,431
I can't see that girl.

1734
01:50:05,143 --> 01:50:07,509
Sir, who? - That..

1735
01:50:07,712 --> 01:50:10,806
Greetings. Greetings. - Greetings.

1736
01:50:11,315 --> 01:50:13,806
Papa, turn your face.

1737
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:20,887
Vijayander is nowhere to be seen.

1738
01:50:21,526 --> 01:50:25,826
That is better. Fool!

1739
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:27,998
What happened to the lady? -Who?

1740
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:31,164
That lady.. Insaan Singh's mother.

1741
01:50:31,369 --> 01:50:34,861
Old age! - Old age!

1742
01:50:35,073 --> 01:50:36,335
What's her name?

1743
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:40,200
Chamchi..

1744
01:50:40,411 --> 01:50:42,276
Katori? - Katori!

1745
01:50:42,947 --> 01:50:45,313
She has gone to her village.
Her father expired!

1746
01:50:46,751 --> 01:50:49,584
Will she come back? -Yes, why?

1747
01:50:49,787 --> 01:50:50,685
Nothing.

1748
01:50:50,888 --> 01:50:53,823
If you have some work, then tell me, sir.
Imarti is there.

1749
01:50:55,727 --> 01:50:56,591
Imarti?

1750
01:50:57,395 --> 01:50:58,225
Imarti!

1751
01:51:01,099 --> 01:51:02,066
What happened?

1752
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:06,597
She is her younger sister, sir.
She is very insolent!

1753
01:51:06,904 --> 01:51:07,996
She has just returned from the village.

1754
01:51:08,206 --> 01:51:09,764
When she will come,
then she will go back.

1755
01:51:10,875 --> 01:51:14,140
Can't both of them stay?
- Both? Why, sir?

1756
01:51:15,079 --> 01:51:16,171
Nothing. Let's go.

1757
01:51:20,852 --> 01:51:21,682
Scoundrel!

1758
01:51:25,056 --> 01:51:27,115
Sri.. we have reached the well too.

1759
01:51:30,261 --> 01:51:31,592
Sir, you want to take a bath?

1760
01:51:34,065 --> 01:51:38,331
Is there water problem here?
- Problem? No, sir. Why?

1761
01:51:38,536 --> 01:51:42,165
Let's go. Come on! - Okay.

1762
01:51:50,047 --> 01:51:51,139
It's cash in advance.

1763
01:51:51,349 --> 01:51:52,281
Sir, buttermilk.

1764
01:51:52,483 --> 01:51:55,816
I don't want buttermilk today.
Today we will celebrate.

1765
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:57,783
Sir, I desire to sit with you.

1766
01:51:57,989 --> 01:52:00,253
Let's go to the farmhouse.
We will have a drink.

1767
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:01,618
Sir, today is Friday. You can't drink.

1768
01:52:01,826 --> 01:52:06,286
He had omelette. Explain to him.
You are always objecting!

1769
01:52:06,798 --> 01:52:08,425
Last time too you left suddenly.

1770
01:52:08,866 --> 01:52:10,697
Sir, take the money. Mujal, take this.

1771
01:52:10,902 --> 01:52:12,028
Yes, sir. Whether you take the money here or..

1772
01:52:12,236 --> 01:52:13,726
.. in the farmhouse, it is one and the same thing.

1773
01:52:13,938 --> 01:52:14,905
No! No! - Come, sir!

1774
01:52:15,106 --> 01:52:15,765
Sir, listen!

1775
01:52:15,973 --> 01:52:18,771
He had egg by mistake.

1776
01:52:18,976 --> 01:52:20,807
He can't drink knowingly.

1777
01:52:21,112 --> 01:52:22,875
Sir, today is Friday!

1778
01:52:24,549 --> 01:52:26,039
Some other day! Sir!

1779
01:52:31,455 --> 01:52:32,547
Oh God!

1780
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:34,785
Get the Mercedes! Come on!

1781
01:52:49,874 --> 01:52:51,273
What the hell are they doing?

1782
01:52:51,943 --> 01:52:54,070
I don't know. - Oh God!

1783
01:53:09,627 --> 01:53:11,094
Let's follow them!

1784
01:53:12,029 --> 01:53:13,656
Bunty, go home with the others!

1785
01:53:13,865 --> 01:53:16,095
Wait for my call! Let's go, Asif!

1786
01:53:33,784 --> 01:53:35,843
Dear, you haven't eaten anything since morning.

1787
01:53:36,053 --> 01:53:38,248
You were out since 6. Shall I make something?

1788
01:53:38,456 --> 01:53:39,548
No, aunty.

1789
01:53:39,991 --> 01:53:41,583
We should have taken the money that day.

1790
01:53:42,126 --> 01:53:43,718
That Khurana is a cunning man.

1791
01:53:43,928 --> 01:53:45,156
I don't know what he is up to.

1792
01:53:46,864 --> 01:53:50,493
I understood on the first day itself..

1793
01:53:51,335 --> 01:53:52,495
.. that you are not what you look like.

1794
01:53:53,504 --> 01:53:55,563
Sir, it's very late.

1795
01:53:55,873 --> 01:53:56,498
Keep quiet!

1796
01:53:58,976 --> 01:54:01,467
Sir, your staff is so strange!

1797
01:54:03,581 --> 01:54:05,811
There too he was asking me to take a bath.

1798
01:54:06,017 --> 01:54:08,315
What is this? What is this?

1799
01:54:09,887 --> 01:54:12,720
And he has an objection
to each and everything.

1800
01:54:13,658 --> 01:54:18,994
That day.. when you got up and went away..

1801
01:54:20,765 --> 01:54:23,996
.. sir, I knew that you are great.

1802
01:54:24,168 --> 01:54:26,898
Really! What is the value
of the land for you?

1803
01:54:28,906 --> 01:54:31,340
Zero! Nothing! Zero!

1804
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:37,104
Even if I were to take the money back..

1805
01:54:39,083 --> 01:54:40,710
.. it won't make a difference to you.

1806
01:54:40,918 --> 01:54:43,045
What is 35 lakhs!

1807
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:55,426
Mr. Sethi.. you sold the land..
I bought it. Am I right?

1808
01:54:55,967 --> 01:54:56,592
Sir..

1809
01:54:57,301 --> 01:55:01,294
I know it's late. Keep quiet!
Eat something!

1810
01:55:03,708 --> 01:55:06,404
I'm very impressed! I'm very impressed!

1811
01:55:08,512 --> 01:55:10,912
Sir, do you know what my problem is?

1812
01:55:12,483 --> 01:55:18,547
I still goof up. Sir, it's because of
keeping low class company.

1813
01:55:20,992 --> 01:55:26,020
And your secretary..
the way the talks to me..

1814
01:55:26,931 --> 01:55:28,694
.. I don't even talk to myself in that way.

1815
01:55:31,135 --> 01:55:35,697
No, no. Very good! - Thank you, sir.

1816
01:55:38,843 --> 01:55:45,976
Sir, partnership. Partnership!

1817
01:55:46,183 --> 01:55:48,811
Partnership, Mr. Sethi! Partnership!

1818
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:57,189
Hey! What is there in these pennies!
What is there?

1819
01:55:58,629 --> 01:56:01,962
Mr. Sethi.. you keep on sending me
money from Dubai.

1820
01:56:02,466 --> 01:56:04,696
And I will keep on buying properties here.

1821
01:56:05,002 --> 01:56:07,368
Fine? Secretary!

1822
01:56:07,905 --> 01:56:10,373
Then wait and watch what we do!

1823
01:56:11,242 --> 01:56:16,908
Shopping complex..
housing complex.. multiplexes..

1824
01:56:17,548 --> 01:56:21,780
.. going carting.. and what's that?

1825
01:56:21,986 --> 01:56:25,353
Bowling. -We will do everything. Fine?

1826
01:56:25,556 --> 01:56:28,957
And you guys are coming tomorrow.
Mr. Sethi! For lunch!

1827
01:56:29,326 --> 01:56:33,228
Then we will talk tomorrow!
Okay! Goodnight! Goodnight!

1828
01:56:33,431 --> 01:56:33,954
Sir, cash.

1829
01:56:34,165 --> 01:56:37,498
Very good! Very good! Very decent!

1830
01:56:37,701 --> 01:56:40,192
No, I appreciate. - Sir, cash. Cash.

1831
01:56:42,339 --> 01:56:42,964
Thank you.

1832
01:56:46,477 --> 01:56:48,138
Tomorrow. Goodnight!

1833
01:56:48,846 --> 01:56:53,613
Hey! Go straight and take a right turn.

1834
01:56:54,118 --> 01:56:57,144
Come on. Be careful. Carefully.

1835
01:57:00,291 --> 01:57:02,759
Mr. Sethi.. goodnight.

1836
01:57:03,294 --> 01:57:06,263
I will just come. - Sir! Sir! Sir!

1837
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:33,914
Are they coming properly?

1838
01:57:34,125 --> 01:57:36,753
Yes, they are coming.
Come on. Increase the speed.

1839
01:57:42,533 --> 01:57:44,023
Asif-bhai. -Yes.

1840
01:57:44,935 --> 01:57:45,594
Thank you.

1841
01:57:46,370 --> 01:57:48,861
What are you saying, Cherry-bhai!

1842
01:57:56,113 --> 01:57:57,045
Hail to the Goddess!

1843
01:58:02,153 --> 01:58:03,381
Hail to the Goddess!

1844
01:58:06,824 --> 01:58:07,518
What is this?

1845
01:58:08,359 --> 01:58:09,257
What do you think?

1846
01:58:14,265 --> 01:58:15,095
Did you check it?

1847
01:58:15,299 --> 01:58:16,231
Can I get water?

1848
01:58:16,433 --> 01:58:18,060
Did you check it? -Yes.

1849
01:58:26,577 --> 01:58:28,568
Not here. Let's go inside.

1850
01:58:40,591 --> 01:58:41,387
Papa.

1851
01:58:44,195 --> 01:58:45,219
We got the money.

1852
01:58:56,574 --> 01:59:00,340
Get the plot back tomorrow.

1853
01:59:09,019 --> 01:59:10,452
You too come along.

1854
01:59:14,091 --> 01:59:15,922
Now I can't do all this alone.

1855
01:59:24,001 --> 01:59:25,298
Keep this in the safe.

1856
01:59:52,029 --> 01:59:54,190
"What is love?"

1857
01:59:54,665 --> 01:59:56,599
"What is it not?"

1858
01:59:57,201 --> 02:00:02,434
"I didn't ask. "

1859
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:06,701
"Are you mine or not. "

1860
02:00:06,910 --> 02:00:08,070
Hi. - Hi.

1861
02:00:08,312 --> 02:00:10,610
Where were you? - I was changing.

1862
02:00:11,882 --> 02:00:13,076
We got the money.

1863
02:00:15,052 --> 02:00:18,749
I know. Okay. I have to go.

1864
02:00:18,956 --> 02:00:22,653
Shall I escort you?
- No, I have the scooter. Bye.

1865
02:00:26,964 --> 02:00:27,589
Meghna!

1866
02:00:38,475 --> 02:00:41,740
Mr. Khosla, you are great! Take this.

1867
02:00:42,279 --> 02:00:46,181
Very good! Very good!
Is he your other son? -Yes.

1868
02:00:47,251 --> 02:00:48,081
What does he do?

1869
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:51,152
He's a software engineer.

1870
02:00:51,355 --> 02:00:53,482
Excellent! Very good! Very good!

1871
02:00:53,824 --> 02:00:56,691
You are lucky. You have 2 sons.

1872
02:00:57,695 --> 02:01:00,027
One is angry son
and the other one wears specs.

1873
02:01:03,801 --> 02:01:05,029
We want to vacate the plot.

1874
02:01:06,036 --> 02:01:08,869
Tell Ombirto evacuate.

1875
02:01:09,073 --> 02:01:11,541
The plot is vacant, sir.
Ombir is here, sir.

1876
02:01:12,943 --> 02:01:17,039
Excellent! The plot is vacate!

1877
02:01:18,949 --> 02:01:20,211
Goodbye then.

1878
02:01:23,387 --> 02:01:26,015
At least have sweets.
You have got the plot back.

1879
02:01:26,223 --> 02:01:28,350
No! No! - For my sake! Please!

1880
02:01:28,559 --> 02:01:30,686
No, no. Please, Mr. Khurana. I don't want it.

1881
02:01:52,549 --> 02:01:57,680
Papa! Papa, are you okay?
- I am fine.

1882
02:01:58,355 --> 02:02:02,917
Are you sure?
- I was feeling giddy. I am okay.

1883
02:02:04,995 --> 02:02:06,053
I am okay.

1884
02:02:24,615 --> 02:02:27,209
Have you thought of a name?
- What?

1885
02:02:29,653 --> 02:02:34,215
You wanted to change your name, didn't you?

1886
02:02:34,792 --> 02:02:36,419
You didn't get the time.

1887
02:02:41,732 --> 02:02:42,858
So when are you leaving?

1888
02:02:45,736 --> 02:02:46,498
Where?

1889
02:02:48,772 --> 02:02:50,137
America. Where else?

1890
02:02:52,609 --> 02:02:54,236
I don't know.

1891
02:02:56,146 --> 02:02:58,580
It has been a long time
since I spoke to them.

1892
02:03:00,551 --> 02:03:02,451
Anyway they were not paying well.

1893
02:03:09,493 --> 02:03:11,427
She's a nice girl. -Who?

1894
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:17,262
Meghna. She is a nice girl.

1895
02:03:21,905 --> 02:03:23,873
Hi. - Hi.

1896
02:03:30,514 --> 02:03:33,950
Meghna.. I am not going to New York.

1897
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:38,553
Meghna, I am not going to New York.

1898
02:03:42,926 --> 02:03:45,918
Are you doing a favour on me? - Meghna.

1899
02:03:48,332 --> 02:03:51,096
Today you are not going.
You will go tomorrow.

1900
02:03:51,835 --> 02:03:56,204
You are not going day after tomorrow.
It is not a joke to you.

1901
02:03:59,276 --> 02:04:03,770
No Meghna! I want to stay here.

1902
02:04:08,285 --> 02:04:09,081
I need you!

1903
02:04:09,286 --> 02:04:10,480
Just don't say anything!

1904
02:04:11,555 --> 02:04:12,954
I love you, Meghna!- Shut up!

1905
02:04:21,064 --> 02:04:21,860
Meghna! I am sorry!

1906
02:04:27,304 --> 02:04:29,465
"The night is so short. "

1907
02:04:29,940 --> 02:04:32,408
"There are so many things to be said. "

1908
02:04:32,609 --> 02:04:34,873
"Now that you have come. "

1909
02:04:35,212 --> 02:04:37,578
"I will tell you everything. "

1910
02:04:38,115 --> 02:04:42,347
"Please hold me just once. "

1911
02:04:42,986 --> 02:04:48,151
"Please hold me just once. "

1912
02:04:48,492 --> 02:04:51,086
"The wait.. the faith.. "

1913
02:04:51,295 --> 02:04:53,729
"I love you too so much. "

1914
02:04:53,931 --> 02:04:56,399
"The wait.. the faith.. "

1915
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:59,034
"I love you too so much. "

1916
02:04:59,236 --> 02:05:01,670
"The wait.. the faith.. "

1917
02:05:01,872 --> 02:05:04,397
"I love you too so much. "

1918
02:05:04,608 --> 02:05:06,803
"The wait.. the faith.. "

1919
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:11,242
"I love you too so much. "

1920
02:05:21,959 --> 02:05:23,950
Okay now one minute, let us be serious.
One minute!

1921
02:05:24,728 --> 02:05:27,196
After giving Khurana 10 lakhs
we have 25 left with us.

1922
02:05:27,397 --> 02:05:30,264
Out of that the expenses
were around 1 lakh.

1923
02:05:30,467 --> 02:05:32,332
So now what do we do with the rest?

1924
02:05:33,770 --> 02:05:34,930
I do not know anything about it.

1925
02:05:35,138 --> 02:05:36,969
You don't ask me
anything about the money.

1926
02:05:37,841 --> 02:05:40,935
So if we divide this money
into three parts then..

1927
02:05:41,712 --> 02:05:43,407
.. Aasif brother you will get 8 lakhs.

1928
02:05:48,819 --> 02:05:50,946
Thank you! - No, thank you!

1929
02:05:52,055 --> 02:05:54,114
And Bapu, for your theatre group, 8 lakhs.

1930
02:05:54,324 --> 02:05:55,552
No! Ten lakhs!

1931
02:05:55,759 --> 02:05:59,593
Hey no! - Not for you,
you smoke your beedi.

1932
02:05:59,896 --> 02:06:02,126
Our theatre company does not run on water.

1933
02:06:02,399 --> 02:06:04,867
A little money will always be of help to us.

1934
02:06:05,068 --> 02:06:06,160
Papu, he is right!

1935
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:09,296
8 will be okay!

1936
02:06:09,506 --> 02:06:11,940
Now remain our 8 lakhs.

1937
02:06:12,709 --> 02:06:13,937
What are we supposed to do with that?

1938
02:06:40,837 --> 02:06:49,768
Sir, the hotel is saying..
that no Sethi ever came there from Dubai.

1939
02:06:54,184 --> 02:06:54,809
Phone.

1940
02:06:55,318 --> 02:06:59,186
It's Dubai's cash card number.

1941
02:07:03,527 --> 02:07:04,323
The plot.

1942
02:07:05,095 --> 02:07:06,562
It belongs to the fisheries board.

1943
02:07:11,702 --> 02:07:13,135
Just forget what happened.

1944
02:07:16,073 --> 02:07:18,769
This matter should not be leaked out.

1945
02:07:22,612 --> 02:07:25,103
That somebody fooled Khurana.

1946
02:07:39,229 --> 02:07:40,594
Now you all do it properly please.

1947
02:07:41,594 --> 02:07:51,594
