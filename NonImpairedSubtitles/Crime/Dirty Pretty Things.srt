00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:31,332  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:346 Y2:414
Ryanair final call
for passenger Wilton,

2
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,570  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:346 Y2:414
travelling to Brussels,
Charleroi, on flight FR 1014.

Please proceed immediately
to departure gate 6,

4
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,775  X1:269 X2:451 Y1:346 Y2:414
where this flight
is now closing.

5
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,845  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:346 Y2:414
Do you want a car?
£10, Theatre Land?

6
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,048  X1:283 X2:437 Y1:360 Y2:399
Car? London?

7
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,224  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:399
You want a taxi?

8
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:58,392  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:360 Y2:399
Buckingham Palace.

9
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,800  X1:313 X2:407 Y1:360 Y2:399
No-one.

10
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,436  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:360 Y2:399
Would you like a car, sir?

11
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,805  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:360 Y2:399
Are you from Sajit?

12
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,573  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
I'm not here
to meet you in particular,

13
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:15,343  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:346 Y2:414
but I am here to rescue those
let down by the system.

14
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,946  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:346 Y2:414
- OK, let's go.
- I'm over there.

15
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,333  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hey, Okwe, how are you, man?

16
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,435  X1:282 X2:438 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Who's next?
- 2-9.

17
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,141  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hey, my turn now.

18
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,177  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:360 Y2:399
Let's me go.

19
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,279  X1:330 X2:390 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hey!

20
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:31,452  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Your name is now Mohammed.
- Thank you, Okwe.

21
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,332  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
Hurry up now, man. Come
quick, quick, quick, quick.

22
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,235  X1:293 X2:427 Y1:360 Y2:399
Quick, now.

23
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,022  X1:298 X2:422 Y1:360 Y2:399
That bitch!

24
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,124  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:360 Y2:399
This shit dustbin city.

25
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,461  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:360 Y2:399
So... What, Okwe?

26
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:15,530  X1:294 X2:426 Y1:360 Y2:399
Amoxycillin.

27
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,232  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:346 Y2:414
You get that in Boots
all right, or not?

28
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,134  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:346 Y2:414
- From a doctor.
- You're a doctor.

29
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,203  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm a driver.

30
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,174  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:346 Y2:414
Look, they say
you're a doctor, right?

31
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,242  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:360 Y2:399
You get me something now.

32
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,545  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
I can't piss fire another day,
man.

33
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,213  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm a driver.

34
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,916  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
It's for my wife's sake.
You know what I mean?

35
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:41,055  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
OK... So, I'll get you
all the jobs in south London.

36
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,359  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:360 Y2:399
OK, I'll see what I can do.

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,428  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:360 Y2:399
Let me kiss you, Okwe.

38
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,597  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:346 Y2:414
Maybe in return
you can get some soap.

39
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:09,417  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:360 Y2:399
Early is as bad as late, Okwe.

40
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:47,088  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hello, Front Desk.

41
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:50,424  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
No, I'm afraid the kitchen
is closed from midnight.

42
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,961  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,898  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:360 Y2:399
Goodnight, madam.

44
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:48,816  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:346 Y2:414
Senay, perhaps today
I can cook you lunch?

45
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:49,951  X1:299 X2:421 Y1:360 Y2:399
No, Okwe.

46
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,327  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:346 Y2:414
- So, it's true what they say?
- What is true?

47
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:02,763  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:346 Y2:414
They say you and the Turkish
girl are nesting like birds.

48
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:05,166  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:360 Y2:399
I rent her couch.

49
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,435  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
In the morning,
when she's working here.

50
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,739  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:346 Y2:414
We're never there at the same
time. She has... rules.

51
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,376  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
You know she's a Muslim,
which means she's a virgin.

52
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,378  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:360 Y2:399
Like a little angel.

53
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,314  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:346 Y2:414
Ivan, I think
there's someone at the door.

54
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:25,720  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:360 Y2:399
Can you believe it?

55
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,422  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
One of the fuckers wanted
to put me on his Visa card!

56
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,525  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:360 Y2:399
Oh, my bloomin' feet!

57
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,693  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:360 Y2:399
Lucky I don't work standing up!

58
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:37,565  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:360 Y2:399
What?

59
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,001  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
Don't they have hookers
where you come from?

60
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:41,669  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:399
Where are you from?

61
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,740  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:360 Y2:399
Somewhere with lions, I bet.

62
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,079  X1:298 X2:422 Y1:360 Y2:399
I like lions.

63
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,150  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:360 Y2:399
Right... Oh, yeah.

64
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,086  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:346 Y2:414
You might want to send someone
to check on the room.

65
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,756  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:346 Y2:414
- There is a problem?
- How should I know?

66
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,958  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:360 Y2:399
I don't exist, do I?

67
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,428  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:360 Y2:399
See you tomorrow.

68
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,883  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:346 Y2:414
What's that? You're stealing
stuff already, huh?

69
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,588  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
Guy before you used to take
whole pigs from the freezer.

70
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:17,425  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:346 Y2:414
But you'd better hide it.
If Sneaky sees that...

71
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,161  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:360 Y2:399
Speak of the fucking devil!

72
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,630  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:360 Y2:399
Where's the greeter here?

73
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,052  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:360 Y2:399
This fucking place!

74
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:50,992  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:346 Y2:414
Hey! Instead of smoking,
you clean this place up!

75
00:10:29,163 --> 00:10:31,265  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:360 Y2:399
Okwe! Everything is all right?

76
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,238  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:360 Y2:399
What's this? Lunch?

77
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:39,607  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
It was blocking the lavatory
in room 510.

78
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,679  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:360 Y2:399
It is a heart.

79
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,315  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:346 Y2:414
- A human heart.
- What?

80
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,152  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:346 Y2:414
What the fuck do you know
about hearts, Okwe?

81
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:53,788  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:346 Y2:414
Perhaps you should telephone
the police.

82
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,459  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:346 Y2:414
Police? You think
I should call the police?

83
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:00,595  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:399
Senor Juan, someone is dead.

84
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,464  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:360 Y2:399
OK. You speak to them.

85
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,268  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:346 Y2:414
You found it.
You do the talking.

86
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:10,338  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:360 Y2:399
I will introduce you.

87
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,676  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:399
What's your full name, Okwe?

88
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:19,547  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
And you never told me
where you are from.

89
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:24,018  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:346 Y2:414
Or even how come you are here
in this beautiful country.

90
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:26,320  X1:284 X2:436 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hello? Police?

91
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,890  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
Yeah, I've got somebody
who wants to talk to you.

92
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,528  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hello? Hello?

93
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,168  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:360 Y2:399
You will learn, Okwe.

94
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,870  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:346 Y2:414
The hotel business
is about strangers.

95
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:47,175  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
And strangers will always
surprise you, you know.

96
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,979  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:346 Y2:414
They come to hotels in
the night to do dirty things.

97
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,848  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:360 Y2:399
And in the morning,

98
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:56,884  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:346 Y2:414
it's our job to make things
look pretty again.

99
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,053  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:360 Y2:399
For your trouble.

100
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:03,858  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:346 Y2:414
You think if you don't take
the money, you are innocent?

101
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,027  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:346 Y2:414
Take it.
Do something nice with it.

102
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,935  X1:337 X2:383 Y1:360 Y2:399
No.

103
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:42,089  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:346 Y2:414
It came to me last night
in a flash of inspiration.

104
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,697  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:360 Y2:399
I can see.

105
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:52,166  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:346 Y2:414
- That's a good move.
- Ah!

106
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:54,368  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:346 Y2:414
Guo Yi,
there's something I need.

107
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,505  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:399
Amoxycillin? You got the clap?

108
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,876  X1:286 X2:434 Y1:360 Y2:399
No. My boss.

109
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:04,579  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Which one?
- They're all the same.

110
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,381  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
In this country,
the health service is free.

111
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,352  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:346 Y2:414
You still driving cabs
in the day?

112
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,889  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:360 Y2:399
You're going to kill yourself.

113
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,124  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:360 Y2:399
I do not care to sleep.

114
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:23,364  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
When you go quiet,
it means you've won already.

115
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,367  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:360 Y2:399
Go on, Okwe. Don't be nice.

116
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,236  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:399
It makes it worse.

117
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:35,343  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:360 Y2:399
Well, shit.

118
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:37,345  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:346 Y2:414
You want Chinese
or English tea?

119
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:38,379  X1:310 X2:410 Y1:360 Y2:399
Chinese.

120
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,548  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:346 Y2:414
Don't know
how you drink that stuff.

121
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:44,619  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
I found it on a body. It's
blown my head wide open.

122
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,721  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:360 Y2:399
You should read it.

123
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:49,724  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:360 Y2:399
Medicine for your soul, Okwe,

124
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,062  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:346 Y2:414
Guo Yi,
today I also found something.

125
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:57,365  X1:283 X2:437 Y1:360 Y2:399
In a lavatory,

126
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:00,568  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:346 Y2:414
in one of the hotel rooms.
Someone's heart.

127
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,307  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:360 Y2:399
A heart. A human heart.

128
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,110  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:346 Y2:414
I'm only telling you
because you are a rational man.

129
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:13,414  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:399
Maybe there's an explanation.

130
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:22,456  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:346 Y2:414
Maybe some guy with one of
the girls had a heart attack.

131
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,559  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:360 Y2:399
Rooms are down as empty,

132
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,861  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
so the Spanish guy
had to get rid of the body.

133
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:31,132  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Hotels hate dead people.
- It was a healthy heart.

134
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:34,268  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:346 Y2:414
So your boss was right.
Somebody brought it with them.

135
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:36,771  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Who carries human organs?
- Lots of people.

136
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,873  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Name someone.
- Me, OK? Me.

137
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,808  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:360 Y2:399
I do it all the time.

138
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,110  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:360 Y2:399
I take my work home.

139
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,546  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
What I'm saying is, I could,
if I was weird.

140
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,649  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:399
And this is a weird city.

141
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:52,820  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
Why would anyone do that
to a human heart?

142
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,423  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:346 Y2:414
These sound to me
like questions.

143
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:58,326  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:346 Y2:414
I don't ask questions
after eleven years here,

144
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,628  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:399
and I'm a certified refugee.

145
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:04,699  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:346 Y2:414
You're an illegal, Okwe.
You don't have a position here.

146
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,901  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:346 Y2:414
You have nothing.
You are nothing.

147
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:11,272  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
You wait outside.
I'll go get you those pills.

148
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,811  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:346 Y2:414
Stick to helping people
who can be helped.

149
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,697  X1:294 X2:426 Y1:360 Y2:399
Fresh stuff.

150
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:37,865  X1:296 X2:424 Y1:360 Y2:399
Thank you.

151
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:13,534  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
Having only one key
is making this impossible.

152
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,703  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:346 Y2:414
I do not want you coming in
when I am there.

153
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,639  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:346 Y2:414
At the hotel we are friends.
I am no different here.

154
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:21,242  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:399
How would it look, Okwe?

155
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,012  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
So it is better I always
chase you down the street?

156
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:28,349  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:346 Y2:414
Wait five minutes,
then knock the door.

157
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,320  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:360 Y2:399
Knock very, very quietly.

158
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:52,740  X1:330 X2:390 Y1:360 Y2:399
Yes?

159
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:56,277  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
Did you clean on the fifth
floor yesterday morning?

160
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:06,387  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:360 Y2:399
Nothing works!

161
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:09,724  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:346 Y2:414
Senay, did you clean room 510
yesterday?

162
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:12,960  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
What the hell are you
talking about the hotel for?

163
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,295  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:360 Y2:399
Water, water, water!

164
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:19,033  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
I was wondering if there was
a problem in 510 yesterday.

165
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,169  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:360 Y2:399
You can fix these things?

166
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,438  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:360 Y2:399
Okwe,

167
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:27,375  X1:281 X2:439 Y1:360 Y2:399
you can fix...?

168
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,310  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:360 Y2:399
They were not clean.

169
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,612  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Glasses need very hot water.
- So do women.

170
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,749  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:346 Y2:414
Everything here is connected
to everything else.

171
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:41,322  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
Okwe, in Africa it is the men
who cook and clean?

172
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:46,427  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:360 Y2:399
This came for you.

173
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:51,432  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Why did you not tell me?
- I just told you.

174
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,872  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:360 Y2:399
You have friends in New York?

175
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,311  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:360 Y2:399
Your postcard.

176
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,279  X1:270 X2:450 Y1:360 Y2:399
I have a cousin.

177
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:08,015  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:346 Y2:414
Ever since I was small,
she has written to me.

178
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:10,751  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
I sometimes wish London
was more like New York.

179
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,487  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:346 Y2:414
It would be easy
to drive a cab there.

180
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:14,355  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:360 Y2:399
You have been to New York?

181
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,960  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
- And you came back?
- I lived there for a time.

182
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,965  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
In the winter,
they put lights in the trees.

183
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:26,167  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:360 Y2:399
Is that true?

184
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:28,870  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:360 Y2:399
And you can skate in the parks.

185
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,306  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:346 Y2:414
And some of the policemen
ride white horses.

186
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:35,143  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:360 Y2:399
Not all of them, but some.

187
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:40,014  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:346 Y2:414
- What did you do there?
- I worked in a hospital.

188
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:42,383  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
- You were a cleaner?
- I was there to study.

189
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:45,453  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:346 Y2:414
So, why are you working
in a hotel?

190
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:47,121  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:360 Y2:399
It is an African story.

191
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,660  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:346 Y2:414
I've noticed you never answer
yes or no.

192
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:55,029  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:360 Y2:399
You are very strange.

193
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,566  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:399
You drink wine, Senay?

194
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,668  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:346 Y2:414
Do you want to know
why I left Turkey?

195
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,670  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
Because you wanted to live
like your cousin?

196
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,807  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:346 Y2:414
No, because I do not want
to live like my mother.

197
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,010  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

198
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,078  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:360 Y2:399
I do drink wine.

199
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:32,767  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:399
This is a recipe from Nigeria.

200
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:36,537  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
In Nigeria they do many
interesting things with pork.

201
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,577  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:399
But of course, I used lamb.

202
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:00,428  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:360 Y2:399
Take one three times a day.

203
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,196  X1:282 X2:438 Y1:360 Y2:399
Avoid alcohol.

204
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:04,065  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:360 Y2:399
In here. Come.

205
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:09,203  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:360 Y2:399
It's all right.

206
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:25,620  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:360 Y2:399
So she's a popular lady.

207
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,688  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
My warriors cannot work
with rotten balls.

208
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:31,592  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:346 Y2:414
My friend is just a porter
in the hospital crematorium.

209
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,441  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hello. Front Desk.

210
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,044  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
No, I'm afraid the kitchen
is closed from midnight.

211
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,179  X1:327 X2:393 Y1:360 Y2:399
Tssk!

212
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:55,783  X1:323 X2:397 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hello?

213
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,852  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:399
Yeah, Room Service.

214
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,530  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:360 Y2:399
Sneaky doesn't know about this?

215
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,699  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:360 Y2:399
Sneaky knows about everything.

216
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,204  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:346 Y2:414
And you? You know everything
that goes on in the hotel?

217
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:18,306  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:346 Y2:414
No, no,
not so much butter, hey.

218
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:23,711  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:346 Y2:414
You guard the door, lvan.
You see who comes and goes.

219
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,682  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
You would know if somebody
came into the hotel,

220
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:29,350  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:360 Y2:399
and did not leave again?

221
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,953  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:346 Y2:414
Why would someone not leave,
Okwe?

222
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,058  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:360 Y2:399
I don't know.

223
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,660  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:346 Y2:414
You should remove the crusts,
like in the Ritz.

224
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:43,631  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:360 Y2:399
Everyone leaves, Okwe.

225
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,767  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:360 Y2:399
Some leave quickly.

226
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,836  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:360 Y2:399
Some stay for a long time.

227
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,838  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:360 Y2:399
If you want to stay,

228
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:55,643  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
don't concern yourself with
who comes and who goes.

229
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:02,717  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
It's the little touches
that make the difference.

230
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:05,319  X1:263 X2:457 Y1:360 Y2:399
That's capitalism.

231
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:09,891  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:346 Y2:414
Now go. Don't forget,
you accept only cash.

232
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:14,896  X1:279 X2:441 Y1:360 Y2:399
Room Service.

233
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:19,200  X1:313 X2:407 Y1:360 Y2:399
Thanks.

234
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:19,060  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:346 Y2:414
OK, you just make yourself
comfortable, and er...

235
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:22,463  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:346 Y2:414
I'll go and freshen up.
All right?

236
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,871  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:360 Y2:399
Fucking arsehole!

237
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:44,485  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:399
Come on, babe. Hurry up.

238
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:49,357  X1:313 X2:407 Y1:360 Y2:399
OK, OK.

239
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,559  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:399
Calm yourself, sweetheart.

240
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:58,132  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:346 Y2:414
- What are you doing?
- Have a drink first.

241
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,334  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:346 Y2:414
You look fine.
Just get out here.

242
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,589  X1:327 X2:393 Y1:360 Y2:399
Stop!

243
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,392  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:399
Enough. No more.

244
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,993  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:346 Y2:414
Where the fuck
did you come from?

245
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,062  X1:270 X2:450 Y1:360 Y2:399
You, leave now.

246
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:41,909  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:346 Y2:414
- You don't have concussion.
- How the fuck do you know?

247
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:43,811  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:360 Y2:399
Christ, you must be bored,

248
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,580  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:346 Y2:414
getting your kicks
spying on me.

249
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:48,182  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:346 Y2:414
I was making sure the blockage
had not returned.

250
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,384  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:360 Y2:399
Perhaps...

251
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:54,021  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:346 Y2:414
- It's Juliette.
- You should go home and rest.

252
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,924  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:346 Y2:414
Rest?
Got three more before morning.

253
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,360  X1:331 X2:389 Y1:360 Y2:399
So...

254
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:01,229  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:399
Have you ever seen a lion?

255
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:03,197  X1:311 X2:409 Y1:360 Y2:399
Oh, yes.

256
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:05,399  X1:318 X2:402 Y1:360 Y2:399
On TV.

257
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:30,925  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:360 Y2:399
I had it cut. It is yours.

258
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:35,530  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:346 Y2:414
You were right.
This way is more sensible.

259
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,981  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:346 Y2:414
Okwe, you must not tell them
at the hotel

260
00:26:54,081 --> 00:26:55,883  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:399
that you have a key.

261
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,252  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
- I tell them only the truth.
- Even so.

262
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,321  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:360 Y2:399
Show them that your back hurts,

263
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:02,323  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:346 Y2:414
so they know
you sleep on the floor.

264
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:04,625  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:346 Y2:414
But that is not true.
I sleep on the couch.

265
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:08,162  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:346 Y2:414
The couch is not as real
as the floor, Okwe.

266
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:10,031  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:360 Y2:399
Believe me, I am a woman.

267
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:12,767  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
And some of those bitches
won't know what is a couch.

268
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:15,336  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:346 Y2:414
But they know floor.
They clean floors.

269
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:19,106  X1:309 X2:411 Y1:360 Y2:399
For you?

270
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,509  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:346 Y2:414
Lmmigration Enforcement
directive!

271
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:23,678  X1:274 X2:446 Y1:360 Y2:399
Open the door.

272
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:37,792  X1:297 X2:423 Y1:360 Y2:399
Miss Gelik?

273
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:39,660  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:346 Y2:414
Senay Gelik?
Turkish national?

274
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,329  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:399
Do you have your SAL handy?

275
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:43,631  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
Standard Acknowledgement
Letter. Your ID.

276
00:27:43,698 --> 00:27:45,800  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:346 Y2:414
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I carry it always.

277
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,636  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:346 Y2:414
Neighbours, Senay.
They see things.

278
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,405  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:346 Y2:414
In the last few days they've
seen someone come and go.

279
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,508  X1:317 X2:403 Y1:360 Y2:399
A man.

280
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:57,278  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:346 Y2:414
Sometimes a woman in your position
can be exploited.

281
00:27:57,378 --> 00:28:00,081  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
There are people living in
London without any papers.

282
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:02,383  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:346 Y2:414
- They prey on people like you.
- Pray?

283
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:04,986  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
- There is someone here.
- There is no-one here.

284
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:09,490  X1:154 X2:566 Y1:346 Y2:414
You are aware your ELR status
means you are unable to accept rent.

285
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,559  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:360 Y2:399
You are seeking asylum.

286
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,329  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:346 Y2:414
Or engage in employment of any
kind for at least six months.

287
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,533  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:346 Y2:414
- You're not working, are you?
- Mind if I use your bathroom?

288
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:21,869  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:360 Y2:399
Your case is under review.

289
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:50,131  X1:296 X2:424 Y1:360 Y2:399
Thank you.

290
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:52,667  X1:296 X2:424 Y1:360 Y2:399
Thank you.

291
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:54,602  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:360 Y2:399
Is that all you want?

292
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,804  X1:296 X2:424 Y1:360 Y2:399
No, no, no.

293
00:28:58,473 --> 00:29:00,775  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
You know this stuff will not
only keep you awake.

294
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:03,711  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:346 Y2:414
It'll blow your brains out.
You know that, don't you?

295
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:14,222  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Hey, Okwe!
- Boy, your licence.

296
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:17,758  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:360 Y2:399
Keys, there you are.

297
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:21,028  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hey, Okwe, what happen, man?

298
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:23,598  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:346 Y2:414
Hey, somebody's husband
come home early, right?

299
00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:25,466  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:360 Y2:399
Anyway, take this.

300
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,902  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
We don't want the doctor
getting sick, right?

301
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,513  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:346 Y2:414
I played them
one of these fellas' songs,

302
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:40,715  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:346 Y2:414
and, actually,
they were very helpful.

303
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,459  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:399
It's bound to happen.

304
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:53,528  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:360 Y2:399
You stay here too long.

305
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:56,130  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:346 Y2:414
You start dressing
like an Englishman.

306
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:20,521  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Where is he, then?
- Who?

307
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:23,658  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:346 Y2:414
I've a date.
Every pay-day, 4:45.

308
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,026  X1:330 X2:390 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hey!

309
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,362  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:360 Y2:399
Come on, lover boy!

310
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:30,231  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:360 Y2:399
Okwe, will you help me?

311
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:32,633  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
Hey, guy before you took L5,
huh?

312
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,870  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:346 Y2:414
- No, no, no, no.
- But you watch the door, huh?

313
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,538  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:360 Y2:399
Come, my little princess.

314
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:40,041  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:346 Y2:414
Come, come, come,
lille princesso!

315
00:30:40,141 --> 00:30:43,811  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:346 Y2:414
Security room is out of bounds
for half an hour.

316
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:45,980  X1:254 X2:466 Y1:360 Y2:399
Five minutes, max!

317
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:50,885  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:346 Y2:414
Lmmigration Enforcement
directive.

318
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:01,262  X1:272 X2:448 Y1:360 Y2:399
Can I help you?

319
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,168  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:346 Y2:414
What time
do the maids clock in?

320
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:11,005  X1:268 X2:452 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Wakey wakey!
- Five o'clock.

321
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:15,510  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:360 Y2:399
Do you mind if we wait?

322
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,147  X1:337 X2:383 Y1:360 Y2:399
No.

323
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:39,767  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:346 Y2:414
Excuse me, sir.
This is a non-smoking area.

324
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:43,738  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you wish to smoke, you can
wait in the designated area.

325
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:23,478  X1:293 X2:427 Y1:360 Y2:399
It's for you.

326
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:25,746  X1:284 X2:436 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hello? Okwe?

327
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:29,116  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:360 Y2:399
But I am almost there.

328
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:31,586  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:346 Y2:414
Senay will be here
in two minutes.

329
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:34,489  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:360 Y2:399
You must stop her.

330
00:33:40,388 --> 00:33:42,523  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:360 Y2:399
I have a medical condition!

331
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,393  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:360 Y2:399
Lightning doesn't strike twice!

332
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:04,779  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Is that the last of them?
- Yes.

333
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,382  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:399
This is an interesting place.

334
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,985  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:346 Y2:414
Would you like to see
a rate card?

335
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,008  X1:272 X2:448 Y1:360 Y2:399
I have a friend.

336
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,410  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
In her factory,
they always need people.

337
00:34:36,477 --> 00:34:38,146  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:360 Y2:399
It's a sweatshop.

338
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:41,082  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:346 Y2:414
Is it any worse
than cleaning up after whores?

339
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:43,284  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:399
It's better money.

340
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:48,089  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:399
Oh, you are so sad for me.

341
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:50,258  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
I do not wish to cause harm
to anyone.

342
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:51,826  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:360 Y2:399
That is all it is?

343
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:53,728  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:346 Y2:414
I will collect my things
and go.

344
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:55,797  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Go?
- How can I stay?

345
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,965  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:399
Okwe, who will cook for me?

346
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,570  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:346 Y2:414
If it's OK, I will call on you
if I have the time.

347
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:05,072  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:346 Y2:414
But I'm owed three days' money
by the hotel.

348
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,409  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:346 Y2:414
I will see Senor Juan
tomorrow morning.

349
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,611  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:360 Y2:399
I have no money for food.

350
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:14,649  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
I will see him today.
Meet me at the cafe at four.

351
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:57,325  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:360 Y2:399
You are here to see Senor Juan?

352
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:03,231  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:360 Y2:399
Looking for work?

353
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,103  X1:273 X2:447 Y1:360 Y2:399
Vous travaillez?

354
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,773  X1:287 X2:433 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Francais?
- No, no, no.

355
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,977  X1:312 X2:408 Y1:360 Y2:399
M'aidez.

356
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:19,313  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:360 Y2:399
Yoruba? You speak Yoruba?

357
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:22,850  X1:319 X2:401 Y1:360 Y2:399
Bantu?

358
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:26,821  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
What the fuck
are you doing here, Okwe?

359
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,689  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:360 Y2:399
Senay has decided to leave.

360
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:30,792  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:346 Y2:414
She asked me to collect
what she's owed.

361
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:33,828  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
Oh, yeah? What, are you
marrying her or something?

362
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:39,734  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'll get her money.

363
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:53,014  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:346 Y2:414
No, no. It's OK, it's OK.
I'm a doctor.

364
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,183  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm a doctor, it's OK.

365
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:58,619  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:360 Y2:399
No, please, please...

366
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:01,856  X1:317 X2:403 Y1:360 Y2:399
Please.

367
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:08,029  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
You must get this man
to hospital now. Right now!

368
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,398  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:346 Y2:414
- He must go straight away.
- No, no.

369
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,600  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you are a doctor,
you can help this guy.

370
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,769  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:346 Y2:414
This is the wound
of an operation.

371
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:19,774  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:346 Y2:414
Where? Where did he have this
operation? Which country?

372
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,976  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
You must get this man
to hospital.

373
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:25,613  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:346 Y2:414
- They won't go to hospital.
- No, no, no, no hospital.

374
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,403  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:360 Y2:399
Guo Yi is here?

375
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:52,306  X1:332 X2:388 Y1:360 Y2:399
Shit.

376
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:10,658  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:346 Y2:414
It's my first day. I was told
to collect my green overall.

377
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,760  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Which shift are you on?
- Which shift?

378
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:15,897  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:346 Y2:414
Come on. Either you're late
or you're really late.

379
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:17,959  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
You couldn't do the bins
in the kitchen, could you?

380
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:27,795  X1:329 X2:391 Y1:360 Y2:399
OK...

381
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:31,032  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:360 Y2:399
You see these blue tablets?

382
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:35,169  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:346 Y2:414
He must take two every
two hours. You understand?

383
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:39,373  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:346 Y2:414
He must take two blue tablets
every two hours.

384
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,252  X1:254 X2:466 Y1:360 Y2:399
You speak English?

385
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:54,288  X1:282 X2:438 Y1:346 Y2:414
- And Somali?
- A bit.

386
00:40:57,925 --> 00:41:01,395  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:346 Y2:414
He says to say thank you.
God is great.

387
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:05,199  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
Tell him he must take two
blue tablets every two hours.

388
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,774  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:346 Y2:414
And one white tablet
every six hours.

389
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:20,014  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
It is very important that
you get this exactly right.

390
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,621  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
Ask him
which hospital they went to

391
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:28,790  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:360 Y2:399
to have the kidney removed.

392
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:36,697  X1:163 X2:557 Y1:360 Y2:399
He says they didn't go to a hospital.

393
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:39,200  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:360 Y2:399
Ask him where they did this.

394
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,039  X1:298 X2:422 Y1:360 Y2:399
In a room.

395
00:41:45,173 --> 00:41:47,441  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:346 Y2:414
He had his kidney removed
in the hotel, yes?

396
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:51,512  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:346 Y2:414
How much did he get
for risking his life?

397
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:58,186  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:399
He is English now.

398
00:41:58,386 --> 00:42:00,988  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:346 Y2:414
He swapped his insides
for a passport?

399
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:11,132  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:346 Y2:414
The man at the hotel said it would be
like taking out a tooth.

400
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:50,104  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:360 Y2:399
Can I get you something?

401
00:42:50,238 --> 00:42:52,740  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
- I've been here one hour.
- An hour and a half.

402
00:42:58,246 --> 00:42:59,714  X1:320 X2:400 Y1:360 Y2:399
There.

403
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:01,916  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:346 Y2:414
I will go
and collect my things.

404
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:05,553  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:360 Y2:399
Why won't you sit down?

405
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:14,529  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Okwe, where have you been?
- Africa.

406
00:43:14,729 --> 00:43:16,197  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:360 Y2:399
I thought you weren't coming.

407
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:17,865  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:346 Y2:414
I would have got you the money
somehow.

408
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:20,067  X1:290 X2:430 Y1:360 Y2:399
The money?

409
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:26,207  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:346 Y2:414
Do you feel that?
Do you feel anything?

410
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,546  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
I counted. I've seen you
laugh three times.

411
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:35,349  X1:327 X2:393 Y1:360 Y2:399
Four.

412
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,289  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:360 Y2:399
You think I'm so innocent.

413
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,759  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:346 Y2:414
In my village,
they chew those leaves

414
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:46,694  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
to forget
how hard their lives are.

415
00:43:46,828 --> 00:43:48,296  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:399
I use it to keep awake.

416
00:43:48,496 --> 00:43:50,465  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:399
You know it makes you look...

417
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,038  X1:182 X2:538 Y1:360 Y2:399
You should keep away from me.

418
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,174  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:360 Y2:399
You lost your job.

419
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:02,276  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:346 Y2:414
Because of me,
you are in a sweatshop.

420
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:06,848  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:360 Y2:399
And now you are going again.

421
00:44:08,116 --> 00:44:09,584  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:346 Y2:414
Be sure you make it
to New York.

422
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,487  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:346 Y2:414
I will make it to New York,
Okwe, thank you.

423
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:20,294  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
Best if you don't show up
until after five.

424
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:22,930  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:346 Y2:414
Most porters are gone by then.
Only ghosts left.

425
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:26,968  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
Showers are here. Water's
not too hot, but it runs.

426
00:44:27,068 --> 00:44:29,170  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:346 Y2:414
Couch in my office
is pretty soft.

427
00:44:30,638 --> 00:44:32,707  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:360 Y2:399
Oh, I forgot.

428
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,643  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:360 Y2:399
You don't sleep, do you?

429
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:39,280  X1:183 X2:537 Y1:360 Y2:399
My friend, welcome to my hotel.

430
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:42,717  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:360 Y2:399
Beautiful, isn't it?

431
00:44:42,817 --> 00:44:46,287  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:346 Y2:414
And the other residents
are very... very quiet.

432
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:50,024  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:346 Y2:414
- It would only be until...
- Until the world improves.

433
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:30,064  X1:319 X2:401 Y1:360 Y2:399
Ca va?

434
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:37,371  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:346 Y2:414
Best truffles
I've ever seen in England.

435
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:40,274  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
Dug up fifteen hours ago
in Provence.

436
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,411  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:346 Y2:414
Came through
on the night train.

437
00:45:50,384 --> 00:45:52,053  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:360 Y2:399
Shall we say £1000?

438
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,889  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm in the wrong fucking hotel.

439
00:45:56,357 --> 00:45:58,426  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:346 Y2:414
£1000, Senor Juan.
What do you say?

440
00:45:58,626 --> 00:46:00,928  X1:296 X2:424 Y1:360 Y2:399
OK. £1000.

441
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:06,234  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
But if I give you that price,
I need a favour.

442
00:46:07,702 --> 00:46:09,771  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:346 Y2:414
There is a night porter.
African.

443
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:13,641  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:346 Y2:414
He came from you so I guess
he came through Amsterdam.

444
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:15,510  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:360 Y2:399
Yes. What about him?

445
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,580  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:346 Y2:414
He is some kind of doctor.
What kind of doctor?

446
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:21,783  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:346 Y2:414
I need to know
what there is to know.

447
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:24,152  X1:283 X2:437 Y1:360 Y2:399
Police! Police!

448
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:48,976  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:399
Can I help you, gentlemen?

449
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,078  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
We're looking for someone
called Senay Gelik.

450
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:55,149  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
- She might be working here.
- Do you see anybody here?

451
00:46:56,684 --> 00:46:58,286  X1:276 X2:444 Y1:360 Y2:399
If you see her,

452
00:46:58,352 --> 00:47:00,455  X1:282 X2:438 Y1:360 Y2:399
give us a call.

453
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:26,114  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:346 Y2:414
You have been here
for two days,

454
00:47:26,214 --> 00:47:28,516  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:346 Y2:414
and already, because of you,
I'm in trouble.

455
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:32,153  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:346 Y2:414
Maybe I should call
lmmigration.

456
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:35,256  X1:254 X2:466 Y1:360 Y2:399
Should I call them?

457
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:37,492  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:399
You wouldn't do that.

458
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:40,394  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:346 Y2:414
I need a good reason.
What can you give me?

459
00:47:42,797 --> 00:47:45,600  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
If they find out you've been
working, what will they do?

460
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:48,836  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:399
They will put you in prison.

461
00:47:48,936 --> 00:47:52,073  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:346 Y2:414
And here,
they mix the men and women.

462
00:47:52,707 --> 00:47:56,244  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:346 Y2:414
So,
every night you will be raped.

463
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:03,618  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you want to be
like a Western girl,

464
00:48:04,585 --> 00:48:06,687  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:346 Y2:414
that's what happens
to Western girls.

465
00:48:07,822 --> 00:48:09,891  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you want to go to jail,
fine.

466
00:48:10,525 --> 00:48:12,727  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you can't give me
a good reason,

467
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:14,829  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:360 Y2:399
I will call the lmmigration.

468
00:48:16,697 --> 00:48:18,766  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm a good man, Senay.

469
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:21,569  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:360 Y2:399
I know where to draw the line.

470
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:25,039  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
I don't want
to take your virginity, Senay.

471
00:48:25,106 --> 00:48:28,376  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:346 Y2:414
I just want you
to help me to relax.

472
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:42,323  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:346 Y2:414
You have
such a beautiful mouth, Senay.

473
00:48:50,331 --> 00:48:51,933  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:399
Achtung! Achtung!

474
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:54,302  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
My ladies and gentlemen,
your coach awaits!

475
00:48:55,336 --> 00:48:56,737  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:360 Y2:399
Bitte. Bitteschon.

476
00:48:56,938 --> 00:49:00,274  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
But you must take your own
luggage to the coach.

477
00:49:03,077 --> 00:49:07,582  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
I will help only those who
cannot carry their own bags.

478
00:49:07,648 --> 00:49:09,750  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:360 Y2:399
Okwe, get up here.

479
00:49:16,324 --> 00:49:18,292  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
- This man is a doctor.
- I'm OK, I'm OK.

480
00:49:18,426 --> 00:49:20,995  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
She's OK. She only needs
to rest a minute.

481
00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:22,997  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:399
He qualified in Lagos.

482
00:49:23,097 --> 00:49:26,334  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
He worked for
the Nigerian government.

483
00:49:26,434 --> 00:49:30,371  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:346 Y2:414
His name is
Dr Olusegun Olatokumbo Fadipe.

484
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:32,607  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:346 Y2:414
We must hurry
or we'll miss the coach.

485
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:46,254  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:346 Y2:414
In the end, I find out all
about everyone in this place.

486
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:51,025  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:360 Y2:399
Here, take a look at this.

487
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:54,929  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:399
French. It's a work of art.

488
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,132  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:346 Y2:414
Lebanese guys I use,
who are the best in London.

489
00:49:58,266 --> 00:49:59,934  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
All you do
is give them a photograph.

490
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:02,637  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:346 Y2:414
I have no idea what you are
talking about, Senor Juan.

491
00:50:03,471 --> 00:50:07,208  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you were just some African,
the deal would be simple.

492
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,645  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
You give me your kidney,
I give you a new identity.

493
00:50:10,845 --> 00:50:14,382  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
I sell the kidney
for ten grand, so I'm happy.

494
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,884  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:346 Y2:414
The person who needs
the kidney gets cured.

495
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:18,352  X1:274 X2:446 Y1:360 Y2:399
So, he's happy.

496
00:50:18,486 --> 00:50:20,154  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:360 Y2:399
The person who sold his kidney

497
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:22,657  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
gets to stay in this beautiful
country, so he's happy.

498
00:50:22,723 --> 00:50:26,828  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
My whole business
is based on happiness.

499
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:32,667  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
But for you, Dr Olusegun
Olatokumbo Fadipe,

500
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:35,436  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:399
I've a better idea.

501
00:50:36,404 --> 00:50:38,506  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:346 Y2:414
I do not want to get involved,
Senor Juan.

502
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,511  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:346 Y2:414
Each time you operate,
you get three thousand.

503
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:47,248  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:346 Y2:414
A passport for you,
and one for Senay.

504
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:49,317  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:360 Y2:399
Take her on honeymoon.

505
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:51,919  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:360 Y2:399
I do not want to get involved.

506
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:54,856  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:346 Y2:414
You could even
go back to Africa.

507
00:50:56,023 --> 00:50:58,326  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:346 Y2:414
And no-one would know
who the fuck you are.

508
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:02,897  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:399
Your choice. No rush.

509
00:51:04,665 --> 00:51:09,871  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
I just wanted to put a little
wasp in your head.

510
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,217  X1:309 X2:411 Y1:360 Y2:399
Unusual.

511
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:25,419  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:399
Chinese guy with no family.

512
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:29,457  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:346 Y2:414
Maybe he's from
the back of a truck.

513
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:35,229  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:346 Y2:414
I cut off his buttons
so his spirit can escape.

514
00:51:35,296 --> 00:51:36,898  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm sewing up his pockets

515
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:40,935  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:346 Y2:414
so he can't take his bad luck
with him to the spirit world.

516
00:51:43,037 --> 00:51:44,472  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:360 Y2:399
If he's an atheist,

517
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:47,408  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:346 Y2:414
I'm ruining a suit
no-one will ever see.

518
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:51,712  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:346 Y2:414
If he's a Buddhist, I'm giving
him eternal happiness,

519
00:51:51,913 --> 00:51:53,748  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:346 Y2:414
for the price
of a piece of thread.

520
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:56,284  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:346 Y2:414
I have found out
why the heart was at the room.

521
00:51:57,118 --> 00:51:59,187  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:360 Y2:399
They are removing kidneys.

522
00:52:00,188 --> 00:52:02,323  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:346 Y2:414
One of their patients
died at their hands.

523
00:52:02,423 --> 00:52:05,059  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:346 Y2:414
Another I treated
for a staphylococcal infection.

524
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:09,497  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:346 Y2:414
You're treating people?
I hope you charge.

525
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,399  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:360 Y2:399
Did you hear what I said?

526
00:52:11,466 --> 00:52:15,069  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:346 Y2:414
There is nothing so dangerous
as a virtuous man.

527
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:19,841  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:346 Y2:414
Okwe, if you're so concerned,
you should go to the police.

528
00:52:20,074 --> 00:52:21,509  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:360 Y2:399
Get yourself deported.

529
00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:24,645  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:346 Y2:414
You think if it were just for
deportation I would not do it?

530
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,648  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm a wanted man, Guo Yi.

531
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,519  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:399
Wanted for what?

532
00:52:35,223 --> 00:52:38,426  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:346 Y2:414
Okwe, you didn't know
people sold their organs?

533
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:43,898  X1:198 X2:522 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Not here.
- What do you mean, "here"?

534
00:52:43,998 --> 00:52:46,334  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
Here in London,
you think it doesn't happen

535
00:52:46,434 --> 00:52:48,569  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:346 Y2:414
because the Queen
doesn't approve?

536
00:52:48,703 --> 00:52:51,005  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
I heard in London
it's ten grand for a kidney.

537
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:53,708  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:360 Y2:399
For that, people take risks.

538
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:57,879  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:346 Y2:414
If I had the courage,
I'd sell my kidney.

539
00:52:58,012 --> 00:53:00,114  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:399
Just to get out of here.

540
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:04,051  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:360 Y2:399
Just to save my brain.

541
00:53:57,939 --> 00:53:59,941  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:346 Y2:414
The problem
with always being on time

542
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:02,543  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
is that you can
always be tracked down.

543
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:05,046  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:360 Y2:399
What do you think of the girl?

544
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:06,781  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:360 Y2:399
She's my next customer.

545
00:54:06,981 --> 00:54:09,951  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:346 Y2:414
Eight years old.
She's called Rima.

546
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:11,986  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:346 Y2:414
Her family
brought her over from Saudi,

547
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,222  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:399
hoping for a miracle.

548
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:16,724  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:346 Y2:414
If she doesn't get a new kidney
in the next few weeks,

549
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,893  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:399
she's going to die.

550
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:21,996  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:360 Y2:399
The doctor we use is no good.

551
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,132  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:399
If he fucks up again,

552
00:54:24,232 --> 00:54:26,601  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
there'll be another heart
down the lavatory.

553
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:32,573  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:360 Y2:399
Okwe, you still there?

554
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:36,744  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:360 Y2:399
So, I'm an evil man, right?

555
00:54:37,345 --> 00:54:39,747  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:346 Y2:414
But I'm trying
to save her life.

556
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:41,616  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:360 Y2:399
That's weird, huh?

557
00:54:41,749 --> 00:54:44,018  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:346 Y2:414
Kind of thing
that keeps you awake at night.

558
00:54:55,997 --> 00:54:59,333  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:346 Y2:414
Tonight,
London is colder than Moscow.

559
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,503  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:360 Y2:399
I heard it on the radio.

560
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:31,999  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:360 Y2:399
Okwe... it is a crazy idea.

561
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,802  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:360 Y2:399
But we really can do it.

562
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:36,671  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:360 Y2:399
You said you liked New York.

563
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:40,541  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:346 Y2:414
But if not New York,
then maybe Boston.

564
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,510  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:360 Y2:399
Or Los Angeles.

565
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,413  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:346 Y2:414
I'm going there, Okwe.
What do you think?

566
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,483  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:346 Y2:414
And Okwe,
you could go there, too.

567
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:55,423  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:346 Y2:414
Are you OK?
Senay, where are you?

568
00:55:56,691 --> 00:55:58,693  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:360 Y2:399
What has happened?

569
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:43,738  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
I knocked
but you did not hear me.

570
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:50,011  X1:173 X2:547 Y1:360 Y2:399
Are you OK? What has happened?

571
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,214  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:360 Y2:399
The factory does not suit me.

572
00:56:53,347 --> 00:56:56,884  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
My hands are too soft.
I cut my fingers.

573
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:58,352  X1:331 X2:389 Y1:360 Y2:399
So...

574
00:56:58,419 --> 00:57:01,355  X1:263 X2:457 Y1:346 Y2:414
I have decided
to go to America.

575
00:57:04,392 --> 00:57:06,694  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:346 Y2:414
For America you would need
a visa, Senay.

576
00:57:09,697 --> 00:57:11,766  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:360 Y2:399
Or maybe a European passport.

577
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:16,370  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Keep away from Senor Juan!
- It's like taking out a tooth.

578
00:57:16,471 --> 00:57:18,639  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:360 Y2:399
He's lying!

579
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,142  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:346 Y2:414
Because you are poor, you will
be gutted like an animal.

580
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,778  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:346 Y2:414
They will cut you here,
or they will cut you here!

581
00:57:23,845 --> 00:57:25,746  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:360 Y2:399
They will leave you to rot.

582
00:57:25,847 --> 00:57:28,783  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:346 Y2:414
One of the laundry girls
did it, and now she's free.

583
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,952  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:360 Y2:399
Others are dead, Senay.

584
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:32,620  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:360 Y2:399
So, they are free, too.

585
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,722  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:399
What would your God say?

586
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,392  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:346 Y2:414
My God does not speak to me
any more.

587
00:57:38,459 --> 00:57:41,796  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:399
Don't break. Save money.

588
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:44,499  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
Keep New York in your head
and work hard.

589
00:57:47,135 --> 00:57:49,203  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:346 Y2:414
You know what kind of work
I do?

590
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:03,484  X1:320 X2:400 Y1:360 Y2:399
Lunch!

591
00:58:48,463 --> 00:58:49,897  X1:320 X2:400 Y1:360 Y2:399
Aargh!

592
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,591  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:346 Y2:414
Okwe, somebody in
the back room looking for you.

593
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:18,760  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:360 Y2:399
She look like a film star, boy.

594
00:59:27,301 --> 00:59:31,272  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
Look, Okwe, I know for sure
that this coat costs £300.

595
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:33,508  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:346 Y2:414
- This dress...
- Tell me what has happened.

596
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:35,376  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:360 Y2:399
We can sell the coat for £200.

597
00:59:35,443 --> 00:59:37,545  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:360 Y2:399
Senay, where did you get these?

598
00:59:38,513 --> 00:59:40,581  X1:292 X2:428 Y1:360 Y2:399
I bit, Okwe.

599
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:43,284  X1:278 X2:442 Y1:360 Y2:399
At the factory.

600
00:59:43,384 --> 00:59:45,453  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:346 Y2:414
He said he would report me
to lmmigration,

601
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:47,955  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:360 Y2:399
and he made me suck.

602
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:50,191  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:360 Y2:399
But today, I bit.

603
00:59:51,526 --> 00:59:53,528  X1:330 X2:390 Y1:360 Y2:399
I bit.

604
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:56,931  X1:329 X2:391 Y1:360 Y2:399
I bit!

605
01:00:20,922 --> 01:00:23,224  X1:175 X2:545 Y1:346 Y2:414
Senor Juan sometimes has rooms
in the hotel.

606
01:00:24,592 --> 01:00:26,561  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:346 Y2:414
- No, Senay.
- Just for tonight.

607
01:00:26,761 --> 01:00:28,229  X1:337 X2:383 Y1:360 Y2:399
No.

608
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:31,132  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
Through there is hot water
and a shower.

609
01:00:31,265 --> 01:00:33,234  X1:282 X2:438 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hurry, Senay.

610
01:00:35,503 --> 01:00:37,939  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:360 Y2:399
What is this place, Okwe?

611
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:41,909  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:346 Y2:414
It is a place
where you can stay for tonight.

612
01:00:41,976 --> 01:00:44,278  X1:313 X2:407 Y1:360 Y2:399
So cold.

613
01:00:44,378 --> 01:00:46,981  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:346 Y2:414
If anyone comes,
you are a friend of Guo Yi.

614
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:12,140  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
Tomorrow we will find you
somewhere to live.

615
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:26,320  X1:260 X2:460 Y1:360 Y2:399
So... it is in there.

616
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,429  X1:286 X2:434 Y1:360 Y2:399
I can hear it.

617
01:01:36,397 --> 01:01:38,399  X1:295 X2:425 Y1:360 Y2:399
Your heart.

618
01:02:47,735 --> 01:02:49,403  X1:245 X2:475 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hello. Room Service.

619
01:03:03,384 --> 01:03:05,453  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:399
Buenos dias... Negro.

620
01:03:15,596 --> 01:03:17,632  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:360 Y2:399
Come on. Come on.

621
01:03:24,772 --> 01:03:26,741  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:346 Y2:414
She's nil by mouth
the whole day.

622
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:28,609  X1:317 X2:403 Y1:360 Y2:399
Please.

623
01:03:34,015 --> 01:03:35,416  X1:322 X2:398 Y1:360 Y2:399
Sister.

624
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:37,552  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:360 Y2:399
Help me, brother.

625
01:03:42,156 --> 01:03:44,459  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:346 Y2:414
Stop acting
like you've got a choice.

626
01:03:49,664 --> 01:03:51,132  X1:317 X2:403 Y1:360 Y2:399
Please!

627
01:03:52,233 --> 01:03:54,469  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Put on your clothes.
- Please, no!

628
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:56,437  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:346 Y2:414
You came here
in the back of a truck,

629
01:03:56,537 --> 01:03:58,439  X1:227 X2:493 Y1:346 Y2:414
but you are going home
in chains!

630
01:03:58,506 --> 01:04:00,508  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:360 Y2:399
They'll deliver you like meat!

631
01:04:03,644 --> 01:04:06,848  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
The whole world is wrong,
except you, Okwe?

632
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:09,684  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:360 Y2:399
What?

633
01:04:10,384 --> 01:04:12,253  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:360 Y2:399
You are going to cut me up,

634
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:14,489  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:360 Y2:399
and flush me away?

635
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:53,361  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
I really, really don't know
you at all, do I?

636
01:04:53,494 --> 01:04:55,763  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:346 Y2:414
- This is Senay. A friend.
- I am not your friend.

637
01:04:55,863 --> 01:04:58,699  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
- She has been out all night.
- I'd rather freeze to death,

638
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,368  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
than go into that building
again.

639
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:02,370  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:346 Y2:414
There are mornings
I feel the same.

640
01:05:02,437 --> 01:05:06,207  X1:200 X2:520 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Come, Senay, it's cold.
- It is the house of the dead.

641
01:05:06,274 --> 01:05:08,910  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:399
They are all dead.

642
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,749  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:360 Y2:399
Maybe this will help.

643
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:17,318  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
My cousin has a room,
in Chinatown.

644
01:05:17,452 --> 01:05:19,554  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:360 Y2:399
I guess there's space for two.

645
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:25,993  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:346 Y2:414
You know, Okwe, good at chess
usually means bad at life.

646
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:30,465  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
You do realise that she's
in love with you, don't you?

647
01:05:30,598 --> 01:05:33,201  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:346 Y2:414
I've been with her
twenty minutes, and I know it.

648
01:05:34,335 --> 01:05:36,437  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:399
But then, I'm bad at chess.

649
01:05:46,647 --> 01:05:48,750  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:346 Y2:414
There is something
I must tell you.

650
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,252  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:346 Y2:414
- This is your religion?
- I have no religion.

651
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:56,958  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:346 Y2:414
You have stopped
chewing the leaf.

652
01:05:57,091 --> 01:05:59,160  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:399
I can see from your eyes.

653
01:05:59,894 --> 01:06:02,163  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:346 Y2:414
Do you know, Okwe,
your eyes are quite pretty?

654
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,799  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:346 Y2:414
- You are not bad looking.
- Listen to me.

655
01:06:08,136 --> 01:06:10,238  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:346 Y2:414
I come to this churchyard
often.

656
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:14,375  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:346 Y2:414
I come here to be alone,
and to think about my wife.

657
01:06:17,378 --> 01:06:19,814  X1:267 X2:453 Y1:360 Y2:399
So now you see.

658
01:06:19,914 --> 01:06:21,916  X1:273 X2:447 Y1:360 Y2:399
What do I see?

659
01:06:21,983 --> 01:06:23,985  X1:175 X2:545 Y1:360 Y2:399
You should not see me any more.

660
01:06:28,456 --> 01:06:31,359  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:346 Y2:414
Do you love her?
Do you love her?

661
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:32,960  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:346 Y2:414
There is a room
above a restaurant.

662
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:35,863  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:346 Y2:414
The lmmigration police
do not dare go into Chinatown.

663
01:06:36,063 --> 01:06:38,032  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:346 Y2:414
Here is some money
for the rent I owe you.

664
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:40,468  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
There is more for the trouble
I have caused you.

665
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:42,837  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Okwe, do you love her?
- Love?

666
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:48,676  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:346 Y2:414
For you and I,
there is only survival.

667
01:06:51,512 --> 01:06:53,881  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
It is time you woke up
from your stupid dream.

668
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:24,345  X1:330 X2:390 Y1:360 Y2:399
Yes?

669
01:07:29,884 --> 01:07:31,986  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:346 Y2:414
Are you going on holiday
or something?

670
01:07:33,855 --> 01:07:35,923  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:360 Y2:399
Senor Juan...

671
01:07:45,933 --> 01:07:48,336  X1:255 X2:465 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Senor Juan...
- America, maybe?

672
01:08:06,687 --> 01:08:08,890  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
Come on, you cleaned up
their shit so long.

673
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:11,793  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:360 Y2:399
Now, you can be one of them.

674
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,955  X1:303 X2:417 Y1:360 Y2:399
Who is it?

675
01:09:14,021 --> 01:09:16,124  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:360 Y2:399
It's me. I got some paperwork.

676
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,329  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:360 Y2:399
OK. How old are you?

677
01:09:21,462 --> 01:09:22,897  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:360 Y2:399
Twenty-two.

678
01:09:22,997 --> 01:09:24,999  X1:205 X2:515 Y1:360 Y2:399
How old do you want to be?

679
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:27,101  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:360 Y2:399
Twenty-two.

680
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:32,173  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:346 Y2:414
Hey, come on, relax. I can
make you whatever you want.

681
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:34,242  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:346 Y2:414
You want to be
Spanish or Greek?

682
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:36,778  X1:318 X2:402 Y1:360 Y2:399
Italian.

683
01:09:37,712 --> 01:09:40,648  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:346 Y2:414
- You need a new name.
- Isabella Encarico.

684
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:45,520  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:346 Y2:414
- You're sure that's Italian?
- She owns a cafe in New York.

685
01:10:11,813 --> 01:10:15,683  X1:183 X2:537 Y1:346 Y2:414
OK, you are at New York
lmmigration. What's your name?

686
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,952  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:399
Isabella Fontanna Encarico.

687
01:10:18,186 --> 01:10:20,354  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:346 Y2:414
- How old are you?
- Twenty-two.

688
01:10:20,488 --> 01:10:22,356  X1:224 X2:496 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Where were you born?
- Napoli.

689
01:10:22,423 --> 01:10:24,625  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Where in Napoli?
- Aranella.

690
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,828  X1:324 X2:396 Y1:360 Y2:399
Right.

691
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:29,230  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:360 Y2:399
The trick, Senay,

692
01:10:29,297 --> 01:10:31,299  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:346 Y2:414
is to believe you are
the new person.

693
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:34,635  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you believe it inside, the
lmmigration will believe it.

694
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:36,838  X1:322 X2:398 Y1:360 Y2:399
Drink?

695
01:10:41,209 --> 01:10:44,245  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:346 Y2:414
What are you afraid of?
Okwe's gone.

696
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:47,381  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:360 Y2:399
Got scared and go away.

697
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,753  X1:300 X2:420 Y1:360 Y2:399
Go to hell!

698
01:10:53,721 --> 01:10:55,723  X1:296 X2:424 Y1:360 Y2:399
This is hell.

699
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:58,860  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm helping you to get away.

700
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:02,196  X1:251 X2:469 Y1:346 Y2:414
Take off you robe.
Come on, come on.

701
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:03,731  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hey, hey, stop that!

702
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:05,933  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:360 Y2:399
Stop that!

703
01:11:06,134 --> 01:11:08,436  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:399
I can't believe it.

704
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:11,572  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
I'm arguing
like you are my fucking wife.

705
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:13,241  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:360 Y2:399
Let me explain something.

706
01:11:13,307 --> 01:11:14,675  X1:276 X2:444 Y1:360 Y2:399
Your robe now

707
01:11:14,776 --> 01:11:17,812  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:346 Y2:414
is what the Americans
call a "deal breaker".

708
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:19,580  X1:331 X2:389 Y1:360 Y2:399
So...

709
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,149  X1:337 X2:383 Y1:360 Y2:399
No.

710
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:26,020  X1:190 X2:530 Y1:346 Y2:414
You are this close to New York
and you said no.

711
01:11:44,806 --> 01:11:46,808  X1:327 X2:393 Y1:360 Y2:399
Wait.

712
01:11:51,612 --> 01:11:54,816  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:346 Y2:414
I want the whole thing.
That's the deal.

713
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,652  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:360 Y2:399
Take it or leave it.

714
01:11:58,786 --> 01:12:01,055  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:360 Y2:399
You do not see me.

715
01:12:01,189 --> 01:12:03,291  X1:291 X2:429 Y1:360 Y2:399
You just do.

716
01:12:04,325 --> 01:12:06,060  X1:257 X2:463 Y1:360 Y2:399
Take it or leave it.

717
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:43,731  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:360 Y2:399
So it wasn't so bad, huh?

718
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:45,833  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:360 Y2:399
Nothing to cry about.

719
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,769  X1:278 X2:442 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm not crying.

720
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:49,437  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you'd told me
it was the first time,

721
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,639  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'd have cut a ribbon.

722
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:57,912  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
I can't believe
Okwe never fucked you.

723
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,349  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:360 Y2:399
You kind of love him, huh?

724
01:13:01,449 --> 01:13:04,585  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
Women love men most
who don't love them back.

725
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,122  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:360 Y2:399
Well, you had a lucky escape.

726
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,359  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:360 Y2:399
You know why he ran away?

727
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:17,398  X1:247 X2:473 Y1:346 Y2:414
Because I found out
that in Africa,

728
01:13:18,232 --> 01:13:20,334  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:360 Y2:399
he murdered his own wife.

729
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:30,545  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:346 Y2:414
You don't eat or drink
for 24 hours, OK?

730
01:13:31,579 --> 01:13:33,548  X1:270 X2:450 Y1:360 Y2:399
Doctor's orders.

731
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:02,844  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:360 Y2:399
Senay is here?

732
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:37,412  X1:268 X2:452 Y1:360 Y2:399
I will need a pill.

733
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:43,184  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
There is a pill you can take
the morning after.

734
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:47,789  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:360 Y2:399
You are a doctor.

735
01:14:49,157 --> 01:14:51,159  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:360 Y2:399
At least you can get me a pill.

736
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:33,468  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:346 Y2:414
I won't allow you
to butcher her.

737
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:36,170  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:399
You won't allow?

738
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,473  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:360 Y2:399
I will operate on her myself.

739
01:15:38,706 --> 01:15:41,709  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:346 Y2:414
- You'll do what?
- I will do it.

740
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:45,346  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
It is the only way I can be
sure she will not die.

741
01:15:47,248 --> 01:15:51,185  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
In return, I want a passport.
A new identity.

742
01:15:53,187 --> 01:15:55,156  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:360 Y2:399
Well, holy shit!

743
01:15:55,957 --> 01:15:58,392  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:360 Y2:399
So you are human?

744
01:15:58,493 --> 01:16:01,229  X1:183 X2:537 Y1:346 Y2:414
I will bring you our
photographs tomorrow morning.

745
01:16:08,903 --> 01:16:12,173  X1:233 X2:487 Y1:346 Y2:414
Hi. I'm Juliette.
I'm a friend of Okwe's.

746
01:16:13,074 --> 01:16:15,076  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:360 Y2:399
He said that you needed these.

747
01:16:19,881 --> 01:16:23,618  X1:211 X2:509 Y1:346 Y2:414
So, he did not care enough
to bring them himself.

748
01:16:24,452 --> 01:16:26,554  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:360 Y2:399
Oh, Okwe's an angel.

749
01:16:37,465 --> 01:16:39,901  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:360 Y2:399
There. Never happened.

750
01:16:46,874 --> 01:16:48,876  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:360 Y2:399
So... What did happen?

751
01:16:55,817 --> 01:16:58,453  X1:236 X2:484 Y1:360 Y2:399
Before, I was a virgin.

752
01:17:00,021 --> 01:17:01,022  X1:322 X2:398 Y1:360 Y2:399
Jesus!

753
01:17:01,255 --> 01:17:03,324  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:360 Y2:399
Mohammed.

754
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:16,671  X1:288 X2:432 Y1:360 Y2:399
What a pair!

755
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:18,773  X1:217 X2:503 Y1:360 Y2:399
The virgin and the whore.

756
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:30,251  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:360 Y2:399
The doctor needs a good car.

757
01:17:33,154 --> 01:17:35,156  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:346 Y2:414
Take it.
Last time you were lucky.

758
01:17:37,325 --> 01:17:39,327  X1:281 X2:439 Y1:360 Y2:399
Black is black.

759
01:18:00,882 --> 01:18:02,984  X1:215 X2:505 Y1:360 Y2:399
Wash these again, please.

760
01:18:05,887 --> 01:18:07,355  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:360 Y2:399
Boil, boil, eh?

761
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:09,023  X1:308 X2:412 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hot, hot!

762
01:18:38,419 --> 01:18:40,421  X1:327 X2:393 Y1:360 Y2:399
Jose!

763
01:18:43,024 --> 01:18:46,561  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
So,
this is how you do it right?

764
01:18:46,694 --> 01:18:48,763  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
There can be no guarantee
against E Coli.

765
01:18:49,697 --> 01:18:51,699  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:360 Y2:399
Mmm!

766
01:18:51,766 --> 01:18:53,868  X1:296 X2:424 Y1:360 Y2:399
Wonderful!

767
01:18:54,902 --> 01:18:56,771  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:360 Y2:399
No, no, no, no.

768
01:19:08,249 --> 01:19:10,952  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:346 Y2:414
Passports.
It's something I do right.

769
01:19:24,499 --> 01:19:26,300  X1:294 X2:426 Y1:360 Y2:399
No parking.

770
01:19:26,401 --> 01:19:28,469  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:360 Y2:399
Okwe wants me to wait here.

771
01:19:30,905 --> 01:19:32,774  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:346 Y2:414
I gave her a sedative
an hour ago.

772
01:19:33,908 --> 01:19:35,476  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:360 Y2:399
She's only in a deep sleep.

773
01:19:35,576 --> 01:19:37,645  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:360 Y2:399
But now you are here,

774
01:19:37,779 --> 01:19:39,514  X1:269 X2:451 Y1:346 Y2:414
I can administer
the anaesthetic.

775
01:19:40,782 --> 01:19:42,049  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:360 Y2:399
Now I'm here?

776
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,852  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:346 Y2:414
You are going to be
my assistant, Senor Juan.

777
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,821  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:360 Y2:399
What the fuck is this?

778
01:19:47,054 --> 01:19:49,457  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:346 Y2:414
I have noticed that if you do
not drink, your hands shake.

779
01:19:49,524 --> 01:19:50,725  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:360 Y2:399
When you pass the scalpel,

780
01:19:50,792 --> 01:19:53,294  X1:242 X2:478 Y1:346 Y2:414
I do not want you
to cut off my fingers.

781
01:19:57,865 --> 01:19:59,534  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:360 Y2:399
When will they come to collect?

782
01:20:03,004 --> 01:20:04,672  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:346 Y2:414
If you faint
during the operation,

783
01:20:04,772 --> 01:20:07,608  X1:193 X2:527 Y1:346 Y2:414
I have half an hour before the
kidney begins to deteriorate.

784
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:11,846  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:346 Y2:414
They come to the laundry bay.
Back of the kitchen.

785
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,217  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
- You'd better start.
- Go and scrub your hands.

786
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:20,621  X1:261 X2:459 Y1:360 Y2:399
Yes. Professional!

787
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:26,994  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:346 Y2:414
It's decided.
It's fucking decided!

788
01:20:27,895 --> 01:20:30,965  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:346 Y2:414
You and me
are going into business.

789
01:20:33,534 --> 01:20:35,536  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:360 Y2:399
You know washing dishes?

790
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:39,707  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:346 Y2:414
You know,
when you forget on Friday

791
01:20:39,807 --> 01:20:43,678  X1:191 X2:529 Y1:346 Y2:414
and come in Monday,
and there is a pan with sauce?

792
01:20:44,712 --> 01:20:46,814  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:360 Y2:399
White... green... shit.

793
01:20:47,849 --> 01:20:50,451  X1:298 X2:422 Y1:360 Y2:399
That... is...

794
01:20:56,691 --> 01:21:00,027  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
Jesus!
Was I speaking English then?

795
01:21:01,496 --> 01:21:03,264  X1:276 X2:444 Y1:360 Y2:399
What you say?

796
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:24,152  X1:241 X2:479 Y1:346 Y2:414
...don't understand it,
how the ice will help.

797
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:26,020  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:346 Y2:414
It'll make you last longer,
babe.

798
01:21:26,087 --> 01:21:28,923  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:346 Y2:414
I don't want to last longer.
It's not even pay-day.

799
01:21:29,023 --> 01:21:31,092  X1:213 X2:507 Y1:360 Y2:399
All right, make you harder.

800
01:21:32,693 --> 01:21:35,897  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:346 Y2:414
Think what happens to water
when it freezes, eh?

801
01:21:37,765 --> 01:21:39,867  X1:320 X2:400 Y1:360 Y2:399
There.

802
01:21:40,268 --> 01:21:42,370  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Get a bucket.
- Bucket?

803
01:21:44,372 --> 01:21:46,040  X1:304 X2:416 Y1:360 Y2:399
Come on!

804
01:21:46,107 --> 01:21:49,977  X1:167 X2:553 Y1:360 Y2:399
You have removed kidneys before?

805
01:21:50,912 --> 01:21:52,713  X1:290 X2:430 Y1:360 Y2:399
Many times.

806
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,248  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:360 Y2:399
In pathology.

807
01:21:54,382 --> 01:21:56,551  X1:254 X2:466 Y1:360 Y2:399
What is pathology?

808
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:59,253  X1:246 X2:474 Y1:346 Y2:414
It means the patient
is already dead.

809
01:22:00,621 --> 01:22:02,990  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:346 Y2:414
Did he tell you things
about me, Senay?

810
01:22:05,093 --> 01:22:06,961  X1:337 X2:383 Y1:360 Y2:399
No.

811
01:22:14,469 --> 01:22:16,971  X1:187 X2:533 Y1:360 Y2:399
Let me wipe your brow, doctor.

812
01:22:33,454 --> 01:22:36,157  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:346 Y2:414
Juliette, put the ice
on the bed and put on the gown.

813
01:22:43,798 --> 01:22:45,666  X1:281 X2:439 Y1:360 Y2:399
Take the bag.

814
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:48,369  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:399
Squeeze. Gently.

815
01:22:49,637 --> 01:22:51,606  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:360 Y2:399
We must go and scrub up.

816
01:22:58,179 --> 01:23:00,148  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:399
Cold tonight, huh?

817
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:07,021  X1:195 X2:525 Y1:346 Y2:414
On a night like this,
who would want so much ice?

818
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:12,260  X1:266 X2:454 Y1:360 Y2:399
You are Pylades.

819
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:15,163  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:360 Y2:399
Pylades was the boatman

820
01:23:15,363 --> 01:23:18,499  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:346 Y2:414
who ferried the souls
to the land of the dead.

821
01:23:18,633 --> 01:23:20,501  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:360 Y2:399
If you didn't put a coin

822
01:23:20,601 --> 01:23:23,071  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:346 Y2:414
under the tongue
of your dead relative,

823
01:23:23,204 --> 01:23:25,706  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:346 Y2:414
Pylades wouldn't take them
to Hades.

824
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:28,076  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
No matter how good
you had been in your life.

825
01:23:45,193 --> 01:23:46,227  X1:325 X2:395 Y1:360 Y2:399
Knife.

826
01:23:56,037 --> 01:23:58,339  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Jesus!
- You are not allowed to faint.

827
01:24:21,262 --> 01:24:23,264  X1:267 X2:453 Y1:360 Y2:399
Pass me the ice.

828
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:47,121  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Is that it, then?
- No, I must sew him up.

829
01:24:47,355 --> 01:24:49,357  X1:326 X2:394 Y1:360 Y2:399
Why?

830
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:53,795  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:360 Y2:399
Fetch me stitches.

831
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:05,073  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
Will you go and check
there is no-one else waiting?

832
01:25:05,139 --> 01:25:06,941  X1:325 X2:395 Y1:360 Y2:399
Yeah.

833
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:25,093  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:360 Y2:399
Where's Senor Juan?

834
01:25:25,293 --> 01:25:27,261  X1:295 X2:425 Y1:360 Y2:399
He's drunk.

835
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,355  X1:212 X2:508 Y1:346 Y2:414
How come I've never seen
you people before?

836
01:25:56,357 --> 01:25:58,459  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:346 Y2:414
Because we are the people
you do not see.

837
01:25:59,894 --> 01:26:02,296  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:346 Y2:414
We are the ones
who drive your cabs.

838
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:04,499  X1:238 X2:482 Y1:360 Y2:399
We clean your rooms,

839
01:26:04,565 --> 01:26:06,667  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:360 Y2:399
and suck your cocks.

840
01:26:23,484 --> 01:26:25,153  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:360 Y2:399
In one hour, call an ambulance.

841
01:26:25,353 --> 01:26:26,888  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:360 Y2:399
Send them up to room 510.

842
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:29,123  X1:312 X2:408 Y1:360 Y2:399
Juliette?

843
01:26:30,792 --> 01:26:33,694  X1:275 X2:445 Y1:346 Y2:414
- Thank you.
- Sssh! It's OK.

844
01:26:33,795 --> 01:26:35,463  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:360 Y2:399
One hour, OK?

845
01:26:46,607 --> 01:26:48,576  X1:192 X2:528 Y1:360 Y2:399
Handa? Handa, it's me, Senay.

846
01:26:49,944 --> 01:26:51,846  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:346 Y2:414
You hear
how good my English is?

847
01:26:52,046 --> 01:26:55,883  X1:222 X2:498 Y1:346 Y2:414
I'm coming to New York.
I'm coming to New York!

848
01:26:56,017 --> 01:26:57,485  X1:235 X2:485 Y1:360 Y2:399
My hands are shaking.

849
01:26:57,552 --> 01:27:00,588  X1:219 X2:501 Y1:346 Y2:414
So are mine. I don't have
a driver's licence.

850
01:27:00,822 --> 01:27:02,690  X1:305 X2:415 Y1:360 Y2:399
It's dead.

851
01:27:02,757 --> 01:27:04,158  X1:277 X2:443 Y1:360 Y2:399
It's the tunnel.

852
01:27:04,358 --> 01:27:06,427  X1:253 X2:467 Y1:346 Y2:414
I must tell her
what time we land.

853
01:27:06,527 --> 01:27:08,596  X1:201 X2:519 Y1:346 Y2:414
Senay, what Sneaky told you
was true.

854
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,264  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:360 Y2:399
He did not tell me anything.

855
01:27:10,398 --> 01:27:13,401  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:346 Y2:414
I did not kill my wife myself,
but still it was my fault.

856
01:27:13,534 --> 01:27:16,938  X1:174 X2:546 Y1:346 Y2:414
- I was a pathologist in Lagos.
- And now you are someone new.

857
01:27:17,071 --> 01:27:19,440  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:346 Y2:414
An official was shot. I was
told to destroy the evidence.

858
01:27:19,574 --> 01:27:20,508  X1:240 X2:480 Y1:360 Y2:399
I don't want to know.

859
01:27:20,608 --> 01:27:22,910  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:346 Y2:414
When I refused,
my house was fire bombed.

860
01:27:22,977 --> 01:27:24,879  X1:230 X2:490 Y1:360 Y2:399
My wife was still inside.

861
01:27:26,881 --> 01:27:28,950  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:346 Y2:414
The police charged me
with her murder.

862
01:27:31,953 --> 01:27:33,955  X1:287 X2:433 Y1:360 Y2:399
I had to run.

863
01:27:34,789 --> 01:27:37,725  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:346 Y2:414
But my daughter stayed.
Valerie.

864
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,862  X1:197 X2:523 Y1:360 Y2:399
She's with my sister in Lagos.

865
01:27:41,462 --> 01:27:43,765  X1:272 X2:448 Y1:360 Y2:399
How old is she?

866
01:27:43,965 --> 01:27:46,667  X1:319 X2:401 Y1:360 Y2:399
Seven.

867
01:27:47,802 --> 01:27:49,904  X1:264 X2:456 Y1:360 Y2:399
I must go to her.

868
01:28:36,117 --> 01:28:37,985  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:360 Y2:399
Tell me about Lagos.

869
01:28:38,052 --> 01:28:40,288  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:346 Y2:414
Do they have hotels
that need maids?

870
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:44,325  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:360 Y2:399
When you arrive at the airport,

871
01:28:44,459 --> 01:28:46,527  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:346 Y2:414
you will see
a whole line of yellow cabs.

872
01:28:48,496 --> 01:28:50,498  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:346 Y2:414
The car will take you
across a bridge.

873
01:28:51,733 --> 01:28:55,937  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:346 Y2:414
When you cross the river, you
will see lights in the trees.

874
01:28:57,872 --> 01:29:00,074  X1:210 X2:510 Y1:360 Y2:399
Policemen on white horses.

875
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:02,276  X1:337 X2:383 Y1:360 Y2:399
No.

876
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:06,647  X1:208 X2:512 Y1:360 Y2:399
I know it won't be like that.

877
01:29:11,352 --> 01:29:13,321  X1:267 X2:453 Y1:360 Y2:399
Goodbye, Okwe.

878
01:29:33,975 --> 01:29:35,977  X1:307 X2:413 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hold me.

879
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,982  X1:229 X2:491 Y1:360 Y2:399
You must go... Isabella.

880
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:44,185  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:360 Y2:399
Always we must hide.

881
01:29:50,858 --> 01:29:52,927  X1:226 X2:494 Y1:346 Y2:414
This is the cafe
where my cousin works.

882
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:04,265  X1:298 X2:422 Y1:360 Y2:399
I love you.

883
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,301  X1:298 X2:422 Y1:360 Y2:399
I love you.

884
01:32:00,888 --> 01:32:02,990  X1:323 X2:397 Y1:360 Y2:399
Hello?

885
01:32:06,728 --> 01:32:08,830  X1:313 X2:407 Y1:360 Y2:399
Valerie?

886
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:13,835  X1:290 X2:430 Y1:360 Y2:399
Yes, it's me.

887
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:18,606  X1:318 X2:402 Y1:360 Y2:399
At last,

888
01:32:21,008 --> 01:32:23,010  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:360 Y2:399
I'm coming home.
