In terms of the nitty-gritty,

491
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,014
the cause of death
is either the mouth wound here

492
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,548
or she was beaten to death
with something like
a baseball bat<i>:</i>

Mr<i>:</i> Bleichert, Daddy<i>:</i>

You<i>'</i>re in for
a cruel caricaturing, Bucky<i>:</i>

my certified genius<i>:</i>

902
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,848
What kind of a name
is Bleichert? Dutch?

903
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,114
German<i>:</i>

904
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,016
A great people, the Germans<i>:</i>

905
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,418
Hitler was a bit excessive<i>:</i>

not joining forces with him
to fight the Eeds<i>:</i>

908
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:46,695
You know,
I killed a lot of your
countrymen during the war<i>:</i>

909
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,933
Mr<i>:</i> Bleichert, have you
met Balto in the hallway?

910
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,102
Yes<i>:</i> Very realistic<i>:</i>

stuffed him<i>:</i>

912
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,645
We were in the Scots Eegiment
together<i>:</i> Georgie Tilden<i>:</i>

913
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,271
He wanted to work
in the flickers<i>:</i>

914
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:59,372
When did you move here?

915
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,507
1920<i>:</i>

916
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,178
Hollywood was a cow pasture
but the silent flickers
were booming<i>:</i>

917
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,688
Georgie got work
as a lighting man,
me building houses<i>:</i>

918
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,190
Georgie introduced me
to Mack Sennett<i>:</i>

919
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,193
I helped him build
that housing project
he was putting up

920
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,195
underneath
that god-awful sign<i>:</i>

921
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,421
Hollywoodland<i>:</i>

922
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:15,691

the <i>Keystone Kops:</i>

Me, too<i>:</i>

924
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,365
Old Mack knew how
to squeeze a dollar dry<i>:</i>

925
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:25,140
He had extras moonlighting
as laborers and vice versa<i>:</i>

926
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,439
Georgie and I used to drive
them over to Hollywoodland

927
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,909
after 12 hours
on a silent flicker<i>:</i>

928
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:32,345
Then put in another six hours
by torchlight<i>:</i>

929
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,509
He even gave us movie credits
a couple of times<i>:</i>

930
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:40,950
EMMETT: Mother<i>:</i>

931
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,321
Are you feeling well?

932
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:46,556
Would you like to contribute
to the conversation?

933
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,328
Did you know, Mr<i>:</i> Bleichert,

934
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,336
that Eamona Boulevard
is named after me?

935
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,405
I didn<i>'</i>t<i>:</i>

936
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:05,642
When Emmett married me,

937
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,948
for my father<i>'</i>s money,

938
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,982
he promised my family
that he would use
his influence

939
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,115
with the City Zoning Board

940
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,557
to have a street named
after me<i>:</i>

941
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,362
But all he could manage

942
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,362
was a dead-end block

943
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,068
in a red-light district

944
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,872
in Lincoln Heights<i>:</i>

945
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:35,511
Are you familiar with
the neighborhood,
Mr<i>:</i> Bleichert?

946
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,371
I grew up there<i>:</i>

947
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,314
Yes, well,

<i>BUCKY: It was</i>
<i>neat enough for the papers,</i>

1488

Hello, Officer Bleichert<i>:</i>

1490
01:51:15,001 --> 01:51:17,629
Did you come to pay your
respects or fuck my sister?

1491
01:51:17,704 --> 01:51:20,195
I came to talk to you
about Lee Blanchard<i>:</i>

1492
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:25,337
He came here, didn<i>'</i>t he?
Asking about your sister
and the Dahlia?

1493
01:51:31,384 --> 01:51:32,612
Tell me<i>:</i>

1494
01:51:50,704 --> 01:51:53,002
<i>Adios</i> yourself back
to the Halls of Tripoli,
shitbird<i>:</i>

1495
01:51:53,073 --> 01:51:55,098
I<i>'</i>ve got business
with the lady<i>:</i>

1496
01:52:07,287 --> 01:52:08,481
Bucky<i>:</i>

1497
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:12,122
Lee knew everything about you
and Elizabeth Short<i>:</i>

1498
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:14,784
He knew everything,
didn<i>'</i>t he?

1499
01:52:14,861 --> 01:52:16,954
I don<i>'</i>t know
what you<i>'</i>re saying<i>:</i>

1500
01:52:17,997 --> 01:52:21,296
I went by your house today<i>:</i>
I talked to your sister,
Martha<i>:</i>

1501
01:52:22,535 --> 01:52:25,766
She told me that a policeman
named Lee Blanchard came by
the house

1502
01:52:25,839 --> 01:52:28,535
asking questions about
you and Elizabeth Short<i>:</i>

1503
01:52:32,812 --> 01:52:35,576
She told him that
the two of you were close<i>:</i>

1504
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:39,316
Martha was always
jealous of me<i>:</i>

1505
01:52:39,986 --> 01:52:41,476
He was blackmailing
your father<i>:</i>

1506
01:52:51,865 --> 01:52:54,356
No<i>:</i> I beat up a wall<i>:</i>
For messing up Nash<i>: : :</i>

1507
01:52:54,467 --> 01:52:55,729
So,

1508
01:52:59,239 --> 01:53:01,730
on the night that
he went to the Olympic
to settle an old score

1509
01:53:01,808 --> 01:53:05,471
<i>you tracked him there:</i>
<i>Like a dog:</i>

1510
01:53:20,493 --> 01:53:23,553
I<i>'</i>ve been pointing my gun
at a lot of people this week<i>:</i>

1511
01:53:24,964 --> 01:53:27,489
I haven<i>'</i>t had a chance
to shoot anybody yet<i>:</i>

1512
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:29,530
What do you think?

1513
01:53:29,602 --> 01:53:32,036
I think you<i>'</i>d rather fuck me
than kill me,

1514
01:53:34,607 --> 01:53:37,075
but you don<i>'</i>t have
the guts to do either<i>:</i>

1515
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:43,639
You<i>'</i>re a boxer, not a fighter<i>:</i>

1516
01:53:43,716 --> 01:53:45,240
You<i>'</i>re a murderer<i>:</i>

1517
01:53:46,553 --> 01:53:47,645
Of my partner<i>:</i>

1518
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,187
A murderer?

1519
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:53,453
Of Lee Blanchard?

1520
01:53:57,931 --> 01:54:00,456
You should thank me
for Lee Blanchard<i>:</i>

1521
01:54:01,367 --> 01:54:02,425
If it weren<i>'</i>t for me,

1522
01:54:02,502 --> 01:54:04,060
you wouldn<i>'</i>t
have had the balls

1523
01:54:04,137 --> 01:54:06,037
to fuck your partner<i>'</i>s girl<i>:</i>

1524
01:54:06,906 --> 01:54:08,931
You don<i>'</i>t talk
about them, okay?

1525
01:54:09,242 --> 01:54:13,542
Wait<i>:</i> I forgot<i>:</i>

1526
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:19,177
You don<i>'</i>t fuck her anymore

1527
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:24,483
because you<i>'</i>d rather
fuck me<i>:</i>

1528
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:27,354
You don<i>'</i>t talk about them<i>:</i>

1529
01:54:29,095 --> 01:54:32,496
You chose me over her<i>:</i>

1530
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:36,326
You<i>'</i>ll choose me over him<i>:</i>

1531
01:54:38,838 --> 01:54:41,534
He was going to take
Daddy<i>'</i>s money and leave,

1532
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:44,308
leave all of you<i>:</i>

1533
01:54:55,855 --> 01:54:57,720
You<i>'</i>d never shoot me<i>:</i>

1534
01:55:00,727 --> 01:55:02,888
Don<i>'</i>t forget who I look like<i>:</i>

1535
01:55:03,997 --> 01:55:06,625
Because that girl,

1536
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:10,760
that sad, dead bitch,

1537
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:14,732
she<i>'</i>s all you have<i>:</i>

1538
01:55:17,744 --> 01:55:18,836
No<i>:</i>

1539
01:55:52,345 --> 01:55:55,576
<i>BUCKY: Madeleine was wrong:</i>
<i>I had others:</i>

1540
01:55:57,383 --> 01:55:59,749
<i>Ones I'd loved</i>
<i>and ones who'd loved me:</i>

1541
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:06,223
<i>People I'd betrayed and people</i>
<i>I needed to protect:</i>

1542
01:56:07,093 --> 01:56:09,186
<i>And, for the first time</i>
<i>in my life,</i>

1543
01:56:09,996 --> 01:56:13,727
<i>I had people that knew that,</i>
<i>for the briefest of times,</i>

1544
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:16,328
<i>in the darkest of places,</i>

1545
01:56:16,402 --> 01:56:20,429
<i>I had been so,</i>
<i>so good at some things:</i>

01:56:24,477 --> 01:56:26,468
