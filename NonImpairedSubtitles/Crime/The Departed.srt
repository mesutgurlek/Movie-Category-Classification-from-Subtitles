I'm afraid
we all have to get used to it.

148

So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

150
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,483
He was a carpet layer
for Jordan Marsh.

151

Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie.
Tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

152
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:09,866
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

<font color="#804040">PRISONER</font>: Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

293
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:04,484
Well, nothing. I know
a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

294
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:07,987
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

295
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:10,823
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

296
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,676
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:32,762
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

299
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,269
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

300
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:42,730
I got kicked out,

Yeah, it was in the papers.

So you know.

303
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,656
And why are we graced
with your presence?

304
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,617
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

I was at a funeral myself, man.

Knew him in school.

310
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:15,638
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

311
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:17,974
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

312
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,477
I got, like...

313
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:25,106
- 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

314
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:28,067
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

315
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:30,903
In your line of work, if I gave you...

like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

You know what you...

00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,788
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

- What? What?
- Come on, man.

Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

321

What, you want me to say it?

322
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,638
I'm not a cop, all right?

That's right. You used to be a cop.

there are guys you can hit...

and there's guys you can't.

Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:48,666
but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

357
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,502
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

358
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,714
You don't fucking hit him.

stole 20 microprocessors...

388
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:40,820
from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

389
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:43,239
These are the kind
they put into computers...

390
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:46,242
that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

391
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,244
from a couple hundred Miles away.

392
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:51,247
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

393
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:54,000
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

394
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:57,086
walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

395
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:59,338

on Wednesday...

says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

408
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,956
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

409
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:36,542
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

410
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,129
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the FBI.

411
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:44,050
Without asking for too many details, do
you have anyone in with Costello now?

412
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,802
Maybe. Maybe not.

413
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,679
Maybe fuck yourself.

414
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,182
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

Feed them shit

He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

You wanna help catch the people...

00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:21,253
who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

426
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,424
Allegedly.

427
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:28,052
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

428
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,179
But not the robbery.
That's not wrong.

429
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:32,431
He did something else wrong?

Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,774
I mean, fuck yourself.

- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

Have I seen you professionally?

No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

438
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,602
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

439
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,356
and then they get to come to talk

739
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,196
let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

740
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:36,157
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

741
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:38,576
And he could do it...

742
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:43,039
which is maybe something you
don't know about William Costigan Sr.

743
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:52,423
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

744
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:56,094
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

745
00:45:56,262 --> 00:45:58,555
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

746

Your Uncle Jackie...

747
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:06,187
he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

748
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:10,817
And I think about this.

749
00:46:16,699 --> 00:46:19,409
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

750
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:23,121
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

Can't get an address off him.
