1
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:25,605
I'm not ashamed. I've known love.

2
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:28,045
I've known rejection.

3
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:30,845
I'm not afraid to declare my feelings.

4
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:36,645
Take trust, for instance, or friendship.
These are the important things in life.

5
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:41,085
These are the things that matter,
that help you on your way.

6
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:47,525
If you can't trust your friends,
well what then? What then?

7
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,205
This could have been any city.

8
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:55,485
They're all the same.

9
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:20,765
Hello. I've come about the room.

10
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:30,805
- So what's his name?
- I don't know. Campbell or something.

11
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,725
- Cameron.
- Cameron? Really?

12
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:36,165
That's right.

13
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,765
What?

14
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:41,165
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes, thanks.

15
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:43,365
- Have you seen the flat?
- Yes.

16
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:46,205
- And you like it?
- Yes, it's great.

17
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:49,125
We all like it. The room's nice,
too, don't you think?

18
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:53,005
Spacious, bright, all that sort of stuff,
all that sort of crap.

19
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:54,645
Well, yes.

20
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:58,165
So tell me, cos I'd like to know,
what on earth could make you think...

21
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,965
..we'd want to share this flat
with someone like you?

22
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:05,965
My first impression is that you have none
of the qualities we seek from a flatmate.

23
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:09,605
I'm talking about things like presence,
charisma, style and charm.

24
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:13,045
I don't think we're asking too much,
or being unreasonable.

25
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:17,045
Take David here. An accountant
he may be, but at least he tries hard.

26
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,245
Trouble is, I just don't think you're trying.

27
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:25,165
Hey, Cameron, I mean this. Good luck.

28
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,765
- Just a few questions.
- What about your hobbies?

29
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,925
- Why do you want a room here?
- Do you smoke?

30
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,805
When you sacrifice a goat and rip
its heart out, do you summon hellfire?

31
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:46,805
It's a straightforward question.
Either you're divorced or you're not.

32
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:50,525
- Or do you just send out for a pizza?
- Do a little freebase, maybe?

33
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:53,245
How do you decide
which shade of black to wear?

34
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:56,605
OK, I'm going to play you
just a few seconds of this tape.

35
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:59,085
Name the song, the lead singer,...

36
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:06,485
..and three hit singles subsequently
recorded by him with another band.

37
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:16,965
Let me get this straight.
This affair that you're "not" having,...

38
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:19,405
..is it not with a man
or not with a woman?

39
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:22,005
Turning very briefly
to corporate financing...

40
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:26,365
No, this is important. Leveraged buyouts:
a good or a bad thing?

41
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:29,125
When did anyone last
say to you these exact words:

42
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:33,005
"You are the sunshine of my life"?

43
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:38,565
And how would you react, then,
if I told you I was the Antichrist?

44
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:45,845
Do you like my picture?

45
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:57,725
Defeat. Defeat. Defeat.

46
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:04,125
Sporting, personal, financial,
professional, sexual and everything.

47
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,045
Next.

48
00:05:11,325 --> 00:05:15,845
- Did you know that...?
- Alex. Just serve.

49
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:22,445
Anyway, I wasn't tryin' to win. I
don't want to devalue your victory, Juliet.

50
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,685
- I wasn't tryin' to win.
- Victory's the same as defeat.

51
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,765
It's giving in to destructive urges.

52
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,605
Did you learn that in
your psychotherapy group?

53
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:33,685
- Discussion group.
- I thought you'd stopped going.

54
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:38,325
He had too many of those urges.
You of all people should know about that.

55
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,685
God, you two are sensitive.

56
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:44,685
All I'm doing is implying some
kind of ugly, sordid, sexual liaison.

57
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:47,405
- I'd be proud of that.
- Maybe you should go.

58
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:50,125
- You'll meet someone wonderful.
- For my life?

59
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:53,485
- A discussion group? I think not.
- For the flat.

60
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:57,325
No, it'd be someone like him,
and one's enough, thank you very much.

61
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,445
What about that girl? That friend of yours,
the one that came round. I liked her.

62
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:04,885
We had something. She could have
moved in. We had chemistry.

63
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,965
- She hated you...
- She had problems.

64
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:11,645
..more than anyone
she had ever met in her entire life.

65
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:15,325
Like they say, you know, she's
got to want to change, hasn't she?

66
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:28,725
- You must be Hugo.
- And you must be Juliet.

67
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:33,685
- Would you like to come in?
- I'd be delighted.

68
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,965
- What do you do?
- I've been away for a while.

69
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:44,965
Travelling. And now I'm writing a novel.

70
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,045
Oh.

71
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:50,885
- What's it about?
- It's actually about a priest who dies.

72
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,005
I see.

73
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:56,445
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I ought to change it. You're right.

74
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:59,885
I mean, who wants to read
another story about a dead priest?

75
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:04,165
In fact, it's about another guy,
he's not a priest, and he lives.

76
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:08,005
He doesn't die. See? It's better already.

77
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:11,085
- Writing seems easy.
- It's a breeze. No problem.

78
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:23,605
Do you think you could answer that?

79
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:28,925
- What, the telephone?
- But... if it's for me, I'm not here.

80
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:33,045
Right. You're not here.

81
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,685
OK.

82
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,885
Hello?

83
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:49,565
Yes, it is, yes. Who's calling, please?

84
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:55,005
Well, I'm sorry, but she's not...
she's not in right now.

85
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:58,645
No, I've got absolutely no idea.

86
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:01,525
Would you like to leave a message?

87
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:05,205
OK. Goodbye.

88
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:10,205
That was, um... a guy called Brian.

89
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:13,125
- Did he sound upset?
- A little bit, yeah.

90
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,965
- Is that good or bad?
- It's an improvement.

91
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,565
- Shall I get the phone?

92
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:22,565
Just leave it. He knows I'm probably
at home. I'm working nights this week.

93
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,405
- You're working nights?
- I'm a doctor.

94
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:26,365
Ah.

95
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:31,205
- And he's a patient?
- No, but he needs treatment.

96
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,685
- For what?
- A certain weakness.

97
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:37,405
- The human condition.
- Oh. You know about it.

98
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:42,165
- Well, I write about it.
- And that's not the same thing?

99
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,925
No. I'm like all novelists -
on a search of the self.

100
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:48,565
Has he tried
down the back of the fridge?

101
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:50,885
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.

102
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,805
I'm not saying
he didn't seem like a nice guy.

103
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:57,485
I just said it's a bit strange,
this search of the self or whatever.

104
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:00,005
He didn't seem strange, Alex.

105
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:05,445
He seemed... you know,...

106
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:09,485
- ..interesting.
- Interesting?

107
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:17,365
- Interesting.

108
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,325
Hello? No, she's not in.

109
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,965
I don't know. I've no idea.

110
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:30,525
- Who was it?
- I don't know. He sounded Swedish.

111
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:33,965
- Do you know any Swedish men?
- No.

112
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,245
Maybe it was just the emotion.

113
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:38,645
- What do you think?
- About what?

114
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:41,325
- About this Hugo person.
- I don't have the time.

115
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:45,165
- I'm just asking what you think.
- I don't care, so long as he's not a freak.

116
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:48,685
David. It's your mother's
handwriting. I didn't open it.

117
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:52,285
I don't like reading about
your father's constipation.

118
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,325
- So we'll meet him, then?
- What?

119
00:09:55,565 --> 00:10:00,725
Yeah, yeah, whatever. I tell you, every
letter this guy writes you is the same.

120
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:04,205
They all begin like true love
and descend into open pornography.

121
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:08,245
"I dream of your thighs, the touch of
your white skin leading me in desire,...

122
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:14,245
..while I, aroused and inflamed..."
Aroused and inflamed?

123
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,765
He even signs them in his own name.

124
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:25,925
I'd sign someone else's. I'd sign his name.
If I wrote them, that is, which I don't.

125
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,445
Interesting. That's what she said.

126
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:31,045
Interesting. You see,
that's why you're here.

127
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:34,165
I don't usually meet people,
unless I already know them.

128
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,725
- I see.
- People can be so cruel.

129
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:39,085
So, um...

130
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,165
..well, we think it's fine.

131
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,405
Ah. So, I can have the room?

132
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,645
- Yes, you can have the room.
- I'm not usually drunk.

133
00:10:47,885 --> 00:10:50,965
- Not usually this drunk.
- Only on expenses.

134
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:53,765
He's going to tell you
he could have been someone.

135
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:57,565
Instead of what he is, which is
the man we know and love.

136
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:01,725
..tired out, empty shell of a...
Know and love?

137
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,725
- I think you're lying.
- You're right.

138
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:11,285
- You see? They don't really know me.
- No, Alex. We don't really love you.

139
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:15,125
Can you afford this place?

140
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:18,805
Oh, yeah.

141
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:26,725
- Can I ask you a question?
- Certainly.

142
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:31,165
Have you ever killed a man?

143
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:39,005
No.

144
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:46,045
That's fair enough, then.

145
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:58,765
Well, it certainly smells like the real thing.

146
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:06,165
Rangers have made a few
dramatic comebacks this season.

147
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:12,205
But they'll really have to
draw on all of their resources.

148
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:18,205
- Have you seen Hugo?
- No.

149
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,965
Any idea which channel he's on?

150
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:24,365
..the High Court in Edinburgh.

151
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,245
Oh, for fuck's sake.

152
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:37,525
No, she's not in.

153
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:48,005
- Have you seen him?
- I don't have the time.

154
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:52,685
- Yes or no? David, yes or...?
- No!

155
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,165
- David hasn't seen him either.
- So I gathered.

156
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:59,005
- Maybe he didn't like us.
- David?

157
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:02,485
- No, Hugo.
- His car's still there.

158
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:05,885
- He's got a car?
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

159
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,805
- What sort of car?
- I don't know, Alex. I'm just a girl.

160
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:11,085
I'll ask you once more. What sort of car?

161
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:15,845
A blue one, OK? And it's still there.

162
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:31,685
Hugo, I'm sorry about this,
but can you open your door?

163
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:37,285
It's us, your flatmates and companions,
your new-found friends.

164
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:41,125
- He's not there. I can't see him at all.
- Maybe he's in the wardrobe.

165
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:43,445
Of course he's not
in the bloody wardrobe.

166
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:46,885
- It's a joke, Alex.
- I think he probably left.

167
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:52,005
- We'll probably never see him again.
- Alex, the key is on the other side.

168
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:54,765
- So?
- Open it.

169
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,845
You want me to kick this in? Now?

170
00:14:57,085 --> 00:15:00,725
- Yeah.
- OK, no problem.

171
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:11,725
Do you want a go?

172
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,485
OK, you size that up.

173
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:43,565
- Is this what they always look like?
- Yes.

174
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,965
- Wonder how he did it.
- Did what?

175
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:52,005
Killed himself.
I presume that's what's happened.

176
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:54,085
What do you think?

177
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:56,805
- Alex!
- What? What's wrong?

178
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:58,805
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

179
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,565
- Don't.
- Don't look?

180
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:02,765
- No.
- Why not?

181
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,445
What's wrong? Don't you
wonder what he died from?

182
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:10,205
No. The guy's dead.
What more do you need?

183
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,965
It's not every day
I find a story in my own flat.

184
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:18,845
It's not a story, Alex, it's a corpse.

185
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:24,965
I've never seen a dead body before.

186
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:36,405
I saw my grandmother, of course,
but I don't suppose that counts.

187
00:16:36,645 --> 00:16:40,165
She was alive at the time.

188
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:59,285
Can I show you something?

189
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,885
Emergency. Which service?

190
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,445
Emergency. Which... ?

191
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,725
- No.
- Just think about it.

192
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:23,965
- No.
- Come on, David.

193
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,365
- No.
- Juliet?

194
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:29,365
- No, Alex. It's...
- It's what?

195
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:31,245
- Unfeasible.
- Is that all?

196
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,645
- You mean immoral.
- I know what I mean.

197
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:38,045
- I'm only asking you to think about it.
- It's a sick idea, Alex. It's sick.

198
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:41,805
But don't tell me you're not tempted.
Don't tell me you're not interested.

199
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:45,765
- I know you well enough.
- You think so?

200
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:54,285
Go ahead, then. Telephone.

201
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:58,285
Telephone the police.

202
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:00,725
Go ahead. No one's gonna
stand in your way.

203
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:02,965
Telephone them. Tell them.

204
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:09,445
Tell them there's a suitcase full
of money, and you don't want it.

205
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:37,685
# My baby don't care for shows

206
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:42,525
# My baby don't care for clothes

207
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:47,605
# My baby just cares for me

208
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:53,485
# My baby don't care for

209
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:57,125
# Cars and races

210
00:18:57,365 --> 00:19:01,085
# My baby don't care for

211
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:05,125
# High-tone places

212
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:09,485
# Liz Taylor is not his style

213
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:12,245
Was there a pet
in the house? Yeah, a pet.

214
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,565
You know, like a dog or a budgie
or a gerbil or something?

215
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:23,285
What I need here is "PC Plod saves Harry
the Hamster from house of horror".

216
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:28,445
All right. Well, that's a pity.
You see, no pets - no human angle.

217
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:34,565
# My baby just cares for me

218
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,925
- Hi, there. What happened to that guy?
- What guy?

219
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:46,045
That guy. The one that died.

220
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,845
- Died?
- That one last week.

221
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:50,605
- Here?
- Yes, here. Where else?

222
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:53,605
Oh, him. Well, he died.

223
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:55,445
That's what I thought.

224
00:19:55,685 --> 00:20:00,405
Hello? Have you got room
for an overnighter?

225
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:11,725
# My baby don't care

226
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:14,885
# For cars and races

227
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,805
# Baby don't care for

228
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:21,805
# He don't care for high-tone places

229
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:27,165
# And Liz Taylor is not his style

230
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:31,085
- He's still here?
- Yeah, he couldn't get his car started.

231
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:33,365
When are you gonna let the police know?

232
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:36,525
You phone them if you want, David.

233
00:20:36,765 --> 00:20:41,925
- What about you?
- I'm getting used to having him around.

234
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:46,445
# With baby

235
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:50,045
# My baby just cares for

236
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:53,965
# My baby just cares for

237
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:59,925
# My baby just cares for me #

238
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:05,045
What is it we do here, David?

239
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,965
- Sorry?
- Here.

240
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:10,485
- Right here?
- In this firm.

241
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:14,205
- Well, it's a wide range of...
- Accounting, David.

242
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:19,165
Chartered accounting is of ten sneered at.
Were you aware of that?

243
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:23,165
- Not any real sneering as such, no.
- There's a whole wide world out there,...

244
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:26,285
..and it all needs to be
accounted for, does it not?

245
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:28,965
- Well, I...
- They sneer, do they not?

246
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,285
- I'm not sure.
- It's unfashionable.

247
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:34,805
But yes, we're methodical,
yes, we're diligent, yes, we're serious.

248
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:38,445
And where's the crime in that?
Why not shout it from the rooftops?

249
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:42,965
Maybe sometimes we're a wee bit boring,
but, by God, we get the job done.

250
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:47,605
- Yes, sir.
- That's why I think you fit in here.

251
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,885
- I'm boring?
- You get the job done.

252
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:57,605
- I see. I thought you meant...
- Which is why I trust you with this client.

253
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:29,085
Good morning. Can I help you?

254
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:33,045
Yeah, I'll just check that for you.

255
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:56,405
Let's do it.

256
00:22:56,645 --> 00:23:00,245
Let's talk about disposal.
We have to make that body unidentifiable.

257
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:03,645
Burning, dumping at sea
and burial are all flawed,...

258
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:07,485
..either by fingerprints or more commonly
by dental records, I have learnt.

259
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:10,245
What I suggest is that
we bury him out in the forest.

260
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:13,685
First we remove his hands
and his feet, which we incinerate.

261
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,645
And his teeth, which we just
remove. It's as simple as that.

262
00:23:17,885 --> 00:23:20,325
David.

263
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,765
I've always wondered
what these were for. Now...

264
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:26,445
Oh.

265
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:28,925
This is what we need.

266
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:31,405
And, um...

267
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:33,685
..this.

268
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:35,325
- What else?
- I don't know.

269
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:37,125
A spade. We need a spade.

270
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:40,005
I wish you'd concentrate.
We need a spade to dig a pit.

271
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:41,925
- Who's gonna do it?
- Dig the pit?

272
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:43,965
- Not that.
- Who's gonna do what?

273
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:47,965
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Do I? What are you talking about?

274
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:51,165
- You know what. Who's gonna do it?
- We all are, David.

275
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:55,365
We're all gonna do it. You, me and Juliet
will do his or her bit. Fair enough?

276
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:57,525
- I can't do it.
- I don't hear this.

277
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:00,805
- I won't be able to do it.
- You want out already?

278
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:03,925
You don't want the money?
Hugo is going off! He smells!

279
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:10,445
- The flat smells! We can't wait!
- I won't be able to cut him up.

280
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,645
- Who's going to do it?
- I thought we all were.

281
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,805
- I don't think I can.
- But, Juliet, you're a doctor.

282
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:35,965
- You kill people every day.
- That's different. I still don't want to.

283
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:40,045
Now you tell me.

284
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,205
There's something I want to ask.

285
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:06,725
I don't know! I swear to God, I don't know!

286
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:10,365
Family? Friends?

287
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:14,605
Drugged-up, wandering, suicidal
fuck-ups don't have families.

288
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:19,445
- I just thought we should discuss it.
- Take his legs.

289
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:26,245
Where's Hugo?

290
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:16,925
- Pick him up.
- Shh.

291
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:21,045
- Pick him up.
- Shh.

292
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:26,965
I swear to God, I don't know! I don't know!

293
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,005
Stupid fuckin' bastard.

294
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,285
Why don't we draw lots for it?

295
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:32,605
Whoever draws the short straw does it all.
That way you either do it or you don't.

296
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:35,125
- OK. I can go with that.
- David?

297
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:38,885
- I don't know.
- If I draw the short straw, I'll do it.

298
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:44,525
But I'm not gonna do it
just because you won't.

299
00:28:21,725 --> 00:28:25,005
All right, then. Here we are and this is it.

300
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:29,325
Do you wanna play or not?

301
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:07,405
I can't do it.

302
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:50,485
- Finished.
- All right, but not quite.

303
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:53,365
- Is that going to be deep enough?
- Don't worry.

304
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:58,925
- Is this necessary?
- Yes. Now come on. All or nothin'.

305
00:30:43,165 --> 00:30:47,245
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. I'm fine, thanks. Just fine.

306
00:30:47,485 --> 00:30:51,525
- Would you like to talk about it?
- No.

307
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:14,085
These three people
get their chance to...

308
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:18,165
..lose a million.

309
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:41,285
Yes, all right. Hello there and welcome
aboard our millionaire's yacht.

310
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:45,245
It's just like the "Marie Celeste"
but without the party atmosphere.

311
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:49,245
As you know, the object is not
to win the game, but to...

312
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:51,045
Lose.

313
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,605
Not to give right answers, but...

314
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,765
- Wrong ones.
- Not to do well, but to do really...

315
00:31:57,005 --> 00:31:59,005
Badly.

316
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:04,325
And above all to try
and make a total... hotchpotch.

317
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:15,125
Be careful.

318
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:35,245
Alex!

319
00:32:40,765 --> 00:32:44,165
I don't know why we couldn't
stuff it under the floorboards.

320
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:50,005
- Stop nagging, Alex.
- We could have hid it in the fridge.

321
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:06,605
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention, please?

322
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,245
I'd like to thank you all
for coming tonight,...

323
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:14,765
..to help us raise funds
for the sick children's unit.

324
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,925
You never told me this was for children.
I hate children.

325
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:24,405
I'd raise money to have the little fuckers
put down. I want my money back!

326
00:34:24,725 --> 00:34:26,685
But before the dancing starts...

327
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:29,805
- Excuse me!
- ..I would like to give a vote of thanks...

328
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:35,845
..to the few people who have worked
so hard to make this occasion happen.

329
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:38,645
- Do you know these people?
- They're my friends.

330
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:42,965
Oh, so if they want to speak to you,
we tell them that you're not here?

331
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:50,165
But ladies and gentlemen and those
of you who are neither or both...

332
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:55,725
- Where did they dig him up?
- Form sets for "Strip the Willow".

333
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:02,565
- Are we going to dance?
- Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?

334
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,845
OK.

335
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:19,685
Talk to me.

336
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:21,605
Talk to me.

337
00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:30,405
- OK.
- No! Don't! Please don't!

338
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,685
No! No!

339
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:39,365
Please!

340
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:56,285
- Can we talk about something?
- Not now. I have an idea.

341
00:36:56,525 --> 00:37:02,325
- It's important. We need to decide...
- Will you just stop worrying?

342
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:06,605
To love and to happiness for ever.

343
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:10,485
For ever and ever.

344
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:16,045
- What's wrong?
- I want to talk now.

345
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,205
When you've drunk
to love and happiness.

346
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,405
- Now.
- After.

347
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:21,965
David, I promise we will.
Just keep him happy.

348
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:27,285
It's not for me. It's for love
and happiness for ever.

349
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:34,765
Look over there. It's Cameron.

350
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,725
- Who?
- You remember Cameron.

351
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,365
- No.
- What's he doing here?

352
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:40,845
- That's not him.
- It is. Cameron!

353
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:45,045
Cameron, come on over here. Come on.

354
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:48,565
What?

355
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:52,045
Nothing. We thought
you were someone else.

356
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:54,485
Good luck!

357
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:58,525
- Why does he have to follow us around?
- What I was wanting to say was this.

358
00:37:58,765 --> 00:37:59,725
Aha!

359
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:03,165
- The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
- Brian.

360
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:06,205
- Would you care to dance?
- Hold on. Who do you think you are?

361
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:08,205
- What?
- Who do you think you are?

362
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:12,525
- You interrupted us.
- I'm Brian McKinley. And who are you?

363
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:18,005
Well, Brian McKinley, if you wanna talk
to my girlfriend, you talk to me first.

364
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:21,005
If you wanna dance, you apply
three weeks in advance,...

365
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:23,605
..or you're gonna end up
inside a fucking bin bag!

366
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:28,285
You didn't apply, so you don't dance.

367
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:36,205
Do you think you could be
a little more forceful next time?

368
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:40,485
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. I think he got the message.

369
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:42,645
That was quite stressful.

370
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:47,045
Yeah, but you were good. He was
really good. Fuckin' bin bag, I like that.

371
00:38:47,285 --> 00:38:50,965
You really explored
your maleness to the full there.

372
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,645
- You think so?
- You certainly had a good look around.

373
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:57,325
You were magnificent.

374
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:00,125
Yeah.

375
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:03,805
Fuckin' bin bag.

376
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:28,965
Fuckin' bin bag.

377
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:37,125
Cameron! What a surprise!

378
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:29,165
Hello?

379
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:32,685
Hello?

380
00:40:38,885 --> 00:40:41,605
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

381
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:46,245
- No one said anything.
- Or rendered speechless with desire.

382
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:50,045
I recall that feeling from
the days when I had such a thing.

383
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:54,125
- Are you all right?
- No.

384
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:59,605
Then let's spend some money.

385
00:41:00,565 --> 00:41:04,685
Hello. It's been a struggle,
but now our days of worry are over.

386
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:08,445
The light at the end of the tunnel
has expanded into a golden sunrise.

387
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:15,605
And now at last, at long last,
nothing will ever be the same again.

388
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:03,165
This is Alex Law reporting on
the video diary of his own life.

389
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:05,845
Let me tell you, I'm so happy I could die.

390
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:17,565
I think we ought to stop this, don't you?

391
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:20,765
- Oh, will you relax?
- You're making us all nervous.

392
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,005
- How much did you pay for this?
- I don't know.

393
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,365
- I can't remember.
- Tell me how much you paid.

394
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:29,205
- I can't remember.
- How much did you pay for this?

395
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:32,845
- No idea. I don't know.
- How much did you pay for this?!

396
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:36,845
- £500.
- £500?

397
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:40,245
You paid £500 for this?

398
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:43,765
- That's what it cost.
- No. That's what you paid for it.

399
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:49,165
£500 is what you paid for it.
We don't know how much it cost us yet.

400
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:54,365
For you two to have a good time.
We don't know the cost of that yet.

401
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:38,685
Excuse me. Did they take anything?

402
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:48,565
Is that enough for you?

403
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:50,165
Oi.

404
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:52,485
- What?
- Is that enough for you?

405
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:55,205
- Yes, that's fine.
- There's plenty more.

406
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:58,885
That's fine.

407
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:05,045
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

408
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:06,965
- You're not eating.
- Eating what?

409
00:44:07,205 --> 00:44:13,525
- You're not eating like you used to.
- If you give me the plate, I'll eat.

410
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:29,325
Now swallow.

411
00:44:33,525 --> 00:44:36,245
You should spend some money
instead of worrying about it.

412
00:44:36,485 --> 00:44:39,725
- You'd feel much better.
- Once it's spent, you don't have to worry.

413
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:43,365
- It'll be a weight off your shoulders.
- You know we're right.

414
00:44:43,605 --> 00:44:46,965
- I wanna secure it.
- Secure it? You wanna put it in a bank?

415
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:50,125
You don't wanna put it in a bank, do you?
Do you want to bury it?

416
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:54,325
- I don't see the point. It's stupid.
- Course it's stupid. We took the money.

417
00:44:54,565 --> 00:44:56,805
It was a material calculation.

418
00:44:57,045 --> 00:45:00,765
What's the point if it's underground
in some funny bank in some funny place?

419
00:45:01,005 --> 00:45:04,205
If you can't have it - spend it -
then what use is it? None.

420
00:45:04,445 --> 00:45:08,765
It's all for nothing. I didn't get into this
for nothing, so that I could have nothing.

421
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:13,245
Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.

422
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:23,565
Tastes different.

423
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:57,325
David, what are you doin' up there?

424
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:06,685
Will you come down now?
It's not safe up there.

425
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:18,805
Are you listening to me?

426
00:46:19,045 --> 00:46:23,725
Security and insanity
are not the same thing.

427
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:30,405
Shit.

428
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:11,605
I don't care. A grown man shouldn't
be living in a loft. He isn't safe up there.

429
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:16,165
If you cared about him at all,
you'd use your influence to get him down.

430
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,685
- And the money?
- We could put it somewhere.

431
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:21,605
Where he can't get it?

432
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:24,005
Well, you thought of that, not me.

433
00:47:24,245 --> 00:47:28,085
Forget it. He'll come down.

434
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:31,525
Oh, Juliet, look.

435
00:47:47,685 --> 00:47:50,165
Hello, Mr Lumsden.
It's David Stevens here.

436
00:47:50,405 --> 00:47:53,205
I'm sorry, sir. I won't be able
to make it to the office today.

437
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:58,245
It's my mother, sir. She's very ill
and I think I need to be with her just now.

438
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:02,485
I don't know. The doctors aren't sure.
It could go either way.

439
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:06,845
Yes, sir. I'll certainly stay in touch.

440
00:48:38,605 --> 00:48:40,085
- Good day?
- What?

441
00:48:40,325 --> 00:48:42,565
- Good day?
- What are you talking about?

442
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:45,765
- I'm just asking if you had a good day.
- Why?

443
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:48,645
Well, I thought I'd make conversation.

444
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:52,925
- Please, I'd rather you didn't.

445
00:48:53,165 --> 00:48:56,365
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

446
00:48:56,605 --> 00:49:02,725
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

447
00:50:02,045 --> 00:50:07,045
It's in the loft! In the loft!

448
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:14,885
September 19, London Heathrow
to Rio de Janeiro.

449
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,965
It's British Airways.
You're looking at £765. That's 7-6-5.

450
00:53:19,205 --> 00:53:21,845
- That sounds fine.
- Air Portugal, on the other hand,...

451
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:27,685
..it's via Lisbon, the same day.
It's £565. 5-6-5. Is catering important?

452
00:53:27,925 --> 00:53:30,525
- What?
- Air France, Glasgow direct.

453
00:53:30,765 --> 00:53:34,205
But then you're looking at
the wrong end of £912. That's 9-1-2.

454
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:37,525
- The first one was fine. Heathrow direct.
- It's up to you.

455
00:53:37,765 --> 00:53:42,525
Air Patagonia, that's a new outfit.
Via... via lots of different places, really.

456
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:48,605
It's no catering. That's £411. 4-1-1.
It's good value, but refuelling at Bogotá...

457
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:51,285
The first one was fine.

458
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:55,885
It's up to you. 7-6-5.
How will you be paying?

459
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:20,845
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!

460
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,965
Oh, my God!

461
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:33,085
Christ!

462
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:38,005
No, no. Dear God. No! Christ!

463
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:17,085
No, and that's it.
I refuse to discuss it any further.

464
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:18,805
- It's the only way.
- I refuse.

465
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:22,645
- You're frightened.
- I'm not frightened. I'm a little terrified.

466
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:25,365
Did you see what happened
to the last two people?

467
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:28,085
They went up alive and
they came back down dead.

468
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:32,125
Did you notice that? The difference,
I mean. Alive, dead - dead, alive.

469
00:55:32,365 --> 00:55:35,565
It wasn't difficult to spot.

470
00:55:35,805 --> 00:55:38,005
He killed them both.

471
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:42,405
- He cut them up.
- Yeah, but you'll be all right.

472
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:47,765
- And how's that?
- Because you're smarter than he is.

473
00:55:49,525 --> 00:55:54,005
Yeah, well, that's what
I've always thought.

474
00:56:18,285 --> 00:56:22,205
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector
McCall. This is DC Mitchell.

475
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,405
I wonder if we could ask some questions.

476
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:27,165
- What about?
- It's about the burglary.

477
00:56:27,405 --> 00:56:30,485
- Burglary?
- Downstairs.

478
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:34,485
- Of course.
- Can we come in?

479
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,445
So I just heard
her cries for help and all that.

480
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:40,445
When I went downstairs,
there were other people there.

481
00:56:40,685 --> 00:56:44,405
So I just stood around, you know,
waiting, the way people do.

482
00:56:44,645 --> 00:56:47,805
And when your colleagues arrived,
I came back upstairs.

483
00:56:48,045 --> 00:56:52,445
That's about all, I think. I didn't actually
see anything useful, I don't think.

484
00:56:52,685 --> 00:56:55,165
And the other three people,
did they hear anything?

485
00:56:55,405 --> 00:56:59,725
There are only two
other people in the flat.

486
00:57:06,045 --> 00:57:10,125
- Two?
- Who said there were four?

487
00:57:10,445 --> 00:57:14,525
We understood there were four people
living here. Not always, but now four.

488
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:17,485
No, three. Who said there were four?

489
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:21,925
How strange. And how unsatisfactory
to have misleading information.

490
00:57:22,165 --> 00:57:24,365
Only three people here?

491
00:57:24,605 --> 00:57:26,805
- You're sure?
- Yes, absolutely.

492
00:57:27,045 --> 00:57:29,005
Who said there were four?

493
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:33,765
Make a note of that, Mitchell.
Only three rather than four. Write it down.

494
00:57:34,005 --> 00:57:36,645
You can use numbers or words.
I've no preference.

495
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:39,725
- Which are you using?
- Both, sir.

496
00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:42,765
Excellent.

497
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:45,765
DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr Stevens.

498
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:49,685
Under my tutelage, he will
undoubtedly make the grade.

499
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:53,765
- I see.
- I doubt it.

500
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:56,645
- You'll wait in the hall?
- I'll wait.

501
00:57:56,885 --> 00:58:00,965
If it sounds like I'm getting killed,
call the police and tell them everything.

502
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:03,805
Except maybe that it was
his idea in the first place.

503
00:58:04,045 --> 00:58:06,205
That's important.
I need to die misunderstood.

504
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:07,925
- Alex.
- What?

505
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:13,125
As smart as you are,
you might need a little help.

506
00:58:14,645 --> 00:58:20,845
David, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
open this lock and I'm gonna come up.

507
00:58:21,085 --> 00:58:26,445
But what's really important
is that you remain calm. OK?

508
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:11,525
Alex?

509
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:15,605
It's all right. It's just a pigeon.

510
00:59:29,325 --> 00:59:33,205
Well, he isn't up here.

511
00:59:36,565 --> 00:59:40,405
Tell him to look for the money.

512
00:59:45,245 --> 00:59:46,885
Look for the money.

513
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:51,685
Don't worry.
That's exactly what I'm doin'.

514
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:05,445
It's not up here. He has eaten it.

515
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,605
Are you looking for me?

516
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:33,805
Looking for you, yeah.

517
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:37,605
What for? What did you want?
The money? Was that it?

518
01:00:37,845 --> 01:00:39,885
We just wanted to talk to you.

519
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:45,485
Who else have you just wanted to talk to?
Maybe you thought they'd already got me.

520
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:49,565
- Who?
- Your friends.

521
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:53,645
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

522
01:00:53,885 --> 01:00:58,005
He doesn't know, David.

523
01:01:00,205 --> 01:01:02,725
Maybe you don't.

524
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:05,405
I'm talking about the police.

525
01:04:26,045 --> 01:04:29,685
I thought you'd gone to work.

526
01:04:29,965 --> 01:04:33,605
With a face like this?

527
01:04:49,005 --> 01:04:52,845
Alex, the editor wants to see you.

528
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:05,445
- I'm sorry.
- So you should be.

529
01:05:08,085 --> 01:05:12,325
Maybe we can still sort everything out.

530
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:20,485
Well, we can certainly try.

531
01:05:22,765 --> 01:05:27,285
Three bodies. Decomposed.
Mutilated beyond recognition.

532
01:05:27,525 --> 01:05:30,845
- I don't know anythin' about it.
- Of course you don't.

533
01:05:31,085 --> 01:05:34,485
If you knew anything about it,
I wouldn't have to send you to cover it.

534
01:05:34,725 --> 01:05:38,205
- Cover it?
- That's right. This is your break, son.

535
01:05:38,445 --> 01:05:40,925
Cover it?

536
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:46,685
Jesus.

537
01:06:01,085 --> 01:06:04,525
Ow!

538
01:07:14,645 --> 01:07:20,325
All right. The releasable and printworthy
facts of the day so far are as follows.

539
01:07:20,565 --> 01:07:24,685
Late yesterday, forestry workers
came across one set of human remains...

540
01:07:24,925 --> 01:07:27,645
..in a grave which appeared
to have been recently dug.

541
01:07:27,885 --> 01:07:32,845
Further excavation revealed another
deeper grave with two sets of remains.

542
01:07:33,085 --> 01:07:38,725
- Is this a serial killer?
- How come they haven't been identified?

543
01:07:38,965 --> 01:07:43,125
- Any obvious motive here?
- Is it true that one has been skinned?

544
01:07:43,365 --> 01:07:45,525
Not entirely.

545
01:07:45,765 --> 01:07:49,085
All right, all right.
An area of skin "has" been removed.

546
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:53,645
And you'd better keep this to yourselves.
There's no hands, no feet, no teeth.

547
01:07:53,885 --> 01:07:56,645
The face is totally
unrecognisable and, yes,...

548
01:07:56,885 --> 01:08:01,125
..skin has been removed
from one of the bodies.

549
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:03,525
As and when the corpses are removed,...

550
01:08:03,765 --> 01:08:07,885
..we will endeavour to ascertain the
mode of death and duration of burial,...

551
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:12,685
..as well as identification, which
will of course be passed on to you,...

552
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:17,245
..after informing,
where possible, the next of kin.

553
01:09:02,165 --> 01:09:05,125
- Are you OK?
- Yes, of course.

554
01:09:05,365 --> 01:09:09,205
Why wouldn't I be?

555
01:09:09,965 --> 01:09:15,645
- I don't know. I just thought maybe...
- We were just sorting things out.

556
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:19,125
- You'd better read all about it.
- We already know.

557
01:09:19,365 --> 01:09:20,885
It was on the television.

558
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,645
Of course, but print
provides a more lucid and...

559
01:09:23,885 --> 01:09:25,845
Oh, shut up, Alex.

560
01:09:26,085 --> 01:09:30,005
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't
deep enough and you wouldn't listen.

561
01:09:30,245 --> 01:09:32,165
It doesn't necessarily matter.

562
01:09:32,405 --> 01:09:36,485
They don't know who they are and have
nothing to connect us with them. Nothing.

563
01:09:36,725 --> 01:09:38,925
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex.

564
01:09:39,165 --> 01:09:41,325
It makes us feel a whole lot better.

565
01:09:41,565 --> 01:09:47,245
- I beg your pardon?
- It makes us feel a whole lot better.

566
01:09:47,805 --> 01:09:51,245
That's what I thought he said.

567
01:10:14,325 --> 01:10:16,165
Shh. Stop.

568
01:10:16,405 --> 01:10:18,525
What are you doin' here?

569
01:10:18,765 --> 01:10:20,645
It's about me and David.

570
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:24,965
- The perfect couple, I should say.
- You mustn't take it so badly.

571
01:10:25,205 --> 01:10:29,565
Don't worry. I'd do exactly the same
thing, only I don't think I'm his type.

572
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:34,245
- Don't you ever stop?
- No.

573
01:10:57,925 --> 01:11:01,125
Take all the time you like, Doctor.

574
01:11:01,365 --> 01:11:04,405
No, I've never seen any of them.

575
01:11:04,645 --> 01:11:08,085
Look again, if you like.

576
01:11:13,085 --> 01:11:15,525
I'm sorry, I haven't seen them.

577
01:11:15,765 --> 01:11:19,165
- Do you have a good memory for faces?
- The same as everyone else.

578
01:11:19,405 --> 01:11:23,925
But in your work you must meet lots of
people every day. New people, new faces.

579
01:11:24,165 --> 01:11:25,565
Yes.

580
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:28,245
What do you recognise most,
names or faces?

581
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:31,405
Diseases.

582
01:11:31,645 --> 01:11:35,645
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

583
01:11:35,885 --> 01:11:40,445
- I suppose so.
- I meant, that's what it's like.

584
01:11:40,685 --> 01:11:42,965
- Sorry?
- You said you supposed so.

585
01:11:43,205 --> 01:11:46,605
- I wasn't offering it for debate.
- He wasn't offering it for debate.

586
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:51,605
Like recognising criminals
by their crimes.

587
01:12:15,285 --> 01:12:18,765
No, I've never seen
any of these men before.

588
01:12:19,005 --> 01:12:22,525
Take a look at the first two.

589
01:12:24,685 --> 01:12:26,525
No, I don't know them.

590
01:12:26,765 --> 01:12:33,725
If I told you their car was parked outside
just now, would that surprise you?

591
01:12:36,725 --> 01:12:40,765
Yes, I suppose so.

592
01:12:42,885 --> 01:12:44,885
Well, is it?

593
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:48,165
- What?
- Parked there?

594
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,805
No. Not any more.

595
01:12:51,045 --> 01:12:55,445
I just wondered if it would surprise you.

596
01:12:56,765 --> 01:12:58,365
- That's it.
- That's all?

597
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:00,365
Yes.

598
01:13:00,605 --> 01:13:05,965
- Sorry to waste your time.
- Oh, not at all. Don't worry.

599
01:13:06,725 --> 01:13:08,925
- One thing.
- Your watch.

600
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:11,765
- Your watch.
- Is it real?

601
01:13:12,005 --> 01:13:16,445
Oh, no. It's a fake. I got it in Thailand.
The second hand doesn't sweep.

602
01:13:16,685 --> 01:13:20,125
- I see.
- Right.

603
01:13:20,165 --> 01:13:24,165
Tell you what. If you do
remember these guys,...

604
01:13:24,405 --> 01:13:28,125
..maybe you could give me
a phone on this number.

605
01:13:28,365 --> 01:13:32,325
Any time you like.

606
01:13:37,245 --> 01:13:41,485
I didn't tell them anything, nothing
at all, absolutely nothing. They're plods.

607
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:46,605
If they had any witnesses, any forensic
evidence, they would have whipped it out.

608
01:13:46,845 --> 01:13:50,085
- They know.
- They can know all they like.

609
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:52,405
- They know.
- So? They know.

610
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:56,125
So what? There's nothing
to connect us with that body stuff.

611
01:13:56,365 --> 01:14:01,125
- Except the money.
- He's right, Alex. They know.

612
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:38,845
Come on.

613
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:40,725
My office is closed.

614
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:43,605
Life, however, grinds on
towards its conclusion.

615
01:16:43,845 --> 01:16:48,685
In the meantime, you may wish to leave a
message, but the final decision is yours.

616
01:16:53,925 --> 01:16:58,365
David? You forgot to wake me.

617
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:13,245
- So let's go.
- You and me?

618
01:17:13,765 --> 01:17:17,605
Together.

619
01:17:18,045 --> 01:17:23,485
Hey! Alex! Who are you calling
at this time of night?

620
01:17:28,045 --> 01:17:31,485
Come out here and talk to us.

621
01:17:46,085 --> 01:17:49,685
Well? Sex lines, is that it?

622
01:17:49,925 --> 01:17:53,245
Triple-X-rated, interactive fantasies?
Old habits die hard.

623
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:57,165
- I was phoning your mother.
- You old devil.

624
01:17:57,405 --> 01:18:00,765
Well, anyway.
As you can see, we're leaving.

625
01:18:01,005 --> 01:18:03,845
- So I gathered.
- I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

626
01:18:04,085 --> 01:18:07,525
- Don't worry. I'll forward your mail.
- No, really.

627
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:12,165
I am sorry. Sorry to be ducking out on
you. I hope you won't take it personally.

628
01:18:12,405 --> 01:18:15,645
No, no. Don't let it worry you.
It's probably for the best.

629
01:18:15,885 --> 01:18:21,285
All for the best. Exactly. I wouldn't
want things to end on a downer.

630
01:18:21,525 --> 01:18:24,325
- Not at all.
- I mean, we've ups and downs, right.

631
01:18:24,565 --> 01:18:27,525
Good times, bad times.

632
01:18:27,765 --> 01:18:30,165
We could talk all night,
but we have to go. Don't we?

633
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:32,565
Yes.

634
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:36,845
- And you need your sleep.
- Yes.

635
01:18:40,445 --> 01:18:43,405
No, I can't think of
anything else that matters.

636
01:18:43,645 --> 01:18:46,405
- About your mail.
- Very good of you to offer, but...

637
01:18:46,645 --> 01:18:48,605
Where do you think you'll go?

638
01:18:48,845 --> 01:18:51,245
Where will we go?

639
01:18:51,485 --> 01:18:53,405
Where will we go?

640
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,525
Juliet?

641
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:58,325
- I don't know.
- Don't be so coy, dear.

642
01:18:58,565 --> 01:19:00,685
You're going to Rio.

643
01:19:00,925 --> 01:19:03,565
- What?
- That's right.

644
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,165
Rio de Janeiro, on your own.

645
01:19:06,405 --> 01:19:11,725
You should know.
You bought the fucking ticket!

646
01:19:15,525 --> 01:19:18,125
Did you see that?

647
01:19:18,365 --> 01:19:21,845
I bet she didn't show you that before
she sent you up there. What did she say?

648
01:19:22,085 --> 01:19:26,805
We'll split it together,
you and me, fifty-fifty.

649
01:19:28,445 --> 01:19:30,525
But I bet you didn't say you'd split on him.

650
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:33,845
- It wasn't like that.
- Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.

651
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:37,525
I bought it.

652
01:19:37,925 --> 01:19:40,365
What?

653
01:19:40,605 --> 01:19:43,405
I bought the tickets.
For her and for me. It was my idea.

654
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:45,885
Your idea. I see.

655
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:47,885
Well, that fits.

656
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:52,645
I mean, you and him fit together.
I should have seen that a long time ago.

657
01:19:52,885 --> 01:19:55,845
- Alex, stop him!
- No, let him go. Let him have it all.

658
01:19:56,085 --> 01:19:59,925
Juliet, let him go.

659
01:20:01,685 --> 01:20:05,125
I'm leaving.

660
01:20:11,045 --> 01:20:17,285
You shouldn't have hit her! Do what
you like, but you shouldn't have hit her!

661
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:35,045
You want it?

662
01:20:35,285 --> 01:20:36,525
You want it?

663
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:39,645
Aagh!

664
01:20:40,005 --> 01:20:43,845
You bastard!

665
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:32,725
You did the right thing.

666
01:22:32,725 --> 01:22:36,485
But I can't take you with me.

667
01:23:45,485 --> 01:23:47,725
Be OK, Mummy.

668
01:23:47,965 --> 01:23:51,525
Oh, I'll be all right.

669
01:24:10,165 --> 01:24:13,605
Hello, Inspector.

670
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:40,805
# It's the sound that lovers

671
01:24:41,045 --> 01:24:45,125
# Hear when they discover

672
01:24:45,365 --> 01:24:53,725
# There could be no other for their love

673
01:24:53,965 --> 01:24:59,925
# It's my happy heart you hear

674
01:25:00,165 --> 01:25:03,845
# Singing loud and singing clear

675
01:25:04,085 --> 01:25:08,125
# And it's all because you're near

676
01:25:08,365 --> 01:25:11,965
# Me, my love

677
01:25:12,205 --> 01:25:16,325
# Take my happy heart away

678
01:25:16,565 --> 01:25:20,325
# Let me love you night and day

679
01:25:20,565 --> 01:25:24,525
# In your arms I wanna stay

680
01:25:24,765 --> 01:25:31,125
# Oh, my love #

681
01:25:32,565 --> 01:25:35,805
Oh, yes. I believe in friends.

682
01:25:36,045 --> 01:25:38,165
I believe we need them.

683
01:25:38,405 --> 01:25:42,405
But, if one day you find that
you just can't trust them any more,...

684
01:25:42,645 --> 01:25:44,805
..well what then?

685
01:25:45,045 --> 01:25:48,485
What then?

686
01:25:50,285 --> 01:25:54,125
# Music fills my soul now

687
01:25:54,365 --> 01:25:58,205
# I've lost all control now

688
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,685
# I'm not half, I'm whole now

689
01:26:01,925 --> 01:26:06,605
# With your love

690
01:26:06,845 --> 01:26:12,685
# It's my happy heart you hear

691
01:26:12,925 --> 01:26:16,805
# Singing loud and singing clear

692
01:26:17,045 --> 01:26:21,125
# And it's all because you're near

693
01:26:21,365 --> 01:26:24,965
# Me, my love

694
01:26:25,205 --> 01:26:29,045
# Take my happy heart away

695
01:26:29,285 --> 01:26:33,165
# Let me love you night and day

696
01:26:33,405 --> 01:26:37,205
# In your arms I wanna stay

697
01:26:37,445 --> 01:26:42,845
# All night long #
