1
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:12,280
Nervous, huh, kid?

2
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:49,157
Matty,
when your father went away...

3
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:51,522
I welcomed him asking me
to look after you.

4
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:53,325
I considered it an honour.

5
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:55,796
And not because
he was Benny Chains...

6
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:59,243
or because your mother was
my sister, but because of you.

7
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,795
Ever since you were
a little kid, you been nails...

8
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:04,162
tough as fucking nails.

9
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:06,886
When you go down there,
be decisive...

10
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,958
because that is
the motherfucker...

11
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:12,517
who is responsible
for your pop being sent away.

12
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:18,523
Matty, tonight is the night
that you become a man.

13
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:03,000
This is all wrong.
Totally all wrong.

14
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:06,045
Teddy, you know.
You got to know.

15
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:09,915
Guys, this is Bobby Boulevard.

16
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:12,202
Thas the life, Matty.

17
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,847
Is always the guy
you don't want it to be.

18
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:16,997
Hey, Matty.

19
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:19,555
How you doin', kiddo?

20
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:20,636
Hey, Bobby.

21
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:31,039
Oh, no, Matty. Matty, come on.

22
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:35,325
Why would I want to rat
on anyone? No.

23
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:37,875
Come on. Hey, hey, Matty...

24
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,118
who taught you
the hook serve, huh?

25
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:44,085
Got you 7 points off your dad
first time you ever set foot...

26
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,237
on a handball court
with him, huh? Who?

27
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,158
You did, Bobby.

28
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:51,956
You remember the time I got you
that bundle of "Hustlers," huh?

29
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:54,038
You made a fuckin' fortune...

30
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:56,083
selling 'em to those kids
at Aquinas Prep.

31
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:59,955
Wasn't me, I swear.
I'm no informant.

32
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:03,323
Shut the fuck up!

33
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:13,041
I feel better already.

34
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,437
Come on, Matty. Now's the time
for stomach, son. OK?

35
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:19,917
You gotta decide,
does this guy live or die?

36
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,804
Come on.

37
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:31,285
Just give the trigger
a gentle squeeze.

38
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:56,279
I'm sorry, Uncle Teddy.

39
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:01,126
Is all right. Is fine.
Don't worry about it.

40
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:08,076
Look, you're not cut out
for this. We know that now.

41
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,037
Go on outside.

42
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:20,524
What are you gonna do to him?

43
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:24,361
Nothin' much.
Bang him around a little bit.

44
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,244
Move him outta town.

45
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,125
Is your fuckin'
lucky day, Bob.

46
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:33,839
Go on. Here.
Make yourself a phone call.

47
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,000
Sure. OK, Jill.

48
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:17,602
Right. I'll see you
at the stadium. Bye.

49
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:20,520
So, Mr. Demaret.

50
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:23,360
- Matty.
- Matty. Fine.

51
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:26,484
So, personnel tells me you were
up for an assistans job...

52
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:29,525
but you got Joanne over there
to convince me to meet with you.

53
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,565
- So...
- Excuse me.

54
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:38,478
So, I want to be an agent,
you know, a sports agent.

55
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:41,240
And why am I gonna
make you that?

56
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:42,840
Well, honestly, Mr. McCreedle...

57
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,758
I think I been preparing for it
my whole life.

58
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:46,883
When I was a kid,
I started going to ball games...

59
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,958
and I remember spending
a lot of time alone...

60
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:51,197
but I could always count on
ball season to keep me company.

61
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,245
I had this uncle in the ushers
and ticket taker union...

62
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:56,318
Local 176, so I got to know
all the ushers...

63
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,318
at Yankee Stadium and Shea, too.

64
00:06:58,407 --> 00:07:00,238
Before I knew it,
I was wired at the Garden...

65
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:02,204
and I never missed
a Rangers or a Knick game.

66
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:05,040
As far back as I can remember,
working with ball players...

67
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:06,446
was really
all I ever wanted to do.

68
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:11,123
Well. Good patter. Yeah,
les see whas on the page.

69
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:18,315
"Bachelor in sports marketing."

70
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:22,002
- Work..."Ubonne Plumbing"?
- Thas right.

71
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:24,806
Now defunct.
You were the president.

72
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:31,402
"White's Taxi and Livery."
Also president.

73
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,521
"Gianda's Catering Hole."

74
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:42,240
Thas Benny Chains' place,
right?

75
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:46,002
Yeah, thas correct.
He owns it.

76
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:49,284
So, are you, like,
related to him?

77
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:52,086
Yes, I am. He's my father.

78
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,046
Well, thas
a pretty close relation.

79
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:00,998
Well, you've got enthusiasm...

80
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,726
but there's nothing in
your job experience for me to...

81
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,367
- Listen, I know...
- No, I'm glad that you came in.

82
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:08,403
I know what you're thinking,
because I've heard it before.

83
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,398
Is always
the same story for me.

84
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:12,682
I get cold-cocked the minute
my father's name is mentioned.

85
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:18,046
You gotta just...
you can do this, all right?

86
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:21,324
Look past the name
and just hire yourself a guy...

87
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,921
who's gonna bust his hump
every day for you. Gimme a...

88
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:27,841
Let me stop you right there.
You put on a good show...

89
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,361
but I think I know what
you're really trying to do here.

90
00:08:30,447 --> 00:08:33,166
You come on all nice
and respectable...

91
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,239
then I hire you, and then
you lay the strong arm on me.

92
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:37,442
Would you just hear me out?

93
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:38,676
When my father started
this place...

94
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,519
you know how many guys
like you and your father...

95
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:41,926
tried to break off a piece?

96
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,202
I'll tell you what he told them:
Go whistle.

97
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,606
All respect,
but you've got me wrong.

98
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,166
Do I?

99
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:51,957
I'm here for a job, all right?
Just a fucking job.

100
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:55,605
In what prosecutors
are calling...

101
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,678
a death knell
for organised crime...

102
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,645
indictments have been
handed down across the board.

103
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,877
The governmens case
is only the latest blow...

104
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,958
to the weakening
power structure of...

105
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:25,241
Thas game!

106
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:31,365
I set you up for that.
Nice fuckin' yonkas, Benny.

107
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:34,678
Too good.
The man is too fucking good.

108
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,156
Thas why he is the boss.

109
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:38,760
Towel.

110
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:41,759
You know why
your daïs so hard to beat?

111
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,157
Most guys let it bounce,
but Benny Chains anticipates.

112
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:47,397
He charges, no hesitation.

113
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,599
Whas that, Manganaros?

114
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:52,518
Yeah. I was in the city
on an interview.

115
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:54,438
Got you guys
some of the good stuff.

116
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:59,555
- Another sport agency?
- Yeah. Last one, too.

117
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:02,878
Fuck 'em. You know, Teddy,
in the last year...

118
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,037
I been to over fourteen
interviews.

119
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:07,880
Various companies,
same result... door slammin'.

120
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:11,482
Listen, to those cocksuckers,
you are what we are.

121
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,239
Yeah, well, they're right.

122
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,283
Is time
I did something about it.

123
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:17,801
- Hey, all right.
- Hey, the champ!

124
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:19,036
What about another one?

125
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:22,278
Jesus, that was quick.
Mercy rule?

126
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:25,484
Well, you know, closed 'em out!

127
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,365
The man was outclassed.
What can I tell ya?

128
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,597
I got somethin' for ya.

129
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:34,282
OK, just in time. Here.
Couple of scoots, huh?

130
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:37,406
That from Cristian?

131
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:42,800
Yeah. The man's a sport,
a gentle, likeable guy.

132
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:46,038
I never paid a check
in his joint in the old days.

133
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,322
I feel half-bad
about collectin' this.

134
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:49,681
So, why did you?

135
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:53,317
We got to.
We're collectin' everywhere.

136
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,204
Guys supposed
to be comin' across...

137
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,324
with a set amount every week
aren't hittin' their figures.

138
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,284
How are we gonna
kick it up above...

139
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,323
if it doesn't flow
into us first?

140
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:05,205
You figure they're holdin' out
or just not earnin'?

141
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:08,085
Not earnin'?
There is no not earnin'.

142
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,885
You think people
stopped fuckin'...

143
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,117
and stopped bettin' and stopped
borrowin' this month?

144
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:15,358
What the fuck's the matter
with you? You don't get it?

145
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:18,564
Someone's stealing from us.

146
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:21,719
Look, Pop,
is there anything I can do?

147
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:26,085
Nah. Nothin' for you to sweat.
We're workin' it out.

148
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:29,079
Come on. Teddy,
would you help me out here?

149
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,395
You said it yourself.

150
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:33,160
Outside of Brooklyn,
no one's gonna give me a shot.

151
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,683
What are you complainin' about?
You drive a Cadillac.

152
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:40,806
Look, Pop, I got a handle
on the low-level stuff...

153
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:43,196
keepin' the taxis running,
overseeing the crap games...

154
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,164
the odd union meeting,
but is time.

155
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,124
I'm ready to step up.

156
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,320
If you're jammed up here...

157
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,398
there's gotta be somethin'
I can do, right?

158
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:57,925
You brought us the sandwiches!
What else can you do?

159
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:01,045
Listen, I'll see you later.

160
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,799
Hey, Tony.

161
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,605
These ladies... their check
is on us today, OK?

162
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:24,200
Of course.

163
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:30,800
For dessert,
you can go powder your noses.

164
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:33,321
Just leave your numbers
with Tony.

165
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,958
Listen, Chris,
not for nothin'...

166
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,197
but your old man's
not gonna like this.

167
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:42,245
He says no more checks
on the arm for random broads.

168
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,443
You're hurtin' him too much
ever since that bachelor list...

169
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:46,358
came out in the "Post."

170
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:50,486
What do you want me to tell ya?
The ladies love me.

171
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,795
Whas up?

172
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:58,758
Why is it every junkie
thinks newspaper cleans glass?

173
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,678
Couldn't tell ya.

174
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,803
Here ya go. Thanks, chief.

175
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,447
No, don't do that.

176
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:07,119
Thas extortion,
for Chriss sake.

177
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:10,040
The window's even dirtier
than it was before.

178
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,322
Come on,
whas the matter with you?

179
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,524
Guy's got the worst job
in the world.

180
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:19,646
Nah, worst job has gotta be
mop boy at Show World.

181
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,604
I'll tell you what,
I'm not moppin' up spooge...

182
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:23,484
but is not that fun
for me anymore.

183
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,718
I never thought
I'd have a fuckin' job.

184
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,277
My father wants me to have
5 days a week... lunch and dinner.

185
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,959
Man, when I was growin' up...

186
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,641
I didn't see him running
no diner room lunch and dinner.

187
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,126
You got that right.

188
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:40,120
Man had crews running while
he sat there at the Bergen...

189
00:13:40,207 --> 00:13:42,084
sippin' his espresso
and countin' money.

190
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,761
Yeah, but he had to get out.
You know that.

191
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:47,361
Another conviction,
he'd be gone for life, right?

192
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,678
But he's still named Scarpa,
and where does that leave me?

193
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,485
With a small piece
of a restaurant...

194
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:54,717
and all the hassles
of his old life.

195
00:13:54,807 --> 00:14:01,246
Bad press. Fed surveillance.
Liquor board shakedowns.

196
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:06,401
Not to mention people whispering
when we walk into a room.

197
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,921
Face it, Chris.
To regular people...

198
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:11,726
we're stone fucking goombahs,
you know?

199
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:15,277
But to knockaround guys,
to our fathers...

200
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:19,565
we're nothin'
but a couple of errand boys.

201
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,356
Shit. Sometimes I think
I ought to change my name.

202
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:28,282
No, I need the name.
Gets me laid once a week...

203
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,403
at least.

204
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,920
- Hey, Johnny Marbles.
- Matty.

205
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,042
- Scarpa.
- Whas up?

206
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,958
Almost bent my plane
on this jet up there.

207
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:58,164
Just dodged a goddamn Aer Lingus
air bus. Irish bastards!

208
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:00,807
Why don't you stop flyin'
this bottom feeder...

209
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:02,878
upgrade your pilos rating
to jets?

210
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,958
Sign me up.
Fly all over the world...

211
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,322
work in a stewardess-rich
environment.

212
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,284
What I really need
is a shot with your father.

213
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,244
I'm serious. Would you
talk to him for me?

214
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,238
Tell him is been a year since
anything's been up my nose.

215
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:17,997
OK, ten months, but I'm ready.
I'm locked down.

216
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:22,684
- You ready to go, or what?
- Yeah. Where's Taylor?

217
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,082
I got nothing for you,
my friend.

218
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:32,162
I checked the meter
on my machines.

219
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:33,919
Now, they've had plenty of play.

220
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:36,237
I gave you that key
so you could borrow a little...

221
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:38,887
float yourself for a few days.

222
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:42,277
But half that money is mine,
and I want it.

223
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,597
What can I tell you, Taylor?
I run a business here.

224
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:45,836
I have expenses.

225
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:50,045
If I'm not paying fast enough
for you, turn 'em off.

226
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:51,924
Take them out of the store.

227
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you crazy?

228
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,044
They're your own
fucking machines!

229
00:17:23,687 --> 00:17:26,076
Don't do this to me, por favor.

230
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:32,125
The milk guy's getting paid...

231
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:33,799
the potato chip guy's
getting paid...

232
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,115
the beer guy's getting paid...

233
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:37,038
every-fucking-body's
getting paid...

234
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,960
and you look through me?!
You fuck!

235
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,043
I got it, I got it.
Is right here.

236
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:54,197
Hey, Teddy. Good to see you.

237
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,118
Hey, Deserve, we were
just talking about you.

238
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:02,000
Look at him. Teddy Deserve.

239
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:04,442
Guy gets kissed more
than a mezuzah.

240
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,084
I'll see you later.

241
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,398
One day, Taylor, you're gonna be
walking in here with Teddy.

242
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:19,638
Nah. He'll use me
when it suits him...

243
00:18:19,727 --> 00:18:22,116
and he knows I'll do the work.

244
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,846
But I don't get
carried away with it.

245
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:29,205
My mother's a Jew, and you know
what that means to them.

246
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:32,723
I saw your bit
on the handball court...

247
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,526
you know,
talking about being ready.

248
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:38,724
- You meant that shit, right?
- Yeah.

249
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,321
'Cause we've been down
this road before, Matty.

250
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,557
I was twelve years old, Teddy.

251
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:45,763
How long are you going to keep
holding that against me, huh?

252
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:48,964
Time to move past it.
You think so?

253
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:51,845
- Fucking-A.
- So do I.

254
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:53,918
And I told your father that.

255
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,157
You did?

256
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:03,326
Remember the problem
we were talking about?

257
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,681
- Shortages?
- Right.

258
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,803
Georgie Yarkus out in Spokane...

259
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,242
is floating your father
some wood for a short term.

260
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:12,000
Got to go get it,
but we got nobody we can trust.

261
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:13,918
We're still hashing out
the details...

262
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:17,602
- but you could be involved.
- Yeah?

263
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:21,965
I done what I could, Matty.
Is on you to convince him.

264
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:26,280
I'll see you later at the hall.

265
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:54,316
Hey, look alive.

266
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:56,523
- Evening, Matty.
- How you doing, man?

267
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:08,924
Sounding good, Jimmy.
How you doing?

268
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,406
Hey, whas up, Matty?

269
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:14,366
- Hey, how you doing, Joe?
- Hey, paying customers, Matty.

270
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:23,160
- Hey, Vito.
- Hey, Matty.

271
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,158
- How you doing?
- Good.

272
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,556
Pump it out, gentlemen.
Get your rent.

273
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:30,605
There it is!
Come on, sweetheart!

274
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:34,441
- Hey, Matty!
- Fellas. Hey.

275
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,722
Did you have a visit
from Tuxedo-Max?

276
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:39,275
Thas right.
Help yourself to a cummerbund.

277
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,679
Twenty up! Twenty up!

278
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:46,042
Come on.
Billy's babes need the bread.

279
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:53,041
You need this money picked up
from Yarkus in Spokane?

280
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,765
I'm your guy.

281
00:20:54,847 --> 00:20:58,044
The answer's no.

282
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:01,881
You get detected crossing state
lines with all that lumber...

283
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:05,516
feds trace you back to me,
I'm fucked here.

284
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:09,122
Listen, I can get this
done for you...

285
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:12,005
'cause Marbles has got a plane.
He can fly out and pick it up.

286
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:17,115
Better that way. Besides,
is a simple fuckin' run.

287
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:19,641
Hold on. Marbles?

288
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:22,287
He's half an idiot,
and that is the good half.

289
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,198
Come on. He's in, he's out.

290
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:27,120
Pop, listen to me. I swear
to God, he's turned it around.

291
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:30,244
And I'll oversee
the whole thing.

292
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:33,444
Would you give me this much?
I can get this job done.

293
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:37,884
Matty, I hate to knife you here,
but is my experience:

294
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:42,085
A guy gets something done
because he needs to.

295
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,044
Now, maybe is my doing.

296
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:47,836
The way I raised ya,
privilege and such...

297
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:49,918
but I'm having a hard time
figuring out...

298
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:52,157
what it is you need.

299
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:55,557
Not for nothin',
but most guys go in for it...

300
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,242
'cause they don't got
no other way to survive.

301
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:06,558
Well, neither do I.

302
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:14,960
Listen, I got us
an opportunity, Marbles.

303
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:18,317
You need to fly to Spokane.
Felts Field.

304
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:21,046
There'll be a guy there
named Georgie Yarkus.

305
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:24,597
He'll hand you a bag.
Don't look in the bag...

306
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:27,121
don't open the bag,
don't let go of the bag.

307
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:29,482
Only stop for fuel,
then get back in the plane...

308
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:35,483
and fly straight home to me.
And don't fuck this up.

309
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:39,276
Benny Chains said to tell you,
"Don't fuck this up."

310
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,198
I know, only stop for gas.
Don't worry.

311
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:42,879
I keep her on the barber pole
the whole way back.

312
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:08,924
Come on, stay alert.

313
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,758
Well, just one.

314
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:25,722
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you very much.

315
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:28,082
- Hi, Louise.
- Sheriff.

316
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:31,045
- How are you doing, Louise?
- Good, Donnie.

317
00:24:35,447 --> 00:24:39,679
- Yeah.
- Say it again, Tease.

318
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:43,077
If I had mad moochie,
do you know what I'd buy?

319
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:44,919
I believe I do, Decker.

320
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:47,805
Doctor Go-Fast design
pro-model street luge.

321
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:51,277
- Carbon-fibre front fender.
- With the vibe-absorb seat.

322
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:54,996
- Yeah. Z-roller trucks.
- Fuckin' boss speed, man.

323
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:09,844
Even hyper super-mondo wheels.

324
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,316
Definitely
super-mondo wheels, man.

325
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:19,326
That don't look
store-bought to me, Stan.

326
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:20,965
Nope, is marijuana, Donnie.

327
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:27,199
- Want to deal with it now?
- Best I deal with it later.

328
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:44,922
Hey. Fifty-four gallons.
Just top her off.

329
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:25,240
I swear to Christ, Matty.
I swear to fuckin' Christ.

330
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:26,601
What did you do?

331
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:29,565
I swear to Christ. I didn't
turn my back for a second.

332
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:31,444
What are you saying to me, huh?

333
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:35,315
I stopped to get fuel. I don't
leave the bag in the plane...

334
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:38,126
I'll tell you that much.
But these cops...

335
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:39,720
Cops? What cops?!

336
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,158
They looked right through me.

337
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:46,364
It was like they knew every
thing I'd ever been guilty of.

338
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:48,278
I couldn't double back
to the plane.

339
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:51,882
It woulïve seemed too obvious.
I had to make a decision:

340
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:55,323
Walk right into 'em,
expose your father...

341
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,726
or stash the bag.

342
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:11,846
A few of the boys
were going down the way to...

343
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,280
What? I'm not invited?

344
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,403
No, I'll talk to you about that,
but I just wanted...

345
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:18,047
to extend to you, you know,
an invitation, 'cause I...

346
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:22,006
Fifty-four gallons
of 100 octane low-lead, please.

347
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:26,803
Thall be 116. 10, sir.

348
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:29,447
- Credit or...
- Cash. I'll pay cash.

349
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:43,118
You just keep the difference.

350
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:47,439
Don't be ridiculous, sir.
Let me open my strongbox here.

351
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:53,077
- One moment.
- No, is gonna take too long.

352
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,759
Why are you in such a rush?

353
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:01,162
I got a schedule.

354
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:11,885
Hey, this one ain't tagged.

355
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,442
- I have your change.
- No, really, is OK.

356
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:28,519
Take your change, son!

357
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:41,686
We don't see too many hundred
dollar bills around here.

358
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:46,045
Thas one-seventeen...

359
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:49,756
eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

360
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:51,883
Forty, sixty...

361
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:05,483
Long as they keep
moving through.

362
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:08,798
- Where's that flight headed?
- Last flight of the day.

363
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:11,560
The only place they fly
is Billings.

364
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:37,125
Listen to me! Who the fuck
has the money, Marbles?!

365
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:40,279
Matty, I have no idea.

366
00:30:04,487 --> 00:30:08,400
That road is total bacon, dude!

367
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:10,478
That was sick!

368
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:16,725
Fuck. All right,
where the hell are you?

369
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,401
Wibaux, Montana.

370
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:24,966
W-e-e-b-o...

371
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:27,197
No, W-i-b-a-u-x.

372
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:30,199
- X?
- Yeah, X.

373
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,721
What do you want me to do now?

374
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:37,835
Don't do anything, OK?
We're coming out.

375
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,919
What are you doing?

376
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,202
What are you,
a fucking ballerina now?

377
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:03,596
No, is ai chi. First off...

378
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,917
I'm refining my centre,
and it stretches you out.

379
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:09,044
I'm all crimped up from sleeping
in the fucking plane.

380
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:10,958
Plus, is a deadly art.

381
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,357
You're a fucking hard-on.

382
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:17,325
That hurt.
I absorbed the impact, though.

383
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:19,204
Shut up, all right?

384
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:21,721
I go on the line for you.
I give you a shot. For what?

385
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:24,640
Jeez, Matty, I told you,
there were cops.

386
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:26,558
It felt like a set up.
What can I tell you?

387
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:28,399
Look, I know I fucked the dog
on this one...

388
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:32,116
No, you didn't just
fuck the dog. You fucked me.

389
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:35,995
Matty, I swear, all right?
If I have to work...

390
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:37,805
the rest of my life,
I'll pay you back.

391
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:39,206
Where was the last place
you saw it?

392
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:40,640
Right here.

393
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:43,446
You told me not to take
my eyes off it. I didn't.

394
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,119
I thought it went to Billings.
I was wrong.

395
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:46,959
But I scoped every passenger.
Crew, too.

396
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:50,357
I watched every piece
of baggage come off.

397
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:52,802
Is got to be here somewhere.

398
00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:00,598
I'm coming with, right?

399
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,643
Do what the fuck you want.

400
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,398
My friend here
lost a bag yesterday...

401
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:10,840
and I was wondering
if you'd be so kind...

402
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:14,522
Hey, you find that bag yet?

403
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:19,123
Like I said last evening,
I am the lost and found...

404
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:21,163
and no bags have been turned in.

405
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:24,284
Louise, I know this is gonna
sound irregular...

406
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,198
but what was in that bag
was extremely important.

407
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:29,040
What I need from you is a list
of arriving passengers...

408
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,924
airport staff, home addresses...

409
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:32,326
phone numbers,
this sort of thing.

410
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:35,479
Sir, that is quite impossible.

411
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:38,286
Well, I'm willing to pay.

412
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:40,483
What I can do
is call the sheriff...

413
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,523
and ask him to help you
with your search.

414
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:44,325
No, thas all right.

415
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:47,285
Could you tell me
who I can rent a car from?

416
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,723
You're talkin' to her.

417
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:14,365
Look at this place.

418
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:17,245
Guys like us could be
running it in a week.

419
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:18,919
First thing you do
in an open town...

420
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:20,599
is the control the cart-out.

421
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:23,247
I'd put my name on every garbage
truck running through here.

422
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:27,161
Listen,
someone's got that money.

423
00:33:28,927 --> 00:33:34,206
My uncle, he says we got
to announce ourselves to them...

424
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:36,596
make them want to find us.

425
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,883
Make them beg us
to take that money back...

426
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:44,004
they're so scared, so long as
we leave them the fuck alone.

427
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:50,637
OK, how do we do that?

428
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:56,007
I don't know.

429
00:33:57,247 --> 00:34:00,364
Like this:

430
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:03,757
We find the toughest guy here...

431
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:07,203
I mean, the worst guy they got.

432
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:12,202
The guy all the other guys
cross the street to avoid...

433
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:15,677
and we glaze this tough guy...

434
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:19,123
give him
the beating of his life...

435
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:22,404
way past the worst
he's ever given.

436
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:34,166
Looks like they're multiplying,
Donnie.

437
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:36,158
Best we keep on our toes.

438
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:41,157
Let me take care of this.

439
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:49,881
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

440
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:54,438
Listen, I need some information.
I want you to take this.

441
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:58,725
I can't break that.
Your tab only came to 14.30.

442
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:02,484
Look, dear, whas your name?

443
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:06,560
Bernadette.

444
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:09,957
Bernadette. You just tell me
where I can find...

445
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:12,163
a little trouble in this town.

446
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:14,966
Used to be you would have
already found it.

447
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:18,278
But since I'm taken...

448
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:22,280
you could always try
the Shamrock tonight.

449
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,927
Is like a fucking
homecoming over there.

450
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:48,235
Are you kidding me?

451
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:51,364
They got action here, Matty.
Legal fucking action.

452
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,765
Grab a table. I got the beers.

453
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:04,157
Hi there.
Do you boys need anything?

454
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:08,604
No, we're good... very good.

455
00:36:10,727 --> 00:36:14,436
Listen, I'm looking for the guy
who runs this place.

456
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:16,358
Owner lives up at Mile City.

457
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:20,360
No, no, I mean, you know,
the guy who runs the place.

458
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:26,759
I'm the night manager.
You sellin' somethin'?

459
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:30,203
Never mind. Just give me
three beers, would you?

460
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:33,599
Seven-fifty.

461
00:36:33,687 --> 00:36:35,962
Here. Keep it.

462
00:36:44,047 --> 00:36:45,196
Hey, Gordy.

463
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:53,803
Howdy, sidewinder.
Take your best shot.

464
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:57,560
Gotcha.

465
00:36:57,647 --> 00:37:00,798
Howdy, sidewinder.
Take your best...

466
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:02,002
Got me.

467
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,282
Howdy, sidewinder. Take...

468
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:05,482
Got me.

469
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:09,037
You see anybody in here
with an unusually thick roll?

470
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:12,957
Nah. I've been watching.

471
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:18,162
Who the fuck
are Brooks and Dunn?

472
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:22,126
They're real good, aren't they?
They're Teri's favourite.

473
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,801
Hey, Teri, come here.

474
00:37:24,887 --> 00:37:28,084
How are you, dear?
People really dance to this?

475
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,885
- Sure.
- Show me.

476
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:32,117
- Show you?
- Yeah, come on.

477
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:35,961
All right.
Is easier than easy.

478
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,558
Jesus Christ.

479
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,603
You dance good.
Where are you from?

480
00:37:48,687 --> 00:37:50,279
Brooklyn.

481
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,124
Oh, great.

482
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:57,721
These are nice guys here, Gordy.
We were just dancin'.

483
00:37:58,807 --> 00:38:00,399
Why don't you keep to yourself?

484
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:10,244
Well, you were askin' about me.

485
00:38:10,327 --> 00:38:13,125
You got my attention now,
don't ya?

486
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:17,962
You run this place? You the man?
You the guy I come to...

487
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,799
if I wanted to sort
some things out?

488
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:23,721
No, I'm Brucker. I'm the guy
askin' what the fuck you want.

489
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:26,446
I am also the guy decides
if you and your friends...

490
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,961
walk the fuck outta here or not!

491
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,040
Yeah, he'll do.

492
00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:40,879
Five hundred.

493
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:44,636
Five hundred what, douche bag?

494
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,403
Five hundred fights.

495
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:58,718
Thas the number I figured
when I was a kid.

496
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:02,204
Five hundred street fights...

497
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:05,597
and you can consider yourself
a legitimate tough guy.

498
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:12,126
You need 'em for experience,
to develop leather skin.

499
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:16,246
So I got started.
Of course, along the way...

500
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:19,285
you stop thinkin'
about being tough and all that.

501
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:22,439
It stops bein' the point.

502
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,724
Get past
the silliness of it all.

503
00:39:25,807 --> 00:39:28,116
But then...

504
00:39:31,687 --> 00:39:34,645
after...

505
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:37,844
you realise thas what you are.

506
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,476
Look, I got no problem
with you, all right?

507
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,285
I'll tell you,
you learn a lotta things...

508
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:49,122
on the way to five hundred,
none more important than this...

509
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:01,477
Son of a bitch.

510
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:10,602
Listen to me.

511
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:14,441
Before we walked in here
this was your town, right?

512
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:16,995
Well, this is how
you get it back.

513
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:19,317
Something of ours went missing.

514
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:22,001
Whoever took it has gotta be
making it obvious...

515
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:24,521
so I want you to find out who.

516
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,839
When you do,
you come meet me at the motel.

517
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:49,964
Do you really think
whoever's got the money...

518
00:41:50,047 --> 00:41:53,198
would be stupid enough
to just geek around with it?

519
00:41:53,287 --> 00:41:55,243
Cool.

520
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:02,323
- Chocodiles?
- Oh, yeah.

521
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:05,999
That it?

522
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:10,596
Where do you keep
your Cocoa Puffs?

523
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:21,157
Get that, will ya, Teddy?

524
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,807
- Yeah?
- Hey, Teddy. Is me.

525
00:42:23,887 --> 00:42:27,800
Is you? Is Matty.
Where the fuck have you been?

526
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:30,640
I'm with Marbles. I'm trying
to take care of this thing.

527
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:33,116
But I figure is pretty
much under control now.

528
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:35,641
Don't piss down my back
and tell me is raining.

529
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:37,877
You tell me
whas really going on here.

530
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:42,438
Hey, Pop, listen. I've had
a few complications, thas all.

531
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:45,325
- Yeah, like what?
- Where are you exactly?

532
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,318
- Look, I'll be home tomorrow.
- You'll be home?

533
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:52,841
I told you not
to fuckin' go anywhere.

534
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:55,680
You got the bag with you
at least, right?

535
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:58,486
Yeah. I'm going
to get it right now.

536
00:42:58,567 --> 00:42:59,920
You don't have the fuckin' bag?!

537
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,998
- Pop, listen...
- He begged me!

538
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:03,202
Is under control,
I swear to you.

539
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:07,200
He begged me for this shot,
and you, you convinced me...

540
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:09,243
to give it to him.

541
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:11,158
Pop, would you listen to me?

542
00:43:11,247 --> 00:43:13,477
I should have known
fuckin' better.

543
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:14,682
Shit.

544
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:17,964
Matty, that bag
is not full of nickels.

545
00:43:18,047 --> 00:43:20,242
Is got about
a half million dollars in it...

546
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:22,397
and now your father
owes the guys above...

547
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:25,923
and Georgie fuckin' Yarkus.
If we don't get that bag back...

548
00:43:26,007 --> 00:43:29,682
in the next forty-eight hours,
is the three Rs for us:

549
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:32,679
The roof, the river,
or the revolver.

550
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:35,076
Get that fucking money.

551
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:36,725
Yeah, I know. Teddy, listen...

552
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:39,162
I've been trying
to deal with this...

553
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:42,885
Fuck. Fuck!

554
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:55,919
Clueless, do me a favour.
Call Santos over at the 504.

555
00:43:56,007 --> 00:43:58,840
- Air transport union?
- Yeah.

556
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:02,044
We need a flight plan
and a tail number.

557
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:14,120
Looks like more than the usual
Thursday night Macarena...

558
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,404
- huh, Heslop?
- Yeah.

559
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:30,076
Hey, Clute,
anybody been in here...

560
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,681
spending
an unusual amount of cash?

561
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:35,361
Yeah, these two little
skateboard punks.

562
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:37,756
They wrecked
the beef jerky display...

563
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:39,963
stuff all over the floor.

564
00:44:58,287 --> 00:44:59,845
Hey, Gordy.

565
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:02,566
Thas a pretty fancy
new set-up you got there.

566
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:07,640
Afraid I got some bad news
for you boys.

567
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:10,241
Kinda like that scarrage
on your face...

568
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:12,477
I ain't in the mood, Tease,
all right?

569
00:45:24,407 --> 00:45:28,559
Look at these fuckers.
Covered in camouflage...

570
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:33,198
sitting out in the woods
all day, stakin' out a turkey.

571
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,595
What do they need
to do that for?

572
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,282
Go to fuckin' Graztiti's,
get a Butterball.

573
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:47,798
You know, we were gonna go once.

574
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:51,484
November 14, 1986.

575
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:53,319
- Come on.
- Yeah.

576
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,959
Just me and my pop,
goin' upstate for deer.

577
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:03,963
I remember, I was gonna get
woken up at 4: 15 in the morning.

578
00:46:04,047 --> 00:46:06,686
The knock came, all right.

579
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:10,442
Whole fucking door
came off its hinges.

580
00:46:10,527 --> 00:46:13,246
OC task force, feds, NYPD.

581
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:19,676
No. Didn't take any chances
with Benny Chains that night.

582
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:26,322
You know, I always wondered
what it would have been like...

583
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:29,046
if we had left
the night before, you know?

584
00:46:30,447 --> 00:46:35,601
At least have those couple days
together before he went in.

585
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,565
Man, yes!

586
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:51,043
So this coulïve been you, huh?

587
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:56,803
Yeah, the hat,
the face-net, the whole deal.

588
00:46:56,887 --> 00:46:59,640
A different way for me.
What can I tell you?

589
00:47:13,887 --> 00:47:16,526
I found out what you told me to.

590
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:48,277
Hey, dude. You think
if we give 'em back the money...

591
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:50,403
you think they'll let us go?

592
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:55,197
I've been thinking, dude.

593
00:47:57,247 --> 00:47:58,441
You believe this?

594
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:02,763
A couple of kids.

595
00:48:02,847 --> 00:48:04,917
Back home
you find a bag of dog shit...

596
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,202
you go looking for
who it belongs to, right?

597
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:18,322
- Donnie.
- Morning, Stan.

598
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:22,446
- Back to the salt mines?
- Gotta make one stop first.

599
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,759
All right, no, I see...

600
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:30,760
is a valid point
about splitting, dude.

601
00:48:30,847 --> 00:48:33,236
Could we not take
the luges with?

602
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,080
No, man, they're too bulky.
We gotta sacrifice 'em.

603
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:38,840
- But my stuff...
- Dude...

604
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:40,838
we'll get you new stuff.

605
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:50,361
Go time.

606
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,437
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

607
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:02,486
What the fuck is that?

608
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:06,915
I knew you weren't sick,
you lying sack of shit.

609
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:09,123
Fuck. Hey, Dad.

610
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:13,923
Watch your mouth.

611
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:16,567
- Whas in the bag, son?
- I don't know, look.

612
00:49:17,727 --> 00:49:20,161
More of that reefer
I saw you smoking?

613
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:22,875
Give me that!

614
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,560
Fuck.

615
00:49:33,247 --> 00:49:35,078
Where'd you get this?

616
00:49:36,687 --> 00:49:39,155
Get in the house.
We're gonna talk about this.

617
00:49:39,247 --> 00:49:41,124
Get in the house.

618
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:49,277
We were rich once.

619
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:04,999
Fuck!

620
00:50:07,647 --> 00:50:09,126
Son of a bitch.

621
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:19,160
So, what do you think, Stan?
Wanna bring in the hypos...

622
00:50:19,247 --> 00:50:23,320
or call straight to the federal
bureau about the money?

623
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:27,844
What I think is,
we work pretty darn hard, Don.

624
00:50:27,927 --> 00:50:31,840
Pretty darn hard.

625
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:33,679
That we do.

626
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:36,964
And we work pretty cheap,
too, don't we?

627
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:43,642
Stan?

628
00:50:43,727 --> 00:50:45,877
So, fifty-fifty clean.

629
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:53,555
247 for you, 247.5 for me.
Thas sheriff tax.

630
00:50:56,207 --> 00:51:00,405
You know what, Stan?
Why don't you keep it all?

631
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:02,398
I'm more than
a little uncomfortable here.

632
00:51:02,487 --> 00:51:06,878
Your comfort
concerns me not a hitch.

633
00:51:08,727 --> 00:51:12,197
You're keeping your half
'cause you're in it with me.

634
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,437
And we're partners, Donnie.

635
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:19,961
Partners, OK?

636
00:51:26,607 --> 00:51:29,246
Is one thing running around
here trying to track the bag...

637
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:33,002
...but cops? That makes it
a different story for me.

638
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:35,476
I'm not fuckin' around
with any cops.

639
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,523
They start asking
where the cash came from...

640
00:51:37,607 --> 00:51:39,996
- how we gonna answer that?
- He's right.

641
00:51:40,087 --> 00:51:44,365
Well, I gotta do something.
'Cause in helping you...

642
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:46,278
I might have killed my old man.

643
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:49,837
How the fuck do you figure that?
All right, I lost the bag...

644
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:51,440
but I ain't getting arrested
behind it.

645
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:53,085
What good is that gonna do us?

646
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:55,727
Arrested.
Can you believe this guy?

647
00:51:55,807 --> 00:51:57,638
Thad be the good news.

648
00:51:57,727 --> 00:52:00,287
That bag was like life support
for my father.

649
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,961
He needed it yesterday.

650
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:24,963
What can I do you for, boys?

651
00:52:25,047 --> 00:52:27,720
Well, I'd say about
a half a million, Sheriff.

652
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:29,126
Is that so?

653
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:33,120
See, my friends and I, we're
looking to get out of your town.

654
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:37,086
But before we do, there's
something we can't leave behind.

655
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,123
This ain't the lost and found.

656
00:52:39,207 --> 00:52:42,244
People around here are real
careful with their property.

657
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:45,000
You wouldn't wanna misplace
your cow or nothin'.

658
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:49,722
You got some set of oysters
on you there, boy...

659
00:52:49,807 --> 00:52:52,241
walkin' in here like you belong.

660
00:52:54,887 --> 00:52:57,765
But be that as it may...

661
00:52:57,847 --> 00:53:00,407
you say you lost some money,
a high dollar amount.

662
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:02,796
As a public servant, I'd like
to help you get it back.

663
00:53:06,047 --> 00:53:08,607
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

664
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:12,726
Listen, why don't you and I just
have a little word in private?

665
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:20,724
Come on, son.

666
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,484
You see,
where I come from, Sheriff...

667
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:45,276
there's what you call
the spirit of sharing.

668
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:47,483
People help each other.

669
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:49,239
But since I've been out here...

670
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,682
I've picked up on
a real streak of independence.

671
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,758
How's that?

672
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:57,317
The way I see it, is you've
been watching my money for me...

673
00:53:57,407 --> 00:54:01,446
protecting it.
And I appreciate that. I do.

674
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:07,119
You and your partner have
an opportunity to profit here.

675
00:54:07,207 --> 00:54:09,801
You're driving mighty close
to the line now, Skip.

676
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:12,117
Why don't you just cut
the bullshit?

677
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,846
Do you know who I am?

678
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:16,963
Well, I could call Mary
down at the hotel...

679
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:19,322
and have her read me
the registration.

680
00:54:19,407 --> 00:54:22,683
- Why don't you tell me?
- My name's Matty Demaret.

681
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:29,805
Look, I don't normally
volunteer this much...

682
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,162
but I'm gonna tell you
because is important.

683
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:34,602
I'm Benny Chains' son.

684
00:54:36,087 --> 00:54:38,362
Well, I don't know
no Benny the Chains...

685
00:54:38,447 --> 00:54:41,803
but les just say
there is this money...

686
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:43,843
Look, I saw you take it
off the kids, all right?

687
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:46,805
I know you fucking have it.
So what you and I have to do...

688
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:49,720
is come to some sort
of understanding.

689
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,877
All right.

690
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:53,559
You understand this.

691
00:54:58,367 --> 00:55:01,006
Stand down! Stand down!

692
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:03,605
Get back behind the counter.
Turn around.

693
00:55:07,527 --> 00:55:09,324
Turn around!

694
00:55:27,447 --> 00:55:29,756
Keep it trained on him, Don.

695
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:45,040
You had it coming,
you son of a bitch.

696
00:55:45,127 --> 00:55:48,756
Guy you arse-whupped in that bar
is a cousin of mine.

697
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,442
By marriage. Get him up!

698
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:06,678
Forget this shit, Marbles.
Straight to the airport.

699
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:09,042
Abso-fucking-lutely, man.
We oughta chalk this one up...

700
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:12,403
in the loss column
and just move on.

701
00:56:12,487 --> 00:56:16,321
Move on? Look at him!

702
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:17,840
What are you gonna do?

703
00:56:21,367 --> 00:56:23,756
You're gonna kill
a couple of cops?

704
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,485
Pull over.

705
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:28,081
Marbles, pull over!

706
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:31,443
Matty,
what if they call the feds?

707
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:34,439
Look, if that sheriff
was gonna call the FBI...

708
00:56:34,527 --> 00:56:37,246
or anybody else,
he woulïve already.

709
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,399
Taylor's P.O.
Woulïve been pulled.

710
00:56:40,487 --> 00:56:43,081
That whole fucking motel
woulïve been swarming with law.

711
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:44,680
They woulïve
taken us into custody...

712
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:47,600
the minute
we walked into that station.

713
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:48,881
They don't want us
in the system...

714
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:51,322
because they don't want anybody
else knowin' about the money.

715
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:56,003
- What are you talking about?
- They're keeping the money.

716
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:06,441
Look, you two can leave
if you want to.

717
00:57:09,647 --> 00:57:11,956
But I ain't goin' anywhere.

718
00:57:34,847 --> 00:57:37,042
Scarpa. Goddamn,
I've heard that name.

719
00:57:37,127 --> 00:57:38,958
Yeah, well, Bill Kurtis
was talking about him...

720
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:41,038
on the history
of organised crime on A&E.

721
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:46,319
- You get A&E with satellite?
- Yeah.

722
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:48,079
You think thas his kid?

723
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:50,556
Oh, yeah, I surely do.

724
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,838
You know something else, Don?

725
00:57:54,927 --> 00:57:57,680
That Demaret kid
wasn't just jaw-wagging.

726
00:57:57,767 --> 00:57:59,519
His daddy Benny Demaret...

727
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:01,757
seems like he's just under
the top guys.

728
00:58:01,847 --> 00:58:04,680
Holy shit, Stan. An underboss?

729
00:58:07,407 --> 00:58:09,557
Look, we're not
rousting juvies here.

730
00:58:09,647 --> 00:58:11,683
They're not just gonna
let this go, that kind of money.

731
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:13,564
They're gonna call their uncles
and their fathers...

732
00:58:13,647 --> 00:58:15,126
and they're gonna come here
looking for the money.

733
00:58:15,207 --> 00:58:16,845
The place
is gonna be crawling with 'em.

734
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:20,203
You're watching too darn much
of that satellite, Donnie.

735
00:58:22,527 --> 00:58:24,199
Nobody's comin'
to this marine's town...

736
00:58:24,287 --> 00:58:26,437
and doing a damn thing.

737
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:29,200
Just think about it.
They can't just call...

738
00:58:29,287 --> 00:58:31,562
and say they lost the money.
They'd have done it already.

739
00:58:31,647 --> 00:58:34,241
They do that, they end up
in a barrel of acid...

740
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:36,682
or whatever else they do
with their bodies these days.

741
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:37,882
I see what you're saying.

742
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:40,083
I just don't figure on them
leaving empty-handed.

743
00:58:43,727 --> 00:58:47,686
See, thas the thing.
We can't let 'em leave.

744
00:58:56,087 --> 00:58:59,159
I'll tell you one thing,
next time I see those fucks...

745
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:01,317
I'm gonna be packin'.

746
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:03,875
I keep a piece in my plane.

747
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:34,203
I'm sorry, Johnny.

748
00:59:41,207 --> 00:59:44,438
That is a big Heartland Lodge
buck right there.

749
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:45,801
Feature this.

750
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:49,596
State senate thinks they can
tell me how to run my shop.

751
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:52,918
So, yeah, there is
a three-day waiting period...

752
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:55,601
technically.
But thas mostly enforceable...

753
00:59:55,687 --> 00:59:58,997
for your garden variety
Latino stick-up men...

754
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:02,443
which you boys
don't appear to be.

755
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:04,722
No, sir. Definitely not.

756
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:08,117
Listen, I appreciate
you moving this along for us.

757
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:10,516
Here's a bill
for all your trouble.

758
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:26,804
They trouble? I thought
they would be trouble.

759
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:28,923
No. No. No trouble.
Question 'em, mostly.

760
01:00:29,007 --> 01:00:30,406
Just question 'em.

761
01:00:30,487 --> 01:00:33,524
Just wanna
yoggle-doggle with 'em.

762
01:00:33,607 --> 01:00:36,360
You give me a call
if you see 'em.

763
01:00:36,447 --> 01:00:38,324
You sure nobody from out of town
has been here?

764
01:00:38,407 --> 01:00:41,399
No. Oh, out of town.

765
01:00:41,487 --> 01:00:43,682
Yeah, John Heater
come up from Beach.

766
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:45,803
Had a party goin' huntin'
up Big Timber.

767
01:00:45,887 --> 01:00:49,641
- No strangers?
- No stranger than you.

768
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:29,563
- I gotta say this one time.
- Whas that?

769
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:33,366
You and Scarpa
take the car and drive.

770
01:01:33,447 --> 01:01:36,405
Leave me here with Marbles.
Is his fault anyway.

771
01:01:36,487 --> 01:01:40,480
Are you serious?
No, there's no way.

772
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:43,240
Is not even a choice.

773
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:46,763
Matty, I'm not just talking
about this little field trip.

774
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:49,600
I'm talking about all of it.

775
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:54,881
You had it right
in the first place.

776
01:01:54,967 --> 01:01:58,596
Looking for a regular job,
being a citizen.

777
01:01:58,687 --> 01:02:01,281
I tried it, man.

778
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:05,476
Is the only thing left now.

779
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,683
You don't want a piece of this.

780
01:02:09,367 --> 01:02:11,835
Matty, for ninety-nine guys
out of a hundred...

781
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:15,522
this is lose-lose.

782
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:18,883
Is not like the way
it was thirty years ago.

783
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:20,844
Is not like the stories
your uncle was telling us...

784
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,326
when we were growing up.

785
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:26,685
Now is either a bullet
in the back of your head...

786
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:29,156
or jail for life.

787
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:36,439
Just snap it back in there.

788
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:51,476
So you know all this, but I
don't see you trying to get out.

789
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:56,595
I said you. Come on,
we're talking about you, here.

790
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:12,962
Sorry I got you into this,
Taylor.

791
01:03:13,047 --> 01:03:15,163
Is just more
of the same for me.

792
01:03:15,247 --> 01:03:18,876
Just more of the same.

793
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:58,755
You fellas are on a real
busman's holiday, aren't ya?

794
01:03:58,847 --> 01:04:00,200
Hey, look at you.

795
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:04,326
You roll into town with
more guys than Sinatra, right?

796
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,003
Teddy, I just want you to know
how truly sorry I am.

797
01:04:08,087 --> 01:04:09,759
I know I fucked this up
right from the get...

798
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:11,997
but I'm gonna do everything
I can to make it right.

799
01:04:13,447 --> 01:04:16,484
Marbles, that voice
is cutting right through me.

800
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:19,798
You are unlikable.
If it wasn't for Matty...

801
01:04:19,887 --> 01:04:22,003
I'd love to kill you right now.

802
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:25,363
As it is, I'd like to kick you
through the uprights...

803
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:27,915
like a fuckin' field goal.

804
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,676
So, where are we at?

805
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:39,443
We've had a wrinkle.

806
01:04:45,607 --> 01:04:49,122
- Cops are involved.
- Dirty fuckin' cops.

807
01:04:49,207 --> 01:04:52,916
Yeah, he said cops.
They give you that makeover?

808
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:58,163
They do nice work.

809
01:04:58,247 --> 01:05:00,886
- You want to talk inside?
- No. We're not gonna talk here.

810
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:04,323
We'll go over the state line
into North Dakota.

811
01:05:04,407 --> 01:05:08,241
If anybody's lookin', we don't
want 'em to find us yet.

812
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:11,802
Sheriff Decker's a lifer.

813
01:05:11,887 --> 01:05:13,923
Came from the military,
highly decorated.

814
01:05:14,007 --> 01:05:18,444
Been in office eighteen years.
The man controls the town.

815
01:05:18,527 --> 01:05:20,438
Good. A man
used to running things...

816
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:22,518
gonna think he can run us, too.

817
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:29,559
Marbles, pay the check.

818
01:05:29,647 --> 01:05:31,365
Matty, you ride with me.

819
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:46,926
I gotta ask you something.

820
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,998
None of my guys
would even be here...

821
01:05:49,087 --> 01:05:51,521
if they weren't trying
to help me out.

822
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:54,201
They shouldn't suffer for that,
you know?

823
01:05:54,287 --> 01:05:56,403
If we get that money back...

824
01:05:56,487 --> 01:05:58,284
nothin' happens to Marbles,
all right?

825
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:02,157
Used to be there was a way
to do things...

826
01:06:02,247 --> 01:06:03,362
and things got done.

827
01:06:03,447 --> 01:06:06,120
No room for whining,
no room for mistakes.

828
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:10,246
Now, everybody's feelings
are involved.

829
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:13,364
A guy steps wrong now, he ends
up on the witness stand...

830
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:16,280
or on the fuckin'
Barbara Walters.

831
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:22,878
But I'll tell you what, Matty.
Since you're askin'...

832
01:06:22,967 --> 01:06:25,435
I'll give you a one-time-only.

833
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:30,282
Nothing will happen
to your friend. OK?

834
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:34,641
Thanks.

835
01:06:36,807 --> 01:06:40,243
You know, this whole thing's
my fault, anyway.

836
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:43,603
I figured
I wasn't a kid anymore.

837
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:47,760
- I figured I was ready for this.
- Age got nothin' to do with it.

838
01:06:47,847 --> 01:06:49,883
You take Taylor,
you put him in that basement...

839
01:06:49,967 --> 01:06:52,686
it don't matter if he's
a toddler or 103 years old.

840
01:06:52,767 --> 01:06:57,079
He's gonna pull that trigger,
and you're not...

841
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:59,203
'cause you're not made that way.

842
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:08,599
And thas good, OK?
Don't get down on yourself...

843
01:07:08,687 --> 01:07:10,803
and the sheriff
will surface soon.

844
01:07:10,887 --> 01:07:12,684
We'll sort the thing out.

845
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:25,120
You might want to notch it
back there a notch.

846
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,401
We got work tonight.

847
01:07:28,807 --> 01:07:31,116
I don't know, man.
I'm not feelin' ready.

848
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:42,198
We ran a check. We know
who you are, Mr. Demaret.

849
01:07:42,287 --> 01:07:44,164
We're willing to deal.

850
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:46,397
Don't want guys like you
unhappy.

851
01:07:46,487 --> 01:07:49,206
Good.
So les get this done, then.

852
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:51,403
I'll come down.

853
01:07:51,487 --> 01:07:53,921
No, I don't want you
walking into my station again.

854
01:07:54,007 --> 01:07:57,124
We meet tonight.
I'm off duty at twelve.

855
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:59,277
Brickman's Meats.
Is past the tracks.

856
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,723
- So why not now?
- I'll say when.

857
01:08:02,807 --> 01:08:04,877
Bring your friends
if you're worried.

858
01:08:04,967 --> 01:08:06,764
I'll tell you what.
I don't like the sound of this.

859
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:08,758
If you want to see
your money again...

860
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:11,122
thas where is gonna be.

861
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:15,119
You're not talkin' about
leavin' are ya?

862
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:16,720
I am.

863
01:08:18,287 --> 01:08:20,926
I think you should
come with me, cuz.

864
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:22,804
Matty needs us.

865
01:08:22,887 --> 01:08:25,606
Matty's got
all the backup he needs.

866
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:28,565
Bus rolls by the interstate
and goes to Billings at 11: 15.

867
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:30,638
I booked us a room
at the Sheraton...

868
01:08:30,727 --> 01:08:32,365
back in New York
by tomorrow morning.

869
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:34,324
My father works things out
with Benny Chains...

870
01:08:34,407 --> 01:08:37,683
six months from now,
nobody's gonna remember a thing.

871
01:08:41,727 --> 01:08:44,321
No chance. No fuckin' way.

872
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:46,125
You're my first cousin...

873
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,767
and I have
a responsibility to you.

874
01:08:48,847 --> 01:08:54,683
This whole thing is my fault.
Is my doing and I'm sticking.

875
01:08:56,847 --> 01:08:59,236
If you gotta go, you go.

876
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:24,076
All right, les go in and see
how we set this thing up.

877
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,361
That makes it twenty.

878
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,677
- How about a check?
- I go to cash it...

879
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,917
you cancel it the minute
I walk out of town? Nah.

880
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:39,567
- Borrow it from your friend.
- Hey...

881
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:42,684
Mr. New York mile-a-minute,
why don't you shut your mouth?

882
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:45,520
You're makin' my ears hurt.

883
01:09:45,607 --> 01:09:47,245
Thall be enough of that,
fellas.

884
01:09:47,327 --> 01:09:51,286
- Go on and have a drink.
- Ain't none of your business.

885
01:09:56,327 --> 01:09:59,285
You don't want me
to make it my business, huh?

886
01:10:02,607 --> 01:10:04,040
Believe me.

887
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,395
Come on.

888
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,158
Can you imagine
these hillbilly bastards...

889
01:10:20,247 --> 01:10:21,521
tryin' to be tough guys?

890
01:10:21,607 --> 01:10:25,395
Fuckin' great. Great to see
you guys throwin' in like that.

891
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,557
I mean, I didn't expect
to see you so early.

892
01:10:27,647 --> 01:10:29,239
I thought we were
gonna meet later...

893
01:10:29,327 --> 01:10:32,478
but still, you guys were
like the goddamn cavalry.

894
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:34,046
Where's Scarpa?

895
01:10:34,127 --> 01:10:36,322
He stepped out.
Why? Whas goin' on?

896
01:10:41,647 --> 01:10:43,205
Where's your fucking cousin?

897
01:10:43,287 --> 01:10:46,040
Wait. Matty said
nothing would happen to me.

898
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:51,124
- Check with Teddy.
- Who do you think sent us?

899
01:10:56,207 --> 01:10:59,404
Come on. Where's Scarpa?

900
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:00,715
I don't know.

901
01:11:00,807 --> 01:11:03,002
This is no time
for bean shootin'.

902
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:09,359
- Maybe he's at the hotel?
- We were at the hotel, Marbles.

903
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:22,526
Well, then, I don't know
where the fuck he is.

904
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:34,556
Well, I guess
is just you, then.

905
01:12:28,487 --> 01:12:31,638
Believe this?

906
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,638
Is almost time.

907
01:12:33,727 --> 01:12:37,276
I'm telling you, Marbles
and Scarpa are bailin' on us.

908
01:12:37,367 --> 01:12:40,518
Thas about the only thing
you can count on in this life.

909
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:48,482
There's nobody wouldn't hurt you
if it helped them.

910
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:50,444
Yeah, well, I know that now.

911
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:55,477
You ready? Les go.

912
01:14:19,767 --> 01:14:21,837
Shouldn't be long now, Donnie.

913
01:14:39,127 --> 01:14:41,880
We just walk right into it.

914
01:14:41,967 --> 01:14:44,003
Keep this guy talkin',
all right?

915
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:50,119
Turn off the part of your brain
that thinks. Just react.

916
01:14:50,207 --> 01:14:52,641
Is gonna be a lot louder
than you can fuckin' believe...

917
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:54,718
and you might not hit a thing.

918
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:12,325
Come on. Over there.

919
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:19,116
So, where are
the other two clowns?

920
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:21,596
Where the fuck is my money?

921
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,962
No, we want to see
the other two.

922
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:28,720
Come to think of it,
we can find them later.

923
01:15:28,807 --> 01:15:31,924
Slow down, Farmer Brown.

924
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:34,567
Jim, don't point
a fucking gun at me.

925
01:15:34,647 --> 01:15:37,115
- Fuck! I knew it!
- Shut up.

926
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,764
I know you thought this was
a manageable situation...

927
01:15:42,847 --> 01:15:45,122
but some situations
are unmanageable.

928
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:48,244
Now, is a dumb shit like you...

929
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:50,716
at least smart enough
to bring the money?

930
01:16:06,967 --> 01:16:09,117
Hey, arsehole!

931
01:16:09,207 --> 01:16:11,163
Put 'em down.

932
01:16:12,807 --> 01:16:16,038
Put the guns down!

933
01:16:17,127 --> 01:16:18,958
What the fuck is he doin' here?

934
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:22,643
Well, is like this, Don.

935
01:16:22,727 --> 01:16:24,718
There's a lot of money
in the bag.

936
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:28,041
Holy shit!

937
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:31,647
- Chris.
- Holy shit.

938
01:16:31,727 --> 01:16:35,117
- I thought you'd left us.
- No, I had to come back.

939
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:42,878
Where's Marbles?

940
01:16:42,967 --> 01:16:44,639
What?
I thought he left with you.

941
01:16:44,727 --> 01:16:46,922
No.
He said he wouldn't leave.

942
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:47,716
Les see what we got here.

943
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:53,086
It was you.

944
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:56,239
- You came out here to do this.
- I know what I told you, kid...

945
01:17:56,327 --> 01:17:58,682
but nobody fucks up
like your friends did here...

946
01:17:58,767 --> 01:18:01,122
and comes out of it clean. No.

947
01:18:01,207 --> 01:18:04,836
Bullshit. You came out here
to take that money.

948
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:15,486
There were never any shortages.
You're the one who's been...

949
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:18,286
robbing from my father,
you son of a bitch.

950
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,959
Matty, is not like that.

951
01:18:20,047 --> 01:18:22,356
Stop fuckin' tellin' me
how it is, Teddy.

952
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:25,757
My whole life,
you been tellin' me how it is.

953
01:18:25,847 --> 01:18:28,725
You've been lying to me.

954
01:18:28,807 --> 01:18:31,037
You put me in that basement
with Bobby Boulevard...

955
01:18:31,127 --> 01:18:33,118
'cause you knew
it would break me.

956
01:18:35,607 --> 01:18:37,882
You came here tonight
to kill me.

957
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:43,043
Tell me I'm wrong.

958
01:18:43,127 --> 01:18:47,120
Go ahead. Tell me I'm wrong
about any of it.

959
01:18:48,927 --> 01:18:51,282
What the fuck
do you want to know?

960
01:18:51,367 --> 01:18:54,279
I did what I did.

961
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:57,283
Walkin' off
that handball court...

962
01:18:57,367 --> 01:19:01,280
dumping game after game
to your fucking old man.

963
01:19:02,767 --> 01:19:05,281
Can I tell you,
I could beat his arse...

964
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:09,485
carrying a lawn chair
in my left hand...

965
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:13,082
so, yeah, now I'm takin' mine.

966
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:18,845
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?

967
01:19:21,127 --> 01:19:25,439
What are you gonna do, Matty?
You gonna shoot me?

968
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,438
You're not gonna shoot me.

969
01:19:32,087 --> 01:19:35,796
I got shoes
older than you, kid...

970
01:19:35,887 --> 01:19:37,366
and tougher, too.

971
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:16,481
Taylor?

972
01:21:14,767 --> 01:21:16,120
There it is.

973
01:21:16,207 --> 01:21:17,879
Good.

974
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:21,755
This'll finally get me out of
the shit that Teddy put me into.

975
01:21:21,847 --> 01:21:24,156
Yeah, thas good.

976
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:28,399
Look,
I know I was wrong about you.

977
01:21:35,007 --> 01:21:40,764
Matty,
you can come in with me now.

978
01:21:44,607 --> 01:21:49,362
You know, there was a time
I really wanted to hear that.

979
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:53,406
Ever since I was a kid,
I've been tryin' to live up...

980
01:21:53,487 --> 01:21:57,082
to what I thought
you wanted me to be.

981
01:21:57,167 --> 01:22:02,082
I fucked up my whole life
for it... for you.

982
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:05,204
Matty, I thought
it was what you wanted.

983
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,925
I never wanted you
in this thing.

984
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:10,238
Thas what you said, but you
know the truth, same as I do.

985
01:22:10,327 --> 01:22:14,286
You never once looked at me
like I was a man.

986
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:19,282
You never would have, either,
if I hadn't have done this.

987
01:22:20,887 --> 01:22:22,843
I'm out.

988
01:22:29,327 --> 01:22:31,238
I'll see ya, Pop.

989
01:22:50,087 --> 01:22:52,203
You told him?

990
01:22:52,287 --> 01:22:55,802
Yeah, I did.

991
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:59,800
Good.
You're finally done with it.

992
01:23:01,087 --> 01:23:02,998
Done with this, too.

993
01:23:06,287 --> 01:23:08,164
- What now?
- Now?

994
01:23:08,247 --> 01:23:09,965
Now we get the hell outta here.

995
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:54,700
