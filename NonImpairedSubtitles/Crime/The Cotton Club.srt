1
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,097
She told you that?

2
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,616
Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I think you're right.

3
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,415
How do you like this?
- He's not bad for a white kid.

4
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,614
It's too much, I want to fall in love!
- You got a tin ear!

5
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,176
I want to listen to him. He's good.

6
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,258
You got everything you need?
- We got it all.

7
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,134
He's in the Bamville.
You can't miss him.

8
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,890
We won't miss him.
- Blow that bughouse bastard away!

9
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,659
That kid can play.

10
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,018
Hey, girls, join us over there!
- What?

11
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,612
Come to a table with nice people.
Come on over and say hello to Dutch!

12
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,379
Bumpy is here, too.

13
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,459
Stop breaking my heart!

14
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,779
Come over here! Nice trumpet.
I thought you were black.

15
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,930
There's four guys, we all strike out,
am I right? - He's cute.

16
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,053
That trumpet duel was great,
but you beat him bad.

17
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,049
You ought to be put in jail.
He puts riffs in from King Oliver!

18
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,173
I once lost a grand
on a horse named Gideon's Trumpet.

19
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,292
Your name Gideon?
- No.

20
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,813
Abbadabba, this man's a musician.
- Hey, girls!

21
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,779
Forget it!

22
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,175
What are you all alone for?
Give me a chance to dazzle you!

23
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,417
I knew it! Come on!

24
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,569
Look at this! The kid's got
the Midas touch with the broads!

25
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,931
What am I going to sit on?

26
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,019
Don't sit on
the best part of your personality.

27
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,455
What a rude man!
- Let me guess. Veronica? Alice?

28
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,095
Am I right?
- Forget it.

29
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,418
I'm not close? Well, what's your name?

30
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,853
Would you believe Myrtle?
- You're named Myrtle?

31
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,929
What's your name?
- Forget it! Vera.

32
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,974
Cicero. Like in Latin.
Did you ever study Latin?

33
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,615
I was an altar boy.

34
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,456
He was an altar boy!
- It figures. - I believe him.

35
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,777
It's a lovely tie.
- Thank you.

36
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,340
You going with anybody? - Do you see
a ring? - Why are they here?

37
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,095
The little men in blue.
You wanted by the police, Miss Cicero?

38
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,693
We're very good tonight, fellas.
- Watch out!

39
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,294
You bastard!

40
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,779
Solly, go after them!

41
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,733
You bastard!

42
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,418
What the hell is this?
- Some people don't like me.

43
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,293
Who are you anyway?

44
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,016
I'm your Dutch uncle from now on.

45
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,133
I owe you one. Dutch Schultz owes you.

46
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,332
Abbadabba, you alright?
- Yeah.

47
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,013
I'm in heaven!

48
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,769
Get up!
- Pow!

49
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,290
Do they do that here every night?

50
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,570
I'm very swoozled.

51
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,176
Help me!
- Which room is your room?

52
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,450
I'm a liitle kaflooie, you know?

53
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,375
Should I put you in bed, too.

54
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,975
Oh no!

55
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,373
Pull your arm out!

56
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,095
See, that wasn't very hard.

57
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,415
Come on!

58
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,019
There!

59
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,572
I really like how
you play the trumpet. Like Gabriel!

60
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,970
It's a cornet.
Gabriel plays the sax. Are you okay?

61
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,212
Whatever it is, don't go home with it.
Stay with me.

62
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,015
Just for the night. Please.

63
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,610
My ears are ringing.

64
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,012
What a night!

65
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,936
I was there with the Dutchman.

66
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,055
It says you saw the bomb coming.
- Yeah, so I saved Dutch's ass.

67
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,218
You saved his ass?

68
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,174
Let me take care of that.

69
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,372
Joe, you want to pick this up?

70
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,288
Since when you got money?
- I did a couple of jobs.

71
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,413
Coffee, home fries, eggs...

72
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,170
Saving Dutch Schultz's ass!
The Dwyer brothers are in.

73
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,418
In?
- Popke, come with us.

74
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,818
Wait up, Vince!
You're some bigtime hero, Dixie!

75
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,299
The Dutchman's telling everybody.
- I got the rakes on the Dutchman!

76
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,495
Vinnie, what the hell is this?
You wanna work for a bootlegger?

77
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,657
You don't kill a fly on Ma's plate!
- Did I get it?

78
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,570
I didn't get him.
- Something is wrong with you.

79
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,294
Behave yourselves.

80
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,536
You ready for the contest?
- Yeah. - Let me see your set.

81
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,258
It's awful and I hate it.
- Oh, you love it!

82
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,488
That's why you'll win.
- Let me see something.

83
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,376
Done quietly!
- Right. - Thank you.

84
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,412
You're dragging!
The master must try it.

85
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,259
Master of what?

86
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,691
Look, Mama! - You gotta do it
pretty to get into the Cotton Club.

87
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,612
Quietly, Mother.

88
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,819
That's
gonna get you to the Cotton Club!

89
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,608
The Cotton Club...
- No new steps...

90
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,620
Too important today.
- Today's audition gotta be stronger!

91
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,575
Stronger?
- You can't fool the Cotton Club!

92
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,569
You start giving white people
what they want,

93
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,410
soon you got no blood left.
- What are we doing?

94
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,330
First rhythm, then social?
- No, save it till later.

95
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,216
I wanna get it out of the way.
- Hello, Dixie!

96
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,697
Where'd you get this money?
- I do business.

97
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,018
You do business?
- I'm like Jesse James.

98
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,530
You work with Jesse? Who's this kid?

99
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,050
Ed Popke.
- A sad case.

100
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,968
I got some big news
that I didn't tell you yet.

101
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,650
What?
- Big news!

102
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,898
I suddenly got married!
- What?

103
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,490
I got married!

104
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,979
You tell me you want a job with Dutch
but don't mention you got hitched?

105
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,492
Where are you going?
- Inside.

106
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,250
We want to be alone,
with just the family, alright?

107
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,609
This is her! Patsy, my brother.
- Congratulations!

108
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,212
Don't congratulate the bride,
congratulate the groom.

109
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,770
One, two, three...
- On your tippytoes!

110
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,859
One, two, three, now turn...

111
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,613
One, two, three...

112
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,012
Would you put some clothes on!
I've told her about that!

113
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,133
I know, but there's
a rat in the house!

114
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,016
Tail this big! It's behind
the curtain, wanna take a look?

115
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,416
It's behind the curtain.

116
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,739
You were in town all day yesterday
and you didn't call me once!

117
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,614
This one goes up, that one goes up,
around my neck in a hug!

118
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,889
Oh, Mom with the dancing feet!
- He saved Dutch Schultz's life, Mom!

119
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,137
Why?
- I didn't know who it was.

120
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,937
He is an absolutely awful man.
Patsy, put some clothes on!

121
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,250
I did!
- Leave the cat alone!

122
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,928
See you next week.
- Want me to take your jacket?

123
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,449
Thanks.

124
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,179
I want you to tell your mother
everything you learned.

125
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,454
One, two, now turn...
Tell your mother.

126
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,096
How did your dancing audition go?
- They loved us.

127
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,849
Think you'll work at the Cotton Club?
- Nah.

128
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,339
You're waiting till the big time, huh?
- We'll see.

129
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,456
He's showing off again.
- He's got a lot to show off!

130
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,413
Good luck, boys!

131
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,176
Where you going?
- Excuse me!

132
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,059
Excuse me, I'm having a heart attack!

133
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,618
You look kinda sick, I think.
- Please, Miss, I'm...

134
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,409
She pushed you over the cliff!
- I'm gonna climb back up!

135
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,973
I'll see you later, man.
- So long, Holmes.

136
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,609
Mr. Stark!

137
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,335
I'm just excited
about the audition and wanted

138
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,375
to find out how we did.
- Everybody liked you.

139
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,573
I'm gonna put you in the next show.

140
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,614
We're in the next show?
- You're in the next show.

141
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,575
Thank you! Listen,

142
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,772
you white folks are so smart.

143
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,612
Ladies and gentleman...
- Much smoother! Now, pivot.

144
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,690
...the Cotton Club girls!
- You're in the wrong spot!

145
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,619
Sorry, Miss Webb.

146
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,890
What's your name?
- Get out of here!

147
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,173
What are you doing here?
- I just spoke with Mr. Stark...

148
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,895
I don't care, you belong to me.

149
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,289
You don't use that front door,
use the back door. Don't do it again!

150
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,852
Are you Dixie Dwyer?
- Yeah, that's right.

151
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,609
The Dutchman wants to put you to work.

152
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,935
He says you play the piano, too?
- I play a little piano.

153
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,338
He wants you to play a little party.
- Party? How much?

154
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,974
150.

155
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,779
150? When?
- Right now.

156
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,698
What do they call ya?
- Nobody calls me nothing.

157
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,893
Not even your mother?
- I didn't have a mother.

158
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,690
They found me in a garbage pail.

159
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,613
How you doing?
- Sol. What's in the bugle case?

160
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,413
Bugle.

161
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,330
What kind of party is this?
- You've never been to one like this.

162
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,819
Maybe I don't want to go to one like
this. - You do want to go.

163
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,608
Wait here.

164
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,257
Don't screw up!
Keep an eye on the boss. Hello!

165
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,728
The cornet player.
I don't believe it, you made it.

166
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,537
What the hell is this?
- Pow! Bugle boy, meet Jesse James.

167
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,413
What are you doing here?

168
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,614
I went up to Dutch and got a job.
You saved his ass, he saved mine.

169
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,972
You asked him for a job?
- Yeah, I said, "I'm begging."

170
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,615
What about you?
- I'm with Vinnie.

171
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,057
I made it.
- I got your brother on my payroll.

172
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,855
He told me about it.
- We got too many Jews here.

173
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,018
We need some Irishmen.
- Since when?

174
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,975
Not too many!
- I love these tough micks. Wardrobe.

175
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,571
Did you bring your horn?
- Here is the first of the money.

176
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,979
My horn?
I thought you wanted my piano!

177
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,332
You can't work for Dutch
and walk around like this, alright?

178
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,816
What do you want to hear?
- Listen,

179
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,730
I got a lot of things to do.
I got this girl coming...

180
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,934
She sings. She's got her own music.

181
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,853
You read music, right?
- Yeah, I read it. I write it.

182
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,733
I play it.

183
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,299
I sleep with it, too.
- Play for her, don't sleep with her.

184
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,209
Lucky Boy, relax. I like you.

185
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,575
I'm looking for Mr. Schultz. Do you
know him? - Everybody knows him.

186
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,693
Do you work for him?
- I work for myself.

187
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,735
My name is Owney Madden. And you?
- You're Owney Madden?

188
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,496
You're very famous.

189
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,012
I'm Vera Cicero.
You own the Cotton Club, right?

190
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,416
I own a lot of things, Miss Cicero.

191
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,409
He's in the next room.
- Thank you.

192
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,610
Right this way, Mr. Flynn.

193
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,412
Thank you, Mr. Flynn.

194
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,889
Wanna lighten up a bit, doll?

195
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,333
Your accompaniment...

196
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,418
A piano player.

197
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,170
The little girl.
- The altar boy.

198
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,578
Schultzie, we gotta talk.
We're having a party time.

199
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,212
It's time, Dutch.

200
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,619
Let's get at it.
- Fine, we're set up down the hall.

201
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,015
What about you?
- I sing, tell a few jokes.

202
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,134
Tell me a joke then.

203
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,848
Hello, Sucker.

204
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,178
Dammit!
Shut the fuck up! Shut up...

205
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,169
You had the bomb dropped!
- What's the point?

206
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,498
Shut up!
- It's bullshit!

207
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,455
I'm telling you! You, too!
- Shit!

208
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,895
Now we heard it all now!
That's the end of it.

209
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,617
There's plenty of money in Harlem
for everybody. It's getting hotter.

210
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,173
You start this war here and you
got a brand new enemy... me.

211
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,375
And me.

212
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,618
You're here because you both agreed
to this truce. And it is a truce.

213
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,936
Tomorrow is a business day. Clear?

214
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,619
Is it clear?

215
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,009
Then shake hands!

216
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,610
Shake fucking hands!

217
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,416
In the next room, gentlemen,

218
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,250
is the best food, drink and pussy
available at any rice in New York.

219
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,489
I suggest you take a sample
of these things. And try to remember

220
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,616
this is why we work so hard.
To live like kings!

221
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,253
Get out of here!

222
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,299
So you finished the funny business?

223
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,335
I shook his hand.
I should have cut it off.

224
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,613
Calm down, you'll overheat.

225
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,217
You two getting along?
- We're making contact.

226
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,296
You look like a beautiful doll.
You know that tune?

227
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,049
"Beautiful Doll?" Yeah.
- Play it!

228
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,014
Go ahead.

229
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,616
Yeah, sure.

230
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,699
How you doing?

231
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,089
Anything you want.
Anything, just ask me for it.

232
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,609
I want to own my own nightclub.

233
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,491
We'll have a little peace and quiet.
- Come on. Hey, Monk!

234
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,615
Let those two kids in.
- Okay, go ahead.

235
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,935
Nobody else right now.
- Help yourselves!

236
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,338
It was good, bringing you guys
together. - We got a little

237
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,453
territory settled.
We ain't together.

238
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,938
You sound like an Irish pig!
- Alright, alright!

239
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,450
You wanna go right now?

240
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,573
Stop it!
- I'll break your fascist face!

241
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,693
...pretty well.
- Owney's got that diplomat...

242
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,050
...Guaranteed.

243
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,936
If Owney was in Washington,
we wouldn't have this shit in Europe.

244
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,769
I like keeping the fucking
Jew boys where they belong.

245
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,973
Them and the niggers,
then we're alright.

246
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,935
Jew's just a jig turned inside out.
- That's enough.

247
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,773
Son of a bitch!

248
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,330
Alright, Dutch, that's enough.

249
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,412
Yeah, that's enough.

250
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,490
Somebody ought to cut out
your brain and pickle it.

251
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,214
You are a crazy son of a bitch!
- I'm sorry.

252
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,015
Fuckin' sorry as a human being!
- Hey, kid!

253
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,338
Can you drive?
- Yeah. - Then take your friend

254
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,568
someplace quiet, away from here.
Take the lady with you. Go!

255
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,056
And fast!
- Get it out!

256
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,889
Look, I don't want you to get lost.
I need to know where you are.

257
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,614
Say, kid!

258
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,095
Come here!

259
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,377
Don't you worry about it.
I got the fix on stuff like this.

260
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,613
Whatever you say, Dutch.
- Alright.

261
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,099
Just right up over there.

262
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,009
I'll see you.

263
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,852
Don't go anyplace.
I wanna know where both of you are.

264
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,658
I need to eat something.

265
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,454
Did I say the wrong thing?

266
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,336
You don't feel for Mr. Flynn?

267
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,490
Mr. Flynn was a bootlegger.
That's how they live. Wise up, sap!

268
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,733
Why not come inside?

269
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,619
Not this time.

270
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,059
You don't belong to me.
You're Dutch's property.

271
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,211
Hi, Joey.
- What's new?

272
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,890
What'cha doing?

273
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,059
Call is 15 minutes to places!

274
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,498
Mr. Stark,
we're the Williams brothers.

275
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,536
The Williams!
- Oh, the Williams brothers.

276
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,256
Charlie, show them their
dressing rooms. - Thank you.

277
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,289
We're here!
- Welcome to the Cotton Club.

278
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,935
You come in right here with the vocal.
- All the way up...

279
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,937
That's Duke Ellington!

280
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,816
Put up the wing.

281
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:04,294
Hiya, Dixie. This your family?
- Showing the newlyweds a good time!

282
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,495
Some of the best musicians
in the world play here.

283
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,932
...all this money!
- Good thing niggers ain't allowed!

284
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,249
They can't get into their own club?
- Owney Madden owns this club.

285
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,091
May I take your coats?
- Wait till you see this!

286
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,616
Look at the rump on that baby!
Hey, baby, come over here!

287
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,172
Vinnie, come on!

288
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,578
These are the times
that try men's souls.

289
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,219
Is this the best table in the house?
- The best for you, my friend.

290
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,096
You ain't no friend of mine!
- Sit down, watch the show!

291
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,413
I know that man, Owney Madden.
- Where?

292
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,138
Right over there.
He backs a lot of Broadway shows.

293
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,970
They call him "Mr. Broadway."
I wonder if he remembers me.

294
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,615
Where you going?
- Hey, Ma, wait!

295
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,615
Mr. Madden?

296
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,414
Owen.

297
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,614
Well, well!

298
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,294
A pleasure to see you again.
- My son Michael. He plays cornet.

299
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,415
I think you should hire him.
- It's my mother, she loves me.

300
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,411
Don't you already have a job?

301
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,613
I play here and there. Nothing steady.

302
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,413
You gotta be careful
who you play piano for.

303
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,976
Alright, come around and see me.

304
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,211
Maybe sometime soon.
Thanks, Mr. Madden.

305
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,015
What do you think of this Dwyer kid?

306
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,017
I'm not impressed.
- Do you trust him?

307
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,858
Dutch seems to.
- Ahhh.

308
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,576
Dutch relies on fear.
It's loyalty we need.

309
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,931
I'm thinking about the coast.

310
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,372
The kid looks good. Talks pretty.

311
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,330
I don't trust no one with a nickname.

312
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,896
What about your nickname, Frenchy?
- That's different.

313
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,410
Why?
- I'm trustworthy.

314
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,818
Oh, yeah.
What would I do without ya?

315
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,010
I'm always watching you, Williams.

316
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,777
Nice place!
How come you never brought me here?

317
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,257
The Cotton Club?
Frances, I almost never come here.

318
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,659
Nice to see you again, Mr. Schultz.
- Really, I don't come here much.

319
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,376
Hey, Dutch!
- Do you ever tell anyone the truth?

320
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,658
The Dutchman just come in.

321
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,934
Bring him up to the coop, right?

322
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,018
I bet you could do that?

323
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,333
Do that little thing
with your tongue. Come on!

324
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,209
Compliments of the house!
- That Owney!

325
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,448
You gonna pop the cork?
50 bucks if you hit the ceiling!

326
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,939
Hello Dutch...
- Oh, hello! - How've you been?

327
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,132
Have a cigar.
- Take a walk.

328
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,418
They read your name in the papers,
they think they know you.

329
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,852
Give me a light.
- Anything you need, Dutch?

330
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,135
Yeah, why don't you bring me the moon!
- It's up on the roof.

331
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,414
Owen would like
to show you his pigeons up there.

332
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,458
Owney and his pigeons.

333
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:12,451
I'll be right back. Enjoy yourself!
- Could you leave somebody with me?

334
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,413
Yeah. Sol, come here.

335
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,610
Now you're gonna have
a good time, so just relax.

336
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,413
Follow me.

337
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,613
What's with the pet pigeons?
I used to catch 'em and cook 'em.

338
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,937
Don't tell that to Owen.

339
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,689
I haven't been able
to eat or sleep for days. You okay?

340
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,370
Oh, you shouldn't fall so soon.

341
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,290
All I want to do is marry you,
take you away from this. - Away?

342
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,049
I practically just got here.
- Me, too.

343
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,618
Look, let's never be separated.
- Can I do this number?

344
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,857
What are you doing here?
- He likes to look at me.

345
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,610
He says if his wife leaves early
he wants to see me.

346
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,493
He wants to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

347
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,410
I don't want to talk to him!
My family's over here tonight.

348
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,570
Do yourself a favor. Don't rile him.
You know how he gets.

349
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,729
I don't want any part of him.
- He can get you anything you need.

350
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,608
Beautiful one.

351
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,450
I was gonna leave it to you
what the restitution would be.

352
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,257
Then I realized, you're such a cheap
son of a bitch, you probably

353
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,056
wouldn't satisfy
my sense of right or wrong.

354
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,857
What I want is
either 25,000 in cash now,

355
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,530
on the table,

356
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,691
or 10,000 a month
for the next four months.

357
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,418
The first offer is a bargain.
I know you love a bargain.

358
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,609
That's fair. I heard.

359
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,418
25.

360
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,095
Sometimes you're a big man, Dutch.

361
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,010
You know how I got that big?
- How?

362
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,371
I ate a pigeon every day.

363
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,617
Did'ya see Dixie here?

364
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,454
300 a week.
- I thought you said 200.

365
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,619
I could say 50 and you'd take it.

366
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,530
Dutch, I appreciate it,
but guns, knives, bombs...

367
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,973
That's not my life. I play music.
- I'm telling you

368
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,810
you got a job.
You got it? All I want you to do

369
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,936
is to take Vera around. She can't
stand Abbadabba, but she likes you.

370
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,459
If I didn't like you,
you'd be dead. Do you understand that?

371
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,497
Sure I understand.
It's nice to be liked.

372
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,297
I gotta see you after the show.
- No.

373
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,617
Tomorrow!
- No.

374
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,655
You gotta!
- Alright, I'll tell you what.

375
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,695
I have a meeting at ten at the
Abyssinian Church. Meet me there.

376
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,339
I'm new. I'm trying to meet people.
- Watch your act, nigger!

377
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,577
You don't handle the merchandise.

378
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,208
There's Gloria Swanson!

379
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,009
You're my biggest star!

380
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,856
You are a very beautiful person.

381
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,936
You're more beautiful than I am.
- You have a chance to be in pictures.

382
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,769
You are gorgeous.

383
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,736
Well, I can't miss, can I?
- Call me at the studio. Monday.

384
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,008
Monday.
- Yes. Goodbye.

385
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,455
That was Gloria Swanson.
- Right here she said it.

386
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,178
Gloria Swanson says I'm gorgeous
and I should have a big future.

387
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,297
Hey, kid.

388
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,536
Good show. See you tomorrow.

389
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,972
Not tonight.
- I don't take "no" for an answer.

390
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,777
You have to this time.
I've got a private life, you know.

391
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,176
The only trouble with the nigger
numbers racket is the risk. I like

392
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,692
things you can fix,
like a horse race. Or a politician.

393
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,779
I think I can fix the number.
- What, you kidding me?

394
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,176
What have you been drinking? Dixie!

395
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,932
Play that Beiderbecke tune for me.
And see if the piano player knows it.

396
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,012
Where do the numbers come from?
- You know "Singing the Blues?"

397
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,979
You take that thing everywhere?
- Dutchman likes the sound of my horn.

398
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,260
His master's voice.
- Look who's talking.

399
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,812
But I'm getting my own nightclub.

400
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,979
Think about it for a minute.

401
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,490
That number comes in the 7th race.

402
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:21,380
So I look at the payoff totals
from the first six races and...

403
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,256
What if I don't like the number?

404
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,294
I place last minute bets.

405
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,777
And that changes
the last number to what I want.

406
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,619
Any number!

407
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,731
And you can figure it in your head?

408
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,852
The one and only.

409
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,496
They're fixing the world with math.

410
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,570
You ever play the horses, Sol?
- When I was a kid I raced rats.

411
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:10,096
If you can do this, we can take over
the whole Harlem numbers racket!

412
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,289
The service is lousy here.
Why don't you get me a gin, darling?

413
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,650
You can own Harlem,
lock, stock, and barrel.

414
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,856
Bottoms up, Dutchess.

415
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,655
I'm really sorry about that.

416
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,414
I saw you spilling that drink.
You ain't clumsy. I didn't like it.

417
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,490
You ever do anything like that again,
I mess up your face. You hear me?

418
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,014
Yeah, yeah.
I won't spill any more drinks.

419
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,015
I want you to pick up my laundry.
It's at the Chink's.

420
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,609
Yeah.

421
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,091
What's up?
- Three bankers.

422
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,453
15,000 from 113th, 20,000 from 72nd,
and 21,000 from 150th Street.

423
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,495
Beautiful. You'll be the next boss!
- Come on.

424
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,409
Come on, get over there!
- One more time!

425
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,298
You still mad at me?
- I was never mad at you.

426
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:32,211
I just felt you should respect my
private life. - Let's get married now.

427
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:37,256
We could have lunch anytime!
- Dalbert, no chance.

428
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,170
I got too many things to do.
I want to make it.

429
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,737
Really make it. I want to do Broadway.

430
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:50,535
You want to do white show business.
- Isn't that what it is?

431
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,457
Wait a minute!
I can't just run out like this!

432
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,336
Wait a second here.
I like that you're taller than me.

433
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,695
Most men are intimidated.
- We're going to the top together!

434
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,017
Dalbert, wait!

435
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,015
Sugar, marry me!
- I'm already married.

436
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:23,248
You're the president of the club.
So you can perform the ceremony.

437
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,056
And I can't wait no longer.
- If you take this man

438
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,775
for your husband,
you're crazier than he is.

439
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,936
Sugar, would you...
- Plus, ain't no women allowed.

440
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,812
Why not no women?
- 'Cause this is the Hoofers Club!

441
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,018
Hoofers! I'll show you.
- This is going to be something.

442
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,894
This is what you do.
Give me a little music.

443
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,253
Heelology!

444
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,136
Don't be so mean!

445
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,093
To the floor!

446
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,772
I'm coming through!

447
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,450
Look out!

448
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,057
No, no!
- What? My brother...

449
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,418
He's doing it!

450
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,775
This is the way it goes!
One, two, three, four... now!

451
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,415
What is this? Where's the Duesenberg?

452
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,011
Where's Dutch?
- Dutch can't make it tonight.

453
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,619
I'm your escort.

454
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,608
I'll do anything for money, too.

455
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,370
Where we headed? Not the theater.
- We ain't going to the theater.

456
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,772
What is this, a kidnapping?

457
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,218
Would you like that?
I think I'm up to it.

458
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,460
I don't know why,
but you do move me.

459
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:24,658
In unusual places.

460
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,973
Where? Your appendix?

461
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,057
We'll sit at Dutch's table.

462
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,616
Go ahead, will you walk?

463
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,219
Keep moving!

464
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,211
Sit down!

465
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,608
Sit down!

466
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,618
Thank you.
- Thanks.

467
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,895
I never have figured you out.

468
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,256
That's funny. I know all about you.

469
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:15,336
I can imitate your walk.
The way you play your cornet.

470
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,490
Like how?

471
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,614
I know a few things about you, too.

472
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,968
Like what you look like making love.

473
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:34,660
When did you see that? - Ever since
I put you to bed that night.

474
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,131
The Golem has arrived.

475
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,293
He follows me everywhere.
- The Golem is in love.

476
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:59,370
Don't be ridiculous.
He just keeps tabs on me for Dutch.

477
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,698
Why do I feel
like I'm walking the dog or something?

478
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,608
I want to dance.
Let's dance for Dutch.

479
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,856
I used to dance for a living.
- No kidding?

480
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,019
I worked in tearooms when I was 18.

481
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,614
Tell me all about it.

482
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,731
These old ladies would pay me
to put my arms around them.

483
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,779
Waltz them off their feet.

484
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,896
Pay two bucks
in the afternoon. Plus tips.

485
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,617
More for the night work.

486
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,416
In private. If you could stand it!
- Could you?

487
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,655
Sure. Look at me tonight.

488
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,494
Dutch likes you to dance, huh?

489
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,855
Dance!

490
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,053
You dance for me! Get up!

491
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,093
Come on, you dance!

492
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,093
You wanna dance?
I'll dance with you, come on!

493
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,410
What makes you think...

494
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,452
That's enough!

495
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,617
I'll dance with you next time, Sol.

496
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:48,177
I just cracked my heel.
- I didn't mean to hurt you.

497
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,975
Yes, you did.
- No, I'm crazy about you.

498
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,493
You tell that to all the girls you
beat up. - I live here.

499
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,609
It belongs to my brother's wife.
She's about your size.

500
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,614
To anything!

501
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,930
To anything!

502
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,851
Is that you, Vincent?
- No, it's Michael.

503
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,258
It's okay, go back to bed.
- Goodnight, Michael.

504
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,609
Goodnight!

505
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,009
Michael?

506
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,213
Yeah, Michael.

507
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,420
Well, Michael, where do I change?

508
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,373
You feel like
you're on your honeymoon?

509
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,653
Honeymoons are never this dangerous.

510
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,614
If he came in here right now,
he'd kill us. - Forget about him.

511
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,379
Who?

512
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,810
I'm quitting the Dutchman.

513
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,459
I'm not running around for his
cigarettes while he strokes you.

514
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,616
I'm not waiting in the car...

515
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,258
while he does whatever he does to you.
- Whatever he does.

516
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,613
All I know is...
I'm getting away from that bastard!

517
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,771
You're a tough guy.

518
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,772
Some things you can't do.

519
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,975
You can't see a murder,
then come home,

520
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,490
fuck your friend, who loves you,

521
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,658
leave him, then go home,

522
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,172
and wake up
and have breakfast with a psychopath.

523
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,332
You can't do that, can you?

524
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,209
Yes.

525
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,620
Madden upstairs?
- Yeah, he's in.

526
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,332
How are ya?
- Alright, alright.

527
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,613
You says I should come see you.
- Oh, yeah...

528
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,817
You're seeing difficult times.

529
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,096
You noticed.

530
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:44,338
You got any ideas for me?
- If you was colored, we'd book you.

531
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,616
The great tragedy of my life.
- Listen...

532
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:56,456
I heard what
Gloria Swanson was saying about you.

533
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,368
A lot of my cash
goes to different places.

534
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,129
Some goes to Hollywood,
and to the studios and to movies.

535
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,732
You could front for us.

536
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:17,577
What do you mean?
- Be my face on the coast.

537
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,775
What about the Dutchman?

538
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,619
I'll keep him off your back.
Come and have some lunch.

539
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,739
Swell, Mr. Madden.

540
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,171
See you tonight!
- See you later!

541
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,135
I got a specialty act.
Remember that solo we talked about?

542
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,332
Can you do it tonight?
- Of course.

543
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,613
You're on right after the Duke.
- I'm there.

544
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,378
What's this about a solo?
- They asked me to do a solo.

545
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:53,416
They asked you? You didn't ask them?
- I talked to them.

546
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:55,735
Clay...

547
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,175
Look, it's a step up, man!
It's good for both of us.

548
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,498
Don't give me trouble. Shake my hand.

549
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,613
Shake your hand?
I ought to spit in your hand!

550
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,895
How could you? I'm your brother!

551
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,451
How could you go behind my back?

552
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,210
You want a solo? You got one!

553
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:19,458
On stage and off!

554
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,216
Your brother wants to see you.

555
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,298
See you later, Vinnie.

556
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,411
What's the urgency?

557
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,298
I gotta go to a doctor.
- For what? You okay?

558
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:01,450
I got a small graze.
Can't go to a hospital I know.

559
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,334
'Cause they'll find out.
- Jesus Christ, kid!

560
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,735
What?

561
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,410
What happened?
- It's just a graze.

562
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,052
A graze from what?
- I was fighting niggers.

563
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,614
The niggers, Harlem niggers.

564
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,614
Why?

565
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:25,609
Look at me. Why do you think?

566
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,376
I should kick the shit out of you.
What are you doing fighting coloreds?

567
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,608
Who do you work for?
What's the matter, Dix?

568
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,090
Do I look like a boss in this suit?

569
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,216
Keep two thugs behind you and you do.
- I want them to notice the suit!

570
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:51,857
Spill a little gravy
like you always do, they'll notice it.

571
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,370
You know, Dixie took a screen test.

572
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:01,574
What's a screen test?
- They shot some pictures.

573
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,773
Now they want me to make a movie.
- In Hollywood?

574
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,290
That's right.
- Forget it! - What do you mean?

575
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,015
It's his big chance!
- They want me to play a gangster.

576
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,894
You?
- In fact, I did an imitation of you.

577
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,889
"Hey, come here. Do what I tell
you to do or I'll plug ya!"

578
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:21,655
Owney arranged the whole thing.
He's co-financing

579
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,809
the movie. He said you wouldn't mind
if I left for the coast.

580
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,570
Playback Dixie Dwyer. Sound!

581
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,899
Here he comes. He's in egg-cream.
- Madden always had good judgment.

582
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,012
Right.
- What's the kid's name?

583
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,179
Dixie Dwyer. Keep an eye on him.

584
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,088
He's fantastic. He's coming in now.

585
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,135
Unbelievable. Watch him, watch him!

586
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,531
First kid you ever sent me
that doesn't sound like a soprano.

587
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,175
He's the greatest. He'll become...

588
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:04,009
Hold it, hold it, Sully!
- What? What?

589
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,099
This kid can't act.
- Alright, I can see it.

590
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,135
He has a good face, good voice,
doesn't look like a fruit.

591
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,969
Not at all.
- He looks like

592
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,536
a gangster. What's his name again?

593
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,289
Dixie Dwyer. A great name!

594
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,175
A fake name. The first thing...

595
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,576
I'll decide about the name.

596
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:29,059
I like the name. Keep the name.
- Put him under contract.

597
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:34,130
We'll send him to the coast. We'll
give him a shot. - Fantastic.

598
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,058
Anyone who moves is a dead nigger!

599
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,693
You! St. Clair!

600
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,608
The Dutchman
wants you in his numbers racket.

601
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:01,431
Madame St. Clair!

602
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:06,786
Gentlemen, we are here because
Mr. Jewett says he can

603
01:01:07,232 --> 01:01:10,781
protect us from the white invaders.
Is that true?

604
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:16,511
I know how the Dutchman thinks.
I see him operate with the Flynns.

605
01:01:16,952 --> 01:01:19,910
You meet a gun with a gun.

606
01:01:22,032 --> 01:01:24,500
And I got all the guns you need.

607
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:28,031
Hire him!
- I don't want no parts of guns.

608
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:32,825
Or I'll leave the numbers business.
- It's not about guns, it's politics.

609
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:39,110
You connected with Jimmy Hines
in Tammany? They control the police.

610
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:42,950
Look, I come to do you people a favor.

611
01:01:43,432 --> 01:01:46,026
That man is leaning on you.

612
01:01:47,792 --> 01:01:50,022
You wanna lean back or no?

613
01:01:56,992 --> 01:01:59,870
It seems we will pass on your offer.

614
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:03,622
We are not ready
to go to war at this time.

615
01:02:04,352 --> 01:02:08,391
Then you don't know
you already lost the war.

616
01:04:22,072 --> 01:04:23,505
Lila!

617
01:04:25,632 --> 01:04:27,668
You can't do this to me, Lila!
- Do what?

618
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:31,229
Disappear like you do.
Where do you go all day?

619
01:04:31,672 --> 01:04:34,664
I have a private life now.

620
01:04:35,112 --> 01:04:37,342
I can't talk to you here.

621
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:39,748
Let's go up on the roof.

622
01:04:40,192 --> 01:04:43,389
I told you that there are
other people in my life.

623
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:46,744
I want to talk.
- This is Madden's place!

624
01:04:47,192 --> 01:04:50,468
I want to talk to you now.
Now just come on! Come on!

625
01:04:50,912 --> 01:04:53,301
Not up here.
- We won't get into trouble.

626
01:04:53,752 --> 01:04:57,540
Let's go outside.
- You moved. Got a new address.

627
01:04:57,992 --> 01:05:00,631
How am I supposed to find you?

628
01:05:01,072 --> 01:05:04,951
What are you doing up here?
- We're just going to talk.

629
01:05:05,392 --> 01:05:08,828
Yeah! You come up here
to fornicate like two dogs.

630
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,070
You don't belong up here. Get down.

631
01:05:12,512 --> 01:05:15,629
Why can't we...
- I'm fed up with you!

632
01:05:17,192 --> 01:05:19,387
Please!
- I'll take care of you!

633
01:05:20,952 --> 01:05:23,591
Wait a minute!
- Come here!
