44
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,456
I was at this fancy restaurant
having lunch...

45
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,662
and the waiter brought me my entree.
It was a salad.

46
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,571
It was Lloyd's head
on a plate of spinach...

sticking out of his ear.

And I said,
'I didn't order this. "

And the waiter said,
"You must try it. It's a delicacy.

50
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:49,317
But don't eat the penis:
it's just garnish."

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,189
- Mmm.
- Lloyd, what do you
think about the dream?

52
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,195
I think she should stop telling it
at dinner parties to all our friends.

don't you think?

I'm not here to judge or
to take sides. I will say...

- Communication is healthy.
- Healthy?

00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,540

castrated "Florentined" is healthy?

where he's responsible.

Well, you made it sound like
it was yours. 'I run an antique store. "

301
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,501
I said I run it. I didn't say I own it.
I am the manager.

302
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,605
- Do you think he cares
if you work for your mother?
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

303
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:28,085
Let's get one thing straight. From now on,
the only person who yells is me.

304
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,781
Why? Because
I have a gun, okay?

305
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,824
People with guns can do
whatever they want.

306
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,793
Married people without guns...
for instance, you...

307
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,524
- [Both] Mm-hmm.
- Do not get to yell!

308
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,226
Why? No guns!

309
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,826
No guns, no yelling! See?

310
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,871
Simple little equation.

311
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:51,875
Jesus Christ, who are
you fuckin'people?

312
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:56,175
Caroline and Lloyd Chasseur.
What's your name?

313
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,512
Fuck you, that's my name.

314
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,984
Got any rope... Lloyd?

315
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,182
For what?

316
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,727
- What am l, applying for a job?
- No.

317
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:13,993
Then stop asking me fuckin' questions,
okay? Got any rope, Lloyd?

318
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,058
No, we don't
have any rope.

319
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,832
We have bungee cords.
They might work.

320
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,500
- Where? Move.
- Right through there in the kitchen.

321
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,668
I don't believe you.

322
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,678
Expecting company?

323
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,113
Yes. Lloyd's mother and his brother's
family are coming for dinner.

324
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,174
They should be here by 9:00.

325
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,185
Great.

326
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,890
Jesus.

327
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,221
Excuse my reach.

328
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,423
- Pass the ketchup.
- Pass the ketchup, please.

329
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,591
I'm not hungry now. I thought
we were eating at Uncle Lloyd's.

330
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,602
God knows what disaster
your Aunt Caroline is making.

331
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,002
This may be our last chance
for normal food.

332
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:58,099
She does it to irritate me.
I'm the one that she's after.

333
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,441
- But I'm not hungry now.
- Eat! Don't annoy me. It's Christmas.

334
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,573
- I'm sure she's going to a lot of trouble.
- Gary.

335
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,584
The last time you ate her cooking,
you had diarrhea for a week.

336
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,086
You had diarrhea
for a week, Dad?

337
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,181
That is not appropriate
dinner conversation. Eat!

338
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:17,718
If we hate Aunt Caroline's
cooking so much, why do we go
there every year for Christmas?

339
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,731
Because my poor Lloyd
needs his family.

340
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,361
Otherwise, he'd be all alone with that
adulteress and her delinquent son.

341
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:29,032
I hope they get into a fight
like always. Their fights are bitchin'.

342
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,599
Shut up.! Don't make me nuts today.!
It's Christmas.!

343
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,247
Merry Christmas.

344
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,580
Ahh. Mmm.

345
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:44,884
So... what's the worst
dive bar near here?

346
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,890
- Seventeenth Hole.
- The Mackerel Lounge.

347
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,516
[Both]
How do you know that?

348
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,528
I passed by once
on the access road.

349
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,656
Did you ever pass by
the Seventeenth Hole?
It's like a urinal with windows.

350
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,829
And the Mackerel Lounge
couldn't be a dive bar, because
they can have entertainment.

351
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:04,633
- ?? It's Christmas
You're drunk and in jail??
- [Phone Ringing]

352
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,677
Mackerel Lounge.
Herbie speaking.

353
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,873
- I'm looking for a friend.
- [Lloyd] The Mackerel Lounge
couldn't be the worst dive bar.

354
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,509
- Can you hang on
just one second please?
- Oh, you happen to know.!

355
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,951
Aah!

356
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,682
Thanks. I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

357
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,421
He's kind of a, uh,
short... drunken loser.

358
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,157
You just described
everybody in the place.

359
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,699
See if there's a guy
named Murray there, okay?

360
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,327
Is there a Murray here?

361
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,201
?? There'll be some whiskey
and a six-pack??

362
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,867
- ?? Not a tree????
- I don't think he's here, pal.

363
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,107
See if there's a waste of fucking life
named Murray. Try that one, okay?

364
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,742
Is there a fucking waste
of life named Murray here?

365
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,911
Gus. Uh...

366
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,391
hello?

367
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,895
Murray.
How are ya, pal?

368
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:03,026
- Fine. How are you?
- Oh, fabulous, fabulous.
Of course, I'm a little tired...

369
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:08,505
from running for ten hundred
fuckin'miles because there was
no fuckin'car waiting for me.!

370
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,507
What did I tell you
if something went wrong?

371
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,305
I told you to act like
a drunk vagrant imbecile.

372
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:17,144
- Is that too much of a fuckin' stretch?
- I got nervous.

373
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,877
The cops were
all over the place.

374
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,717
The cops, they've set up a roadblock.
They're checking cars.

375
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,315
- And by 10:00 tonight, there's a curfew.
- Fuck it.

376
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,657
- I just heard it at the bar.
- Fuckin'...

377
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,199
Excuse me.
Is anything wrong?

378
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,297
Lloyd, don't talk to me.

379
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,036
Don't talk to me.
Shut up.

380
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,443
- Don't say anything to me.
Okay? Understand?
- [Murray] Gussie?

381
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:52,074
- Shh.
- Because maybe we can help, you know.

382
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,119
My God!
I swear to God!

383
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,914
Gussie, where the hell are ya? I'm scared.
I don't think I can handle this.

384
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,017
- I'm...
- Ya been drinkin'?

385
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:07,861
No. No.
What are ya, nuts?

386
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,959
- Listen...
- Calm down, okay? Just calm down.

387
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,061
You gotta help me.

388
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:18,701
I'll tell you what. Go to a place
called Winslow Harbors, okay?

389
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:22,269
- And steal us a boat.
- Boat? Wha...

390
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,612
I'm a car man, Gussie. What the hell
do I know about boats?

391
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:29,347
Figure it out.! I don't care if it's
a barrel as long as it fucking floats.

392
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,016
7:30 now. Curfew starts at 10:00.
That gives you more than enough time.

393
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,218
Ya got a pen?
Write this number down.

394
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:40,788
Okay? 555-353 7.

395
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,800
- Okay? Repeat it.
- 353 7.

396
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:48,896
Listen, kid. Maybe you better
tell me where the swag is, in
case I have to bribe somebody.

397
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,568
- No, Murray. No.
- But...

398
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,874
You can hot-wire station wagons,
you can hot-wire a fucking boat.

399
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:59,542
And just remember,
if you can't, what men your age
become in prison: wet nurses.

400
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,178
Okay, Murray?
Bye-bye.

401
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:07,116
Oh. Thanks.

402
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,888
Ah. Everything's
gonna be fine.

403
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,623
Everything's
gonna be A-okay.

404
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:16,633
We're gonna be in a boat in a couple
of hours. We'll be out of here.

405
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,862
Right back on track.
Right? Right.

Now...
got any cigarettes?

409
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,219
I don't smoke,
and Caroline just quit.

410
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,820
Ah.

411
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,690
Just quit, huh?

412
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,161

Chessboard,

00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,251
What?
You told me you quit.

418
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,516
- Yes!
- I told you I wouldn't smoke in the house.

419
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:17,221
- I never said I quit.
- You said you quit. You hadn't
had a cigarette in three months.

420

I haven't finished a cigarette
in three months. I take a few drags.

- I don't inhale.
- You are such a liar. I don't believe it.

- I am not a liar!
- You sat right in the dining room
and lied to me!

- It was in the bathroom.
- I wonder how many other things
you've been lying about.

Ugh.

Did you say that you
would quit, Caroline?

Did you say
that you would quit?

00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,839
[Sighs]

449
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:13,469
I don't believe it.
You want to have sex with him.

450
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,911
- What?
- "Use the ouchless."
"We have bungee cords."

451
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,919
Ugh.
I'm frightened.

452
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,956
Humans get frightened
because they have feelings.

453
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:30,017
Didn't your alien leaders teach you
that before they sent you here?

454
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,495
I suppose you'll use this drama
as a reason to have another affair.

455
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,762
I feel sorry for the next deliveryman
that comes to this house!

456
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,826
[Doorbell Rings]

457
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,038
Shh.

458
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,337
[Ring]

459
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,571
Okay, our car's
in the driveway.

460
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,079
The lights are on.
They know we're in here.

461
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:53,982
- ???? [Humming]
- [Doorbell Rings]

462
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,319
Who the fuck is that?
Make it quick.

463
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,054
Okay.

464
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,528
Ho ho ho!
Merry Christmas.

465
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,691
Did I catch you
at a bad time?

466
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,826
No, no, no. I was, um,
in the attic.

467
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:16,033
I bet you thought Margaret forgot you
on her fruitcake list.

468
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,372
I thought... maybe.
[Laughing]

469
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,174
Well, she would
never do that.

470
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,181
- [Santa Laughing]
- Oh? Great.

471
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,183
- Thank you, George.
- Merry Christmas.

472
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,981
- Thanks to Margaret. Yup. Bye.
- Right. Yeah. Hey!

473
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,283
Did you hear
about the reward?

474
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:36,055
Willard called the radio station
from Bimini when he found out
about the robberies...

475
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:41,963
and he said he'll give $ 100,000
to anyone who captures this guy.

476
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:49,099
- Oop. Okay, bye.
- Well. [Laughing]

477
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,607
I got a lot of children
to see before that curfew.

478
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,610
- Thank you.
- Pay my best to Lloyd.

479
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,579
- Yup.
- And to that son of yours. Uh...

480
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,879
- Jesse. Okay, bye-bye.
- I'm still waiting for our chess rematch.

481
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:05,184
And ifhe happens to know
where the town's babyJesus is...

482
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:10,421
we're still missing it from the lawn
Nativity scene from last year.

483
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,429
- My God.
- Yeah.

484
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,965
Merry Christmas.

485
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,967
Bye.

486
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:29,839
That guy blames Jesse
for everything that happens.

487
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:33,475
And he hasn't played chess
with him for years.

488
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,315
Ah. What's in this?

489
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,754
- I don't know, alum? Don't eat it.
- [Spitting]

490
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,825
- Welcome to the suburbs.
- Yeah.

491
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,831
- Where are those Band-Aids?
- Upstairs.

492
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,833
Show me.

493
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,005
Wow.

494
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,167
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

495
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:03,009
It's my mother-in-law's. Every time
I pass it, I feel her eyes on me.

496
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,413
You want it?

497
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,417
Do I want it?

498
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,419
This is Chagall, right?

499
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,049
- This is a real Chagall.
- Yeah.

500
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:17,720
It really pisses me off.

501
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:20,730
- Sorry?
- You got something like this
hanging on your wall...

502
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,062
and you don't even
fuckin' appreciate it.

503
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,069
Probably 'cause you never
worked a day in your life.

504
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,007
That's not true.

505
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:33,840
We had our own business once.
We owned a restaurant.

506
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,902
An Italian restaurant.

507
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,609
'Course, I would have
preferred French, but anyway...

508
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,084
- It failed eventually...
- What are we, girlfriends here?

509
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:45,384
Do I give a shit about this?

510
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,651
No. Let's move.

511
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,659
[Radio]
Cloudy skies, drizzle...

512
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:54,027
- You wanna go for coffee?
- Look, kid, I gotta get home to my family.

513
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,089
This is my lastjob.

514
00:33:56,167 --> 00:34:00,001
Oh, come on.
It can't be that bad.

515
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,165
Look. Can you just drive me
around the block a little?

516
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,300
I'll give you another fifty.

517
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,004
Well, it's your money, pal.

518
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,478
- [Children Yelling]
- [George] Who's been naughty
and who's been nice?

519
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,918
Here we are.! Hey, hey.!
I got one forJohnny here.!

520
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,923
And here's one for Bill.
And for Karen.

521
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:23,927
- And here's a beautiful looking...
- It's so cold out tonight.

522
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,863
- Do you think Santa would
like something to eat?
- [George] Santa's hungry.!

523
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,901
- [Boy] Let's give him some cookies.!
- Cookies.

524
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,993
- Santa, have a cookie.!
- Over here.!

525
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,006
- Merry Christmas, Santa. [Laughing]
- Uh-huh.

526
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,875
- [Boy] The cookies are good.!
- All right, everybody, tuck in!
Let's eat, huh?

527
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,073
- Here, Santa!
- Enough with the cookies, kids!

528
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,896
You two were gone
an awfully long time.

529
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,996
I got us moved to
a more comfortable place.

530
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,042
What did you have to do for it,
dress his wounds?

531
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,806
Oh, that's right, Lloyd.
We're having an affair.

532
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:19,339
He wants to run away to Acapulco. He
tied me up in case I had second thoughts.

533
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,749
No one goes
to Acapulco anymore.

534
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,811
Our son's walking in here any minute.
Why don't you worry about that?

535
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,825
Look, if we just cooperate,
I'm sure he won't hurt him.

536
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:31,828
What are you doing?

537
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,922
I think we can get out of these.
Oh, move your body!

538
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,024
Stop that!
What if he walks in here?

539
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,468
We'll just say we're
being... affectionate.

540
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,666
Tied up,
with an armed man in the house?

541
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,766
Works for me.

542
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:17,031
- Just reach down and touch
that clippery thing.
- Listen to me.

543
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,042
I cannot move my arm.

544
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,546
- Oh! Oh, oh! Stop it!
- What's that?

545
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,682
It's nothing.

546
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,275
It doesn't
feel like nothing.

547
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,215
- Just the friction.
- [Chuckling]

548
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,225
Stop it.

549

00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,934
Lloyd, you animal.

552
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,065
Haven't you left yet?

553
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,578
- Did ya hear the fuckin' phone ring?
- Look, what about our son?

554
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,910
Well, guess it's gonna be a real Chasser
family picnic, huh?

555
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,884
That's Chasseur.
It's 18th-century French Huguenot.

556
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,755
- Got any extra cord?
- No, we don't have any extra cord.

557
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,591
Okay. Guess we're gonna
have to economize, huh?

558
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,027
- [Horns Honking]
- Move up!

559
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,033
Bring 'em on up.

560
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:19,592
Keep it moving.
Keep moving.

561
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,935
You, sir. Whoa. Whoa.

562
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,703
- May I see some identifiication, please?
- Certainly, sir.

563
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:31,839
- How can they do this on Christmas Eve?
- There is a criminal at large.

564
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,111
They can't stop
for the holidays.

565
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,983
Maybe they'll let him go
in the spirit of Christmas.

566
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,988
That is not
the spirit of Christmas.

567
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:43,152
The spirit of Christmas is
either you're good, or you're
punished and you burn in hell.

568
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:47,721
- Who would catch a criminal
and then let him go free?
- Republicans?

569
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,626
[Policeman]
Have a merry Christmas.

570
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,773
[Caroline Sighing]

571
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:04,280
Why don't you
just give yourself up?

572
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:08,512
- What'd you say?
- Well, you're not going to kill
an entire family.

573
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,249
It's over. I mean, you're not the type.
You're a thief, not a killer.

574
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,257
That's obvious.

575
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,351
I hate guys like you,
you know?

576
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:23,128
With yourJeep Grand Cherokees
and your Nicaraguan maids
and your Ping Zing golf clubs...

577
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,931
every goddamn thing in the world
handed to you. What fuckin'
purpose do you people serve?

578
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,632
You're a criminal.
What purpose could you serve?

579
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,641
Fuck you, Lloyd.
I work for a living, okay?

580
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,768
I have a skill.
I'm in the game, pal.

581
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,142
What do you do except
take up fuckin' space?

582
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:40,206
If you're so skilled,
what are you doing stuck here?

583
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:45,449
I can break into any house, take whatever
I want: in and out, ten minutes.

584
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,514
No prints, no evidence,
nothing.

585
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,425
If what's-his-name hadn't installed
that fuckin' roadrunner booby trap...

586
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:55,397
- I'd be in Jamaica by now.
- Mmm, I'm impressed.

587
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,400
No, you people don't
get impressed, do ya?

588
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,631
Life just bores the shit
out of you people. I'm sorry.

589
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,640
We don't all have rich mummies
and daddies we can live off of...

590
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,871
or open restaurants
when we get bored playing tennis.

591
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,840
You told him
about the restaurant?

592
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:17,320
Yeah. I heard you couldn't cut it working
for a living, Mr. Brooks Brothers, so...

593
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,186
Shut up.!

594
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,926
You and my wife
have a lot in common.

595
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,225
You both think you have some right
to life working out the way you want...

596
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,233
and if it doesn't, you get
to act any way you want.

597
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,735
The problem is someone
has to be responsible.

598
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,738
I'd love to run around taking classes
and playing with my inner-selfness.

599
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:39,037
I'd love the freedom to be a pissed-off
criminal without any responsibility...

But you don't see me with a gun.

You don't see me sleeping
with someone else.

You think my life turned out the way
I wanted because I live in this house?

You think every time I look in the mirror
I shout, "Gee, I'm glad I'm me...

Hello?

- Jesse.
- Who are you? Hey! Watch it!

- You guys okay?
- Hands behind your back.

- Wait a second. You're the guy who...
- Shut up!

This isn't your M.O.
You only knock over estates.

- But hostages? That's a no-win situation.
- You too, huh?

You know what this family
needs? A mute.

621

Let me say it one more time. I have a gun.
It's loaded. Shut up. Okay?

622
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,125
Yes, but we have people
coming for dinner.

- They're driving from Boston.
You gonna tie us all up?
- Five extra people.

- Dinner's canceled.
- We can't cancel dinner.
I mean, they're on the road.

625
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,404
- [Lloyd] They'll be here by 9:00.
- Should I shoot one of you in the foot?

626

Listen. If the police have a curfew,
they might do house-to-house searches.

- You can't stay here.
- That would be very bad for you.

- Really.
- I can't leave until my partner calls.

Maybe I could
sell tickets. No, no.

Let's see. No, no. The...
The point is, in order to get this robe...

You know, I've never seen this movie
all the way through.

00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:39,680
- Don't you live in this country?
- They show it during the holidays.

637
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,352
With the kids and the family,
I've never seen the whole thing.

638
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,418
- The color of your jacket.
- It's charcoal.

639
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,897
- I didn't know what you were talking about.
- Merry Christmas, Lieutenant.

640
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:54,370
- Yeah, merry Christmas.
- Where the hell are you two going?
Stay here.

641
00:42:56,106 --> 00:43:00,941

- That's the way I was brought up.

No, that's fast-forward.
This is it.

Give me that.

Then I'll organize specific teams...

each with a specific
geographic location.

654

Lieutenant.
Some county prosecutor guy?

- I think we should just wait
'til Huff gets back.

How did you
get home again?

673
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,511
- I got a ride with a friend.
- Which friend?

674
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,550
Which friend?
Do I know him?

675

All right,
I took a limo, okay?

676

Where'd you get
the money for a limo?

- Okay, I stole one. Is that better?
- Listen, smart-mouth...

- Don't talk to him like that.!

00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:09,091
- You've never disciplined him.!
- If you had not sent him to that prison...

- For a summer. I go for
my entire high school life.

You were sent there because high schools

- Bainbridge.

You take Main Street and you turn left
on Domino Square.

You can't. Domino Square
is a one-way street.

00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,158
Bainbridge is the only
two-way street to the docks.

You know, you're never
gettin' out of here.

It's quicker.!

Never again. Never again!

She's been collecting them for years.

they found a ski mask on the scene.

00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,284
- Hello?
- Caroline?

744
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:03,493
- It's Connie.
Listen, we got a little held up.
- Oh, hi.

745
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,501
We'll be there
in 20 minutes.

746
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,367
I hope that dinner
isn't ruined.

747
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:11,305
- Oh, well... bye.
- Okay, bye.

748
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,639
All right, get in the car!

749
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:19,876
Great. Looks like there's gonna be
one more for dinner, huh?

750
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:27,222
?? I'll have a blue Christmas...??

751
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,417
[Phone Rings]

752
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,758
- Siskel.
- [Woman] Honey,
when are you coming home?

753
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:36,287
Your parents are here.
The children are asking for you.

754
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:39,802
I'm sorry, Stella.
I had some last-minute work to do.

755
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,330
Uh, I'll get there as soon as I can, okay?
Tell the kids I love 'em.

756
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,467
- Okay, please hurry.
- Okay, bye.

757
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:51,344
?? Decorations of red??

758
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:56,751
?? On a green Christmas tree????

759
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,881
Look, you're making a mistake.
I could help you out, you know.

760
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,222
- I got $11,000 cash...
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

761
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,922
It's been a long, bad day.

762
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,932
I'd rather be in Iraq
than in this fuckin' house.

763
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,901
So do me a favor,
do yourself a favor, cut the shit.

764
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,028
- Okay?
- I'm not. It's the truth.

765
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:18,199
- I got a blackmail deal going in school...
- Blackmail?

766
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:22,143
What are we, a buck ten?
You're doing blackmail on people?

767
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:27,275
Yeah. I needed some big money fast.
I was desperate.
I wanted to get out of here.

768
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,786
- Desperate about what?
- Let's see.

769
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,914
I got two years, four months
left in military school.

770
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,858
My parents hate each other. My
father records every mistake in my life...

771
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,864
like he's preparing for my parole hearing.
I don't get to do anything by myself.

772
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:46,062
And I live in the suburbs.
You figure it out.

773
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:49,071
So where you gonna go?
Huh?

774
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,108
I don't know.
Where do you go?

775
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,075
Where do I go?

776
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,078
Well...
[Clears Throat]

777
00:51:56,146 --> 00:52:00,480
I usually end up in Jamaica with
this friend of mine, Jimmy Marlo.

778
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,984
He steals appliances
off of trucks.

779
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,987
We get the money back
from the fence...

780
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,489
which is about half what
the stuff s really worth...

781
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,492
spend all the money, come home,
start all over again.

782
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,496
'Course, this time was supposed
to be the big final score.

783
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,998
You know,
the big retirement score.

784
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:20,093
Why you quitting now?
You got a great life.

785
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:23,230
Let me explain
something to ya, kid.

786
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,639
What I do, runnin' around
stealin' shit...

787
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,144
that may sound great
when you're 15 years old...

788
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,010
but it sucks just a little bit
when you're 3 5...

789
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,448
no family, no house.

790
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,453
I got a partner who's 56.
He's an alcoholic.

791
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:40,456
He still can't figure out why
they took Happy Days off the air.

792
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,721
Then on TV every day,
I see kids like you on these talk shows.

793
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:47,229
You got everything,
opportunities up the ass.

794
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,266
You got a family to come home to,
and what do you do?

795
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,268
You bitch and moan because
things don't go your way.

796
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:57,295
Well, you know what? Welcome to
the real world, where most of the time...

797
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,638
things don't go
your fuckin' way.

798
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:03,201
Easy for you to say.
Everything goes your way.

799
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,441
Great. You know what?

800
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,484
I think I had you
pegged wrong.

801
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,487
I don't think you have a brain
in your fuckin' head.

802
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,821
Merry Christmas.

803
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,756
Now, we don't have much time.
Rules of the house.

804
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:25,062
No telephone except for the kitchen.
No television.

805
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,194
Nobody on the second foor,
in case your son makes noise.

806
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,068
I want you in front of me
at all times.

807
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,075
No arguing. When you fight,
you forget everything else.

808
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,738
Just behave and pay attention,
or I take your son with me.

809
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:41,079
Now, tell me
about this doctor guy.

810
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:48,056
I received a call from Will Warren,
the county prosecutor.

811
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,684
Happens to be
a close friend of mine.

812
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,697
In spite of your bungling,
he's confident they'll find our thief...

813
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,960
in those house-to-house
searches during curfew.

814
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:03,233
Another thing. He said, uh, your men
are to assist and report to me...

815
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,240
as per his instructions.

816
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:09,244
You can call if you'd like.
Um, let's see, one other thing...

817
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:11,439
Oh, yes, your Christmas
wish came true.

818
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:15,575
[Laughing] You're to be out of here
the day after Christmas.

819
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:19,611
Isn't that a lovely Noel?
It's been swell.

820
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,657
- Bob.
- Yes.

821
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:25,092
- I nailed your wife.
- What?

822
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,595
After the town meeting
last August.

823
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,791
You were in Rhode Island
on business.

824
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,769
Three times, Bob.

825
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,800
She said you never
went three times, Bob.

826
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,202
[Knocking]

827
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:50,008
- Merry Christmas, Lloyd!
- Phil, Steve, merry Christmas.

828
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:52,020
- Are you guys working tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

829
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,216
They're starting that curfew tonight,
and this is our area.

830
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:58,022
Thought we might
say hi to Gary.

831
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,790
- Is he here yet?
- Gary.

832
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,856
- Who's Gary?
- He's my brother-in-law.

833
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,333
- They all grew up together.
- Great.

834
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:14,375
- Is that Caroline? I'd love to say hello!
- I'd love to see Caroline.

835
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:18,380
- You know, your wife?
- Of course it is. What am I doing?

836
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,781
She's upstairs. She's chang...
You want a cup of coffee?

837
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,513
- Come on in. In the kitchen.
- Oh, yeah.

838
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:28,489
- Maybe a piece
of pumpkin pie or something?
- Oh, uh...

839
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:33,086
- [Lloyd] Were you guys here last year?
- Yeah, there was a rum cake.

840
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,132
- You guys make great coffee.
- Yeah, it was fantastic.

841
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,999
You guys help yourselves.
I'll go get Caroline, so...

842
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,595
- Unh!
- What is wrong with you?

843
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:46,608
- It would have caused suspicion to say no.
- You never admit you're wrong.

844
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,043
- Finally somebody says it besides me.
- There was no alternative.

845
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,479
I could have been
in the shower.

846
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:56,007
- She could have been wrapping presents.
- What is this, a lying seminar?

847
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,647
- You made a noise. I was distracted.
- He was distracted.

848
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,588
[Grunting]

849
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,728
[Steve] No, I'm not buying wine
for your brother.

850
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:18,103
He can suck on a grape,
Marge. Forget it.

851
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,142
[Marge]
What about the breakfast?

852
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,374
- Okay, I'll get the milk and the doughnuts.
- There you go.

853
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:29,111
Mm-hmm. Ye... Marge, hold on.
They got another call comin' in.

854
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,677
Yes, I'll talk
to you later. Hello.

855
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,747
Uh, Gussie?

856
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,884
No, this is Lt. Milford.
To whom am I speaking?

857
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,556
- Uh...
- Ooh, he hung up.

858
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:46,125
- [Phil] Who was it?
- I don't know. Hung up.

859
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,899
- Probably a wrong number.
- Crank call.

860
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,441
- Yeah, kids.
- That's it.

861
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:56,536
- So... ooh, it's late.
- When do you think Gar
might be gettin' here?

862
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,481
Well, maybe what you should do
is go and, um...

863
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,077
when Gary comes, I'll get him
to call you at the office.

864
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:07,248
- Because Christmas Eve,
you're so busy, and l...
- [Phone Rings]

865
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:10,986
Oh, I'll get it. That's it.
Thank you. Hello?

866
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,326
Hello. Uh,
are you feeling better?

867
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:20,267
Who gives a rat's ass
how I feel? Where's Gussie?

868
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,328
I'll get him.
Back in a minute.

869
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,201
I can't believe
I'm working tonight.

870
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,906
I know. Some guy robbin'
people on Christmas Eve?

871
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,778
It's not right.
It's not right.

872
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:39,686
We'll get him though. We got every cop
and his brother lookin'for him.

873
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:43,453
- Christmas Eve, it's...
- Murray.

874
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,493
- He hung up.
- Well, he sounded upset.

875
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:52,501
He should be. He's gonna die
a horrible fuckin' death.

876
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,503
[Connie] Caroline.!

877
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,698
Oh! Speaking of which...

878
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:02,108
[Sighs] So, Gary and Connie
and the kids.

879
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:05,773
- [Gary, Connie] Merry Christmas.
- Gar!

880
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,783
- Steve.! Phil.!
- Oh, merry Christmas, Gar.!

881
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:11,446
Mom?
Merry Christmas.

882
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,455
Mom, the TV's broke.
What are we gonna do all night?

883
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,616
- I can't believe this.
- Celebrate the birth of Christ!

884
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,889
- Now, put the presents under the tree.
- Connie, honey...

885
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,862
- Look who dropped by.
- [Both] Merry Christmas, Connie.

886
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:25,299
- [Chuckling]
- I'll take that bag upstairs.

887
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,962
[Mother] I'll take it.
I want to change my shoes.

888
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,972
- Mom, hi.
- Lloyd, who is this?

Doctor... Wong.

Ah, the marriage doctor.

- Right.
- Yeah.

Wong?
You're a Wong?

895
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,390
- Well, my mother was Irish.
- And your father?

896
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,327
- Wasn't.
- Why don't we go downstairs?

897
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,888
- I want to change my shoes.
- [Lloyd] Your shoes are lovely.

898
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,662
- My feet hurt.
- Take 'em off. Go barefoot.

- What the hell...

strange at family gatherings?

It's not me, Mom.
It's Caroline.

Nobody likes you.
What are you talking about, "friend"?

It's somebody I just met, and we kind of

If she did, she'd be back in

- Santa doesn't drink champagne.

Look, Santa can't drink
any more milk tonight.

intolerance.

It gives him
horrible gas pains.

What you're wearing on your heads
are called Lucia wreaths.

969

They're worn in honor

were so strong...

As the story goes...

Lucia was engaged
to be married...

975
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,711
and instead of giving her dowry
to her in-laws...

976
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,809
she gave it to the poor people
of the village.

01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:14,289
Her husband-to-be, thinking
she was out ofher mind...

978
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,121
betrayed her to the Romans
as a Christian...

979
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:20,959
and they condemned her
to burn at the stake.

But although she was
surrounded by fames...

981
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:26,463
she would not burn.

982
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,232
And they had to stab her
with a sword.

a Christmas story?

01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:44,192
and our parents
wanted to join farms.

1040
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,700
Really.
What kind of farms?

1041
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,761
Pigs.

1042
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,808
Caroline,
could I have the wine?

1043
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,400
It's all finished.
We have to get another bottle.

1044
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,247
[Mother]
Where are you all going?

1045
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:03,581
I gotta stay with them
to, uh, weave the, uh...

1046
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,553
Uh... ow!

1047
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:09,284
Just shut up and eat
your goddamn dinners.

1048
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,918
You won't talk about it in therapy,
but you'll discuss it behind my back...

1049
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:14,087
- With that bitch!
- Hey, she's my mother.

1050
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:16,097
- She's a fuckin' bitch, Lloyd.
- You are not supposed to take sides.

1051
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,929
No, no, no. Thank you so much, Gus.
Finally somebody else sees.

1052
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:20,935
- You'd have to be blind not to see.
- All right, all right.

1053
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,937
- Let's just get in there
and change the subject.
- Oh, fine.

1054
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,099
Why didn't we just change the subject
before I was humiliated?

1055
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,439
That's it, Lloyd.
We are getting a divorce.

1056
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,446
I've, you know...
This is finished.

1057
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:41,620
Now get the hell home, George,
before we call your wife.

1058
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,954
Honestly, George.
What an example.

1059
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,290
Santa was
mean to me.

1060
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:49,627
- I'm serious, George.
- Yeah?

1061
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:53,464
Maybe Santa won't
come back next year.

1062
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,470
Maybe him
and the Easter Bunny...

1063
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,631
will take a fuckin' cruise
toJamaica...

1064
01:07:57,706 --> 01:08:01,972
and you can eat
your own lousy cookies.

1065
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,978
[Unzips Fly]

1066
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:07,311
[Urinating,
Sighing]

1067
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:12,343
Oh, who the hell knows,
huh? Ow!

1068
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,981
I was pregnant
with Jesse then.

1069
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:19,994
We lived
in the most... wonderful...

1070
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:22,690
one-bedroom
apartment.

1071
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,995
You see, Lloyd...

1072
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:28,002
never took any money
from his family then.

1073
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,436
I found that
so attractive.

1074
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,303
And then what happened?

1075
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:35,070
Don't encourage her, Mary.
No one wants to listen to her misery.

1076
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:41,014
Lloyd was working as an assistant
banquet manager at the Sheraton.

1077
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,347
[Chuckles]

1078
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:47,253
- We'd make love in the mornings
because he was, you know...
- Caroline...

1079
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,257
why don't you
eat something.

1080
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:53,056
Lloyd, why don't you eat me.

1081
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,154
- [Gasps]
- Kids, go into the den.

1082
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:58,723
- It all turned to shit...
- [Connie] This is not
a conversation for children.

1083
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,702
- It's not a conversation for adults either.
- When Lloyd's father died.

1084
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:06,833
- Where you going?
- The living room,
to leave you to your quilting.

1085
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,639
- [Caroline]
She bribed Lloyd to move back...
- I'll be there to open presents.

1086
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,737
If my plans change,
I'll contact you.

1087
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,282
- I hate Connecticut.
I grew up in Connecticut.
- Why don't we all...

1088
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,377
go into the living room. Then we can
have our coffee and dessert in there.

1089
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:22,481
- You phony bastard!
- Caroline, shut up.!

1090
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:24,492
- Let's all go to the bathroom...
- Sit down, Connie. Sit.

1091
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,120
Excuse me, but I am not
one of your patients.

1092
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:30,461
You're gonna be somebody's
patient if you don't get your
ass back down into that chair.

1093
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,728
Wow. Ow!

1094
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:34,996
I swear to God,
you hit that kid one more time...

1095
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,470
and I'm gonna stick that
pig's head right up your ass!

1096
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,442
Gary, are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?

1097
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,910
- Well, hon, he is a doctor.
- [Laughing]

1098
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:48,507
Okay now, Caroline, Lloyd
and I will go into the kitchen
and get the coffee and dessert.

1099
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,711
- And then we're gonna open the presents.
- We can't open...

1100
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,448
- Presents until midnight.
- Why not?

1101
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,650
- Because it's not Christmas until midnight!
- Guess what.

1102
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,660
We're changing the rules a little bit, okay?
We're gonna open up the presents now.

1103
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,288
Not later, now. Why?
Because we're adults...

1104
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,855
and we can open the presents
whenever we want!

1105
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:08,097
- [Snickering]
- Let's go.

1106
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,902
- [Caroline Groaning]
- [Mother] Why isn't my portrait...

1107
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:17,139
over the fiireplace?

1108
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:20,478
- Have some coffee.
- Go to hell, mama's boy!

1109
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,985
- Caroline, get a grip.
- Or what? What are you
gonna do? Shoot me?

1110
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,146
[Laughing]
You think death scares me?

1111
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,158
You forget, buddy. I have been
married to him for 15 years.

1112
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,320
You forget
I have your son upstairs.

1113
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,834
[Sighs]
God.

1114
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,029
[Sighs]

1115
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:46,473
- Here we go.
How's that, Mom? Good?
- Mary, this one's yours.

1116
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:50,501
John, this is to you
from me and Dad.

1117
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,939
- What's that, Aunt Caroline?
- It's an orange...

1118
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,282
marzipan cake with
creme de menthe and lime zest.

1119
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:02,484
- Oh, sounds too sweet.
- Then don't eat it.

1120
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,288
Coffee?

1121
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:12,130
Is it real coffee or some
Scandinavian Christmas potion?

1122
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,967
- How about some music?
- How about some Nat King Cole?

1123
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:20,668
- Oh, Gary loves Nat King Cole.
- [Caroline] Gee, you know
each other so well.

1124
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:23,610
Okay, Nat King Cole it is.

1125
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:32,646
- Oh. Gary, this is for you.
- Oh, thank you.

1126
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:36,919
Oh. This is forJesse.

1127
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:41,827
Uh, we'll just put that
in a pile right over here.

1128
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:44,331
Do you like it, Mary?

1129
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,391
?? Chestnuts roasting
on an open fiire??

1130
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,993
Yeah, it's, uh...
real neat.

1131
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:54,737
Slipper socks!
Oh, I have wanted these for so long.

1132
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:58,769
Thank you, Mother Rose.
Kids, look what Mom got.

1133
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:02,647
[Quietly] You know, with all
her money, what does she think?
She's gonna take it with her?

1134
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:06,085
- I think that's the plan.
- ?? Folks dressed up like Eskimos??

1135
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:09,591
Oh, Caroline,
this is for you from Lloyd.

1136
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,355
- ?? Everybody knows??
- [Cracks A Nut]

1137
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:16,956
- ?? A turkey and some mistletoe??
- Lloyd?

1138
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,796
Should I stop handing out
the presents?

1139
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,735
Maybe some of us
are not in the mood?

1140
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,574
Caroline?

1141
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:31,739
You see, Dr. Wong, you can use
any treatment you like...

1142
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,782
and it won't do a bit of good.

1143
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,079
The simple truth is...

1144
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:40,645
that she's a nasty, selfish woman
who thinks only of herself.

1145
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,988
She has ruined my son's life.
I can attest to that.

1146
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,153
- He has endured such heartache.
- Lady...

1147
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:50,221
why don't you just sleep with him.
Let us all off the hook.

1148
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:53,097
- Shit.
- [Lloyd] Caroline, what are you doing?

1149
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:55,568
What's the point?
You've made your decision.

1150
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:57,195
What decision?

1151
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:02,806
Caroline's leaving me.

1152
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,574
We're getting
a divorce.

1153
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:09,447
?? And so I'm offering??

1154
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:12,180
- ?? This simple phrase??
- Why?

1155
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,882
?? To kids from one...??

1156
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:26,466
- Gary, this is to you from me.
- Thank you, bunny.

1157
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:31,973
- Oh, thanks, Mother Rose.
- I bought you the husky size, John.

1158
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,168
You mustn't let your weight
become a problem.

1159
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,405
He does not have
a weight problem.

1160
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:43,317
Oh. Isn't that nice.

1161
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:47,947
Thank you, Connie and Gary
and Mary and John.

1162
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:51,982
[Whispering]
Mom, this is our gift.

1163
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,326
It's to put in the bank.
It's another payment on the loan.

1164
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,094
Oh, thank you, Lloyd.

1165
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:03,901
Of course, we'll have to see
what happens with interest rates
in the new year.

1166
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,769
Cocksucker.

1167
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:11,212
- What did she say?
- She said, "cocksu..."

1168
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,807
you've been sucking us dry
for years on this loan.

1169
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:17,852
- Hey, Caroline.
- No, I have something to say.

1170
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,946
- You gotta problem with that?
- Nope.

1171
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,287
Don't you think
it's gone on long enough?

1172
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:27,795
You both borrowed money to open
that ridiculous restaurant...

1173
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:30,297
which I told you both
would never work.

1174
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,732
Well, it might have worked if you could
have taken your tentacles off of him.

1175
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:37,169
- Caroline, stop it.
- If you remember, Caroline...

1176
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:40,731
my husband had just died.
I was all alone.

1177
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,937
- And I had to have surgery.
- Plastic surgery.

1178
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,606
- It was necessary.
- It was nothing more...

1179
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,480
than needing to keep
your son's attention on you.

1180
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:53,749
- Manipulating him to open that store!
- You were practically destitute.!

1181
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,790
I gave him a real job.

1182
01:14:55,858 --> 01:15:00,090
I let you use my home
out of the goodness of my heart.

1183
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,392
You're charging us rent, Rose.

1184
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:05,433
- What kind of therapy is this?
- Come on, now...

1185
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,731
this is getting
a little ugly here.

1186
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,771
Yeah, we walk around
on tiptoes because...

1187
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,772
Mother might get upset
or Mother might get angry.

1188
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,774
And why?
Let's be honest.

1189
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:18,211
She has money, and she holds it over
all of us like a death sentence.

1190
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,215
I'm happy to give
my children everything.

1191
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,217
That's the problem!

1192
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,753
One son who can't
say boo to his wife...

1193
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:29,052
and the other one, the other one...
he just gives up.

1194
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:31,217
One bad review
in one lousy magazine.

1195
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:34,490
- You just give up.
- Now just a minute. Stop right there.

1196
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:41,295
In the first place, it wasn't
"one bad review in one lousy magazine."

1197
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,305
- It was the
Restaurant Guidebook of New York.
- Oh, God.

1198
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:47,638
And when the Restaurant
Guidebook recommends you...

1199
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:51,645
to Hindus looking for
a fun night out of fasting...

1200
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,477
what did you expect me to do,
change the menu?

1201
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:59,783
- You close the restaurant.
- No, you close the restaurant.
Other people try again.

1202
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:04,519
But, you see, everything always
came so damn easy for you.

1203
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:06,754
But the first time that
you tried something...

1204
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:10,764
that was really important
to you, to us...

1205
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:13,164
and it didn't work out,
what did you do?

1206
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,796
You ran home to Mom.
And then you build this wall...

1207
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:20,535
around yourself, shutting me out,
shutting Jesse out...

1208
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,271
with your cynicism
and your derision!

1209
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,280
And you call that
being responsible!

1210
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,942
Well, I can't live like this.
I don't care if I wind up...

1211
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:32,612
a truck stop waitress with platinum
hair and pineapple earrings!

1212
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:37,284
At least I'd be alive. Be better
than living with a corpse.

1213
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:54,301
Before you, uh, get on with
your career in the service industry...

1214
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:58,073
let's set the record straight.

1215
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:01,741
Because I don't want you leaving
with any misunderstandings.

1216
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:06,246
Maybe you're right.

1217
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:09,586
Maybe I was afraid.

1218
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,150
Maybe I can't...
take failure.

1219
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:15,753
That's probably true.

1220
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:21,098
And maybe it's because
the decision was all up to me.

1221
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,434
It was always all up to me.

1222
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:27,407
You were so afraid of being wrong,
you never made a choice.

1223
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,377
- At least you made it look that way.
- What does that mean?

1224
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:35,747
If you recall,
my first response to my mother's
offer to live here was absolutely not.

1225
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,547
- Lie.
- Absolutely not. You think about it.

1226
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,282
We were sitting in our bedroom
on 78th Street.

1227
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:43,290
We were smoking a joint
and listening to Al Green.

1228
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:45,952
- And I said, "Absolutely not."
- [Connie] I'm sorry...

1229
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,723
but I have had enough!

1230
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:51,288
I have never heard
of such a Christmas.!

1231
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,699
Sex and drugs a-a-and
women being set on fire!

1232
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,136
- I am taking my children upstairs right now.
- Connie, that's it.

1233
01:17:57,205 --> 01:18:01,699
- Sit down and shut up. Okay?
Sit down and shut up.
- Come on, kids...

1234
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:05,144
- We're going upstairs. Gary?
- I think this is more important.

1235
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:09,946
- Well, I think this is sick!
- Connie, honey, right now
nobody cares what you think.

1236
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:13,249
- You have not defended me
once this entire evening!
- Tell her to sit down.

1237
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,312
[All Arguing]

1238
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,324
Just sit down and
give these people...

1239
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,622
a little space
to work out their...

1240
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:23,461
- Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me!
- [Glass Shattering]

1241
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:34,772
- If you don't mind,
the corpse still has the foor.
- [Poker Hits Floor]

1242
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:39,837
I told you what moving here
could mean, but you were the one
who said we should consider it.

1243
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:42,850
Not the actual moving,
just the considering.

1244
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:46,354
The actual moving-in part
was left to me. Why?

1245
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,857
Because you didn't know what to do.
You were confused.

1246
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,950
You didn't know what
was the right thing.

1247
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:54,689
But you were sure as hell
sick and tired ofliving...

1248
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,697
in a one-bedroom apartment
in New York City.

1249
01:18:56,765 --> 01:19:00,292
So don't hand me that
"it was the best of times" bullshit!

1250
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:03,132
You didn't want to work anymore, and
you didn't want any help with the baby...

1251
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,139
because you wanted
to do it all by yourself.

1252
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,141
And you hated New York...

1253
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,700
because we weren't as rich as your
college friends were to enjoy it.

1254
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,973
We couldn't afford
a bigger place...

1255
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,777
and you were miserable
being around people who could.

1256
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:18,650
And... we were
up to our ears in debt.

1257
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,156
But moving here
was my decision.

1258
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,522
Right! And the loan
was same situation...

1259
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:28,620
What difference does any of this
make now? You're getting a divorce.

1260
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:30,688
- Mother.
- What?

1261
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,860
Is it possible for you to shut the fuck up
for ten seconds?

1262
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:41,568
Lloyd, don't talk to me
like that in my own house.

1263
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,582
You know what, Mom? You know what
I'm gonna get you next Christmas?

1264
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:53,519
A big wooden cross.

1265
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:57,115
So every time you feel unappreciated
for all your sacrifices...

1266
01:19:57,192 --> 01:20:00,719
you can climb on up
and nail yourself to it.

1267
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:04,232
Gary, get my bags.

1268
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:08,094

Is there some trouble?

01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:28,482
Yes, yes, and I couldn't in good
conscience let it wait any longer.

You'll never get away, you know.
You'll either be captured or killed.

World wars, old age,
marriage and weak men like you.

Men who don't have the guts
to survive in the real world.

Men who are just scared little boys

May I ask you
just one question?

Is there something that we don't give you?
What do you need all that money for?

- Gus, I'm going with you.
I'll give you a cut.
- What?

1330
01:23:56,398 --> 01:23:59,265
We can make it to the docks on foot.
We can take a shortcut.

1331
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:00,824
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down.

1332
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,063
You gotta take me with you.
I have no other option.

1333
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:07,006
- I can't stay here.
- What am I? The fuckin' circus?
Take you with me?

1334
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,908
- But come on!
- No, forget it. Forget it.

1335
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:11,969
Just forget it,
okay?

1336
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:16,643
Don't start running, kid.
Once you start, you never stop.
Believe me.

1337
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:23,415
Fine.
Fine, be that way.

1338
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:26,790
I'll just go
by myself then.

1339
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:30,627
Oh, please, Jesse, look.
Give us another...

1340
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:35,635
- Oh, Jesse. We screwed up, not you. Oh!
- [Doorbell Rings]

1341
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:39,469
[Sighs]
Shit. Who is that?

1342
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:44,304
Look, I promise you,
we'll take care of this.

1343
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:47,314
We'll fix everything.
No matter what happens
between me and your father...

1344
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:52,285
- You're splitting up?
- That's not your problem, honey.

1345
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:54,821
Hey, I'm in this family too,
you know.

1346
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:58,825
Every time you guys yell and scream
at each other, it is my problem, Mom.

1347
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:01,191
- Caroline, let's go.
- One second.

1348
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,425
Okay, a lot's happened
between me and Lloyd.

1349
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:08,595
We've made a lot of mistakes.
You got caught in the middle.

1350
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,996
Do you hate each other?

1351
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:15,099
[Doorbell
Continues Ringing]

1352
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,474
- No.
- Then you're staying together.

1353
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:21,481
- Caroline, come on. Let's go.
- Oh, just wait! Please!

1354
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:26,543
I don't know. I don't know
what your father wants.

1355
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,486
What do you want?

1356
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:32,617
Caroline.
Caroline, come on.

1357
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:38,629
We'll talk about this later, okay?
Just stay here, please.

1358
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:41,635
- We'll be back soon.
- What about Siskel?

1359
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:44,968
We'll fix it, honey. We'll give him
the money, the photos, anything.

1360
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:47,701
Just... stay right there.

1361
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,974
Hey!

1362
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,415
You know something?

1363
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,249
Lloyd, Caroline...

1364
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:05,588
- Every year we give you
a fruitcake for Christmas...
- Didn't you lock the door?

1365
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:10,097
And you don't give us
a goddamn thing.

1366
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:13,760
My wife thinks
it's because...

1367
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:17,965
Hey, you had a gun,
didn't you?

1368
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:20,269
- Me?
- Yes, you did. You did.

1369
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:23,936
- You had a gun. I saw it.
- No.

1370
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:27,971
- Hey, you're the guy.
You're the guy, aren't ya?
- Okay, pal.

1371
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,746
What, are you pulling a gun on me?
I'm not afraid of you.

1372
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:34,879
- Just calm down, all right?
- You think you can take me?

1373
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,891
I'm Santa Claus.
[Shouting]

1374
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:40,291
- [Gasping]
- [Santa Hits Floor]

1375
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:46,429
Great.
I just beat up Santa Claus.

1376
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:49,470
[Siren Wailing]

1377
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,267
Guys, the cops are here.
What are we gonna do?

1378
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,639
Central, Cruiser 252.
Panella speaking.

1379
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,701
I'm at the Chasseur house.
Over.

1380
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:02,943
- We gotta get you outta here.
- But I can't just leave.
I don't know where I'm goin'.

1381
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:05,349
Just keep pretending like you're
Dr. Wong. Then you don't have to go.

1382
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,411
- There's five people tied up
in the back room. Come on.
- Then we can hide you.

1383
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:09,456
- We can hide you anywhere.
I know this place.
- There's search teams.

1384
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:12,186
They search until they find what
they're looking for. It's a bad idea.

1385
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,627
No, it's a good idea. There's the mudroom,
the trap door in the mudroom.

1386
01:27:15,697 --> 01:27:17,756
- We'll put you in there. It'll be perfect.
- No, no, no.

1387
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:19,823
- Or the trunk of the Beamer.
The trunk of the Beamer's a good place.
- No, no.

1388
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,768
- [Siren Wailing]
- Oh, I know. The hope chest.!
We'll put you in the hope chest.

1389
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:25,931
- I can pretend I've lost the key.
- Forget about it! No, no, no!

1390
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:30,341
[Gus]
What about the basement?
Is there a tunnel or a hole?

1391
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,777
Path through the woods!

1392
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:35,475
Jesse, quick, take Gus
to the path through the woods.

1393
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,347
You said you know a shortcut
to the docks, right?

1394
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,443
You're the only one
that can take him.

1395
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:45,754
Well, what do you want
us to do? Turn him in?

1396
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:52,032
I can't spend my whole life sending
everybody I care about to prison.

1397
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,625
Go on.

1398
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:57,136
Okay, Dad. Come on, Gus.
Let's get outta here.

1399
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,503
[Lloyd]
And be careful.

1400
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:03,977
- All right, go, go, go. We'll stall the cops.
- [George Groaning]

1401
01:28:04,045 --> 01:28:09,950
If I were a senator...
[Groaning]

1402
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,322
- How many more after this?
- Sixteen.

1403
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,985
- Geez.
- 419, we're over at Seabury Court. Over.

1404
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,324
- 419, dispatch.
- Yeah, we're starting canvassing...

1405
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:23,421
[Knocking]
State police!

1406
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:29,334
There's got to be someone
home with all these lights
and that car in the driveway.

1407
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:32,840
Ah, geez.
We got a live one.

1408
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:35,000
I need some people to surround
this house right now.

1409
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:38,341
Eddie, get your men in here!
Hit it!

1410
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:44,010
[Muffed Talking]

1411
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:46,178
Oh, my God! Thank God you're here!
You've got to hurry!

1412
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:48,449
- You have no idea the nightmare
I've been through!
- He left an hour ago.

1413
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:51,356
- He went to an airport in Hartfo...
Would you shut up?
- The entire night...

1414
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,519
I'm trying to give them
important information. He went
to an airport in Hartford.

1415
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:56,358
Oh, I suppose you're the only one
who's been tied up all night.

1416
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,296
- I didn't say that.
- What is this? A men's club?

1417
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:02,803
Excuse me.! Are there any other
hostages in the house?

1418
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,474
- No.
- No.

1419
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,807
- Oh, kid. Ah, Jesus.
- Come on, Gus.

1420
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,971
There's no better route
than this with less snow?

1421
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:15,311
No, this is it.
This is the best route.

1422
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:17,977
- This is the best route?
- We'll be there in no time. Come on!

1423
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:20,543
I might need a wheelchair,
I'm telling you, kid.

1424
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:23,488
I distinctly heard him say that he was
headed to a small airport in Hartford.

1425
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:26,823
And from there he was taking
a private plane to Vancouver.

1426
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,828
- [Caroline] No, no, it was not Vancouver.
- What's going on?

1427
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,830
- [Lloyd] Yes, it was Vancouver.
- We're working on it.

1428
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,833
- He was on the phone,
and he said Yugoslavia.
- Yugoslavia.!

1429
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,994
There is no Yugoslavia anymore.
And who in their right mind
would go there?

1430
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:38,368
- He's not in his right mind!
- All right!

1431
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:43,007
- Oh, uh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1432
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:45,568
Would you like us to come downtown
and give our statement?

1433
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:48,740
- [Both] No!
- We'd be willing to do that.

1434
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:50,750
- No, no, no, no.
- Thanks anyway. Hey, merry Christmas.

1435
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:53,150
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you very much.

1436
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,155
- Oh. Well, if you're sure.
- Bye. Bye-bye.

1437
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,986
- Good night, everybody.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

1438
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:08,293
- [Jesse] Docks are down
the street on your left.
- [Siren Blares]

1439
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:12,100
Hey, George! The curfew!
Go home! Get off the streets!

1440
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:14,971
Home, George,
home.

1441
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:17,476
Guess I ought to be
getting home now.

1442
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:19,979
Good idea.

1443
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:23,483
You know, I think things are
gonna be different with Dad.

1444
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:28,818
If they're not, I'll blackmail him.
See ya, Gus.

1445
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:31,324
Take it easy.

1446
01:30:31,392 --> 01:30:33,485
Christ.

1447
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:35,995
I'm never having kids.

1448
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:42,328
So do you think
we should go untie everybody?

1449
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:45,497
No. We should unwrap them
in the morning.

1450
01:30:45,573 --> 01:30:48,007
- It'll be more festive.
- [Laughing]

1451
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,447
So what aboutJesse?

1452
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,786
Well, Siskel said if we give him back
the pictures he won't press charges.

1453
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:07,954
No, no, l, um...
I mean about us.

1454
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:10,463
What do we tell him
about us?

1455
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:20,140
Oh, Carrie.

1456
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:26,574
Sorry, but Grandma's
eating through her gag.

1457
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:32,482
You know something?
You are a piece of work, pal.

1458
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:35,147
I tell you to get a boat, and this is what
you get? Get out of the fuckin' way.

1459
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:38,158
- Uh, Gussie?
- What?

1460
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:41,662
- When are we gonna open presents?
- Presents?

1461
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:44,163
Is that what you said?
Presents? I'll tell you what.

1462
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:46,166
As soon as we get back,
we're gonna open the presents.
Matter of fact, I'll tell ya.

1463
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:49,328
I'll save you the trouble. Your present
is a giant, fuckin' cannon, okay?

1464
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:51,337
And when we get back, you're
gonna crawl into it, okay?

1465
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:53,669
I'm gonna put two pounds of gunpowder
in there, I'm gonna light it up...

1466
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:55,834
and I'm gonna shoot you right
out into fuckin'Jersey, okay?

1467
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:59,277
And then I'm gonna steal a car
and drive toJersey and pick up
all the little fuckin' pieces...

1468
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:01,941
of your body, put 'em in a big plastic
bag, bring it back to my house...

1469
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:04,951
put 'em in the fireplace,
light 'em on fire. I'm gonna sit
there with a glass of whiskey...

1470
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:10,116
and watch the Charlie Brown special
with your ashes heatin'
my fuckin' house! Oh!

1471
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,456
- [Sniffing] Gus?
- What?

1472
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,621
- What's that smell?
- Shut up.

1473
01:32:15,897 --> 01:32:18,991
?? Life keeps me waiting??

1474
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:24,467
?? Against my will??

1475
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,975
?? Believe it or not??

1476
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:34,139
?? I know my own mind??

1477
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:42,485
?? Don't got no spark??

1478
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:52,666
?? Don't got no will??

1479
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:59,271
?? I'm weary??

1480
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:02,605
?? Nothing holds me??

1481
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:07,272
?? Eternally seeking??

1482
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:12,782
?? Through the windows of pain??

1483
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:22,789
?? Don't got no spark??

1484
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:33,135
?? Don't got no will??

1485
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:37,640
?? I'm weary??

1486
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:42,645
?? Don't have the answer????

1487
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:07,265
?? Why??

1488
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:11,937
?? Can't we get our lives together??

1489
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:18,452
?? How??

1490
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:23,456
?? Can we stop hurting each other??

1491
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:29,295
?? Pray??

1492
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,957
?? To God that you can go??

1493
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:34,297
?? Stay??

1494
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:36,632
?? Outside this broken circle??

1495
01:34:36,704 --> 01:34:40,140
?? Losing your??

1496
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:42,641

?? We all must sacrifiice??

1498
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:48,648
?? We pay the price
We pay the price??

1499
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:51,981
?? Ashes to ashes??

1500
01:34:53,721 --> 01:34:59,421
?? We all fall down??

1501
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:04,430
?? It's time for us to close this circle??

1502
01:35:04,498 --> 01:35:10,926
?? Can we get up off of the ground??

1503
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:14,441
?? Why??

1504
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:19,104
?? Can't we get our lives together??

1505
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:25,615
?? And how??

1506
01:35:25,686 --> 01:35:29,622
?? Can we start to make it better??

1507
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:36,129
?? Loving you is killing me??

1511
01:35:45,206 --> 01:35:47,299
?? Live??

1512
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:50,741
?? The other life we should have lived??
