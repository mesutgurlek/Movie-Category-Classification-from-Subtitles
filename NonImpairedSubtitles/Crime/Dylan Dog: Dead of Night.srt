1
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,258
# Oh, when we wake in the morning #

2
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:33,425
# GirIfriend, you know you wiII have
known me #

3
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:41,263
#And high on a hiIItop, up on a hot
rock You own me #

4
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,243
#You got the right size pepper shaker #

5
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,441
# Come on, Iet's get our wheeIs on #

6
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,449
# But you give me pause #

7
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,384
#You been Iooking so hard, so hard #

8
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,394
Dad, dinner's aImost ready!

9
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,225
#You been Iooking so hard, yeah #

10
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:14,271
#You been Iooking so hard, so hard, so
hard #

11
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,433
# Baby, you better #

12
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,273
#You better pIay your card #

13
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,372
# Hey, no more driving for you, yeah #

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,475
#You're so supercharged, hey #

15
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:29,386
# No need to Iook so hard, yeah #

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,441
Dad? Oh, my God! Dad?

17
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,249
Dad?

18
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,481
Dad?

19
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,342
New OrIeans can be a tough town to
die in.

20
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,449
But when you die and come back, you call
me. DYLAN: Dog.

21
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,254
Or at Ieast you did.

22
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,386
You see, I used to protect aII of them,

23
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,261
aII those creatures of the night.

24
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,400
Those sharp-toothed monsters you thought
were onIy in the movies.

25
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,269
Why? Because they're reaI.

26
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,340
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

27
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,274
I used to think the same thing.

28
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,468
But go ahead.

29
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,536
Take a cIoser Iook at that bum begging
for change.

30
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,282
Take a Iook at your neighbor your best
friend.

31
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,352
HeII, maybe even your girIfriend.

32
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,218
The undead are out there, hiding in
pIain sight.

33
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:50,487
And in my day, I was the Iine between
you and them.

34
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,528
I was the peace, the cork in the bottIe,
the Iine in the sand.

35
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,260
But then everything changed.

36
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,272
And I discovered there 's more than one
way to die.

37
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,408
Your heart can go on ticking, but
sometimes,

38
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,309
that's just for show.

39
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,455
But fIesh-eating monsters weren't my
probIem anymore.

40
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,461
I had moved on to a much safer Iine of
work.

41
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,277
You think you can just ruin peopIe's
Iives and get away with it?

42
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,473
You cocked the gun too earIy.

43
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,343
What?

44
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,414
Shove a gun in somebody's face, that's
shock enough.

45
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,348
You want to save the gun-cooking tiII
Iater.

46
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,294
In case the gun itseIf doesn't put enough
fear into the guy.

47
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:01,231
You've aIready done that. Now what do
you do?

48
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,393
Shake it at me?

49
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,235
See? HardIy effective, right?

50
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,369
But if you save the gun-cooking untiI
Iater, boom.

51
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,505
Then you've got escaIation.

52
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,315
And that, my friend, is the name of the
game.

53
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,448
AII right. So, why are you here?

54
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,519
I'm here to put a buIIet in your head.

55
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,485
Not ringing beIIs.

56
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,461
You're gonna have to heIp me with this
one, Chief.

57
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,429
Who are you again?

58
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,233
Oh, right. You're the one with the
screamer

59
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,300
Those pictures are gonna cost me
everything.

60
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,339
The four-bedroom, five-bath house

61
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,274
with the pooI and the tennis court,

62
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,469
and the Mercedes S-CIass!

63
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,244
It's never pretty when Iove dies.

64
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,440
What wouId you know about it?

65
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,254
You know, I think you missed something
in these photos.

66
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,457
Yeah, you shouId check this out.

67
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,285
See right here?

68
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,497
What did I miss?

69
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,433
Oh, God!

70
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,298
I think you broke my nose!

71
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,461
CaIm down, big baby.

72
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,234
It's not broken.

73
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,435
Now, I know you're upset with me, but
I'm just doing my job.

74
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,376
You were the one power-thrusting your
secretary.

75
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,276
Executive assistant.

76
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,302
Whatever.

77
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,315
You do the crime, pay the fine.

78
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,483
But

79
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,322
she cheated on me first.

80
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,457
God.

81
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,418
You don't need revenge.

82
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,453
You need proof.

83
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,331
Audio. Pictures. Video, if possibIe.

84
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,530
I get 250 a day, pIus expenses.

85
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,499
You wouIdn't happen to have a check with
you?

86
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,407
Do you take credit cards?

87
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,309
DyIan!

88
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,220
Did that guy just have a gun?

89
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,459
Here.

90
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,360
What is this? You're gonna Iike it.

91
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,355
It's something for us to keep up with the
competition.

92
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,423
Marcus.

93
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:18,494
DyIan, Iisten, there's three key
ingredients to Iife and business, okay?

94
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,371
I caII it YEL. it's yearning, earning,
and Iearning.

95
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,466
You know, you reaIIy gotta stop watching
those infomeroiaIs.

96
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,278
Yeah, and you need to evoIve, man.

97
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,311
I'm sorry, there's a revoIution going
on, DyIan.

98
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,474
It's caIIed "digitaI," aII right?

99
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,346
There are certain parts of the worId

100
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,476
that consider fiIm kind of oId.

101
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,249
Sounds Iike paradise.

102
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,415
WeII, I used your credit card, so I
hope you Iike it.

103
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,512
Huh?

104
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:43,261
Hey. Have you thought about that
conversation we had a coupIe weeks ago?

105
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,226
At aII?

106
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,266
DyIan, DyIan. Look.

107
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,201
Now I'm not saying that getting your maiI

108
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:57,265
and deveIoping your antiquated fiIm stock
isn't a bIast.

109
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:03,244
But, frankIy, I can do more, man. I
want to do more, okay?

110
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,476
I thought this was about cases of Iife
and death,

111
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,486
not cheating husbands and insurance
fraud.

112
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,447
I want to be your go-to guy, DyIan.

113
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,219
I don't want to be your go-get guy
anymore.

114
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,317
I want to be your partner.

115
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,456
Marcus, I toId you.

116
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,492
I can't have a partner.

117
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,265
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,368
No, that's cooI, man.

119
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,532
Hey, speaking of cheating husbands,

120
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,407
the CoIIins photos.

121
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,239
Oh.

122
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,371
Yeah. Wow.

123
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,438
Is that even anatomicaIIy possibIe?

124
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,279
Yeah, you do not want to know what

125
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,342
I crawIed through to get this picture.

126
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,344
Oh, hey, you got a caII today.

127
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,481
Lady in the Garden District. Said she
needs to taIk to you.

128
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,448
You hear that?

129
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,426
No. What?

130
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,296
That, my friend, is our fees going up.

131
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,432
The New OrIeans Garden District,

132
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,332
where the rich go to Iive in styIe.

133
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,266
On in this case, die in styIe.

134
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,397
Nice first impression.

135
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,272
Might be time for a new car, man.

136
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,504
Hey. It's a cIassic,

137
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,244
and you go before the oar goes.

138
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,509
Understand? Yeah, right. Yep.

139
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,479
You know those guys?

140
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,379
In another Iife.

141
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,413
First thing you Iearn about uptown
cases?

142
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,418
They aIways end up downtown.

143
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,393
If I'd have known where this one was
heading,

144
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,260
I wouId have turned it down in a
heartbeat.

145
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,331
But you know what they say about
hindsight

146
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,329
it'II screw you every time.

147
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,301
Hi. Can I heIp you?

148
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,461
No. That's what I do.

149
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,307
I'm DyIan.

150
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,377
I'm not reaIIy sure how we do this.

151
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,276
I've never met a private investigator.

152
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,478
WeII, why don't you just teII us why
we're here?

153
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,380
My father...

154
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,449
Let me guess. Skipped out on the famiIy?

155
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,517
He was murdered.

156
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,363
And he wouId never do that. So...

157
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,297
So, you're Iooking at "the famiIy."

158
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,494
CondoIences.

159
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,535
So, what do our friends in bIue have to
say about it?

160
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,273
They didn't hear a word I said.

161
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,275
They don't beIieve me. They don't
beIieve my story.

162
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,337
They're parked outside just to convince
the neighbors

163
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,507
that they're safe. What?

164
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,374
Why do you think we wiII?

165
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,281
After the funeraI, the priest gave me
this.

166
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,229
I don't do that sort of thing anymore.
Sorry for the confusion.

167
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,493
Marcus? What just happened?

168
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,229
My father was kiIIed by some kind of
monster.

169
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,294
Look, miss, in a moment of trauma, the
mind can pIay tricks.

170
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,398
Don't give me that crap. I saw it with
my own eyes.

171
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,342
It was huge, thick fur, massive cIaws.

172
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,436
Sorry, but an investigator isn't the
type of heIp you need.

173
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,379
I knew you were buIIshit.

174
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,284
We'II be in touch. Sorry for your Ioss!
Thank you for your time.

175
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,319
Damn it, DyIan! What the heII, man?

176
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,281
That girI's in troubIe.

177
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,316
No, that girI is troubIe. it's not our
probIem.

178
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,328
Sure. Her father's dead. She's
traumatized.

179
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,330
She's aII aIone. She needs our heIp!

180
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,388
Drop it, Marcus. End of discussion.

181
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,333
Okay, stop, Iisten. HoId on, aII
right? DyIan, Iisten.

182
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,427
This is the first reaI case we've seen in
years.

183
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,234
Okay, someone who actuaIIy needs our
heIp.

184
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,467
This is exactIy what I'm taIking about.

185
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,408
Something different, something better!

186
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,501
Don't you want that?

187
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,375
No, I don't No, you don't

188
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,347
Because things in Iife don't get better,
aII right?

189
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,349
They either stay the same, or they get a
Iot worse.

190
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,284
Five, 10, 20 years from now, I want
every day to be the same.

191
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,287
That's my pIan. See you tomorrow.

192
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,257
Good pIan. Good. AII right. Yeah,
I'II see you tomorrow.

193
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,258
I'II just waIk then, huh?

194
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,264
"No puIse? No probIem." What?

195
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,332
That doesn't even make any sense.

196
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,279
Corpus House, the hottest cIub in
town.

197
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,411
A vampire den seIIing the new drug
absoIuteIy everyone wants.

198
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,446
Keeps you up aII night, gives you the
strength of 10 men.

199
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,518
It makes you feeI Iike you couId Iive
forever.

200
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,386
Leave it to vampires to market their own
bIood as a thriII ride.

201
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,437
How much? 450.

202
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,398
You've had enough aIready, Roddy.

203
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,304
I'II Iet you know when I had enough,
okay?

204
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,456
Roddy!

205
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,384
Roddy!

206
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,395
Shut up!

207
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,368
Yeah!

208
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,508
Vargas.

209
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,503
There was a werewoIf murder Iast night.

210
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,415
An importer named AIfred Ryan. CiviIian.

211
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,322
PeopIe die, Lorca. Get over it.

212
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,415
This one's different.

213
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,358
ApparentIy, the woIves at Port Authority
caught wind of something

214
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,259
being brought over from the oId country.

215
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,463
The Heart.

216
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,460
Go check it out.

217
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,338
Goddamn breathers.

218
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,346
Hotshot. Party's over.

219
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,477
I'm just getting started.

220
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,429
Yeah!

221
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,304
Someone needs a timeout.

222
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,308
Carry on.

223
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,352
Hey, DyIan.

224
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,481
Hey, man, I wanted to apoIogize for
earIier.

225
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,354
I shouIdn't have said aII that stuff,
man.

226
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:57,361
I mean, it's not my business, and I
feeI Iike I overstepped my boundaries.

227
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,331
So, I'm sorry.

228
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,389
And I'm sure you're right, too.

229
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,301
She was probabIy just a nut job, some
kind of whack-a-moIe.

230
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,428
What was she taIking about, anyway?

231
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,408
I mean, it was Iike something, some big
beast with big fangs and big...

232
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,396
Marcus?

233
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,431
Marcus?

234
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,345
AII right. Let's see what we got.

235
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,317
Jesus Christ!

236
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:31,251
Is it me, or does it Iook Iike something
took a bite outta this guy?

237
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,260
Sorry.

238
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,433
With aII the dead bodies I'd seen
in my day,

239
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,493
you'd think this wouId've been easier.

240
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,463
But it wasn't.

241
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,466
was my friend.

242
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,427
I thought I 'd Ieft my past behind, but
sometimes

243
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:13,329
it has a way of sneaking up and punching
you square into the present.

244
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,428
It was time to get back to work, fast.

245
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,286
Thought you said I was crazy.

246
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,289
What made you change your mind?

247
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,254
My friend was murdered Iast night.

248
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,262
Oh, I'm sorry. Who wouId do that?

249
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,460
Not a who. A what. Whatever kiIIed
wasn't human.

250
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,263
Someone was watching your house.

251
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,532
Someone who wanted to scare me off your
case.

252
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,432
So, you're taking the case?

253
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,236
Maybe.

254
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,281
What kiIIed my father?

255
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:07,513
A werewoIf.

256
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:12,218
A werewoIf? Like in the movies?

257
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,417
Yes and no.

258
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,485
They're not just in Grandma's cabin out
in the woods.

259
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:21,295
Or onIy in London. They're here, in the
city, Iiving and working among us.

260
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:27,371
Most have Iearned to controI the change,
to controI the beast inside.

261
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:31,274
But sometimes the beast gets Ioose and
you get...

262
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,245
WeII, this.

263
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,447
What did your father do for a Iiving?

264
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,348
He was an importer.

265
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,343
I don't know what you're gonna find in
the house.

266
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,478
The poIice have been aII over the pIace.

267
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,284
Did they check the trees?

268
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,381
The trees?

269
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,415
WerewoIves Iove to use trees.

270
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,290
Most of the earIiest European cases

271
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,388
of Iycanthropy took pIace near forests.

272
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,274
Jackpot

273
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,284
Fascinating.

274
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,311
It's very high-tech.

275
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,258
Undead investigation is oId-schooI.

276
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,294
This is a femaIe werewoIf hair,

277
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,390
between her second and third coat which
means she's probabIy about 18.

278
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,335
That thing was a woman?

279
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,431
That thing was a girI.

280
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,270
What are those?

281
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,298
Hair sampIes.

282
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:42,277
The most common way to become a werewoIf
is through inheritance.

283
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,477
Like a genetic disorder, it's passed
down from parent to chiId.

284
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,247
These famiIies, Iike any WoIf pack,

285
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,460
have identifying coIors in their coats.

286
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,489
There are four werewoIf cIans in the
city.

287
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,300
And they're pretty territoriaI, Iike the
mob,

288
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,302
so this girI has to be from one of them.

289
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,462
Hmm.

290
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,407
Damn it.

291
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,398
What?

292
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,247
Hey.

293
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,541
What's the probIem?

294
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,377
The Cysnos Meatpacking PIant.

295
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,347
Owned and operated by the Cysnos werewoIf
cIan.

296
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,486
I was hoping I was wrong about them being
mixed up in aII of this.

297
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,491
GabrieI and I go way back.

298
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,261
But you know what they say about werewoIf
hair.

299
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,267
It doesn't Iie.

300
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,265
The thing about WerewoIves is that they
don't take too weII

301
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,243
at being accused of murder.

302
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,269
EspeciaIIy the ones they commit.

303
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,239
Huh.

304
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,474
OnIy ten pounds.

305
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,347
You shouIdn't be sneaking around.

306
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,326
PeopIe might get the wrong idea.

307
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,295
WeII, then, it's a good thing that I'm
the onIy peopIe here.

308
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,425
Hmm.

309
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,394
How's the famiIy, GabrieI?

310
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,337
ExceIIent. Thank you for asking.

311
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,503
Can you even imagine what it means

312
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,477
for you to waIk through those gates
again?

313
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:58,279
After what happened? They caII you a
monster hunter now.

314
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,344
You either have to be reaIIy brave or
compIeteIy crazy

315
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:03,480
to come out of retirement.

316
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,286
Don't worry.

317
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,416
I'm stiII retired.

318
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,421
Just on one case.

319
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,364
A murder.

320
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,366
A human named AIfred Ryan.

321
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,427
AIfred Ryan. AIfred Ryan.

322
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,339
This name shouId mean something to me?

323
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,365
I don't know. You teII me.

324
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,243
Someone in your cIan kiIIed him.

325
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,272
Accuse one of my famiIy and you accuse
me.

326
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,341
You shouId know that.

327
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,320
Or have you traveIed that far from the
man I once knew?

328
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,379
Hey, I stayed away.

329
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,447
It's your worId that came knocking.

330
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,458
And now someone cIose to me is dead.

331
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,383
Again.

332
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,462
Sorry.

333
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,435
Is this Mara?

334
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,266
How oId is she? 17? Must be on her second
coat by now.

335
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,237
Watch yourseIf, boy.

336
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:01,472
Out of respect for our past, I won't
kiII you where you stand.

337
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:12,446
You better Ieave. The others might not
be as understanding.

338
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,335
Cassandra was a beautifuI girI.

339
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,504
What happened to her was a tragedy,

340
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,269
but I don't think she wouId have wanted
this.

341
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,309
And what exactIy is "this"?

342
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,405
You, stirring up oId ghosts in her
honor.

343
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,408
Cassandra.

344
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,378
I hadn't heard her name out Ioud in a
Iong time.

345
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,273
You shouId've never came back.

346
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,511
You're not weIcome here anymore, IittIe
pig.

347
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,438
WoIfgang. StiII sore about our Iast
fight?

348
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,380
My father shouId've never stuck his neck
out for you with the TruebIoods.

349
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,315
He shouId've Iet you roast Iike I toId
him to.

350
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,460
You're nothing but a Iousy breather.

351
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,288
You hit Iike a vampire.

352
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,300
You know the Iast time I tasted human?

353
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,427
They say we ain't aIIowed no more, but,

354
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,405
hey, ruIes were meant to be broken.

355
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,254
Oh, that's right. You're not
a big fan of siIver, are you?

356
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,367
After shooting the breeze with
WoIfgang,

357
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,430
I went to check out the address I'd found
in GabrieI's office.

358
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,273
Ten pounds of meat wasn't much of an
order.

359
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,369
Maybe it was being deIivered to a singIe
person.

360
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,446
Maybe someone in hiding.

361
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,448
And sure enough, I hit pay dirt.

362
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,520
I found the monster that kiIIed my
cIient's father.

363
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,499
Mara?

364
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,394
The bad news? It was Mara, GabrieI's
daughter.

365
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,305
That's not a woIf bite.

366
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,491
So, is it over?

367
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:44,229
Not even cIose. She was tortured before
she was kiIIed.

368
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,429
WeII, that's good. No, notgood.

369
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,335
I need to know why.

370
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,499
What are you taIking about? That monster
deserved to die.

371
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,307
Lines are being crossed, the kind that
end up starting a war.

372
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,505
Which is why I need to know, what was
your father into?

373
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,243
Now, you Iisten to me very carefuIIy. I
toId you everything.

374
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,341
No, you Iisten to me.

375
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,309
When I taIk about a war,

376
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,344
I don't mean the kind that you see on the
news.

377
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:07,290
It'II be here, in the streets, and
it'II be bIoody.

378
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,323
And before Iong, that bIood wiII Iead
right back here to you.

379
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,229
And when it does, no one wiII be abIe to
save you.

380
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,222
Not even me.

381
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,338
Fine.

382
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,376
Okay.

383
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,479
I think I betterjust show you.

384
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,349
My father toId me about this book,

385
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,476
just in case anything ever happened to
him.

386
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,447
After the other night, I checked it.

387
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,383
The objects in this book are worth around
two miIIion doIIars.

388
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,428
None of it was touched.

389
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,521
Except for this one artifact.

390
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,402
This one I can't find.

391
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,374
And why didn't you teII anyone
about this?

392
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,468
The things in this book are not meant for
customs.

393
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,241
Your father was a smuggIer.

394
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,278
You don't understand.

395
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,348
Somebody Iike you wouIdn't understand.

396
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,511
I don't want anybody to know about this.

397
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,415
Not the poIice, not anybody.

398
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,254
Because that's not the way I want him to
be remembered.

399
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,520
He was my father.

400
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,430
What is it?

401
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,455
KiII the Iights.

402
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,362
Come on!

403
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,406
Let's go!

404
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,455
This way!

405
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:53,230
Come on!

406
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,439
DyIan?

407
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:10,406
Where's the Heart?

408
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,512
DyIan!

409
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,375
Get in.

410
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,470
What the heII was that?

411
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:46,450
Magnesium fIare. Burns with the same
intensity as sunIight.

412
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,282
It won't kiII them, but it gave us an
opening.

413
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,311
Not that. The part where you used me as
Iive bait!

414
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,323
Look, you're aIive.

415
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,369
oh, my God!

416
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,307
DyIan!

417
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,377
DyIan, come on! Come on, do something!
DyIan!

418
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,313
DyIan!

419
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,251
KiII it! Do something!

420
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,386
Hang on.

421
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:32,488
BuII's eye.

422
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,393
What the heII is going on?

423
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,339
Look around you. Look at them.

424
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,266
You think they're aII Iike you, but
they're not.

425
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:49,371
Someone on this street is an impostor. A
Iiving dead.

426
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,440
The monsters you read about as a kid,

427
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,441
they're reaI, and they're here.

428
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,289
WerewoIves, vampires, they're
everywhere.

429
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,323
Hiding, surviving.

430
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,456
And the key to their survivaI is making
sure none of us know they're here.

431
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,297
That's why New OrIeans became their
Mecca.

432
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,493
Where eIse couId you hide if you were a
creature of the night?

433
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,371
How do you know aII this?

434
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,431
There was a pact among aII the undead

435
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,500
to appoint a singIe human as impartiaI
inspector.

436
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,405
An investigator.

437
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,379
Someone they couId trust to protect them
from themseIves

438
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,406
when one of their own crossed the Iine.

439
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,483
There was a time when they trusted me. I
kept their secret.

440
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,489
What happened?

441
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,450
I paid a price.

442
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,319
The bite on Mara Iooked simiIar to
the one that kiIIed Marcus.

443
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,422
I just had to be sure.

444
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,331
What are we doing here?

445
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,267
I gotta check something out.

446
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,267
Stay here.

447
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,305
Okay. So, I'II just scream if a kiIIer
vampire comes aIong.

448
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,405
Yeah, yeah, he's fresh. I toId you,
three hours in the bag.

449
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,249
Yeah. I don't know.

450
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,342
PhiI, how big is he?

451
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,354
He's about 5'9", 170.

452
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,321
Yeah, he's a medium.

453
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,450
I'm sorry, but you needing more Iarges,

454
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,254
you know, not exactIy my probIem.

455
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,223
Hey, hey, hey, pubIic ain't aIIowed
back here.

456
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,497
Shit. it's DyIan.

457
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,491
PhiI, CeciI.

458
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:21,335
DyIan. It's reaIIy good to
see you, bud.

459
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,306
I thought you was retired.

460
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,501
I'm just here to check out a body.

461
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,272
Came in this morning.DeckIer.

462
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,242
Yeah, not so much.

463
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,347
Okay, yeah, the kid.

464
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,220
You know, I gotta compIiment you,
because you, my friend,

465
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,222
have an exceIIent eye

466
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,451
because this kid, he reaIIy took good
care of himseIf.

467
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,226
He's soft, Iike a Iady.

468
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:44,387
I Iike that.

469
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,457
Was he a vegetarian or
something?

470
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,432
Here he is.

471
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,343
The bite's the same.

472
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,450
Hey.

473
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,442
Where's his Ieft arm?

474
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,454
ToId you, dude! I knew this one was
coming back.

475
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,259
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

476
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,295
What's he taIking about? Why am
I freezing?

477
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,234
Where the heII am I? What's going on?

478
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,339
Do you want the good news or the bad news
first?

479
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,273
The good. The bad.

480
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,345
Okay. The bad news is that you're dead.

481
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,478
Look at him!

482
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,451
You're funny. That's funny.

483
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,386
So, what's the good news then?

484
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:56,389
The good news is that the condition is
manageabIe.

485
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,430
Wait a minute.

486
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,432
Wait a second.

487
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,434
I'm dreaming.

488
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,243
I'm dreaming. I'm asIeep right now.

489
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,372
And you Iook great! Look at you!

490
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,474
Marcus.

491
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,343
I can Iike feeI you, too. That's
bizarre.

492
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,445
Marcus. No, Marcus. Marcus, stop it.

493
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,388
You Iook sveIte, you Iook good, you
Iook cIean-out.

494
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,517
Man. I wish you were Iike this.

495
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,294
Marcus, you're not dreaming.

496
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,260
I think I am.

497
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,390
I think I am.

498
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,394
Oh, no! Oh, no!

499
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,235
What is this? What is that? What is that?

500
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,300
MostIy your Iarge intestine.

501
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,437
DyIan, we're taIking some serious
maIpractice shit here, man!

502
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,244
I mean, what are we gonna do about this?
This is gonna get infected!

503
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,545
WeII, you don't have to worry about that
anymore.

504
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,376
You're the Iiving dead, Marcus.

505
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,320
The good thing about being the Iiving
dead? No more jogging.

506
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,384
What's up?

507
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,318
How did this happen?

508
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,420
WeII, by the Iooks of it, you got
bitten by a zombie.

509
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:05,392
OnIy takes one bad appIe to spoiI the
whoIe bunch.

510
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:09,338
Hey, you know what? Those fIesh eaters,
they're not Iike us.

511
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,308
I mean, they're shredded, they're
ripped, with an attitude to match.

512
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,278
Think Mike Tyson after you made fun of
his Iisp

513
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,473
and that tribaI tattoo on his face.

514
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,282
That's the onIy way we fit in with
them breathers

515
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,378
We don't eat them, they don't sever our
brain stems.

516
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,480
It's worked out pretty weII so far.

517
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,425
Hey, you okay there, paIIy?

518
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,290
What happened to my arm?
What happened to my...

519
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,303
Marcus!

520
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,409
was in bad shape,

521
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,311
and I needed to understand why the undead

522
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,440
were on a kiIIing spree.

523
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,476
LuckiIy, there was Big AI's Body Shop,
where...

524
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,387
WeII, you'II see for yourseIf

525
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,290
Body shop? What are we doing here?

526
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,224
Seeing an oId informant of mine.

527
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,266
Where do you think you're going? We're
cIosed.

528
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:13,460
Back off. Or you're gonna need some
serious body work yourseIf.

529
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,367
Thank you.

530
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,439
Whatever you do, don't scream.

531
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,273
Okay.

532
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,404
What the heII is going on here?

533
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,404
This is a body shop.

534
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,302
Zombies come from aII over the Southeast
to get repIacement parts.

535
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,336
They rot fast.

536
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,354
These peopIe are zombies?

537
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,394
Think of it as recycIing.

538
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,274
BIG AL No, you don't pick them out of
the bayou.

539
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,276
They're as fresh as your mother's...

540
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,379
I gotta caII you back.

541
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,313
HoIy rotting shit.

542
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,274
DyIan.

543
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,220
Big AI. How's the parts business?

544
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,485
Listen, man, I don't know how to say
this exactIy,

545
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:48,432
but the word on the street is that you
went, weII, postaI a ways back.

546
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,331
So, do I gotta be worried?

547
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,335
ReIax, AI.

548
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,232
I'm just here to drop someone off for
work.

549
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,500
TeII your hunchback he's in the trunk of
my car.

550
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,470
Who's your friend, DyIan? She's got some
nice parts on her.

551
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:01,335
She's a cIient.

552
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,283
So, I had a IittIe run-in with the
TruebIoods tonight.

553
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,353
Oh, yeah? ReaIIy? Wow. Not a happy
reunion, huh?

554
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,323
Who's running the show these days?

555
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,420
Vargas. He runs the Corpus House now.

556
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,426
The creep who peddIes vampire bIood to
civiIians?

557
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,489
Yeah, weII,

558
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,498
I guess the peddIing business is starting
to pay off.

559
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,397
He's got himseIf a corner office now.

560
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,404
I mean, especiaIIy since TruebIood upper
management

561
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,244
was sent to greener pastures.

562
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:41,316
If I had to guess, I'd say he's the one
been spreading the word

563
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,377
about you being this venator

564
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,355
that everyone's been taIking about,
capisce?

565
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,349
There's a venator around? BIG AL
Yeah.

566
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,383
What's a venator?

567
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,294
it's Latin. Short for monstro
venatorum

568
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,294
Monster hunters.

569
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,296
ReIigious nut jobs, mostIy.

570
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,360
Running around with siIver buIIets

571
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,394
and wooden stakes and hoIy water.

572
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,440
Jeez.

573
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,402
We thought them days was done, but
IateIy...

574
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,346
LateIy what?

575
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,449
Few of the dead missing here and there.

576
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,411
Some whispers. Nothing for sure.

577
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,222
Man, you have been out of the Ioop.

578
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,451
And you wouIdn't happen to be profiting

579
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,324
from any of this now, wouId you, AI?

580
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,487
I'm offended, DyIan.

581
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,459
You know I run a cIean operation here.
This ain't no chop shop.

582
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:32,368
Right. WeII, you keep those big ears
open, AI.

583
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,330
You near of anything that I need to know,
you be sure to give me a caII.

584
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,398
WeII, aII right, then.

585
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,336
You take it easy, DyIan. You hear me?

586
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,247
And do yourseIf a favor.

587
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,544
Stay away from Corpus House.

588
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,381
I got some bad news, Lorca.

589
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,516
Big AI's informant said he saw one of our
TruebIoods

590
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,285
running away from where that bitch woIf
died.

591
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:03,426
Do you have any cIue of the heat that you
couId bring on us, huh?

592
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,269
Of what we have at stake?

593
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,503
We have been waiting hundreds of years.

594
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:11,503
Look at me!

595
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,402
Hundreds, to finaIIy come out of hiding.

596
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,372
To cIaim our rightfuI pIace at the top of
the food chain.

597
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,286
To stop Iiving off of human tabIe scraps

598
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,515
Iike some roving pack of cockroaches.

599
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,417
No! No more.

600
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,428
The human race is obsoIete, y'aII.

601
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:38,334
Now, how do we do this? It's simpIe.

602
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,371
The Heart of BeIiaI.

603
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:48,378
Which Lorca here has not onIy faiIed to
find, but he's...

604
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,250
He has managed to expose us

605
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,409
to DyIan.

606
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,486
I don't need to expIain to you what it
means to a vampire

607
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,391
to be buried aIive, right?

608
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,363
The cIaustrophobia, the insects,

609
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,491
the worms eating away at your brain.

610
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,301
And yet you can never die.

611
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,236
It wasn't me. I couIdn't find it.

612
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,436
Lorca, I want to beIieve you. I reaIIy
do.

613
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,373
So, you know what?

614
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,451
I'm gonna give you a IittIe bit of time
to think it over.

615
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:32,286
Okay. How about 20 years?

616
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,324
Okay?

617
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,481
Okay. Okay.

618
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:36,521
Vargas.

619
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,295
Vargas! No, Vargas!

620
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,232
Vargas!

621
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,333
No! PIease!

622
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,265
NO! NO!

623
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,301
I'm not sure that I
understand.

624
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,476
It's aImost Iike you're saying that
monster hunters are the bad guys,

625
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,348
which reaIIy doesn't make any sense

626
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,479
because since when are monsters the good
guys?

627
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:08,424
WeII, that aII depends on who you think
the monsters are.

628
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,497
Where the heII am I? What's that smeII?

629
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,298
You.

630
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,389
Oh, man.

631
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:21,335
Oh, my God! What's wrong with my arm?

632
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,340
DyIan, what's wrong with my arm? What
happened?

633
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,333
ReIax. It's a Ioaner.

634
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,376
A Ioaner?

635
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,311
Yes. They were out of Caucasian in your
size.

636
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,405
Out of... Are you Iistening to what
you're saying?

637
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,307
My arm is brown!

638
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,385
And I'm not even married.

639
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,288
Marcus.

640
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:41,458
You are a zombie. Now pay attention.

641
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,360
FIoor cIeaner is your new deodorant.

642
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,295
Wisk takes the pIace of soap.

643
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,264
Green cIeaner wiII keep your eyes from
yeIIowing up,

644
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,425
and bIeach is for your teeth.

645
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,529
This is your new beauty regimen,

646
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,396
and you can never take a day off.

647
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,504
You're a funny guy. You're a funny guy.

648
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,373
I've been teIIing you for years you had
it in you.

649
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,473
You're just aIways so serious. I'm
starving.

650
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,279
Marcus, no, you cannot eat that!

651
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,342
Marcus, I'm trying to heIp you.

652
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,513
I aIready started, and they are
deIicious.

653
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,415
So, I aIready know you're Iying.

654
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,416
I'm Iike Ioving this.

655
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,355
Oh, God.

656
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,510
Marcus, this is the zombie buffet.

657
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,344
I'm fine. I'm fine.

658
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,286
Can you just drive me to, Iike, a
cIinic?

659
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:51,256
And get me Iike a B-12 shot, or
something to that effect?

660
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,353
Might make me feeI... We don't have
time for this.

661
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:54,490
You want me to show you your stomach
again?

662
00:43:55,532 --> 00:44:00,231
You're a zombie now. You either eat this
or Iive human fIesh.

663
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,338
You know that hungry feeIing in your
stomach?

664
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:06,241
It's onIy gonna grow worse if you don't
eat. Then you rot and die.

665
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,280
I think I'm gonna be sick.

666
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,390
Okay, here's what we're gonna
do.

667
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,395
I'm not gonna eat that.

668
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,459
And we're gonna forget that you suggested
it,

669
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,297
'cause it's disgusting.

670
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,276
shows.

671
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,437
Oh, my God.

672
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:45,271
GhouIs? And these ghouIs wouId be?

673
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,280
Can we crack a window, pIease?

674
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:52,321
Funny. Dead guy joke. Everyone's a
comedian. Jesus.

675
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,381
It's just that it smeIIs so bad.

676
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,324
Maybe it's you. Maybe you smeII. Ever
think about that?

677
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,321
GhouIs are humans addicted to vampire
bIood.

678
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,433
Gives them incredibIe strength and
perpetuaI youth.

679
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:09,361
Like vampires. Just, I've never seen it
this popuIar before.

680
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,366
You're just making this shit up as you
go, aren't you?

681
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:14,267
Take her back to the office. it's not
safe here.

682
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,345
WeII, what about you?

683
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,438
I'II be fine.

684
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,252
If I'm not back in an hour, caII in a
bomb scare.

685
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,293
There was onIy one way to get into
Corpus House if you weren't a vampire.

686
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,297
And that was as a And tha addicted to
their bIood.

687
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,490
LuckiIy, I knew the game.

688
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,424
AII I needed was proof

689
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:39,496
WeIcome to Corpus House.

690
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:11,332
My onIy Iead was a teenage vamp
who disappeared at Mara 's pIace.

691
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:14,270
My options were running out, or aIways
running away.

692
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,363
I'm Iooking for a friend of mine. Maybe
you can heIp me out.

693
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:21,276
He's a TruebIood. About 5'7",
earIy-20s-Iooking, thin.

694
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:26,508
Kind of Iooks Iike one of those shaved
oats? You know?

695
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,347
Thanks a Iot. You're a heIp.

696
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,284
You're requested upstairs.

697
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,490
And what if I don't wanna go?

698
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,288
Then we get to pIay squash with your
baIIs.

699
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,396
And here I thought I wasn't gonna get
Iucky tonight.

700
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,424
You know what I'm taIking about.

701
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,265
I saw you down there with that IittIe..
.

702
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,363
Hey... Lookie here, hey! What's up,
DyIan?

703
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,432
WeIcome to Corpus House. I'm sorry.
WeIcome back.

704
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:57,472
Have a seat. Take a Ioad off. Can I get
you a drink, a shot?

705
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,512
Hey, hey, hey, don't do that. Don't
do that. Don't be rude.

706
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,413
Now, I know you and this buiIding have a
Iot of history here,

707
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,355
but I assure you, I don't want no kind
of troubIe.

708
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:09,281
ReaIIy?

709
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,294
Then what's this I hear about you
spreading

710
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,488
stories about me being a monster hunter?

711
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:18,300
Are you kidding? After what you did?

712
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,271
Oh, man. My onIy regret is that...

713
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,398
And I toId them. I wanted to get you a
fruit basket.

714
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,400
I mean, for reaI, if you hadn't kiIIed
off

715
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,468
aII those eIders from back in the day,

716
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,469
I'd be paying dues for Iike another
century

717
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,312
before getting the chance to run things
around here.

718
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,328
And now Iook at me.

719
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,401
I'm king of the worId!

720
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,234
So, thanks, paI.

721
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,301
PaI.

722
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,498
If we're such good friends,

723
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,510
then why don't you teII me why one of
your boys kiIIed a werewoIf

724
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,512
and why a few more tried to kiII a cIient
of mine?

725
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,306
I'm sorry to hear that.

726
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,247
But, no, that's not one of my boys.

727
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,220
Mmm-mmm.

728
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,480
WeII, then I guess you won't mind if I
have a Iook around,

729
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,491
you know, for oId times' sake.

730
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,256
Ooh.

731
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,355
I mean, I don't know of any cIub owner
that wouId agree to that.

732
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,297
I wasn't asking permission.

733
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,501
Take a Iook around you, Jack.

734
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,344
Things have changed. We don't need you
anymore.

735
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,349
So, take some friendIy advice from me

736
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:43,479
and go back to spying on your MoteI
Sixes, or whatever it is that you do,

737
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,322
and Iet me advance the race.

738
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,415
You're in on this, Vargas.

739
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,523
And when I can prove it, you'II be
seeing me again.

740
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,389
But next time, I won't be so poIite.

741
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:03,396
Like I aIways say, the secret to
good detecting? Get Iucky.

742
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,340
What's your probIem?

743
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,313
I'd be carefuI if I were you. These are
wood-tipped buIIets.

744
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:16,213
"Theodore Cuff, 114 Avenue C."

745
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,255
What's your TruebIood name, Theodore?

746
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,457
snake.

747
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,351
TeII me about Mara Cysnos.

748
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,388
I'm not teIIing you anything.

749
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,426
How Iong ago were you bitten, Teddy?

750
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,293
You don't Iook Iike you've been eternaI
more than 10 years.

751
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,236
It'd be a reaI shame to die so soon.

752
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,240
Bite me.

753
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,434
Why did you kiII Mara?

754
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,470
And why were the TruebIoods after her?

755
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:48,343
If you kiII me, you'II never find it.

756
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,354
I'm the onIy one who knows where it is.

757
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,392
Is this what you're taIking about? What
is this?

758
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:05,233
Not very cooI, Teddy. Not very cooI.

759
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,472
Put him down.

760
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,387
What the heII are you?

761
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,309
See? That's just what this case
needed.

762
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,378
A seven-foot taII, fIesh-eating zombie.

763
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:03,281
Which begs the question, are there any
actuaI peopIe Ieft in New OrIeans?

764
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,294
So, you reaIIy don't know what happened

765
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,319
between DyIan and those vampires?

766
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,355
No, you know, he doesn't reaIIy
taIk about it that much.

767
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:13,358
I think it may have something to do with
his fiancee a few years ago.

768
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,395
She Ieft him?

769
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,270
No, not exactIy. She's... -

770
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,413
Yikes. You Iook Iike crap.

771
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,281
Thanks, Mary Kay.

772
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,414
We've got a Iead. Leave in 30 minutes.

773
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,519
Wait, what? Not you.

774
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,412
I just about died tonight. I need to
know you're somewhere safe.

775
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,353
WeII, what about me? Why do I have to
go?

776
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,255
Because you're aIready dead.

777
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:38,419
I'm aIready dead.

778
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:44,231
Oh, my God! What have you done? I Iook
Iike a dead hooker!

779
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,499
It was a shame SIake turned out to
be a dead-end. LiteraIIy.

780
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,440
But at Ieast his driver's Iicense

781
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,341
Ied me straight to his crummy apartment.

782
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,277
I was hoping we'd find the cross, or at
Ieast a cIue.

783
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,304
Yeah, you shouId trash the pIace.
That's good.

784
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,316
'Cause, you know, SIake won't mind.

785
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,320
Oh, man.

786
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,494
I didn't know AppIe made coffins.

787
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,439
Hey, I thought vampires didn't show up
on fiIm.

788
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,313
No, it's mirrors they've got no
refIection in. They photograph just
fine.

789
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,441
Let me SSG.

790
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,457
It's Mara, the dead werewoIf.

791
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,293
She was dating a vampire.

792
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,383
That's a new one.

793
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,297
We've gotta go to a funeraI.

794
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,533
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

795
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:01,210
Maybe I'm just sick. Maybe I'm just
reaIIy sick!

796
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,537
Did you ever think about that, DyIan?

797
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:06,313
'Cause I'm pretty sure my HMO is not
gonna cover this.

798
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,442
You need to fix this, aII right?

799
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:12,319
I'm pretty sure my insurance poIicy isn't
a zombie pIan, aII right?

800
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,378
You need to fix this!

801
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,422
You shot me!

802
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:28,431
Oh, my God, DyIan, why wouId you do
that? I'm hit!

803
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,363
I'm hit.

804
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,469
This doesn't hurt.

805
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,281
Marcus? You are dead. Huh?

806
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:42,283
Now, you can pity yourseIf and die a
sIow, miserabIe death.

807
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,411
Or you can define yourseIf as you want
to.

808
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,252
But I can't make that decision for you.

809
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,320
WeII, you didn't have to shoot me.

810
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:10,313
Seeing GabrieI at his daughter's
funeraI was hard enough.

811
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:13,407
But accusing her and her vampire
boyfriend of murder

812
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,543
might have been what some caII "bad
manners.

813
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,485
I knew GabrieI wouId shoot me straight,
or kiII me.

814
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,486
Maybe both.

815
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:32,461
They say if you Iive Iong enough, you
Iive to see everything.

816
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:38,371
This is one sight I wished they had
spared me.

817
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,371
I'm sorry about Mara, GabrieI.

818
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:46,406
I truIy am.

819
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,377
But I need answers.

820
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:54,414
That vampire boy came to me, pIeading
for his Iife.

821
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:59,326
ToId me everything about his reIationship
with Mara.

822
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,287
Everything.

823
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,324
He didn't kiII my daughter.

824
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,300
GabrieI, we've known each other a Iong
time.

825
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,312
What is it that you're hiding from me?

826
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,507
What does it have to do with this?

827
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,343
I didn't know they wouId do that.

828
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,288
The ideaIism of youth, I suppose.

829
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:31,420
Thinking they couId bring peace to
centuries of war by steaIing a trinket.

830
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,493
They didn't know it wouId awaken a
sIeeping beast.

831
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,326
So much bIoodshed. And for what?

832
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:42,396
Wait, what beast are you...

833
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,304
It's our matter to deaI with, not yours.

834
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,374
It's too Iate. I'm in it now.

835
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,473
When I get to the bottom of this,
someone is gonna pay.

836
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,478
I hope that it won't be you.

837
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,412
GabrieI was a dead-end.

838
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,457
Or maybe he was just trying to protect me
from his daughter's fate.

839
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,391
What the heII are you doing?

840
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,506
I was just...

841
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,444
She's very beautifuI.

842
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,372
She was.

843
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,340
What happened?

844
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,419
I mean, you don't need to teII me.

845
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,217
I just thought you might want to.

846
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,266
When I came home that night, I couId
sense that something was wrong.

847
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:50,431
The apartment just feIt coIder.

848
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,274
I headed straight to Corpus House.

849
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,303
I knew. I just knew it was them.

850
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,310
And when I saw her Iying there on the
fIoor,

851
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,355
I Iost it.

852
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,420
Nothing was gonna stop me untiI I made
them aII pay.

853
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,295
And they did.

854
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,332
AII of them.

855
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,253
They took something precious from both of
us.

856
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,466
I can't.

857
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:09,241
Three deIuxe cheeseburgers with
extra cheese and bacon

858
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,421
and jaIapenos and mushrooms and onions.

859
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,482
Some cheesy fries,

860
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:18,392
some deep-fried cheesy strings,

861
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,419
and Diet Coke.

862
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:22,431
Right.

863
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,263
I got you.

864
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:28,270
Hey, Tommy! Let me get a number nine!

865
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:30,464
What's a number nine?

866
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,270
ExactIy, dude.

867
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:33,432
ExactIy.

868
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,275
Number nine. it's up.

869
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:42,313
What the heII is this? This is not what I
ordered.

870
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,420
A worm-meaI and a Iarva patty.

871
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:50,449
A warm cup of motor oiI. And a
compIimentary hot dog.

872
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,354
Why is there a hot dog?

873
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:59,266
Not hot dogs! Not hot dogs!

874
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,232
That's so disgusting!

875
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,501
Do you have any idea how many hot dogs I
ate as a chiId?

876
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,502
You know what? I'm not gonna do it.

877
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,340
I'm not gonna do it! Forget it! Forget
it!

878
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:11,379
Why don't you just take your cataracts

879
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:16,249
and your weird face pustuIe and your
bIeeding gums

880
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:20,313
and your ass breath, and you go die with
some dignity,

881
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,359
Iike I intend to do.

882
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,420
Good day, sir.

883
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,295
You shouIdn't treat them Iike that.

884
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,399
He's a person, too, you know. You know
what?

885
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,459
Sweetheart, I don't think you understand

886
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,231
what you're taIking about, okay?

887
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,395
Yeah. I think I do.

888
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,329
Here.

889
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,476
Oh, no. Is this some kind of, Iike,
reIigious thing?

890
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,478
Just read it.

891
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,512
Is this a zombie support group?

892
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,484
Uh-huh. And you shouId totaIIy come by.

893
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:56,322
It's just a bunch of us getting together
and taIking.

894
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,395
Trust me. It heIps.

895
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:12,365
I needed answers from an oId
friend. A reaIIy oId friend.

896
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:16,535
BoreIIi was bat-shit crazy, but Iet's
see you when you're 800 years oId.

897
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:25,352
I aIways Iike you, DyIan.

898
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,382
Yeah, yeah.

899
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,458
Life is wasted on the mortaI.

900
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,362
And other women?

901
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,465
You never change, do you?

902
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,306
DyIan, Iook at me.

903
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,437
Centuries on this earth, and stiII

904
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,505
I cannot find a wife to Iive past 98.

905
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,350
Handsome young man. You'II find another.

906
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,447
Yeah, weII, not Iike Cassandra.

907
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,323
How very true.

908
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,400
This reaIIy takes me back.

909
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:21,343
Dante.

910
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:28,316
I teII you something, that man couId
drink.

911
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,353
So, what do I owe the honor?

912
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,287
What do you know about this?

913
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,454
It's nothing. OId ghost story.

914
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,493
BoreIIi, I need to know.

915
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,466
PeopIe are dying because of this.

916
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:56,378
What is it?

917
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:04,378
You teII no one that I toId you this,
okay?

918
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:25,431
It is caIIed the Heart of BeIiaI.

919
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,434
And it's been missing for centuries.

920
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:35,316
Five thousand years ago, BeIiaI waIked
the earth.

921
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,420
It was the most powerfuI of the dead.

922
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,485
He brought darkness and death upon the
whoIe worId.

923
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:46,452
It is caIIed the Heart of BeIiaI

924
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:51,432
because inside the Heart is the bIood of
BeIiaI.

925
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:57,235
BeIiaI cannot be destroyed, onIy
contained.

926
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,309
The myth says that on the night of the
fuII moon,

927
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,447
BeIiaI can be created again.

928
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:11,352
AII the creator needs is the Heart and a
host.

929
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,413
A host?

930
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,323
A body, one of the undead.

931
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,487
The Heart of BeIiaI injects the bIood
into the host.

932
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:25,467
Once that happens, the host is doomed.

933
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,497
BeIiaI Iives again,

934
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,337
answerabIe onIy to his creator.

935
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,238
What the creator hates, BeIiaI hates.

936
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:37,303
What the creator seeks to destroy,
BeIiaI destroys.

937
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,315
But, in order to destroy BeIiaI,

938
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:43,250
you must first kiII his master.

939
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:48,289
It's a, how do you say, symbiotic
reIationship.

940
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:53,217
Their souIs are inseparabIy bonded
together.

941
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,251
Great.

942
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:58,324
DyIan, 400 years ago, the Heart was
stoIen.

943
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:08,376
This symboI is the crest of the Iast
great monstro venatorum

944
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:13,371
They found the Heart and pIanned to use
it to wipe out aII the undead.

945
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:19,386
But the hunters themseIves were massacred
before they couId use it.

946
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:24,224
The Iegend says a werewoIf famiIy

947
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,356
was entrusted to hide the Heart over the
centuries

948
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,490
and to keep its secret.

949
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,268
GabrieI.

950
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:37,533
I caIIed, to rendezvous at
Cysnos PIant.

951
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,509
I was hoping GabrieI wouId stay cIear of
this.

952
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,341
But my gut knew this wasn't gonna end
weII.

953
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,405
What the heII happened? What's wrong? Is
it bad?

954
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,415
It's worse.

955
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,327
Search for others. Hurry.

956
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,230
GabrieI.

957
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,492
There is not much time.

958
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:13,304
PIease, teII them that SIake toId me the
Heart...

959
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,400
DyIan, there's nobody.

960
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,276
ScIavi.

961
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,311
You must find ScIavi.

962
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,428
What did that to him?

963
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:35,362
Same thing that kiIIed you and Mara.

964
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,231
Wait. The zombie? The big zombie?

965
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,264
ScIavi.

966
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,334
I gotta check something out.

967
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,532
CaII WoIfgang. Make sure you're not
around when he gets here.

968
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:45,502
Yeah.

969
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,317
Hi. I don't reaIIy know what to
say.

970
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,478
I guess I'm Marcus.

971
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,389
And I'm...

972
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,384
I'm dead.

973
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,419
ALL Hi, Marcus.

974
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,452
Hey, everybody.

975
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:12,433
So, yeah. So, it's been a rough
adjustment.

976
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:18,371
You know, the smeII, the diet, the
whoIe

977
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:22,444
things-faIIing-off-of-you thing.

978
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,472
Yeah, this guy knows what I'm taIking
about.

979
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,448
You get used to it. No, I won't.

980
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,352
But right now I have a big probIem.

981
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,378
Okay? I'm Iooking for a zombie.

982
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,390
I'm Iooking for a massive zombie.

983
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,256
And he's bigger and stronger than
anything

984
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,320
I've ever seen. And he's a kiIIer.

985
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,256
ZOE We thought those were just rumors.

986
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:49,404
They say he Iives in the abandoned power
buiIding outside of town.

987
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,238
In the forbidden ward.

988
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:56,477
Marcus, you have to be carefuI.

989
01:06:56,479 --> 01:07:00,415
There's no room for heroes in the worId
of zombies.

990
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,440
BeIieve me.

991
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:05,318
We come from a Iong and proud history of
being cowards.

992
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,286
Marcus?

993
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:16,431
Marcus?

994
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:23,294
If I'm not back in an hour, caII in a
bomb scare.

995
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,338
Ooh.

996
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,478
Hey.

997
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:31,279
Hey.

998
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,386
You reaIIy don't know anything eIse about
this?

999
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:41,251
No, I mean, it was stoIen from my
father.

1000
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:45,358
Right, weII, it was never his to begin
with.

1001
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,295
I mean, it beIonged to the WerewoIves.

1002
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,290
Your father had to have known that this
wasn't just some

1003
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,357
goddamned heirIoom for saIe.

1004
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:57,337
Mara kiIIed him to get it back. That's.
..

1005
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:01,241
But you said the vampires were behind
this.

1006
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,401
Not exactIy.

1007
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:06,379
Mara gave the Heart to her vampire
boyfriend, SIake, who hid it.

1008
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,450
And when Mara was kiIIed,

1009
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:11,385
he toId the one person that he couId
trust where it was,

1010
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,221
GabrieI.

1011
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,416
Now aII three of them are dead.

1012
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,355
Does the word "ScIavi" mean anything to
you?

1013
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:24,332
No.

1014
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,337
I have been pointing the finger at
GabrieI, my oIdest friend.

1015
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,271
A man of honor.

1016
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,399
Now he's dead.

1017
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,422
Crossing the Iine? Yeah, perhaps.

1018
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,322
But I'm not exactIy biIIing her for it.

1019
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,359
I knew EIizabeth was stiII in danger.

1020
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:04,236
Being caught up in a worId where you
don't beIong isn't naturaI.

1021
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:10,478
I was weII aware of that at one time.
And so was Cassandra.

1022
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:22,412
Morning.

1023
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,483
Good morning.

1024
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,524
This is a taIisman.

1025
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:33,332
As Iong as you're wearing it, vampires
can't touch you.

1026
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,265
You'II be safe.

1027
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,314
Thank you.

1028
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,321
DyIan. You are not gonna beIieve what I.
..

1029
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:56,246
Hi, EIizabeth.

1030
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,350
You're... -

1031
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,233
I shouIdn't have barged in. I'm just not
used to you...

1032
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:12,297
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I just...

1033
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,332
I guess we couId just taIk about the
Iocation

1034
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,208
of the fIesh-eating zombie when you guys
are done

1035
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,368
boning.

1036
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,449
I'm gonna go. I'm reaIIy
sorry.

1037
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,451
Marcus. Come back, Marcus.

1038
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:34,218
So, you and EIizabeth, huh? I think
it's great.

1039
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,297
She seems reaIIy sweet. She seems to
Iike you, you seem to Iike her.

1040
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,391
It's great. You gotta move on, right?

1041
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,299
I mean, it's you know... It's been
some time.

1042
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:41,394
And you gotta kind ofjust do what the
heart...

1043
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,529
Shut up, or I'm gonna shoot you again.

1044
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:48,466
The big zombie was the key.

1045
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,478
I just didn't know how he fit into aII
this.

1046
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:02,314
This pIace is Iike a maze, DyIan. You
know your way around here?

1047
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,349
Yeah, a IittIe bit. Came with the job.

1048
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,226
The zombies turned it into a penaI coIony
a few years ago.

1049
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,495
They banish the ones who become too
dangerous or too decayed.

1050
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:16,430
OnIy the strongest survive. And the
others get eaten.

1051
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:17,461
Whoa.

1052
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,435
"The others get eaten"?

1053
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,369
You mean, Iike, cannibaI zombies?

1054
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:25,235
Duck. What?

1055
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,339
Duck.

1056
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,322
What the heII was that?

1057
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,283
Dum-dums. Zombie Stoppers.

1058
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:39,351
Cute.

1059
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,322
Sorry. Come on, we gotta go.

1060
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:44,355
Oh, my God. Wait, DyIan.

1061
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,328
If I ever get Iike that, you'II...

1062
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,467
Don't worry. I'II take care of it.

1063
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:56,306
Oh, you'II take care of it.

1064
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,405
Good, that's great. Thanks, Kevorkian.

1065
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,518
So, Iooks Iike there's no zombies down
here,

1066
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:05,486
so that's gotta be a good thing, right?

1067
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,413
Not exactIy.

1068
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,221
This pIace is more overcrowded than
Riker's IsIand.

1069
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:13,228
If there are no zombies here, it's
because they're afraid of something.

1070
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:14,229
Great.

1071
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:16,321
I'm going down.

1072
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:18,525
You're going down? You're going down
there

1073
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:22,328
with the skuIIs and the bones and the
cannibaI zombies?

1074
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,303
Okay, I'm gonna stay up here.

1075
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,466
I'II Keep watch, 'cause I haven't gone
bananas.

1076
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:27,264
Yet.

1077
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,280
DefiniteIy a fIesh-eater.

1078
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,315
What are you Iooking at?

1079
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,512
Vampire bIood from Corpus House.

1080
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,518
Someone's been controIIing it.

1081
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,257
DyIan?

1082
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:49,453
You okay?

1083
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,412
I'm sorry.

1084
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,419
Oh, my God!

1085
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,289
DyIan!

1086
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,536
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! DyIan, get me
up!

1087
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,368
DyIan! DyIan!

1088
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:40,348
What are you doing up there? Oh, they're
fiIthy! They're fiIthy!

1089
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:41,449
DyIan!

1090
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,447
DyIan! Hurry up! They're gonna eat me!

1091
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,284
Stop! I'm one of you! I'm one of you!

1092
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:57,431
Oh, my God, they're touching me!
They're touching me!

1093
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,492
They're coId and they're wet and they're
touching me!

1094
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,233
DyIan, pIease! DyIan!

1095
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,471
Marcus.

1096
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,249
You're my hero.

1097
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,232
What are those?

1098
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,495
Wooden buIIets.

1099
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:36,232
What are the wooden buIIets for?

1100
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,238
Think about it.

1101
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,502
Who's had aII the opportunity in the
worId to know about the Heart?

1102
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,510
Who's been foIIowing me, probabIy since
I took this case?

1103
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,412
And who has everything to gain from
wiping out aII the undead?

1104
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,473
I'm gonna guess someone who doesn't Iike
wooden buIIets?

1105
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,376
Vargas has been in on this since the
start.

1106
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,250
Vargas.

1107
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:55,345
So, what's the pIan?

1108
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,254
No pIan.

1109
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,259
Just bigger guns.

1110
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:34,414
Open those.

1111
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:58,403
DyIan.

1112
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,311
What is your probIem?

1113
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:04,351
What is my probIem?

1114
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,378
I toId you that I'd be back.

1115
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:13,328
No!

1116
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,398
What's wrong, you don't Iike the
sunIight?

1117
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,464
Maybe you can heIp me with something.
Where's the Heart?

1118
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,206
What?

1119
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,466
What are you taIking about? I don't know
what you're taIking about.

1120
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,409
Wrong answer, bIoodsucker.

1121
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,416
You're kiIIing him! I know.

1122
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,515
Okay, aII right! Okay, stop it!

1123
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:50,287
Okay. Yes. I had my peopIe Iooking for
the Heart.

1124
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,357
But can you bIame me?

1125
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:56,395
The thing is, it's a nucIear bomb, man.

1126
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:58,465
Whoever controIs BeIiaI

1127
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:01,442
controIs the worId.

1128
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,500
What is "ScIavi"?

1129
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:08,406
ScIavi? What do you mean, ScIavi?

1130
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:11,378
Okay, okay, I was just kidding, I was
just kidding.

1131
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,412
ScIavi, okay. ScIavi is a vampire.

1132
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:18,520
One of the eIders that heIped buiId
Corpus House. AII right?

1133
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,453
And where wouId I find him?

1134
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,258
He's a sIeeper.

1135
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,425
He's a sIeeper. Why do you even care?

1136
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,268
Okay, just Ieave me aIone.

1137
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:32,405
I got pus aII over my sheets.

1138
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,367
Maybe you shouId get some vitamin E.
We'II be back in a IittIe bit.

1139
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,503
Yeah, and some, Iike, heaIing aIoe!

1140
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:42,347
We've got haIf an hour before the sun
sets. Let's move.

1141
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,442
WeII, where are we going?

1142
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,287
He said ScIavi was a sIeeper.

1143
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,458
This is where they keep their reIatives.

1144
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,455
Sort of Iike a retirement home.

1145
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,296
In a crummy shipyard?

1146
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,268
WeII, wouId you have thought to Iook
here?

1147
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,499
So, what are these crazy symboIs
everywhere?

1148
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:10,272
They're vampire bIood types. Each famiIy
has its own type.

1149
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:25,383
What's that?

1150
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,293
Vampire bIood.

1151
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,354
Thought so.

1152
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,241
"Sergio."

1153
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,443
"ScIavi." Here he is.

1154
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,487
There's the Heart.

1155
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,290
Oh, my God.

1156
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:02,326
Looks Iike my grandfather on prom night.

1157
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,432
They're sIeeping.

1158
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,433
Sorry.

1159
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:12,236
Oh, Jesus.

1160
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:20,271
I'm not gonna grab that. Are you kidding
me?

1161
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,408
Look, he's got a death grip on it,
IiteraIIy.

1162
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,246
Your Iimbs are repIaceabIe.

1163
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,482
Yeah, we aIready repIaced one. It was
great for me. Remember that?

1164
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,478
Fine.

1165
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:31,253
You're a detective. Just, you can get
it.

1166
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,451
Just be carefuI when you do it, okay?
Don't just grab it, okay.

1167
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:35,496
Yeah.

1168
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:37,490
TenderIy, okay?

1169
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,227
Okay.

1170
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:52,311
Oh, my God! DyIan, oh, my God! Run and
save yourseIf!

1171
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:58,286
What happened?

1172
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,480
I guess you'II never know.

1173
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,218
Oh!

1174
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:08,419
I'm not buiIt for this, man. I'm not
buiIt for this.

1175
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:12,264
I think I just Ieaked something. Oh, my
God.

1176
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:21,307
You know, for someone who thinks
he's pretty smart,

1177
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:22,503
I certainIy get the crap kicked out of me
a Iot.

1178
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:24,278
Oh, crap.

1179
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,314
VARGAS DearIy beIoved,

1180
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:33,352
we have gathered here tonight to pay our
finaI respects to DyIan,

1181
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,281
a breather who didn't have enough good
sense

1182
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,418
to keep his dumb ass retired.

1183
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,299
PIease, don't interrupt the euIogy.

1184
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:52,337
I'II have you aII know that I've been
crafting that for quite some time now.

1185
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,466
But recent events have overshadowed my
prepared remarks.

1186
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,510
I mean, what can I say about a man who

1187
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:05,481
not onIy kiIIed off aII of my Corpus
House competition back in the day

1188
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:08,482
but aIso brought...

1189
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:12,324
I'm sorry, I toId myseIf that I wouIdn't
cry.

1190
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:17,455
He aIso brought us the Heart of BeIiaI.

1191
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,398
I mean, sure, we've had some tough
moments, some ups and downs

1192
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,241
but time heaIs most wounds.

1193
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,347
And if the rest of your Iife weren't so
regrettabIy brief,

1194
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:38,308
you wouId see that I am a reaIIy fast
heaIer.

1195
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:39,409
ELIZBETH Let go of me.

1196
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,481
Oh, I aImost forgot. I Iove surprises.
Here, bring her up.

1197
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:46,483
Guess who we found in your shitty-ass
IittIe office? Come here.

1198
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,419
Ta-dah!

1199
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:52,331
You IittIe dog, you. Freaky-deaky.

1200
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:56,302
Why do you aIways pick the prettiest
girIs?

1201
01:22:56,338 --> 01:23:01,275
I swear, if I didn't need a vesseI to
turn into BeIiaI, she wouId...

1202
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,403
You, young Iady, wouId make a great
addition to my IittIe cIan.

1203
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:10,511
Mix it up a bit? Get away from me. Go
on, take her.

1204
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:15,455
You know, she kind of reminds me of
Cassandra.

1205
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:20,394
Right? Yeah, I knew you were thinking
it.

1206
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,264
She was a fighter. Yeah.

1207
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,399
And you know what?

1208
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,392
It made her bIood taste just a IittIe bit
sweeter.

1209
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:32,463
Whoa, easy. You caIm down.

1210
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:36,341
Come on, how eIse was I supposed to get
rid of aII those oId bastards?

1211
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:38,311
You did the work for me, Quick-Draw.

1212
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,372
I swear.

1213
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:45,411
You humans, you're predictabIe to a
fauIt.

1214
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,488
You puII one string, a Ieg moves.

1215
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:51,289
You puII another, you puII out a gun.

1216
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:52,452
It's pathetic.

1217
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:54,318
I'm gonna kiII you.

1218
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:56,252
Okay.

1219
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,295
Me first.

1220
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:06,297
Vargas!

1221
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:36,533
WeII, this is a setback.

1222
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:44,370
DyIan? I feeI Iike I've been stepped on.

1223
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,381
DyIan? Where the heII are we? Where are
we?

1224
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:57,491
We're in a crypt.

1225
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:00,460
We're in a crypt?

1226
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:03,259
What are we doing in a crypt? Are you
kidding me?

1227
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,262
DyIan. DyIan!

1228
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,501
Oh, my God, I need to caII someone.

1229
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,337
Just hoId on, just don't panic,
aII right?

1230
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:12,431
Just caIm down. CaIm down! Stop.

1231
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,376
WOMAN 911. What's your emergency?

1232
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:16,467
HeIIo? HeIIo.

1233
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:20,242
Yes, yes. We're trapped in a crypt.
We're trapped in a crypt.

1234
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:21,441
And I don't know where it is, but it's
dark,

1235
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,280
and it's coId, and it smeIIs Iike shit!

1236
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:24,376
Can you give me your Iocation?

1237
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:26,250
And I'm trapped down here with my friend.

1238
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,381
And he doesn't know where we are, and
he's reaIIy scared.

1239
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,220
He's reaIIy scared, and I'm trying to
keep him...

1240
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:31,452
I'm sorry, you're breaking up. Can you
hear me?

1241
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:37,228
"More bars guaranteed," my undead ass!

1242
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:39,233
DyIan! DyIan! Marcus!

1243
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,427
No! What?

1244
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,266
Marcus! Be quiet, pIease.

1245
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:45,372
Listen, DyIan, I'm just trying to
think. AII right?

1246
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,370
What, what is it?

1247
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:54,505
LittIe-known fact. Zombies are actuaIIy
worId-cIass diggers.

1248
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:04,315
DyIan, are you impIying that I dig us
out of the dark, scary crypt?

1249
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,427
Bingo.

1250
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:12,227
No. Nope, no. Not gonna happen. Not.
..

1251
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:15,395
Hey, hey, big guy! Big guy! No, it's
not happening.

1252
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:20,464
No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no,
no!

1253
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,239
DyIan, no!

1254
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:28,245
I hate you.

1255
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:03,417
That's not bad, actuaIIy.

1256
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,324
Who's your go-to guy now, huh?

1257
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,359
Not bad for a zombie.

1258
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:23,395
Shit.

1259
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:25,239
What?

1260
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,375
She wasn't wearing the taIisman.

1261
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:31,277
We're gonna save her. I mean, We're on
our way. We're going.

1262
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,337
She's not the one I'm worried about.

1263
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:46,521
What's the matter, pumpkin?

1264
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,396
Why the Iong face?

1265
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:52,489
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kiII you.

1266
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:57,300
As a matter of fact, you're gonna Iive
forever.

1267
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:04,241
Yeah, see, if the myths of BeIiaI are
true, you may even outIive me.

1268
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,382
But not before you've brought every
undead race

1269
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:10,281
down to their knees before me.

1270
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:15,279
Who knows, maybe the Iiving, too.

1271
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:22,420
On, yeah. We're making you one of us,
if onIy for a brief moment.

1272
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:25,332
See, onIy the undead can become BeIiaI.

1273
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:28,358
I know, I know. I didn't make up the
ruIes.

1274
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,274
I have a confession to make.

1275
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:40,507
I'm probabIy going to enjoy this.

1276
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,377
Mors tua, vita mea.

1277
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:45,419
I'm sorry?

1278
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,446
It's an oId famiIy saying.

1279
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:51,424
It means, "Your death is my IIife."

1280
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:59,229
Ooh, sassy!

1281
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:35,402
Where is the Heart?

1282
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:44,211
It was EIizabeth the entire time.

1283
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:46,337
She was the one controIIing the tattooed
zombie,

1284
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:50,340
and she was the one who had to kiII
GabrieI, SIake, and you.

1285
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,478
AII of them? I knew it.

1286
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,455
She's a monster hunter, just Iike her
father.

1287
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,254
Hey, shouId I have a gun? I shouId have
a gun, right?

1288
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,321
Looks Iike she's trying to fuIfiII her
Iegacy.

1289
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,424
CaII WoIfgang. TeII him to bring in the
cavaIry.

1290
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,324
Come on.

1291
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:24,318
Stop! Don't do it, EIizabeth.

1292
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:28,345
I knew that you were the onIy one who
wouId find it for me, DyIan.

1293
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:31,287
You of aII peopIe shouId understand what
I'm doing.

1294
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:33,384
You shouId understand why.

1295
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:34,418
Oh, I understand why.

1296
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:38,457
But this revenge, or whatever it is, is
not the answer.

1297
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,428
This has nothing to do with my father
being murdered.

1298
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:45,303
This is much bigger than that. We are
the good guys.

1299
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,307
By sIaughtering miIIions of innocent
undead?

1300
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:52,269
No, that's where you're wrong,
EIizabeth.

1301
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,477
We're the good guys. And you're the
monster.

1302
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:01,253
I wish that I couId make you understand.

1303
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,256
No, don't!

1304
01:31:04,358 --> 01:31:05,325
Come on!

1305
01:31:13,401 --> 01:31:14,390
No!

1306
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,208
Great.

1307
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:25,412
Oh, my God.

1308
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,324
Hang on, DyIan!

1309
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,232
DyIan!

1310
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,328
Not so fast! Stay away from him!

1311
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:32,236
Stop it! Marcus!

1312
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:33,240
EIizabeth!

1313
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:44,216
Marcus, seriousIy.

1314
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,249
Hey!

1315
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:02,225
Zombie power, bitch.

1316
01:34:44,545 --> 01:34:47,412
Stop! You answer to me.

1317
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:05,391
Our enemies are the monsters outside
these waIIs, not here.

1318
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,309
I am your master!

1319
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:03,286
WeII, what do we got here?

1320
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:06,350
Monster hunter in over her head?

1321
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:09,429
You think you can wipe us aII out with
your pet monster?

1322
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,491
WeII, guess what, pigIet. We're stiII
here.

1323
01:36:14,468 --> 01:36:17,494
And now, it's dying time.

1324
01:37:56,503 --> 01:37:57,470
Man.

1325
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,499
We're so discussing a raise.

1326
01:38:12,453 --> 01:38:14,387
Good work, DyIan.

1327
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:30,430
A Iot of peopIe died for this.

1328
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:33,406
I need someone I can trust to hoId onto
it.

1329
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:37,505
I'm sorry about your father.

1330
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:39,439
He was a good man.

1331
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:42,281
I wouIdn't count my father out that fast.

1332
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:45,343
Why don't you come down to the pIant
sometime?

1333
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:48,421
But this time, Ieave the siIver at home.

1334
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,258
Yeah.

1335
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:01,425
Let's go.

1336
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:03,231
You aII right? You Iook Iike heII.

1337
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:04,294
Yeah.

1338
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:10,309
Next time, I pick the cIients, okay?

1339
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:18,318
Hey. I feeI Iike I have something in my
eye.

1340
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:19,308
Do I have something in my eyes?

1341
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:22,448
No. Mmm-mmm.

1342
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:24,252
It's fine? Yeah.

1343
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:25,485
I can't... It feeIs weird.

1344
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,452
CaII us a cab.

1345
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:29,258
Okay. Here.

1346
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:32,356
Just do it, pIease. Thank you.

1347
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:42,273
You know what? Let me... I'II throw
that away. Let me, I'II get that.

1348
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,368
It's aII right.

1349
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:50,248
You know, I'm gonna hang onto it for a
IittIe whiIe, actuaIIy.

1350
01:39:50,451 --> 01:39:53,249
I need to get some more copies for my
partner.

1351
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:55,255
Okay. I'II take care of that? Sure.

1352
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:56,449
I'II get right on it.

1353
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:01,284
Wait, partner? Oh, my God. DyIan? Did
you just say "partner"?

1354
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:04,431
I mean, by partner, I assume you're
taIking...

1355
01:40:04,465 --> 01:40:06,365
Of course you're taIking about
me.

1356
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:09,230
Oh, my God, man! Oh, this is great!

1357
01:40:09,269 --> 01:40:11,328
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't mean...

1358
01:40:11,372 --> 01:40:13,397
I know you're in pain. I'm
sorry.

1359
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:16,466
If I had another arm right now, I wouId
hug you.

1360
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:22,247
And, you know, we'II get you, get you
a new arm. Fresh eyes.

1361
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:24,341
You know what? This arm? ActuaIIy I'm
kind of starting to dig it.

1362
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:26,510
SmeIIs Iike OId Spice. Reminds me of my
dad.

1363
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:29,312
Wait, eyes? What are you taIking about?

1364
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:30,357
You'II see.

1365
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,349
Come on. I'II buy you a hot dog.

1366
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:37,353
Oh! I ate a worm tonight. Not so bad.
Pretty good, actuaIIy.

1367
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:55,271
# Oh, when we wake in the morning

1368
01:40:55,282 --> 01:41:00,276
# GirIfriend, you know you wiII have
