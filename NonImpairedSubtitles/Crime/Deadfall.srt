What would a home look like?

00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,362
I do not know.

3
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,426
I think the farm in the Valley,

4
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,402
As the place where we grew up.

5
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,473
Located in a ...

6
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,354
I remember that there were orchids on that night.

7
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,348
Looking through the many Windows.

8
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,518
Wait until Dad went back to sleep
so you can go back in.

9
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,361
Do you remember that Liza?.

10
00:01:40,500 -->  00:01:42,263
You remember him?

11
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,236
I think I fainted
hit me.

12
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,338
The House was on fire.

13
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,439
Orchids, the whole valley in flames.

14
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,384
As Liza, first killing?.

15
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,321
I don't know, sad.

16
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:08,427
Nervous, I can spy on someone.

17
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,224
Someone who is doing something dirty.

18
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,266
Yes, I know what you mean.

19
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,335
Shame.

20
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:20,372

-Liza.
-I understand.

Are you in pain?

No, I think I'm good.

See if you can take the bag,
take what you want.

I'm sure he called help,
Police will be here soon.

It shouldn't be so stupid now,

-Did you get the money?
Mmhm-.

-This morning for good behavior.
-Oh my God.

This is good, you're going to come
Thank you for tomorrow?

00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:29,311
Oh, I'll make it good fun,
as before.

70
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,281
What about dad?

71
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,450
Your father loves you Jay.

72
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,394
He gave it to see.

73
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,390
Listen, if you feel more comfortable,
tomorrow morning will be gone.

We can talk about it at that time.

Oh sure, come here to pick it up.

Do you need money?

78
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,246
- Do not hang up.
- Mom I gotta go.

79
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,373
Read the sign.

You're not even there, Ronnie.

91

How did you get my medal?.

92

I think ... I'm going to keep it,
you know.

93
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,358
- Keep in a safe manner.
- Right.

94
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,390
You're suitable to wear this guy.

95
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,299
When you get out?.

96
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,405
- A few hours ago?
- Wow come here directly.

97
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,439
I got it.

Ronnie?

- Oh, finally.
- Why only me to blame?.

100

Why do not you blame?

101
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,477
- You have a lot of questions.
- I have a lot of time to think about it.

102
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,289
I want you to pay your debt.

How do you know when your boyfriend money?

104

107
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,299
You're like a son to me.

108

I do not have much at the moment, but.

109

I have a couple.

110
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,500
Some is better than nothing, right?

(RONNIE DRAWER OPEN)

112
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,373
Not much, but that's all I have right now.

00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,423
You're an idiot, you think you can come here
and ask?.

114
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,460
Wake up stupid, do not dare to touch.

115
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,491
It should not be a loser, we should be
able to make a lot of money together.

116
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,427
From what I see, you owe me.

117
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,341
Ronnie.

118
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,247

00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,302
Is anyone there?

122
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,403
Stay on the phone, you hear me?

123
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,465
We will send the address of the car.

124
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,344
Hey, man. time no see.

125
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,404
Sorry for the delay.

126
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,415
James, Hey!

127
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,376
What is the problem?

128
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,388
Wacht, man!

129
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,360
I told Jed to stop tomorrow morning.

130
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,522
I see.

131
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,305
Do not do it, Jed!

132
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,342
It's not fair!

133
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,479
He turned his back on his family.

134
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,243
I wonder who he is?

135
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,386
- Hello, Hena!
- Hi!

136
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,522
Hi! Jared!

137
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,266
- Not me, surely someone else.
- Oh.

138
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,232
Nice to meet you!

139
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,393
It seems so long ago.

140
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,466
Look at you!

141
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,299
It is preaty young woman.

142
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,469
You're a bit 'like your mother.

143
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,507
I remember when mom and dad brought me here
Thanksgiving when I was a kid.

144
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:35,376
Jake loved to climb the big pig
have.

145
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,322
- Jake is there?
- Oh, uh

146
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,253
What brought you come here now?

147
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,290
Oh, um ...

148
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,429
We acctualy a bad situation.

149
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,322
We give you guys heads up.

150
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,460
What do you mean by bad?

151
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,495
Last night at tribal casinos, there is someone who
robbed.

152
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,270
Two armed suspects masks.

153
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,240
There are wounded?

154
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,246
At six in the morning, the local police came
the place of occurrence.

155
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,405
In the south of us.

156
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,376
When help arrived, they found the police
had been killed.

157
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,485
Oh, my? God!

158
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,216
There are other suspects died in
the incident.

159
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,446
Police searched the park here.

160
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,456
We have set up checkpoints.

161
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,261
Sending a research group, there is a possibility
managed to escape.

162
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,353
So, say the whole family
I'm here.

163
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,296
E 'was a strip very large.

164
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,360
He will never get to this point
walk.

165
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,233
And the temperature continues to drop.

166
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,431
In blizzard conditions.

167
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,408
I say let him die of cold.

168
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,275
Cop finds him.

169
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,328
What do you see Edisson?

170
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,404
I'm sorry!

171
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,242
Is it okay to look.

172
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,246
Hush ... Devil will hear you.

173
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,282
I do not promise, when we
started.

174
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,308
No one will ever hurt you?

175
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,388
I want you to remember this.

176
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,345
She did not hurt anyone.

177
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,289
I made the choice.

178
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,324
I would think differently.

179
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,319
-What are you doing?
- We'll split up.

180
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,331
They do not know anything about you.

181
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,366
You're just a distraction.

182
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,267
I do not like this plan.

183
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,303
I did not ask if you liked it.

184
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,404
We should not divide us.

185
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,339
Listen!

186
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,501
Follow this road. and will be cut to
the road.

187
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,438
Use your charm, a passage and continue north.

188
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,211
We can still get in Canada.

189
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,451
But until then!

190
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,275
I do not recognize myself.

191
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,250
I'm not your brother.

192
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,481
Not until I tell you, it's safe.

193
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,361
Remember how I taught you.

194
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,495
I leave you now, and I will
call you tonight, okay.

195
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,402
You're a modern girl, be careful.

196
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,278
I'm not a child.

197
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,248
Come on, get out of here!

198
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,451
This is it!

199
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,454
What happens if you do not call?

200
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,333
I mean dead.

201
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,499
Do you have plans for Thanskgiving?

202
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,237
No, dinner only.

203
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,374
What about you?

204
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,312
All the news from your mother, Hena?

205
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,439
- Really?
- No, dear.

206
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,249
Not so far.

207
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,409
Very nice to meet you.

208
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,351
- See you.
- See you.

209
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,416
Oh, you should come tomorrow for dinner.

210
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,296
Oh, thank you, you know.

211
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,298
My father and I plan.

212
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,262
He wanted to do what you set.

213
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,326
- See you later!
- See you later!

(PEOPLE) SOUND CONVERSATION

215
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,478
Hello, Dorris, is there any news?

216
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,287
Reportedly it was bad!

217
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,416
There is someone waiting for you at the office.

218
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,424
- Bakker?
- Good boy.

219
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,327
There's a letter for me? Letter?

220
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:38,490
Yet to come.

221
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,424
- Let me know!
- Yes, ma'am.

222
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,327
We provide manpower and support
other county.

223
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,470
Close the door, ah!

224
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,370
K-19 will be the turn tonight.

225
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,405
So we will be heading south
with my dog.

226

Use your radio, use your head, everbody
wear a vest.

227
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,505
If you meet this guy.

228
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,284
Call it in, you do not want to go home
for a turkey dinner.

229
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,387
We continue to talk, I'm not made for
turkey dinner.

Travis when you're taking the piss
small mouse, he calls his wife.

231
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,324
This guy shot the policeman in the face.

232
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,257
A police officer named Allan Thompson.

233
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,331
He served for soldiers for 18 years.

234
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,425
That man is dead and gone forever.

235
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,437
Okay, calm down, I'm sorry.

236
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,338
It 'areal bargain boy!

Do you understand?

238
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,310
Well, listen up!

239
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,343
This is what we do.

240
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,340
Travis Brice, Billy, you will be with me in
west of the accident site to the short lake.

She will head to the east of 75.

243
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,286
Alright.

244
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,487
Let's move on.

245
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,356
What about me?

246
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:42,488
What about you?

247
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,295
- I'm gone?
- No.

248
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,230
What do you mean?

249
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,388
I mean who would not turn off.

250
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,432
You can not do this?

251
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,524
I am responsible for the lives of these men.

In addition to what you want to do more than
out there in addition to changing the pads.

254
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,311
No offense, Vice.

255
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,480
And change the daddy!

256
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,269
Oh, shit!

I've been there twice
in a dream.

00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,483
He told me they were coming.

274
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,464
Can barely see anything out there.

- You know, it's going out on a white.
- What?

276

You can not see what is in front of you.

I'm just passing through.

281
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,298
Do you think you give me a lift?

282
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,269
No.

283
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,235
I'm sorry, I can not.

284
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,237
I'll leave you at the gas station later, okay?

E 'was years ago, Hanna.

It's not actually thinking of giving it.

312
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,412
Why?

313
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,440
So you can take care of it?

314
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,315
Only I've got left.

315

This is your life.

Well, good luck.

They're closing the road.

All about blizzard.
Fast can get through the morning.

00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,377
You can do there?

334
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,218
I hope you are well.

335
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,426
Alright. Bye.

336
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:44,373
Hey. Can I get you something to drink?

337
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,301
- No, I'm fine.
- The first of me.

338
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,472
Call it a special snow storm.
You and your wife?

339
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,474
Oh, we like to drink. Thank you.

340
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,447
My name is Patricia. This is my husband Edison.

341
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,316
Edison? This is a fun.

342
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,318
It 's the name of his father.

343
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,421
You two married long?

344
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,236
No, pretty new to this.

345
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,305
Thought so, so that the globe.

346
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,340
Well, my name is Mandi and this is my bar.

347
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,237
Got it in a divorce.

348
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,311
I used to come here when
who runs the place, but now I like it.

349
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,439
Hey, Mandy!

350
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,415
How about giving us a little pitcher ', eh?

351
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,354
My sister ex no thris.

352
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,345
Look, honey.

353
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,358
You can choose the type,
you can not just choose the family.

354
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,349
Come here, hun.

355
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,222
Come to mama.

356
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,227
Come here.

357
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,423
Alicia, come back here!

358
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,397
No!

359
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,400
Let it go!

360
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:24,331
Lisa, your ass back in the cabin.
Do you know what best for you.

361
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,238
Come to Mama, please.

362
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,475
This also applies to your mother.

363
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,314
Either I will be more hunting tomorrow's march.

364
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,253
You're not going anywhere.

365
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,482
There is nothing for miles.

366
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,292
Your baby is going to freeze.

367
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,258
I'll be waiting!

368
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,387
Do not move!

369
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,495
Take your coat and go outside.

370
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,339
- Who are you?
- Shut your mouth!

371
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,300
- Laza, get out now.
- His name is Liza.

372
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,246
See how it makes me call.

373
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,274
You'll be dead before the hand touches.

374
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:46,417
Liza, your mother 'on a hill
with the child.

375
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,483
It was very cold and he needs you now.

376
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,452
- You have to go with her.
- You are there Liza.

377
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,295
He does not have the courage
to do it in front of you.

378
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:59,392
There will be a little 'beautiful girl
see his stepfather killed.

379
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,501
- I'll wait here.
- I want my mommy.

380
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,333
E 'at the top of the hill with the child.

381
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,472
- He fucks my wife is so?
- Liza go now.

382
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,506
I want to be with my mother.

383
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:17,479
And who are you?
I knew it! I fucking knew it!

384
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:21,515
Go on! You can have
that little fuck slut!

385
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,426
Fuck you!

386
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,226
(FIRE)

387
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,464
So, tell me something
on you, Addisons.

388
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,501
What do you know?

389
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:49,285
I do not know ... What you do for a living?
Why are you so serious? Anything.

390
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,455
I was a boxer.

391
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:56,484
Sometimes, as a long time ago.

392
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,421
Like a boxer in the ring boxer?

393
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,530
ì, my? father trained me since I was a ragazzin

394
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,463
I've been training since I was little.

395
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,332
Oh, you must be really good.

396
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,477
I won a silver medal.

397
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,508
- Is not it?
- Oh, shit ...

398
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,515
- You have on you?
- I do not usually ... I happened to be today.

399
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,488
Can I?

400
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,323
- This is really cool.
- It is not gold, but ...

401
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,367
It 's amazing.

402
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,234
I've never been good at anything.

403
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:23,209
Here we go ... Are you going to help me.
Keep your child.

404
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,442
This guy needs you. Is that okay?

405
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,512
We can not do this without you.

406
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,311
Here we go.

407
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,267
Liza, you can help your mother and the baby.

408
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:53,401
Accompany them, go to
in a blanket and accompany them.

409
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,413
Cuddle up real tight.
I had to do something.

410
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:29,502
Now, Liza, I tried to imagine
how you feel.

411
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:36,252
I think it will ...
complicated feelings.

412
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,417
I think at this moment nothing in
the whole world seems secure.

413
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,353
Step dad is gone.

414
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,230
Your mother is ill.

415
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,460
And you were in the woods with a stranger.

416
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,337
What happened to your hand?

417
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,252
Well, I got in a fight ...

418
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,444
With the great Indian chief.

419
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,347
He cut my finger.

420
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,465
- Did you kill him?
- Yes, I did.

421
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,396
Are you going to kill me?

422
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,533
No.

423
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:37,436
You're still a child.
children should be protected.

424
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,473
The angels protect me.

425
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,452
Maybe this is how you should think of me.

426
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,328
I was an angel
got out of the storm.

427
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:56,459
And remove this man from your life.

428
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:07,343
(MUSIC PLAYING)

429
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,249
Why would you do this trip alone?

430
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,246
What is your excuse?

431
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,351
I do not know.

432
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,456
I just wanted to think for a moment, you know ...

433
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,302
I can take it.

434
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:38,264
I hate to be alone,
I'm scared ... it always has.

435
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:48,474
Do you still want to ...
do it?

436
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,326
I hope you're the one.

437
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:00,261
I hope that no one else is coming.

438
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,324
I hope no one else.

439
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:31,393
Pretend ... okay?

440
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,389
I pretend to ...

441
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,524
Fuck me Addison.

442
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,313
So you want to be when you grew up?

443
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,474
Nurse, I wanted to be a nurse.

444
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,377
I always wanted to be a farmer.

445
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,354
We have a farm food, mostly peaches.

446
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,386
But my father was an alcoholic.
And I run into the ground.

447
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,364
When I was a child I
always want to fix it up.

448
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,401
The farmer right.

449
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:01,273
Can I change the baby?

450
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,246
Yes.

451
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,377
Make a great nurse.

452
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,250
I had a baby sitter ...

453
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:44,220
When we were kids I used to
take care of her, just as you are.

454
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,448
Where is he now?

455
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:49,253
I would like that is out there somewhere.

456
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,496
I see you're going
leave her alone.

457
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,492
(PEOPLE TALK)

458
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:41,343
- It 'my daughter Ammy, you know?
- Of course his friends from school, please.

459
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:46,247
Then you know that it is always
afraid of him for a lifetime.

460
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:50,446
- It 's probably because I've never ...
- Madam, tell me what happened?

461
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,515
He did not come home last night.

462
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,458
He must come to my house.

463
00:44:56,293 --> 00:45:01,356
She and her son, her husband Bobby
is a bad guy.

464
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,457
The men who do not know him?

465
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,429
We met at his house
on several occasions.

466
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:11,366
Have you ever divorce him yesterday?

467
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,399
- Are you trying to call?
- No,

468
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:19,272
Bobby in a hunting cabin with no phone
and all that was in the forest.

469
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,476
Could you please check?

470
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,446
Be sure, please let me
all is well.

471
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,347
Let me feel like a stupid old woman.

472
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,223
Sure.

473
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,430
I'll be home pretty late.

474
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,366
It is not necessary waiting.

475
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,302
- Hey.
- Yes?

476
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,305
You're a little 'silent this morning, are you okay?

477
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,341
Yes.

478
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,509
Parents know it is not easy for anyone.

479
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:57,352
- You have done it this way.
- Well, because they are more
hide hardest part.

480
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,423
And you're always grateful.

481
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:02,416
Who knew you were hungry.

482
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:13,497
- I think you said your beam residence.
- I'd like to take in case of need.

483
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,463
All right, then.

484
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,466
I would like to keep warm.

485
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,280
Do not tell me what to do.

486
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:45,360
Began to seem obvious.

487
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:47,428
Where are you?

488
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,269
Are you still alive?

489
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,240
I can hear when you're dead
there was nothing else I think.

490
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:58,311
I just felt the need to keep moving.

491
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,248
Now listen,

492
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,514
everything has become so confused.

493
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,396
The man you are talking about,

494
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,422

495
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,435
He just disappeared from me.

496
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,231
Thus,

497
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,371
I'll find 'another way.

498
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,433
And I'll call you.

499
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,378
O you who call me, where are you?

500
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,475
Okay, hello.

501
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,388
Participate?

502
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,513
- Of course.
- All right.

503
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:16,426
Hey!

504
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:24,230
- Hey guys what's the problem?
- You beat!

505
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,366
Go away!

506
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:31,407
- What are you doing?
- What do you look like,
last night was over.

507
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,339
But why?

508
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:35,402
- It 's just a game.
- This is nonsense! And you know it.

509
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,343
I did?

510
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:37,472
You do not even know my name.

511
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,346
So, tell me!

512
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,243
No problem, I can not be with anyone.

513
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:47,448
This means to me.

514

Why are you doing this?

515
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,405
Hey Bill,

516
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,402
- Did you have breakfast?
- Fast, Travis.

517
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:18,353
- What are you doing here Hanna?
- Vicky concerned about her daughter.

520

He was headed north about an hour
ago, at the police station.

521
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,328
Want me to join you?

522
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,456
No need to.

523
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,368
As you wish.

524
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,471
Good.

525
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:02,357
That's where my father seriously
wounded close to home.

526
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:08,368
He pulled the trigger himself,
screams and then die.

527
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,431
Someone had shot him.

528

Want to know what I do?

529
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,243
Clean with a garden hose.

530

Comb your hair,

531
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,289
Remove the road and wait
someone found me.

532
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,418
Where did you find it?

533
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,228
My brother.

534
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,237
He closed the tube and take me away.

535
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,332
What happens then?

536
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,448
Many foreigners, and the police came to the house.

537
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,280
People think of where I left off.

538
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,348
My father was a bad person.

539
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:05,350
And the animals.

540
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,294
And he deserves to die that way.

541
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,365
I had to grow up.

542
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,414
As others have a husband and a home.

543
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,443
And they have their children.

544
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,487
Instead, I screwed up.

545
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,441
Lisa.

546
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:05,448

I'm going to do my job.

- Message from Becker to call.

With a rifle.

662
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,485
Why are you so calm?

663
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,429
A panic
helps no one.

664
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,233
I like you, June.

665
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,405
You do as I say
I do not want to hurt you or your family.

666
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,271
Thank you.

667
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,517
Would you mind op ...

668
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:43,424
Can I see it?

669
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,433
Are you my mother?

670
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,328
A mother.

671
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,497
Ah, shit.

672
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,496
- You're alive.
- Whatever it is, please help. Thank you.

673
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:28,375
Do not move.

674
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,479
Follow what I'm saying.

675
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:35,283
Put your hands to the head,
Do not move your fingers.

676
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,277
Do it, I was holding a gun
that is on the table.

677
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,382
This will not happen.

678
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,487
- He shoots you.
- I do not think it will.

679
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,231
Do not try me, son.

680
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,529
No, it's too much to lose.

681
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:58,329
Lord, believe me when I say
Are genius when I was like in June

682
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:04,470
So, for both of us.
Can you go back?

683
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,282
Shit.

684
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,480
Drop the gun on the ground.

685
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:23,397
Sit next to your wife.

686
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,300
- I'm sorry.
- No need to apologize.

687
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:32,498
How is this possible?

688
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:38,278
You know, when I was a kid,
I was surrounded by 20 men.

689
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,440
If you use a stick.

690
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:51,223
You're better than it might seem.

691
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,223
Thank you.

692
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:57,331
Oh, that's right. This is a day of gratitude.

693
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:04,328
Which is fine if you eat tonight?

694
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,502
It would be nice to get a good meal.

695
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,412
- You lost my mind?
- I'd love to.

696
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:15,341
- Honey.
- Chad, we have to eat. Slightly.

697
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,351
Thank you so crazy.

698
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,487
Thank you, June.

699
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:21,222
Do not thank me,
Thank you Chad.

700
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,281
Well, thanks Chad.

701
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,457
What are you looking for?

702
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:34,459
- No, I just ...
- What are you looking for the police?

703
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,464
I know what
when people are around.

704
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,409
Shut up.

705
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,286
Not 'my fault.

706
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,355
I will not go to jail again.

707
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:59,327
I can not.

708
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,467
And 'safe.

709
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,245
Who is June?

710
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:29,247
Cabbage. E 'was Sgt.
E 'was James.

711
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:36,464
One by one.

712
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,495
Be careful, step well.

713
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:50,411
- Hello Mom.
- James. Oh, James.

714
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,381
- I brought a girl.
- Oh, James.

715
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:57,384
Look, there's a man inside.

716
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:59,248
He has a gun.

717
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,358
No, no.
It 's the father fascinating.

718
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,521
Please, come on you two.

719
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,232
Dad, are you okay?

720
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,337
I'm all right, son.

721
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,397
Good morning.

722
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,339
You must be James.

723
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:22,343
What do you want?

724
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:25,345
- This must be your wife.
- It 'a friend of mine.

725
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,475
Oh, I believe I can speak for itself.

726
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,415
- What is your name?
- Lassa.

727
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:38,290

- The food will be completed soon, is not it?
- Yes.

731

Superb. I know you all

01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,441
Chad, this drink a little 'wine.

733
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,342
Take it from me,

734
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:08,288
I need food,
and I need to sleep.

735
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,324
In addition to this.
This is a day of gratitude.

736
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:19,434
What's going to look for me, Jake?

737
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,311
It would be a bad idea.

738
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:11,251
(WOMEN IN RADIO)

739
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,481
We hope he comes.

740
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:29,235
Hello? Yes, it's Sheriff's Office.
Who is this?

741
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:34,241
Sure.

742
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:37,370
Detective Fredmatt?

743
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,438
I'm going to call the police.

744
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,318
Say it again.

745
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:49,313
Oh, I know where she lives.

746
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:56,254
Leave the statement.

747
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:58,196

748
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:02,236
I'm going to go there.

749
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,268
Happy holidays to you too.

750
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,335
Cabbage.

751
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:18,250
June, what do you mean
on this day of Thanksgiving?

752
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,378
Let us give thanks.

753
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:21,313
Now what is working?

754
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:25,257

Thank you for this food.

759
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,477
By the grace of God

760
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:48,306
And I'm sorry
actions of my husband and me.

761
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,343
Good words.

762
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:55,422
Chad? you're next.

763
01:14:56,291 --> 01:15:00,489
Thank you for the month of June,
lover of life.

764
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,294
Wow, 'sweet, Chad.

765
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:08,269
And your son?

766
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,339
What's wrong with him?

767
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,241
We ask.

768
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:22,374
- Jay, where have you been?
- This is not your concern.

769
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:27,286
No, you're missing the point of his Jay.
- I will not give it to you.

770
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,324
Jay, it's your turn.

771
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,384
Please stop forcing people
did not want to discuss anything with you.

772
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,358
You better watch your mouth, girl.

773
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,267
Do not forget where you came from.

774
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:50,438
Gratitude, Jay. You'd better say something.
I know your real name.

775
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,480
You think I'm scared of you?

776
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:57,248
Ok, you're nothing without a weapon.

777
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:03,224
And if this is so last month
to your father?

778
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,293
Would you like to talk about?

779
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:09,328
Jay. Please, dear.

780
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:17,338
Forgive me father.

781
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,399
I ruined everything.

782
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:27,510
But that's okay, I accept that title.

783
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,476
I looked down.

784
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:36,481
I've done that.

785
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:42,455
Be your child is very difficult.

786
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:52,499
This attitude, son.

787
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:59,437
And I'm not the only one who messed up.

788
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,499
Once again, Jim.

789
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:31,437
Give one.

790
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:34,382
What are you going to do?

791
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,512
We'll have red wine.

792
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:40,253
And we have friends all night.

793
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:42,255
About the police.

794
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,283
I'm talking about.
I felt good enough to sit here.

795
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:52,492
Hi, this is Hanna.

796
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,303

01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,282
They have to go.

802
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:17,253
- No.
- Do it.

803
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,225
Come in, Hanna.

804
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,462
Hey, guys, I'm sorry to disturb.
I do not think they know it all ...

805
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:29,327
I am a murderess!

806
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,307
One that you are looking for.

807
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,373
I'm sorry, Hanna.

808
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:36,502
I do not know what to do.

809
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,344
I do not know well.

810
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,244
Give me your belt.

811
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:48,313
Sit down.

812
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:51,486
Do it!

813
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,295
June.

814
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:57,264
It aims to provide a cake.

815
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,266
Like the pumpkin or apple?

816
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:04,304
I like pumpkin. It seems more suitable
Holiday

817
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,241
Hanna So, what are you doing here?

818

You.

822
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,448
- A long time.
- Yes.

823
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:27,294
I received a call from a detective
in Detroit.

824
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,227
- He wants to talk to you.
- What?

825
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:32,391
Are you in trouble with the police, J?

826
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,361
It's a little 'embarrassment to your people.

827
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:38,501
Me, this sounds pretty incredible.

828
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,309
What's wrong with you, man?

829
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:44,277
What are you pursuing?

830
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,471
- I want to know.
- I have something to give.

831
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,249
What is it?

832
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:55,482
My brother.

833
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,257
What?

834
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:04,364
Because when we were kids, I was protected,
because I could not defend myself.

835
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:11,269
I was very young, he thought that he could not
remember, but I remember everything.

836
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:17,472
thus catering for big guns blew me away the scarp

837
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:21,210
My brother has killed the devil.

838
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:25,477
He saved me from hell.
And I am forever grateful.

839
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:29,313
I really love her for it.

840
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:37,459
But now, I need a chance.

841
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,525
I took the chance for their lives.

842
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:44,362
And I want to thank my brother.

843
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:51,277
I need him please let me go.

844
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:20,441
Eat.

845
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:27,344
Eat!

846
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:10,381
You fall in love?

847
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:17,231
Do you think he loves you.

848
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,405
Do you think he loves you?

849
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,333
Look at me!

850
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,311
Look at me!

851
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:33,339
Do not touch his cock!

852
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:34,510
Sit!

853
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,456
You put your hands on the desk so that I can see!

854
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:49,330
- Bastard! Stop it!
- Are you there!

855
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:51,456
Sit! You sit down!

856
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,502
God damn hell!

857
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,466
Eddison!
Help! Come on, just go, just you and me!

858
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,299
- No!
- Come on! Right now! Come on.

859
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:02,468
- How to get through!
- I was a little girl.

860
01:23:03,445 --> 01:23:06,278
Do not, please!

861
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,475
You fuck, J?
Really?

862
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:12,247
Do you think cares about you?
See your boyfriend now!

863
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,345
Look at him!

864
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:16,447
- God no!
- Watch your family.

865
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,418
You see what you did!

866
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,320
He needs immediate help.

867
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:27,266
I take in Spark O'Neil.
1 mile from Cornieline 55.

868
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:32,295
Some men suspected hostage.
He wears a leather jacket.

869
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:33,398
And Eglo amblo.

870
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,237
Women as possible.

871
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,405
(MAN ON RADIO)

872
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:56,413
Dad!
Evy was in the room.

873
01:24:57,492 --> 01:25:00,256
Happy Thanksgiving!

874
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:02,456
I'm glad you came!

875
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,467
Do not do it!

876
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:08,434
Do not do it!

877
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:12,261
No!

878
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:44,328
Jack!

879
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,340
Help!

880
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:49,204
Help!

And 'my brother.

882
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:14,366
It hurt, J!

883
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,404
I love you, J?

884
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:24,341
Yes.

885
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:26,280
I do.

886
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,274
We have arrived!

887
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,244
Take girl!

888
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,280
I get it!

889
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,318
- Eddison!
- Hands behind!

890
01:27:05,486 --> 01:27:07,351
There are in!

891
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:12,385
Mom!
Get out of here!

892
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,360
Mom, I need you back!

893
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:16,397
Please, I need to go back!

894
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:20,232
Mom!
Take an ambulance!

895
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:23,369
Come on!
That's it!

896
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:33,247
- Another officer, are you sure?
- Wear protection.

897
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:36,441
You are in good shape.
Do you know what are the prospects?

898
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:53,228
What does the house look?

899
01:27:54,502 --> 01:27:56,436
I do not know!

900
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,332
Farm in the valley, I think.

901
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,245
As we grew.

902
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:06,345
the last.
