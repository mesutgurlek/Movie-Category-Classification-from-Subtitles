1
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,005
- You got the note?
- Yeah, right.

2
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:26,702
Nice and tight.
Two, three, four.

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,705
This is the Fordham section
of The Bronx: my home.

4
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,643
A world unto itself.

5
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:05,977
Any borough
is only 15 minutes away...

6
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,574
but they seem 3,000 miles away.

7
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,784
That's Mount Carmel Church.

8
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:15,757
The sound of the bells
filled the neighborhood.

9
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,836
lt was 1960, and doo-wop
was the sound on the streets.

10
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,845
l felt like there was a doo-wop
group on every corner back then.

11
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,583
What a time it was.

12
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,746
The Yankees were playing the
Pirates in the World Series...

13
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:49,485
and Mickey Mantle
was like a god to me.

14
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:53,495
My dad and l would go to Yankee
Stadium and see the Yankees win.

15
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:59,457
That's the Chez Bippy,
where all the guys hung out.

16
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,970
l'll tell you about them later.

17
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:08,535
That's my building.
l live on the third floor.

18
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:11,409
667 East 187th Street.

19
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,583
There's my stoop.

20
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:21,446
On warm summer nights
all through the neighborhood...

21
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:24,584
you would hear young ltalian men
romancing their women.

22
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:26,720
Hey, Marie!

23
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:29,765
- Get in the fucking car!
- No!

24
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,358
- Get in the car!
- Leave me alone.

25
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,903
- You know l love you.
- Yeah, bullshit.

26
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:36,996
Get in the fucking car!

27
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,344
And right there,
under that lamppost there...

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,356
stood the number-one man
in the neighborhood, Sonny.

29
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,360
Everybody loved Sonny
and treated him like a god.

30
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,296
And in my neighborhood,
he was a god.

31
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,926
l would sit on my stoop and
watch him, all day and night.

32
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:10,135
But he would never even
look at me.

33
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,073
Never, until one day.

34
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,579
- What do you want?
- You got room there for us?

35
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,178
You wish.

36
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:21,133
- Oh, shit!
- Let's go!

37
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,161
That's my dad, Lorenzo Anello.

38
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:57,571
His bus route was 187th Street.
l used to love riding with him.

39
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:01,037
That's me, Calogero,
at nine years old.

40
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,831
See you later, Pop.

41
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,164
Go right upstairs, son.

42
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:38,146
That's my mom, Rosina.
She met my dad at a dance.

43
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:40,876
They fell in love
and been together since.

44
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,394
You're always listening.
Take care of this fucking--

45
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,982
Come on. Knock him out!

46
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,364
The Chez Bippy.
This is where all the guys hung out.

47
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,458
Get the fuck out of here!
Take a walk!

48
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:43,338
Tony Toupee was owner of the bar
in name only.

49
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,340
lt was really Sonny's place.

50
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:51,306
Tony was a frustrated singer.
Everybody hated his voice.

51
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,440
So just for spite, he would
never utter a spoken word.

52
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:56,007
He would only sing it.

53
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,883
He was Tony Toupee
because of his lousy hairpiece.

54
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,819
Eddie Mush
was a degenerate gambler.

55
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,090
He was the world's
biggest loser.

56
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,065
He was "Mush" because everything
he touched turned to mush.

57
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,499
Never mind.
l need a winner.

58
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:17,198
At the track, the teller would
give him his tickets ripped up.

59
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:19,298
l had the Yankees. They lost.

60
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,811
lf it wasn't for bad luck,
l wouldn't have no luck at all.

61
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,147
JoJo the Whale.

62
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:28,775
You didn't walk with JoJo,
you walked among him.

63
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,979
lf you stared long enough,
you'd see him get fatter by the hour.

64
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:36,083
Legend has it his shadow
once killed a dog.

65
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:40,589
They called him
Frankie Coffeecake...

66
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:44,190
because his face looked like
a Drake's Coffeecake.

67
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,827
He was tough to look at.

68
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,573
Hey, kid, how you doing?

69
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:06,186
His name was Jimmy Whispers.
He was Sonny's main man.

70
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:10,419
He was "Whispers" because
everything was a secret to him.

71
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,690
Danny K.O. knocked guys out...

72
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:20,668
and Bobby Bars spent
half his life behind them.

73
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:24,638
This was Sonny's crew, and
nobody fucked with these guys.

74
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,577
What are you doing here
Didn't we tell you not to come here?

75
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:34,275
l told you to come upstairs!
Wait till l tell your father!

76
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,911
- What were you doing here?
- l was looking for Daddy.

77
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:39,420
That's very nice!

78
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,250
l have to get something in the store.
Don't move!

79
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:46,022
You wait right here! You hear me?

80
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:52,691
l always tried to imitate Sonny.
He still wouldn't look at me.

81
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:59,971
Sonny had five fingers...

82
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,101
but he only used three.

83
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,680
Come on. Let's go.
Move. Upstairs.

84
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,557
l'm not in the mood for steak.

85
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,650
You're not?

86
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:21,219
You know how often l have to drive
that bus back and forth...

87
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,561
so we can eat steak once a week?

88
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,566
- Seven.
- Who told you that?

89
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:26,896
Nobody. l counted.

90
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,062
Your father
wants to talk to you.

91
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:32,471
- About what?
- You were by the bar today.

92
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,101
- l wasn't.
- Tell your father the truth!

93
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,475
- l was by the bar.
- Why'd you lie?

94
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:39,878
- l took a shot.
- Wanna do something here?

95
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,076
What am l gonna say?
Nice try, son.

96
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:44,813
- Thanks, Dad.
- Lorenzo, come on, please!

97
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:47,048
How can l keep him away?
lt's two doors away.

98
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,387
Daddy's right.
Listen to him.

99
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,221
Shut up.
Nobody's talking to you.

100
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,158
Give me your plate.

101
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:56,630
l want you to listen to me.

102
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:00,601
Do not go near the bar.
Stay on the stoop.

103
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:03,467
- When you're older, you'll understand.
- Yes.

104
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:07,839
- You don't see me going there.
- Mommy won't let you go either?

105
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,073
- What am l going to do?
- l got him all day.

106
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,707
l'm just kidding.
l'll won't go near the bar.

107
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:21,916
Look what l got. Two tickets,
Yankee Stadium, center field.

108
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,323
- Behind the Mick?
- Right behind number seven.

109
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:27,021
- Now eat your steak.
- Yeah!

110
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,258
Let's go, Alfie.

111
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,428
That's Phil the Peddler.

112
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,665
He would call everybody "Mary."

113
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,675
Me and my friends would
love to break his balls.

114
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:46,045
Slick and Crazy Mario
were my best friends.

115
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:48,583
Slick got his name
because of his hair.

116
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:51,484
Mario got his
because he was just crazy.

117
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,383
l'll kick your fucking asses
for you, you bunch of Marys.

118
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:02,259
Stay away from the fruit!
Keep your hands off the fruit!

119
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:03,798
You fucking Marys!

120
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,131
l'll kick you loose, you Marys!
The three of you!

121
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,934
l'll kick your fucking asses,
you fucking ball breakers!

122
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:15,636
Stay away from the vegetables!
What do you think this is?

123
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,908
Wait! Go make your mother
and father feed you!

124
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:22,815
l'll give you the heave-ho,
you fucking ball breakers!

125
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:25,684
How many did you get?

126
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:27,688
You don't stop
borrowing money!

127
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,316
Oh, boy,
Coffeecake's in trouble again.

128
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,916
What should l do?

129
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:33,621
He's gonna get his ass kicked.

130
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:36,893
Guys, check it out.
Mario, who's this?

131
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,407
That's Jimmy Whispers.

132
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:51,844
You'd better talk to him again.
You're responsible for him.

133
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,848
Whoa! Come on, wait a minute.

134
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:01,184
lt's Sonny.

135
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,492
You do somebody now,
big mouth.

136
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,859
Do somebody hard,
like Coffeecake.

137
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,127
- l can't do Coffeecake!
- That's hard.

138
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,658
Put a screen in front of your
face while l throw shit at it.

139
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,972
Oh, shit.

140
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,369
These niggers got some balls,
coming in our neighborhood.

141
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,004
They just pass through
from school.

142
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,878
- How the fuck do you know?
- Dad told me.

143
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,885
My father told me
that's how it starts.

144
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:35,751
Hey, get the fuck out of our
neighborhood, fucking niggers!

145
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,758
Go back where you came from!

146
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:40,454
You're lucky
you're on that bus!

147
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,895
Go back where you came from!

148
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,061
Stay out of our neighborhood!
l'll kick your fucking ass!

149
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,439
Why?

150
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:08,848
You don't fucking stop.
Get the fuck out of here!

151
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:11,188
Nobody's cooler than you, Sonny.

152
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,824
What the fuck is wrong with you?

153
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,562
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, you scumbag!

154
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:23,730
You motherfucker!
l'll bust your fucking head!

155
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,900
l'll bust your fucking head!

156
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,818
What's going on here?

157
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:41,155
Give me the gun!

158
00:15:41,223 --> 00:15:43,214
Move the fucking car!

159
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,093
Come on!

160
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,732
When Sonny looked at me,
l went deaf.

161
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,435
l couldn't hear.

162
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,946
All l could see was Sonny
with the gun in his hand.

163
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,703
What happened?

164
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,571
Dad, it was just
a parking space.

165
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:35,803
- You don't understand.
- ls he all right?

166
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:38,005
- Baby, are you okay?
- Let's go inside.

167
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,275
- What happened?
- l'm okay, Mom.

168
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:43,648
Oh, my god, l got so scared.

169
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:52,286
You don't understand. They were
fighting over a parking space. Why?

170
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:55,091
lt wasn't over a parking space.
They just met at the wrong time.

171
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:57,359
- What kind of answer is that?
- Leave it alone.

172
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,367
He's okay.
That's the main thing.

173
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,596
l can't believe somebody
would do this.

174
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:06,773
Who is it?

175
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:09,106
Police. ls this
the Anello residence?

176
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,838
Yeah. Can l help you?

177
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,543
We'd like to ask you
some questions.

178
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:18,845
- About what?
- Just open the door!

179
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,493
How you doing? Good.

180
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,122
l'm Detective Belsik.
This is Detective Vella.

181
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:30,961
Hello, son. How you doing, ma'am?

182
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:33,767
We'd like to ask your son
a few questions.

183
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,532
- About what?
- There was a shooting outside.

184
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:40,405
- We believe your son was there.
- Really? He knows nothing about that.

185
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,376
There were people who saw him.

186
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:44,378
They're wrong.
He don't know nothing.

187
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:48,348
We can do things
the nice way or the hard way.

188
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,647
l don't care.
He don't know nothing.

189
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,914
Daddy, l know everything.

190
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,650
Kids. Sometimes they
make believe they see things.

191
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:02,823
We didn't pick your name out of a hat.
We know he was there. So let's go.

192
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,098
Son, here's what
l'd like you to do for us.

193
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,765
Take a walk downstairs with us and
your father. We have people down there.

194
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,140
l want you to pick out
the person you saw with the gun.

195
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:19,442
That's it. You think
you could do that for us?

196
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,892
Good. Come on.
Let's take a walk.

197
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:36,590
Mr. Anello,
take a walk downstairs.

198
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,257
- We won't be long.
- Will he be okay?

199
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:43,236
Everything's fine.
They'll be back in two minutes.

200
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,461
There's Lorenzo.

201
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,454
Fellas, turn around.

202
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:46,594
You two, take your hats off.

203
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:51,361
Put your head up.
Straight ahead. Look this way.

204
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,806
- ls that him?
- No.

205
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:03,479
How about this guy?
Straight ahead, fella.

206
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:04,780
How about him?

207
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:10,724
Straight ahead, you.
How about this guy?

208
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,494
Give me an answer.
How about him?

209
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,127
How about him?
ls it this guy?

210
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,438
Give me an answer.

211
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,114
Hey! Put your eyes up!

212
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,313
How about this guy?

213
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,692
Let's go. Hey, look
straight ahead! Over here.

214
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,094
Look at me. That's it.

215
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,792
ls it this guy?

216
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:55,866
- How about this guy?
- No.

217
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,870
Look at this guy.
How about him?

218
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:05,573
Hey! Straight ahead.

219
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,178
How about this guy?
ls it him?

220
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,796
Give me an answer.

221
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,032
- You satisfied, Officer?
- No.

222
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:36,134
- He don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, he doesn't know.

223
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,873
- He said he can't help you.
- Take a walk.

224
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:41,711
- Go ahead. Take a walk.
- Come on, son.

225
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:51,648
You guys can breathe again.
Get out of my sight.

226
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:58,865
- We really fooled them, Dad.
- Yeah.

227
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:02,301
l didn't rat, Dad.

228
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:03,804
No, you didn't rat.

229
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,840
l did a good thing, right?

230
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,139
Yeah, you did a good thing
for a bad man.

231
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:14,810
l did a good thing
for a bad man.

232
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:17,477
l didn't understand that
at nine years old.

233
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,181
All l knew was...

234
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,190
a rat was the lowest thing you
could be in my neighborhood...

235
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,555
and l didn't rat.

236
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:43,773
Why did you say l did
a good thing for a bad man?

237
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,276
Because sometimes you have to do
things that aren't right.

238
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,443
Do you understand?

239
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,491
No. lt's just that l thought
l did the right thing.

240
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,460
Now l'm not sure l did.

241
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:03,896
You did do the right thing.
When you get older, you'll see.

242
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,092
Your mother and l
love you very much.

243
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,707
Tomorrow you ride
on the bus with me. Okay?

244
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:21,610
City lsland was the last stop
on my father's route.

245
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,311
lt was one of our
favorite places.

246
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,877
lt was like
a daylong vacation.

247
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:30,889
My dad listened to jazz
and we talked about baseball.

248
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,728
Can l have an ice cream?

249
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:41,163
We do our job first,
then ice cream.

250
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:42,669
Okay, Pop.

251
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,940
Here.

252
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:51,743
- Let's play the game.
- Let's see how good you are.

253
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:53,906
What player last won
the Triple Crown?

254
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:57,383
Mickey Mantle.
Batting average, .353.

255
00:23:57,452 --> 00:24:01,548
RBls, 130. Home runs, 52.

256
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:05,517
- That's pretty good.
- He's the greatest player ever.

257
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,528
Joe D.'s
the greatest ballplayer.

258
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,690
The Yankee Clipper.
56-game hitting streak.

259
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:15,668
- Nobody beat that. Right, Dad?
- Nobody beat that, son.

260
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,000
- You know why Joe D. was great?
- Because he was ltalian?

261
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:23,067
- Well, that's part of it.
- Then why?

262
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:26,581
Because he had the most talent.
That's right.

263
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:32,819
- Do l have talent, Dad?
- Of course you do.

264
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,549
Can l be a ballplayer?

265
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:37,621
You can be anything
you want to be.

266
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:40,559
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

267
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:44,895
lf you've got talent and do the
wrong thing, nothing happens.

268
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,764
But when you do right,
good things happen.

269
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,498
- You hear me?
- You're right.

270
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,006
- Let's get that ice cream.
- Good.

271
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,344
- l'll shut the doors, right?
- Yeah.

272
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:02,273
Ready. Watch it.

273
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,680
- Got it?
- l got it.

274
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:13,119
Wasted talent was something my
father talked about all my life.

275
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,987
Let's hurry.
The game's starting.

276
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:20,762
36,683 here to see
the final game...

277
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:22,700
of the '60 Series.

278
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,137
And what a ball game
they're looking at.

279
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:28,608
Moose Skowron, with that
infield hit deep to third...

280
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:32,374
has picked up his twelfth
World Series base hit in 1960.

281
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:39,148
Time called. Blanchard back--

282
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,153
Come on, Sonny.

283
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,689
One out, unassisted,
to Nelson, to end the sixth.

284
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,861
Southpaw hitter.
Elroy Face...

285
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:58,132
staring down to
his battery mate Hal Smith.

286
00:25:58,206 --> 00:26:01,107
lnto the stretch.
The little man sets.

287
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:02,939
Here's the first one
to Blanchard.

288
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:04,706
Outside and a ball.

289
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:10,478
See you later, Pop.

290
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:19,586
Get right upstairs
and watch the rest of the game.

291
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,652
No hanging out, son.

292
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:32,766
Hey, Lorenzo, how you doing?

293
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,241
Keep driving.
l want to talk to you.

294
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:39,171
Your kid is a good kid.

295
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:40,612
Thanks.

296
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,116
Sonny appreciates
what you two did.

297
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,085
That's all right. l'm just glad
everything worked out.

298
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,416
He'll help you now.

299
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:51,152
You drop some numbers off for us
and make $150 a week.

300
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:55,526
- Do it right off the bus.
- Thanks, but l got a city job.

301
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:57,758
- l could lose it.
- Think about it.

302
00:26:57,832 --> 00:26:59,857
l just can't do it.

303
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,596
$150 a week. You don't
want to think about it?

304
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,640
l can't do this.
lt's not for me.

305
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:09,040
Sonny will be disappointed,
but l'll give him your answer.

306
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,869
Stop the bus.
l want to get off.

307
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:33,763
- They offered me a job today.
- Doing what?

308
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:37,566
Numbers. l just drop off
a piece of paper...

309
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:39,573
and get 150 a week.

310
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,768
What did you say?

311
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:45,677
What do you think?
l told him it's not for me.

312
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:51,618
What?

313
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:56,615
l don't know. 150 dollars?
lt's only numbers.

314
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:59,956
- You think l should've took it?
- l don't know.

315
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:05,697
But you get involved with those guys,
next thing, one, two three--

316
00:28:13,808 --> 00:28:15,469
l don't like the way you look.

317
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,777
Maybe you're right.

318
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:22,483
- l'm going to check on the baby.
- Come here.

319
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,484
- What?
- Come here.

320
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,551
Are you sorry you got stuck
with a bus driver?

321
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,821
l fell in love
with your uniform.

322
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,005
The day of the funeral,
l felt really bad.

323
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:49,533
l realized a man died, and l
lied and committed a mortal sin.

324
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,545
l wanted God's forgiveness.

325
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,617
Bless me, Father,
for l have sinned.

326
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:07,422
lt has been one month
since my last confession...

327
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:11,295
and these are my sins:
l missed Sunday Mass twice...

328
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,698
l lied
about witnessing a murder once.

329
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:18,068
- l ate meat on Friday--
- Wait. Can you back up a bit?

330
00:29:19,107 --> 00:29:20,665
l ate meat on Friday once?

331
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:23,176
Not that one.
Back up a little more.

332
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:26,543
- About witnessing a murder?
- Yeah, that's the one.

333
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:29,082
Do you realize what you said?

334
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,981
lt was only once.

335
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:35,216
- Do you know what the fifth is?
- Yes, Father, l know.

336
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,622
"l refuse to answer
because l might incrimin--"

337
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,284
The Fifth Commandment.

338
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:41,751
"Thou shall not kill."

339
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:47,429
That's right. Now, l want you
to tell me what happened.

340
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:50,096
No, Father, l'm not
telling nobody nothing.

341
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,139
Don't be afraid, my son.

342
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,973
- Nobody's more powerful than God.
- l don't know about that.

343
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,171
Your guy's
bigger than my guy up there...

344
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:00,680
but my guy's bigger than yours
down here.

345
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,848
You got a point. Five Our
Fathers and five Hail Marys.

346
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:10,254
For a murder rap? Not bad.

347
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,089
- What did you say?
- Bye, Father!

348
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:16,062
lt was great to be Catholic
and go to confession.

349
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,064
You could start over
every week.

350
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:30,706
Hey, kid!

351
00:30:34,282 --> 00:30:38,343
Sonny wants to see you. Nobody's
going to grab that bike.

352
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:49,629
They're good kids.
They just did some work for me.

353
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:51,892
- Put them in.
- lt's up to you.

354
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:56,801
Here's the kid, Sonny.
Go ahead. Don't be afraid.

355
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:09,908
How you doing, kid?

356
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,251
Good.

357
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:16,622
We finally meet face-to-face.

358
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:22,161
Are you afraid of me?

359
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,988
- No.
- That's good.

360
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,467
What's your name?

361
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,535
Calogero.

362
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:33,171
That's a big name.
You got a nickname?

363
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,543
- What do your friends call you?
- Calogero.

364
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:41,309
That makes sense.

365
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:44,078
Are you a Yankee fan?

366
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:48,880
Sit down.

367
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:53,725
Come over here.
Sit next to me.

368
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:02,732
You must be pretty upset
after the Yankees lost.

369
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:06,171
Bill Mazeroski, l hate him.

370
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,336
He made Mickey Mantle cry.
The papers said the Mick cried.

371
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:13,107
Mickey Mantle?
That's what you're upset about?

372
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,582
Mantle makes $100,000 a year.
How much does your father make?

373
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:19,484
- l don't know.
- You don't know.

374
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:22,853
lf your dad needs money, go ask
Mickey Mantle. See what happens.

375
00:32:22,924 --> 00:32:26,291
Mickey Mantle don't care about
you. Why care about him?

376
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,760
Nobody cares.

377
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:31,492
Can l ask you something?

378
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:33,227
Sure.

379
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:37,337
Did you shoot that man
over a parking space?

380
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:44,601
When you get older,
you'll understand.

381
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:53,613
From that day on, l never felt
the same about the Yankees.

382
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,435
l started spending a lot
of time with Sonny.

383
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:22,273
l would come home from school
and sneak away any chance l got.

384
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,875
l would serve the guys drinks and coffee
for tips.

385
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:27,716
- Bet!
- l'll lay a hundred.

386
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:36,125
Come on, Sonny!

387
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,429
- Son of a bitch!
- l don't believe it!

388
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,229
l should break his arm.

389
00:33:41,969 --> 00:33:44,301
Here, kid, this is for you.

390
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:48,604
- Loan me a hundred.
- You know what's gonna happen!

391
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:50,906
- l feel it! Please!
- Give him a hundred.

392
00:33:50,978 --> 00:33:54,436
- l'm in, l'm in!
- Go ahead. Give him the dice.

393
00:33:54,515 --> 00:33:56,073
- Give him the dice.
- l'm in!

394
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,017
-lt's fucking hot.
-Come on, Mush, make a donation.

395
00:33:59,087 --> 00:34:02,488
- Get this over with, Mush.
- Come on, dice.

396
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:06,789
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Come on, seven!

397
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:09,022
Come on! Come on, dice!

398
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,592
- And seven!
- l don't even have to look.

399
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:15,761
- Craps! l'm out!
- Get out of here.

400
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:21,364
- Get him out of here!
- Man never hit a number in his life!

401
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:25,071
Bring the dice up here.

402
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:25,908
Where's the kid?

403
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:31,383
-Put this coffee on my tab?
-Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

404
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:35,513
Where's the kid? The kid's
gonna throw the dice for me.

405
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,423
Sonny, don't let this kid
throw the dice!

406
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,826
- Anybody got a problem with that?
- No problem.

407
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,926
l want you to throw the dice for me.

408
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,469
- l don't know how to play.
- You don't have to know.

409
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:52,631
You just listen to me.
Hear what l said?

410
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:55,232
Put 500 down on the kid.

411
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:57,300
l got a hundred!

412
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,280
Can you stop fucking
leaning on me, please?

413
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,257
- You're breathing all over me.
- Hey, JoJo, relax!

414
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:13,919
l'm trying to get a bet in.
l wanna play too!

415
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,192
You got to hit the wall, kid.
You can do it. Hit the wall.

416
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,234
- You can do it.
- Wait!

417
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,236
l'm betting on Sonny.

418
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:25,568
l don't want your money
touching mine.

419
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,940
What, it's counterfeit?
My money's no good no more? Why?

420
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,809
Because you're
a fucking jinx, that's why!

421
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,475
Put him in the bathroom!
Get him out of here!

422
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:41,954
Get in there,
you fucking loser mutt!

423
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:43,513
Leave him in there!

424
00:35:45,426 --> 00:35:47,257
- A fucking jinx!
- Shoot the dice.

425
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,292
That's a lot of money on you.
Come on.

426
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:53,390
- Roll a seven. Come on.
- Shoot the fucking dice.

427
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:56,736
Seven!

428
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:02,569
Bring the dice up.
Put $1,000 on seven.

429
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:12,778
You can do it, all right?

430
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:14,116
You--

431
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:17,419
Stop fucking breathing on me!
You're killing me over here!

432
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:20,551
l'm on a win streak.
Stop breathing on me!

433
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:23,563
- Put him in the bathroom.
- Eddie's in there. He won't fit.

434
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:27,123
l don't give a fuck!
Put him in there!

435
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:39,142
Give me a another seven.

436
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:41,374
Shoot the fucking dice!
Come on!

437
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:46,283
We got a four! That's all right.

438
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:47,844
Four's what we got.

439
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:51,483
- Let's go! Shoot the dice!
- Give the kid another shot!

440
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,494
What's wrong with this money?
What, is he crazy?

441
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:55,756
ls it counterfeit?

442
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:00,094
l say the kid makes the four.
Give me $500.

443
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,691
Get your bets down.

444
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:06,035
- Twenty-two on the hard four.
- l'll lay a hundred.

445
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,837
- Who wants a gag on the four?
- One-forty, no gag.

446
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,537
Put it down.

447
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:13,774
- l say he makes the hard four.
- He'll never make it.

448
00:37:13,848 --> 00:37:17,284
- Come on. You can do it.
- Don't worry. l'll throw a seven.

449
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:19,512
- No seven!
- Yeah! Hit a seven!

450
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:22,112
- Shut up!
- Quiet!

451
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:26,888
- Do you believe this kid?
- Nobody laughs at this kid.

452
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:28,690
Seven's are not good now.

453
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,731
- Hit the wall.
- Get a four.

454
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:33,028
Make the point.
You can do it.

455
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,599
Frankie Coffeecake, no good.

456
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,573
l don't want his face looking
at that face when he's throwing dice.

457
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:44,373
Jimmy, get a towel from the bar.
Put it over his head.

458
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:47,243
l don't want a towel over
my head. lt's embarrassing.

459
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:49,749
Put him in the fucking bathroom.

460
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:52,183
Wait a minute. l got money here!

461
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:55,245
Get the fuck out of here!

462
00:37:55,323 --> 00:37:57,484
- Get him the fuck out!
- Put him in the bathroom.

463
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,082
Get over here.

464
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:05,259
- Rat bastard locks us in here.
- Very degrading.

465
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,301
l need that point. Listen!

466
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,599
See that money over there?
See that money?

467
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:14,198
Are we going to make this point?
Come on. Attaboy!

468
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:17,711
- Come on!
- l need a 2-2 on the hard four.

469
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:20,440
Hey, don't get cocky, kid!

470
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:21,879
Fucking kid.

471
00:38:21,949 --> 00:38:24,417
Just make the point. Go ahead.

472
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,317
l don't fucking believe it!
He did it!

473
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:32,793
Eleven. l made eleven
passes in a row.

474
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:38,694
l don't know how much money
Sonny won, but it was a lot.

475
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:46,435
He said the working man
was a sucker...

476
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:50,068
and l was at the best school:
the University of Belmont Ave.

477
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:54,137
l was getting two educations:
from the street and from school.

478
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:57,150
That way l'd be twice as smart
as everybody.

479
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:13,533
Hey, kid, you did good.

480
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,728
- Thanks.
- Here.

481
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,572
That's it?

482
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:22,675
Here.

483
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:26,078
All right?

484
00:39:26,914 --> 00:39:30,008
- Go home. lt's getting late.
- See you later.

485
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,356
Listen.

486
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,849
We got to fix your name.

487
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:43,193
From now on, you're C.

488
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:45,494
- C?
- That's right. C.

489
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:47,193
Go home.

490
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:49,668
So long, Sonny.

491
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,262
Sonny took me everywhere
and introduced me as his boy.

492
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,138
l noticed strange things started
happening in the neighborhood.

493
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:00,647
Hey, Calogero, come on over.
l want to talk to you.

494
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,183
My name is C.

495
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:07,487
l mean C.

496
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:10,991
- How are you today, my boy?
- Good.

497
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:13,526
l got nice peaches
for your mom.

498
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:15,755
l don't have any money.

499
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,230
You don't need no money
with me, kid.

500
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:21,500
Don't embarrass me
like that again.

501
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,606
Just tell Sonny
that l took care of you.

502
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:37,048
l saw it was because of Sonny
that everyone was being so nice.

503
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:40,281
l liked it.
l liked it a lot.

504
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:48,489
Mommy, look what l got.
Some peaches for...

505
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,529
free.

506
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:02,702
- What's this?
- What's what, Dad?

507
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:06,075
Where did you get this? Your mother
found this behind your drawer.

508
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,272
l've been saving.

509
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:11,750
$600? Did you become
a brain surgeon overnight, son?

510
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:14,150
Tell your father
where you got the money.

511
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,712
- l worked for it.
- Doing what?

512
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:20,521
- Things.
- "Things"? What do you mean?

513
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:22,562
Oh, things. You know, things.

514
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:27,032
Don't lie. Just tell the truth
and l won't get upset.

515
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:31,130
- Promise?
- Would l say it if l didn't mean it?

516
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,601
l work the crap games for tips.

517
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:37,610
- Crap games?
- What crap games?

518
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:40,241
What crap games?
What tips?

519
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:44,413
- What crap games?
- You said you wouldn't get mad.

520
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:45,850
l lied. Tell me.

521
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,151
- l work for Sonny for tips.
- l knew it.

522
00:41:49,223 --> 00:41:52,715
Weren't you told
not to go near that bar?

523
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:54,818
- But l worked for it.
- What do you mean?

524
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:57,159
- You're not supposed to go there!
- l'm taking it back.

525
00:41:57,231 --> 00:42:00,098
-l'm bringing it back to the bar.
-Let's just think about it for a minute.

526
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,102
- What are you saying?
- We could use the money.

527
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,899
lt's not like
he had to do something bad.

528
00:42:04,972 --> 00:42:08,772
You know where this comes from. l don't
want him having that kind of money!

529
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:11,606
- Let's just think about it--
- That's it!

530
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:14,079
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.

531
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:19,982
Why do you got to go down
like this? Calm down!

532
00:42:20,054 --> 00:42:22,614
Lorenzo, please!

533
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,624
l don't believe this!

534
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,273
- ls Sonny around?
- l think he's in the back.

535
00:42:57,424 --> 00:42:58,948
We can't accept that.

536
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:01,957
Your son worked for it.

537
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:05,089
Right. My son. l don't want him
involved in what goes on here.

538
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,065
lnvolved in what?

539
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,035
Please, l'm not a stupid man.

540
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:14,404
- Just stay away from my son.
- Hey, you stay right over here.

541
00:43:14,475 --> 00:43:16,238
C, go outside.

542
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:20,246
l'll speak to my own son.
Calogero, wait outside.

543
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:25,245
First, l respect you, Lorenzo.
You're a stand-up guy.

544
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,584
But don't ever talk to me
like that again.

545
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:30,920
l tell your son
to go to school--

546
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:35,428
lt's not what you say, it's what
he sees-- clothes, cars, money.

547
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:38,231
He threw away
his baseball cards...

548
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,790
because Mickey Mantle
would never pay my rent.

549
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,530
He said that?
l don't believe this kid.

550
00:43:43,604 --> 00:43:47,904
That's not funny when he has
a bigger bank account than l do.

551
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:50,102
l offered you work.
You said no.

552
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:53,544
And l say no now.
Just leave my son alone.

553
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:57,243
Don't you see l treat that kid
like he's my son?

554
00:43:57,318 --> 00:44:00,549
He ain't your son.
He's my son!

555
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:02,680
- Get out!
- l'm not afraid of you.

556
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:05,054
- You should be.
- l know what you can do.

557
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:08,424
And l would never
step out of line.

558
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:11,896
But this time you're wrong.
This is my son, not yours!

559
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:15,765
You want to fight? Get out or
l'll give you a fucking slap!

560
00:44:15,836 --> 00:44:17,770
Stay away from my son!

561
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:20,466
- l don't care who you are!
- Get out of here!

562
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:24,033
- Where's my money?
- lt's in there.

563
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:25,908
lt was mine!

564
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:28,607
That's bad money!
You can't have it.

565
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:31,708
- l earned that money!
- Stay away from him!

566
00:44:31,785 --> 00:44:34,276
- Please listen!
- Stay away from him!

567
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:37,950
- Dad, listen to me!
- Did you hear me? Stay away!

568
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:41,961
Sonny was right.
The working man is a sucker.

569
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:44,293
Wrong! Pulling a trigger
doesn't take strength.

570
00:44:44,365 --> 00:44:48,563
Get up every day and work for a
living! Let's see him try that!

571
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:51,661
We'll see who's really tough.
The working man is tough.

572
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:54,003
Your father's the tough guy!

573
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:57,066
Everybody loves him, just like
everybody loves you on the bus.

574
00:44:57,144 --> 00:45:00,773
No, it's not the same. People
don't love him. They fear him.

575
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:02,713
There's a difference.

576
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:07,019
- l'm sorry.
- l don't understand, Dad.

577
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:10,682
You will.
You will when you get older.

578
00:45:12,426 --> 00:45:14,360
l'm sorry l hit you.

579
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:42,650
- Should l take care of him?
- No, leave him alone.

580
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,688
Sonny and my father never
spoke to each other again.

581
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:51,128
l never listened to my father
about staying away from him.

582
00:45:51,198 --> 00:45:54,998
The bar was so close.
l'd sneak away any chance l got.

583
00:45:55,068 --> 00:45:59,664
Eight years passed, and
as l grew, Sonny grew in power.

584
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:02,834
He became a boss,
and l was his friend.

585
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:22,319
Dion was topping the charts.

586
00:46:22,396 --> 00:46:24,591
The Beatles were changing
our life-styles.

587
00:46:24,665 --> 00:46:27,964
The Yankees were in last place
and l didn't give a shit.

588
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,801
There was change everywhere, but
my neighborhood was the same.

589
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,067
They're off! Kryptonite
comes first from the gate!

590
00:46:37,144 --> 00:46:40,671
- On the outside--
- Here's the kid! We're in!

591
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:44,444
- C! You get it in?
- Yeah. lt's all on Kryptonite.

592
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:47,681
- You hold them.
- Look at this horse go.

593
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:50,723
- Come on. Take it home!
- Look at this one move!

594
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:54,921
- This horse can't lose!
- You can do it, Kryptonite!

595
00:46:54,995 --> 00:46:58,795
lt's a lock. Don't even worry
about it. We can't lose.

596
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:02,859
l'm not even going to look
because l know we can't lose.

597
00:47:02,936 --> 00:47:06,235
- Look! He's pulling away!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

598
00:47:06,306 --> 00:47:08,331
Come on, Kryptonite!
Look at him!

599
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,808
Forget it. lt's over.
lt's all over.

600
00:47:10,878 --> 00:47:12,709
Let's go!

601
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:16,215
- That's it, Kryptonite!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

602
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:19,616
Bring me luck!
Come on. Bring me luck!

603
00:47:19,686 --> 00:47:22,177
Come on, Kryptonite!
Hang in there!

604
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,656
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Let's go!

605
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:27,819
Get the--
He bet the fucking horse?

606
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:30,557
He bet Kryptonite?
Give me the tickets.

607
00:47:30,631 --> 00:47:32,155
But, Sonny, we're winning.

608
00:47:32,232 --> 00:47:37,067
We can't win. The Mush
bet Kryptonite. Fucking jinx!

609
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:40,573
- We're five lengths in the lead.
- Come on. We've been "mushed."

610
00:47:40,641 --> 00:47:43,701
Come on. l got to get away
from this fucking jinx.

611
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,803
- Come on, one!
- Fucking jinx!

612
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,905
Come on. You can still do it!

613
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:51,974
Come on, Kryptonite.
You can still do it!

614
00:47:52,052 --> 00:47:56,011
- Hang in there!
- Come on. Take it home!

615
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:58,455
Hang in there!

616
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,758
Shit!

617
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:07,163
- Fuck! This fucking close!
- l don't believe l lost!

618
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:08,963
l don't fucking believe it!

619
00:48:09,036 --> 00:48:12,005
Hey, C, l got a tip
in the next race for you.

620
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:14,063
Go fuck yourself!

621
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:16,942
You're very emotional.

622
00:48:20,013 --> 00:48:23,505
White Birch wins it
in an absolute shocker!

623
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:37,996
We finally got our own
social club.

624
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:39,999
We called it the Deuces Wild.

625
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:43,833
Drinks were a buck
and the jukebox paid the rent.

626
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:45,838
We only cared
about hanging out.

627
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,737
We would cut class
and hang out all day and night.

628
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,607
Nobody wanted to go home...

629
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:55,375
because you might leave and find
out later you missed something.

630
00:49:00,053 --> 00:49:03,989
Whoa, look at those broads
over there. They're beautiful!

631
00:49:16,837 --> 00:49:19,567
Yo, get over here!
Come here!

632
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,336
Put it back in your pants.

633
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:25,242
- Those broads are both pigs.
- How do you know?

634
00:49:25,312 --> 00:49:28,304
- Fuck you, C.
- How the hell do you know?

635
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,840
- They'd fail my test fast.
- What test?

636
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:36,582
lf you want to marry a girl,
she's got to pass the test.

637
00:49:36,657 --> 00:49:40,525
- l call it the Mario test.
- This l got to hear.

638
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:44,360
The test is, you take a girl
for a ride in your car.

639
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:49,300
You pull up to one of them big
18-wheelers on the highway.

640
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,133
You pull alongside it
and get the driver's attention.

641
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:56,073
Honk your horn. Make sure
he's looking. That's important.

642
00:49:56,143 --> 00:49:59,135
At the same time, put your hand
behind this broad's head...

643
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:01,976
and push her head down
between your legs.

644
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:06,008
- Get the fuck out of here.
- lt's for her own good.

645
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,021
Now, if this girl
goes down on you...

646
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,489
knowing that truck driver
is watching...

647
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:14,083
then she's a pig
who can't be trusted.

648
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:16,061
You're a sick maniac.

649
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:20,293
When they're into it, they
throw their hair over their ear.

650
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:23,734
They did it before. Believe me,
they're fucking pros.

651
00:50:39,252 --> 00:50:42,744
That's the second time
those niggers passed today.

652
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:47,624
- Who gives a fuck?
- l give a fuck, that's who.

653
00:50:47,694 --> 00:50:50,288
Did they bother you? No.

654
00:50:50,363 --> 00:50:53,696
Today it's one car, then two,
then it's their neighborhood!

655
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:57,396
- Then they'll fuck our broads.
- They shouldn't be here. Period.

656
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,099
lnvite them in.
Make them have a drink.

657
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:02,232
Smash their fucking heads.

658
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,335
You want a shot?
Take one. Come back!

659
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:11,245
Louie? Dumps! Get over here!
Where's my money?

660
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,786
l got to do that thing.
l can't--

661
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:17,984
This guy owes me 20 bucks.
lt's been two fucking weeks.

662
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:19,992
You can't dodge me forever!

663
00:51:20,894 --> 00:51:22,623
Fucking piece of shit.

664
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,539
l'll be right back.

665
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:37,702
- All right, l'll see you.
- Come back.

666
00:51:44,551 --> 00:51:46,519
Take a ride with me.

667
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:49,453
- Do l have to?
- Yeah, you have to. Come on.

668
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,761
Sit over here.

669
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,971
This music
gives me a headache.

670
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:13,308
You kids today don't even know
what good music is.

671
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,177
This is good music.

672
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:25,924
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

673
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:34,328
You listening to me?

674
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:40,003
Can't you call me C?
Everybody does.

675
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,769
Calogero was your grandfather's
name, the name l gave you.

676
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:45,778
That's why l can't call you
C or whatever it is.

677
00:52:49,182 --> 00:52:51,116
Want to go to the fights?

678
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:56,278
- Could l let you know tomorrow?
- Do you want to go or not?

679
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:00,387
- All right, l'll go.
- Don't say it like that.

680
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,396
Don't want to twist your arm.
Don't do me a favor.

681
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,025
She was tall,
she was beautiful...

682
00:54:12,098 --> 00:54:13,929
and she was classy.

683
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,195
But she was black.

684
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:21,640
And that was a no-no
in my neighborhood.

685
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,955
- Jackie, what's the first?
- 2:00, fellas.

686
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,931
- Two. Your friend's number.
- Who?

687
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,594
- Your pal.
- Don't fuck around.

688
00:54:49,669 --> 00:54:51,933
- Johnny Biscord bet 228 again?
- That's it.

689
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:53,472
- Again?
- Again.

690
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,333
l'll have better music
next time.

691
00:54:57,744 --> 00:55:00,178
l'm only kidding.
lt's okay, Pop.

692
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:06,247
See you later.

693
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,470
- Louie!
- My grandmother's sick.

694
00:55:29,542 --> 00:55:32,909
l'll talk to you later.
l got to go do something.
