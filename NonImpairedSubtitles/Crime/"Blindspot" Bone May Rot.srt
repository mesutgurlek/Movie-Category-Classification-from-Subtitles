- No.

Then why is your name
tattooed on her back?

(Patterson) All of her tattoos
are brand-new.

167
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,704
I was alone,
and I was just eating a...

168
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,172
a breakfast.

169
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:57,374
(Zapata)
Okay... does this tattoo

170
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,043
happen to mention
what we're looking for?

171
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,411
No.

172
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:02,379
The CDC is a huge organization.

173
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,415
Yeah.
Let's get started.

174
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,383
I'll let them
know you're coming.

175
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,751
Thanks.

176
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:12,022
Look, we have no idea what
we're getting ourselves into.

177
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:13,958
You sure you want
to bring her today?

178
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,292
We've been through this.

179
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:16,894
She might see
something that we don't.

180
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,229
(locker opens)

181
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,630
All right, honestly,
the idea of having her

182
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,432
armed and out in the field
makes me nervous.

183
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,367
She can handle herself.

184
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,902
Target practice is one thing,

185
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,351
but think about what
she's going through.

186
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:27,671
How's she supposed to focus?

187
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:29,833
I don't want to keep having
this conversation with you.

188
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,942
She's coming with us.

189
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,024
(phone ringing)

190
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:49,593
Hello.
Rebecca Fine.

191
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,328
I'm Deputy Director
of Epidemiology.

192
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,130
Kurt Weller, FBI.

193
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:54,365
Pleasure.

194
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,100
(man)
Sorry to keep you waiting.

195
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:59,036
Frank Surrey, Military Liaison
and Principal Director.

196
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:00,304
Edgar Reade.

197
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:01,705
(Surrey)
I understand you all need to

198
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:03,674
inspect our facility...
should we be concerned?

199
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:06,043
No. We're working
on a classified case.

200
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:07,578
Unfortunately, I can't
say much more than that,

201
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,546
but we do appreciate
your cooperation.

202
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,348
(Rebecca)
Great, just in time.

203
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,984
This is Juliette Chang,
my lab assistant.

204
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,386
Nice to meet you.

205
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:16,387
Juliette will take you
through security,

206
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,788
give you a tour.

207
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,124
Let us know if you
need anything else.

208
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,694
So anyone entering
the secure part of our lab

209
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:26,196
needs to go through
a decontamination process.

210
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,132
It seems like it should be
the other way around.

211
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:30,000
- (chuckling)
- (door beeps)

212
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:33,504
She's too smart for you.

213
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,908
I'll be turning on

214
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,678
an ultraviolet light
that will destroy any

215
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,747
<i>potentially harmful contaminants
that may be on your bodies.</i>

216
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:46,717
After we're done here, I'll
escort you to the vacuum room.

217
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,852
If everyone's ready, I'll go
ahead and start the process.

218
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:49,854
<i>All good.</i>

219
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:55,159
(electronic buzzing)

220
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:01,565
That's the reason why
we bring her in the field.

221

223
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:17,353
Ultraviolet tattoos
aren't especially rare,

224
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:20,242
but this application was genius.

225
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:21,911
Why haven't we seen this before?

226
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:23,746
<i>The UV frequency the CDC uses</i>

227
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:25,614
in their decontamination process

228
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:28,217
essentially cooked
the invisible ink like a...

229
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:30,653
like a sunburn, making it
visible under these conditions

230
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,254
and these conditions only.

231
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:34,023
<i>We never would have
seen this in a lab.</i>

232
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:35,958
So whoever tattooed them
knew that she'd have to be

233
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,760
at the CDC for them
to become visible?

234
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:39,962
<i>That's right.
It's a site-specific tattoo.</i>

235
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:42,431
So what do these numbers mean?

236
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,033
It's got to have something
to do with the CDC.

237
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:47,636
Juliette, do these
mean anything to you?

238
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,839
Those numbers follow
the exact sequence

239
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:52,174
we use to categorize
our lab specimens.

240
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,476
Which specimens?

241
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:54,844
Let me check.

242
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:57,546
(Juliette)
This is weird.

243
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:02,051
I think you need
to talk to my boss.

244
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,019
Each of these numbers
corresponds

245
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,722
with a sample vial
of an infectious disease.

246
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:08,557
SARS, MERS...

247
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,159
typhoid fever, Ebola.

248
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:12,128
Wait, those vials are kept here?

249
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,863
None of those diseases
have any cure.

250
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:16,632
Shouldn't they be kept in
a biohazard Level 4 facility?

251
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:22,338
We have an undisclosed
BHL4 lab at this facility.

252
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,341
(Rebecca) Knowledge of the lab
is strictly need-to-know.

253
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:27,309
Most of our own employees
aren't even aware of it.

254
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,645
So other than the fact that
these are dangerous diseases,

255
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:31,380
what else do they
have in common?

256
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,582
I mean, there's got to be
a reason they were singled out.

257
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:34,884
I wish I could tell you.

258
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,452
Actually, I think
I have something.

259
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:38,521
It looks like Walter

260
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:41,557
was the last person to
access all of the vials.

261
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,392
- Walter?
- Walter Tunnel.

262
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,761
He was our former director.

263
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:47,363
Where can we find him?

264
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:49,899
Unfortunately, Walter died
in an accident two years ago.

265
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:53,502
He was infected with a...
a rare form of botulism.

266
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:54,837
How'd he get infected?

267
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,906
There was a tear
in his safety suit.

268
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,507
It never should've happened.

269
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,776
It's taken us a long time
to get over the loss.

270
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:02,344
He was a wonderful man.

271
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:03,846
We're gonna need
to see those vials.

272
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:04,947
Of course.

273
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:06,382
Juliette, take them
down to BHL4.

274
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:09,218
I'll, uh, call in the clearance.

275
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,586
(Weller)
Reade, Zapata, find out

276
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,188
everything you can about
Walter's accident

277
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,522
and his connection to the vials.

278
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:14,857
Hey, Juliette.

279
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:16,926
Did you know Walter personally?

280
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:19,295
Yeah, I knew him really well.

281
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:20,763
I took his epidemiology class

282
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:23,566
at Columbia, and then
I interned for him.

283
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:25,734
I was there when he died.

284
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,803
It was...

285
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:29,405
It was a real shock.

286
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,740
He was always so careful.

287
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:32,942
Good to go?

288
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:34,810
Yeah, we're all set.

289
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:36,944
Now, the process for
entering a BHL4 lab

290
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:38,547
is a bit more complicated.

291
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:40,583
Let's get suited up and I'll
walk you guys through it.

292
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:41,750
Good.

293
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,370
- (door opens)
- Hey. Sorry.

294
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:48,958
Just wanted to check in
on the Guerrero file,

295
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,959
see where we're at.

296
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:51,126
I'm handling it.

297
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,795
Right... it's just,

298
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,731
Jane's tattoo is directly
related to this file,

299
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:56,999
and... and this could be
the key to everything.

300
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:58,067
If you could get it
unredacted...

301
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:59,068
I can't do that.

302
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,669
Okay...

303
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:04,173
Is...
Is there a... a reason

304
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:06,773
that you don't want me
looking into this case?

305
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:11,347
We still have agents in
the field who could be affected.

306
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:14,450
It's too dangerous
to start poking around.

307
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:15,985
I understand that.

308
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:19,021
But if you could just
give me some context...

309
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:23,259
When I say it's too dangerous,
it's too dangerous.

310
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:25,594
- I just... we're so...
- Tell me something.

311
00:12:25,596 --> 00:12:28,430
That CDC tattoo
you solved today,

312
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:31,166
"on your own"...

313
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,868
how'd you really crack it?

314
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:42,144
Maybe you should
get back to work.

315
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:43,812
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,485
(keypad beeping)

317
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:52,021
(beep, airlock hisses)

318
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:55,291
Follow me.

319
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,359
This is our BHL4 lab.

320
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:01,630
All the specimens are kept
in a negative 70-degree freezer.

321
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:05,801
(beep)

322
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,139
Shut the door
behind you, please.

323
00:13:10,141 --> 00:13:11,473
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,015
(air lock hisses)

325
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,338
That's strange.

326
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,540
It should be right here.

327
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:45,908
Maybe it got mislabeled.

328
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,942
Check the next number.

329
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,448
_

330
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:58,287
It's not there, either.

331
00:13:58,435 --> 00:13:59,577
_

332
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,528
So far, all the vials
from the tattoos are missing.

333
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,529
How is this possible?

334
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,797
(alarm buzzing)

335
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,798
What is that?

336
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,400
Did we set something off?

337
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:13,135
No, it wasn't us.
There must have been a breach.

338
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:14,303
We're in lockdown.

339
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,770
(alarm buzzing)

340
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:23,838
(Jane)
A breach?

341
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,072
Wh-What does that mean?

342
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,407
Are... are we safe
in here?

343
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:27,908
It could be
security-related

344
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,610
or a compromise
in one of the labs.

345
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:30,745
I just don't know.

346
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:32,580
When was the last time
this happened?

347
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,415
It was when Walter died.

348
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:38,185
He was the last person
to access the missing vials.

349
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,126
- I need to regroup with my team.
- No, I'm sorry.

350
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:41,856
That's just not
gonna be possible.

351
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:44,027
We have to stay here until
the lockdown is lifted.

352
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:46,619
For how long?
How long?!

353
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:49,884
_

354
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,633
Timing of this seem
a little weird to you?

355
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:53,635
Very.

356
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:56,871
Think Jane and Weller are okay?

357
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:58,139
Something might have
happened with those vials.

358
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:00,541
They're wearing HAZMAT suits.

359
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:03,310
Probably the safest ones
in here.

360
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:04,879
We should be in there with them.

361
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:06,280
I'm glad we're not.

362
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,385
You really wanna be stuck in
a room with Weller right now?

363
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:14,155
No window, no way out?

364
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:15,990
(chuckling)

365
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:18,325
That is a control freak's
worst nightmare.

366
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,535
Here, why...
Why don't you sit?

367
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:29,703
This feels deliberate.

368
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:32,640
Walter accesses those vials
and then dies in an accident.

369
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:35,543
As soon as we find out they're
gone, we get locked in here.

370
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,145
I... I agree, it's too
big of a coincidence,

371
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:41,015
but what can we do?

372
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:44,018
I mean, Juliette said
it's gonna be a while.

373
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:47,354
(sighs)

374
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:48,422
Kurt.

375
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,259
Sit, please.

376
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:53,894
You're making me nervous.

377
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,764
Here.

378
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,944
Will you tell me
about that night?

379
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,779
The night I went missing.

380
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:14,014
You... You said
you were there.

381
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:21,388
I was the only one there.

382
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:27,628
When your mom worked nights...

383
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,864
she'd ask me
to take care of you.

384
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:32,266
And you'd already gone to bed.

385
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:34,535
I went in to check on you.

386
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:39,206
And you were gone.

387
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:42,476
Then what happened?

388
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:43,844
I searched for you.

389
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,213
I checked the whole house.

390
00:16:47,816 --> 00:16:50,284
Did someone break in?

391
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:54,088
There were no signs
of forced entry.

392
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,890
No doors were open.

393
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,460
No windows were open.

394
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:04,398
You just vanished.

395
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,956
Were there any suspects?

396
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:33,627
Only one.

397
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:37,031
My father.

398
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:45,472
There was never
any physical evidence.

399
00:17:45,474 --> 00:17:48,108
But he lied about his alibi.

400
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:53,681
People thought that he was...

401
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:55,716
he was too close.

402
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:58,485
He was close to...

403
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,691
He denied it.

404
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:08,529
He still does.

405
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:10,164
(alarm sounding)

406
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,565
(woman on PA)
Lockdown has been lifted.

407
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:13,000
<i>All clear.</i>

408
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:18,372
I told Frank about
the missing vials.

409
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:19,506
He's on his way down.

410
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,874
The lockdown?

411
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,098
What happened?

412
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,853
According to security,
it was a false alarm.

413
00:18:23,882 --> 00:18:25,064
But it's strange.

414
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:27,708
Apparently, Rebecca is
the one who initiated it.

415
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:30,384
We need to talk to Rebecca.

416
00:18:30,386 --> 00:18:31,852
She's not here.

417
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:32,920
Where is she?

418
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,989
I'm sorry, who are you?

419
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,924
When did she leave?

420
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:38,592
(woman) Right before the lockdown.
She went to run an errand.

421
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:41,095
What is this about?
Y-You can't go in there.

422
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:43,731
Uh, you can't just do that!

423
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:48,869
(Reade) How'd she initiate
a lockdown

424
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,404
if she's not even
in the building?

425
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:52,106
It looks like she
accessed this computer

426
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:54,541
remotely from her laptop
after she left.

427
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:56,410
You think she did this
to trap us in here?

428
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,379
Yeah.
Question is why.

429
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:00,481
That's impossible.
They must have been misplaced.

430
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:01,915
No, they're missing.

431
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,150
Okay, we need to alert
security right now,

432
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:04,718
have them review video footage,

433
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,487
pass codes,
everything they have.

434
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:07,988
Who had access to the vials?

435
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,723
Only two people in the CDC
can give clearance

436
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:12,326
to get into that freezer...
myself and Rebecca.

437
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:13,627
We're gonna need
to talk to her now.

438
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:14,895
She's in the wind.

439
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:16,796
She initiated
a lockdown remotely.

440
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,332
Feels like she wanted
to tie us up.

441
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:19,276
Remotely from where?

442
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:20,868
Patterson tracked down
Rebecca's IP address.

443
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,370
She sent the lockdown commands
from a brownstone in Brooklyn.

444
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,438
Let's move.

445
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,873
Patterson.

446
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,574
Send a team to that
address in Brooklyn.

447
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:29,510
Find out if Rebecca's there.

448
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,851
(beeping)

449
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:44,258
(buzzer)

450
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,226
(Patterson)
So it turns out Rebecca

451
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,795
has been running
a secret lab in Brooklyn.

452
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:49,129
No sign of the missing vials,

453
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:50,917
but she had her own
mini CDC in there.

454
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:51,989
Mass spec machines,

455
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,917
x-ray crystallography lab,
you name it.

456
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:55,402
Any idea what she's up to?

457
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,704
Nothing good, but
according to CDC records,

458
00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:59,373
one of the missing vials

459
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,942
contains a rare strain
of viral hemorrhagic fever.

460
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:05,387
Essentially the deadlier cousin
of Ebola with no known cure.

461
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:09,016
What would happen if that was
released into the population?

462
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:11,452
An outbreak like
we've never seen.

463
00:20:11,454 --> 00:20:14,054
Possibly millions of casualties.

464
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:15,589
Any leads on Rebecca?

465
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,057
She's gone dark.

466
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:18,392
Her phone's not operational

467
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:19,927
and she hasn't logged on
to her computer

468
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:21,061
since the lockdown.

469
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:22,529
That's not very promising.

470
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,098
So we're gonna find her
and find out

471
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,966
what she's planning
to do with those vials.

472
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:28,314
This map shows the origins
of disease outbreaks

473
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:29,770
from the past five years.

474
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:32,406
Several of them correspond
with the disease specimens

475
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:33,507
in the missing vials.

476
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,442
Ebola. SARS.

477
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,578
MERS. Typhoid fever.

478
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,539
They were contained eventually,

479
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:40,414
but not before tens
of thousands of people died.

480
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,702
We've been tracking
Rebecca's movements

481
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:42,983
for the past few years.

482
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:45,185
Get this:
the last nine major epidemics

483
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:46,954
occurred in cities
that she's traveled to

484
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:49,189
or near just before
the outbreaks.

485
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:50,657
So you're saying
that she started them?

486
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:51,992
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's actually

487
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:53,427
a pretty big coincidence
if she didn't.

488
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,096
Rebecca is singlehandedly
responsible

489
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:57,498
for all of those deaths?

490
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,710
(Weller)
Why would she do this?

491
00:20:58,745 --> 00:20:59,833
I don't know.

492
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,535
But there are ten disease
strains missing

493
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,537
and it looks like
she used nine of them.

494
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,439
She has one left.

495
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:06,673
The deadliest one.

496
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:08,208
Why hasn't she used it yet?

497
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,543
(panting)

498
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:11,979
Uh, I think I might know.

499
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,481
We just seized these
aerosol cans from her lab.

500
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,050
She was in the process
of weaponizing the virus.

501
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:19,319
So we just accelerated
her timeline.

502
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,722
She must have realized
it was now or never.

503
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:23,490
(Weller)
Grabbed one of the prototypes.

504
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,125
Hey, looks like
Rebecca's husband just used

505
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:27,361
his credit card at
a gas station in Cold Spring.

506
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:29,129
You think they're together?

507
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:31,665
He's the last person she called
before she destroyed her phone.

508
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:32,874
(Weller)
I'm calling state police.

509
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:34,201
(dialing)

510
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,207
I don't understand.

511
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:42,342
How did your mom get
into a car accident?

512
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,877
I mean, whose car
was she driving?

513
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:46,380
I don't know.

514
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:48,015
We'll be there soon.

515
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,319
(siren)

516
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:54,221
I wasn't even speeding.

517
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,827
(second siren)

518
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:02,696
Another one?
This is ridiculous.

519
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,730
What'd I do?

520
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:05,220
Just pull over.

521
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,255
(police)
<i>Driver, pull over.</i>

522
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:12,406
(police) <i>Turn off the ignition,
exit the vehicle...</i>

523
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:14,174
What the hell is going on?

524
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:15,909
Look, I love you.

525
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:17,945
Please understand.

526
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:20,185
I am trying to save the world.

527
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,967
What are you talking about?

528
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:23,150
I'm so sorry.

529
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:25,276
But this will be faster.

530
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,380
Rebecca, what are you...

531
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:26,959
- (gunshot)
- Uhh! (groaning)

532
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:28,369
(police officer)
<i>Shots fired!</i>

533
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:32,747
(gunshot)

534
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,263
Thank you.

535
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:47,081
(sighs)

536
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,304
Her mother lives upstate.

537
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:50,373
I think that's where
she might have been heading.

538
00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:52,081
She must have known once
we saw the vials were missing

539
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:53,699
we'd be onto her.

540
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:56,068
We just got
the crime scene photos.

541
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,703
The state police
checked the car.

542
00:22:57,705 --> 00:22:59,371
No sign of the missing vial,

543
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:01,306
but they did find
a parking receipt

544
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:02,774
from the Manhattan
Cruise Terminal

545
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:04,209
from about three hours ago.

546
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:06,211
Why would she stop
at the pier first?

547
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:09,314
If she was planning to infect
as many people as possible,

548
00:23:09,316 --> 00:23:10,882
the terminal would be ideal.

549
00:23:10,884 --> 00:23:12,317
Thousands of people
getting off cruise ships

550
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,752
and getting on the planes
to head home.

551
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:15,206
Perfect way to spread
the virus around the world.

552
00:23:15,241 --> 00:23:16,388
If that was her plan,

553
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,251
she wouldn't have
to hide the device.

554
00:23:17,286 --> 00:23:19,558
She could put it
somewhere out in the open.

555
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,094
What is this?
Can you zoom in on her watch?

556
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,565
Set on a timer.

557
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,100
About two hours to go.

558
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,234
When was that photo taken?

559
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:31,003
2:01 p.m.

560
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:34,039
So we got until 4:00 p.m.
to find that delivery device.

561
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:35,841
She wasn't just running from us.

562
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:37,012
(Weller) She was trying to get
out of the hot zone.

563
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:41,533
I'll dial in TSA and NYPD
to order an immediate evacuation

564
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,235
and I'll get our biohazard team
to start suiting up.

565
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,184
No, no, no, no, no.

566
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,435
You're not gonna
make it in time.

567
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,562
We gotta stop this now.

568
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:49,855
If that device goes off,
a lot of people are gonna die.

569
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:53,225
Thank you.

570
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:57,095
(siren wailing)

571
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,409
You blame yourself, don't you?

572
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:11,977
For what?

573
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:13,378
The night I went missing.

574
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,615
You think it was your fault.

575
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:19,918
You know, ever since you
told me I'm Taylor, I've...

576
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,488
been focusing on what
that means for me, but...

577
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,158
you've been living
with this for 25 years.

578
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:31,581
Have you talked
to your dad about me?

579
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:39,271
My dad and I...

580
00:24:39,273 --> 00:24:40,772
It's not that simple.

581
00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:45,644
I can't talk about it
right now, Jane.

582
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:47,412
I don't wanna...
talk about it.

583
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:52,557
All right.

584
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,087
Here we go.

585
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:57,422
Looks like the evac's
already underway.

586
00:24:59,158 --> 00:25:01,193
(crowd chattering)

587
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:08,266
Excuse me.
Move!

588
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:09,835
What are we looking for?

589
00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:11,303
Anything that looks
out of place.

590
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:14,139
In a crowded terminal
during an evacuation?

591
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:15,540
Should be easy.

592
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:17,020
(man) Come on, folks,
keep it moving.

593
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:19,544
(Weller) Excuse me, coming through.
Excuse me.

594
00:25:19,546 --> 00:25:21,446
All right.
Reade, Zapata,

595
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:23,548
go check the security footage
from a few hours ago.

596
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,784
Jane and I will
search the floor.

597
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:34,559
Excuse me, coming through,
excuse me.

598
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:35,794
Jane.

599
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:44,136
♪

600
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:15,066
The terminals are
being swept by NYPD.

601
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:18,603
TSA is securing the ships
and the baggage areas.

602
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:20,939
So far, I haven't
seen anything unusual.

603
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:22,874
It's a needle in a haystack.

604
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:25,043
Rebecca didn't
have a lot of time.

605
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:31,183
(Jane)
What?

606
00:26:31,185 --> 00:26:32,185
What is it?

607
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,353
See that?

608
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,922
All these bags are linked

609
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:40,358
with that security chain,
except for that one.

610
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,727
That's not right.

611
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:45,063
Zapata... you in
the control room?

612
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:46,520
I'm in front of
the check-in desk.

613
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:48,880
Review the footage from my
position a couple hours back.

614
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:50,769
- I think we've got something.
- Pull up the check-in desk.

615
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:52,637
Can you take it
back a few hours?

616
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:02,580
There she is.
Rewind it.

617
00:27:05,918 --> 00:27:06,952
We got her.

618
00:27:06,954 --> 00:27:08,787
- Now what?
- We contain it.

619
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:10,555
How?

620
00:27:10,557 --> 00:27:11,911
Where's the HAZMAT team?

621
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:13,558
They should be here by now.

622
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,368
The evacuation caused
a massive traffic jam.

623
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:16,728
They're having trouble
getting through.

624
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,263
We're running out of time.

625
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:20,165
How are we gonna
do this on our own?

626
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:23,168
(Weller)
Patterson?

627
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,569
Okay, okay.

628
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:27,005
Uh, uh...
We can do this.

629
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:28,306
I can walk you through it.

630
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:29,716
Uh, first, we're
gonna need to prevent

631
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,409
as much collateral damage
as possible.

632
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:33,796
Every door and window needs
to be shut in the terminal,

633
00:27:33,831 --> 00:27:34,742
and the main HVAC system

634
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:37,015
- needs to be turned off.
- On it.

635
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:38,516
Next, we're gonna
need to "MacGyver"

636
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:39,940
some sort of containment tent
around the bag

637
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,452
before it goes off.

638
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:44,789
We're on it.

639
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,591
(grunting)
Move it this way.

640
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:51,463
Reade!
Give me a hand.

641
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:54,933
(Weller)
Get the broom.

642
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:58,336
(mutters)
Okay...

643
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,142
(tape ripping)

644
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:08,181
(Reade)
One more, one more.

645
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:10,348
(Patterson) <i>The key is to
make it airtight.</i>

646
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,151
You just need it to hold
until HAZMAT gets there.

647
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:14,819
(Weller)
Reade.

648
00:28:18,157 --> 00:28:21,326
Okay.
That's it.

649
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:22,727
(Weller)
<i>Bag's contained.</i>

650
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:23,895
(sighs)

651
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,567
It's 4:00.
Nothing happened.

652
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,469
Maybe we got the wrong bag.

653
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:33,138
(pop, gas hissing)

654
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:49,969
(cell phone vibrating)

655
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,974
What's wrong?

656
00:28:54,976 --> 00:28:56,239
(man)
<i>Uh, nothing.</i>

657
00:28:56,274 --> 00:28:57,943
I don't think.
Why, what have you heard?

658
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,433
You never call me at work.

659
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:00,980
<i>I know, I just...</i>

660
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:02,481
<i>I had to see if we were right.</i>

661
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:04,416
About the tattoo.
It's been killing me.

662
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:05,851
- No.
- <i>What?</i>

663
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:06,966
Damn it!

664
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,854
I thought for sure
we cracked that thing.

665
00:29:08,856 --> 00:29:10,913
No, no, no, no, no,
we were right, but...

666
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:12,958
Yes, I knew it.
Was it a big deal?

667
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,260
It's a big deal, isn't it?

668
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:15,454
You can't tell me.

669
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,363
That's okay.
It had that feel to it, though.

670
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:19,632
Yes, it's...
it's a very big deal,

671
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,155
but that's not the point.

672
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,233
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

673
00:29:22,268 --> 00:29:23,702
Hey, what'd the bird mean?

674
00:29:23,704 --> 00:29:24,904
Was it a cipher or something?

675
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:26,105
It was a cipher, wasn't it?

676
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:28,440
No, it was a logo.
No, David!

677
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:31,043
<i>We have to stop.
You can't help me with this stuff.</i>

678
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:32,426
These tattoos are classified.

679
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:34,313
I mean, you shouldn't
even be looking at them.

680
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,448
Hey, did we solve it
or didn't we?

681
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,229
Yeah, we did, but...

682
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:39,718
And did it help or didn't it?

683
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,922
It did, but...

684
00:29:40,957 --> 00:29:42,331
Then what's the problem?

685
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:43,967
Look, if I can help you crack
some of these faster,

686
00:29:44,002 --> 00:29:45,491
isn't that a good thing?

687
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,126
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

688
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:48,527
Uh, I gotta go.

689
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:49,625
Okay.

690
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,297
Hey, I have a...
like, a weird craving

691
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,878
for that corn dog place
across from Barcade.

692
00:29:52,913 --> 00:29:53,984
Do you want to meet me
there tonight?

693
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:56,060
Uh, yeah, fine, whatever.

694
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,070
Just... just stop
calling me at work.

695
00:30:00,874 --> 00:30:02,508
(Surrey) Hey, guys.
Come on in.

696
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,043
We need to do a basic evaluation

697
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,560
and get some blood from
you guys before we let you go.

698
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:08,647
Wonderful.

699
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:09,999
Where's, uh,
Special Agent Weller?

700
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:10,907
(Zapata)
He didn't want to leave

701
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,976
the makeshift containment
tent unattended,

702
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,186
just in case.

703
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:15,670
We should have stayed with him.

704
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:17,690
It's over.
He's fine.

705
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,925
Do you have a radio
for Agent Weller?

706
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:24,469
Agent Weller, this is
Frank Surrey from the CDC.

707
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:25,908
I'm here to relieve you.
I need you to report

708
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:27,182
<i>to the quarantine tent.</i>

709
00:30:27,217 --> 00:30:29,435
I'll stay,
help you seal the area.

710
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:31,078
Agent Weller, my team
should be here any minute.

711
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:33,906
Every second you're there, you
increase your risk of exposure.

712
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:36,876
That's why you're gonna
bring me a HAZMAT suit, Doctor.

713
00:30:38,912 --> 00:30:40,079
I'm on my way.

714
00:30:45,518 --> 00:30:47,887
(Weller)
Did you know her well?

715
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:50,723
(Surrey)
I thought I did.

716
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,225
Went to school together.

717
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,386
Co-authored
several papers.

718
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,929
I was the one who brought her
into the fold at the CDC.

719
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:58,764
(computer beeps)

720
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:01,233
Well, this is very not good.

721
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,935
It's hard not to feel
responsible for this

722
00:31:02,937 --> 00:31:04,136
in some way.

723
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:06,899
You can't think like that, Doc.

724
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,474
Hey, Weller,
are you still on VOX?

725
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:10,242
(grunting)
Uh... yeah.

726
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:11,647
What's up?

727
00:31:11,682 --> 00:31:15,748
Don't let Dr. Surrey
near the device.

728
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,149
Why is that?

729
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:18,447
<i>I-I-I've been
cross-referencing</i>

730
00:31:18,482 --> 00:31:19,918
every CDC employee's travel

731
00:31:19,953 --> 00:31:21,754
to see if there was any overlap

732
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,217
with the outbreaks,
and I just got an alert that

733
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:26,745
Frank purchased
a plane ticket an hour ago

734
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,928
<i>with short layovers
all around the world.</i>

735
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,496
EDT?

736
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:31,962
The ticket was bought today.

737
00:31:31,997 --> 00:31:33,165
<i>I think he might be planning</i>

738
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,236
to infect himself

739
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:36,602
and fly around the world
and spread the disease.

740
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:39,890
He's probably already ripped
his safety suit... and yours.

741
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,025
Doc, stop.

742
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,241
Step away, Doc.

743
00:31:47,276 --> 00:31:49,148
- But I...
- Don't!

744
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,116
It's over.

745
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:59,224
Rebecca and I spent our
entire lives studying viruses.

746
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:01,760
Do you know what the greatest
threat to mankind is?

747
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:03,896
Modern medicine.

748
00:32:03,898 --> 00:32:06,832
Stop!
Don't move!

749
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:09,134
We create all these vaccines,

750
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,603
antibiotics...
cures for diseases

751
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:14,239
that should never be cured.

752
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:18,243
This planet was not designed
to support 8 billion people.

753
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:20,079
You're a doctor.

754
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:21,647
You work for the CDC.

755
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,415
Your job is to save lives.

756
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,784
No, my job is to save
the human race.

757
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:29,321
If we do nothing,
our destruction is guaranteed.

758
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:30,656
That is insane.

759
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,257
No...

760
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:35,494
It's already
spiraling out of control.

761
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:38,931
In your lifetime, we're
gonna see famine, drought,

762
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,467
poverty,
on an unimaginable scale.

763
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:42,968
Somebody's got to have
the courage

764
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,138
to do what has to be done
to save the human species.

765
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,440
Walter found out, didn't he?

766
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:50,009
And that's why you killed him.

767
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,844
All these diseases
that we're trying

768
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,679
so desperately
to find a cure for

769
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,180
are actually
the last-ditch effort

770
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,553
of a dying planet
trying to save itself,

771
00:32:57,588 --> 00:32:59,218
trying to wipe out
the thing that is actually

772
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,053
destroying it: us.

773
00:33:01,055 --> 00:33:02,354
Don't!

774
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:09,895
(both grunting)

775
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:17,136
- Uhh!
- Ohh!

776
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:24,810
(grunting)

777
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,089
(panting)

778
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,461
The CDC is so solid.

779
00:33:48,496 --> 00:33:50,454
How did Frank and Rebecca
have these radical views

780
00:33:50,456 --> 00:33:51,989
and go undetected?

781
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:53,624
They're gifted scientists.

782
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,860
Top of their field.

783
00:33:55,862 --> 00:33:58,362
The CDC had no reason to suspect
that they'd gone rogue.

784
00:33:58,364 --> 00:33:59,804
They almost got away
with it, though.

785
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:08,172
They're gonna be fine.

786
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:11,976
We all are.

787
00:34:11,978 --> 00:34:14,178
Hope so.

788
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,532
First the DOD, then the CDC.

789
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:19,283
Whoever made these tattoos had
some pretty serious access.

790
00:34:19,285 --> 00:34:21,953
- Definitely.
- Why would they do this to her?

791
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:24,155
Why kidnap a woman,
wipe her memory,

792
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:27,358
then tattoo her entire body
with puzzles for us to solve?

793
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,361
Makes her pretty hard to ignore.

794
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:36,634
Okay.
Hold that.

795
00:34:36,636 --> 00:34:38,369
And I will be back in a minute.

796
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:40,404
You just wait here for me, okay?

797
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:47,912
(clears throat)

798
00:34:49,247 --> 00:34:50,982
Hey, good work today.

799
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:53,651
Thank you.

800
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,417
Look, I know you think
I'm the bad guy

801
00:35:01,452 --> 00:35:03,494
because I didn't
welcome you with open arms.

802
00:35:03,496 --> 00:35:04,862
You think I'm a liability.

803
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:07,797
I don't know what more
I can do to...

804
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:10,201
I'm not worried about you.

805
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:14,372
All of us depend on Weller.

806
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:16,407
He's got better judgment
than anyone I've worked with

807
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:17,942
my whole career.

808
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:19,610
He's made
split-second decisions

809
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:22,646
that have saved our lives
more times than I can count.

810
00:35:22,648 --> 00:35:24,849
- I don't understand...
- When he's around you,

811
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:28,686
the guy I lean on,
the guy I know... isn't there.

812
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:33,557
And that scares
the hell out of me.

813
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,459
There's nothing
I can do about that.

814
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:38,029
I know.

815
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:41,359
That's the problem.

816
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:52,643
What are you doing in here?

817
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:55,646
I was thinking about our
conversation the other night,

818
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:57,948
regarding your mystery girl.

819
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:01,485
This laissez-faire
approach of yours

820
00:36:01,487 --> 00:36:03,120
isn't really doing it for me.

821
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:04,255
Tom...

822
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:05,556
I want to talk to her.

823
00:36:05,558 --> 00:36:06,724
That's not possible.

824
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:08,926
<i>Anything's</i> possible.

825
00:36:08,928 --> 00:36:11,128
I mean, you of all people
should know that.

826
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,297
Come on, I get
in a room with Jane,

827
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:15,499
we have a nice little chat,
it'll be great.

828
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,101
I promise not to bite.

829
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:19,603
I told you I was
managing the situation,

830
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:21,572
so give me the time to do that.

831
00:36:21,574 --> 00:36:24,742
Time is the last thing
that we have.

832
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:28,015
See, if your girl knows about
Daylight, then who else does?

833
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,881
And what do they know about us?

834
00:36:30,883 --> 00:36:32,616
What, you think
it's a coincidence

835
00:36:32,618 --> 00:36:35,237
that she was gift-wrapped
and delivered to your team?

836
00:36:35,272 --> 00:36:36,687
See, I don't like the proximity,

837
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:39,156
and I don't like
the question marks.

838
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:41,592
Her mind was wiped.

839
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:44,695
She's just a vessel for
this information, that's all.

840
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:46,664
What are you basing that on?

841
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,300
What, a lie detector test
and some psych evals?

842
00:36:49,302 --> 00:36:50,768
Just let me talk to her.

843
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,269
I'm not handing her over to you

844
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,004
so you can throw her
in some cell and do

845
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:57,608
whatever it is the CIA does
to find things out.

846
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,143
This doesn't have to be
a straight favor.

847
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:00,711
What do you need from me?

848
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:02,780
Let's make a deal here.

849
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:05,183
I need for you
to get out of my office.

850
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:13,691
So be it.

851
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:16,694
Just remember this later...

852
00:37:16,696 --> 00:37:18,796
when everything's falling apart

853
00:37:18,798 --> 00:37:20,331
and you're asking yourself why,

854
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,733
that I came to you first
and tried to play nice.

855
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:25,703
'Cause the rest is on you.

856
00:37:37,182 --> 00:37:38,784
_

857
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:57,598
You were very brave today.

858
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:04,363
Stupid... but brave.

859
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,462
I think there was a compliment

860
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:07,326
in there somewhere.

861
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,213
(mutters)
Yeah.

862
00:38:11,616 --> 00:38:14,218
I'm, um, I'm...

863
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,620
I'm sorry if,
earlier, in the car...

864
00:38:29,536 --> 00:38:31,971
I recognize where
that photo was taken.

865
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:41,745
We had a creek
at the back of our house.

866
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:43,914
Just out there.

867
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,181
Used to go fishing there
with my dad.

868
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:54,095
We didn't... we didn't
catch much, but, uh...

869
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,277
I loved being out there.

870
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:58,992
My sister,
she was always inside,

871
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:01,865
playing with her dolls,
but, uh...

872
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:05,135
but you were a tomboy.

873
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:08,119
Anytime I was outside,

874
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:10,708
you'd run out of your house
and try to tag along.

875
00:39:13,278 --> 00:39:16,447
(chuckling)
We...

876
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:19,516
We had this little...
wooden fort.

877
00:39:19,518 --> 00:39:21,218
(chuckling)

878
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,155
I haven't thought about
that for a long time.

879
00:39:27,818 --> 00:39:29,267
Sorry.

880
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:32,125
Weller, can I steal you
for a second?

881
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,310
Okay.

882
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:39,970
(chuckling)

883
00:39:39,972 --> 00:39:42,172
(sighs)
Well...

884
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:43,474
Yeah.

885
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:51,265
It's really nice...
to have you back.

886
00:39:57,188 --> 00:40:00,524
(cell phone ringing)

887
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,130
_

888
00:40:06,064 --> 00:40:08,065
That's cold, Tash.

889
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:11,268
Screening my calls all day.

890
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,371
I was gonna hit you up
after I got out of the subway.

891
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,363
What are you doing following me?

892
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:17,601
If you picked up
your phone, you know,

893
00:40:17,636 --> 00:40:19,176
I wouldn't have
to chase you down.

894
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:21,111
I'll pay you as soon as I can.

895
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:23,776
Jets lost today.

896
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:26,684
That makes it 40 Gs now.

897
00:40:26,686 --> 00:40:28,252
Let's go again.

898
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:31,422
Double or nothing.

899
00:40:31,424 --> 00:40:32,756
No.

900
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:36,360
That's how you got in this hole.

901
00:40:36,362 --> 00:40:37,795
I want my money.

902
00:40:37,797 --> 00:40:41,554
I'll get it to you.

903
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:44,401
You know I'm good for it.

904
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:45,969
Three days.

905
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,778
All right, what am I looking at?

906
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,138
Molecules of coltan,

907
00:40:56,173 --> 00:40:57,981
which is short
for columbite tantalite.

908
00:40:57,983 --> 00:41:00,487
My favorite of all
the tantalites.

909
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:04,816
They're trace isotopic elements
I found in Jane's tooth.

910
00:41:04,851 --> 00:41:06,623
You pulled one of Jane's teeth?

911
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,125
Well, I-I-I took the one

912
00:41:08,127 --> 00:41:10,603
that was knocked out in
the fight at the safe house.

913
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:11,371
Right.

914
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:12,601
I mean, it was
too good to resist.

915
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,889
The human tooth is...

916
00:41:13,924 --> 00:41:16,447
is a goldmine
of genetic information.

917
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:19,470
Besides, it's not like
she can put it back in.

918
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:21,103
Yeah, what does this mean?

919
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:24,756
These elements would
only be in Jane's enamel

920
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:27,132
if she was from
Sub-Saharan Africa.

921
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,748
Maybe she was taken there
after she got kidnapped.

922
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:31,248
Here's the thing.

923
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:35,085
Isotopes can be aged.

924
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:36,820
Kind of like carbon dating.

925
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:40,657
The markers in her teeth are
from when she was an infant.

926
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:42,459
So what are you saying?

927
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:45,162
She was born in Africa.

928
00:41:45,164 --> 00:41:47,765
No. She was born
in Pennsylvania.

929
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,666
I was there the day
they brought her home.

930
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:51,468
- I'm sorry.
- N-No.

931
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,049
But that's not
what the tooth says.

932
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:57,107
Your DNA tests confirmed
that she's Taylor Shaw.

933
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:58,776
So what are you saying?
That's not true?

934
00:41:58,778 --> 00:42:01,019
All I know is the DNA results

935
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:03,547
directly contradict
the isotope test.

936
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:05,282
Is she Taylor Shaw or not?

937
00:42:05,284 --> 00:42:09,353
Both tests are conclusive,
but both can't be true.

938
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,195
I don't know who she is.

939
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:18,125
