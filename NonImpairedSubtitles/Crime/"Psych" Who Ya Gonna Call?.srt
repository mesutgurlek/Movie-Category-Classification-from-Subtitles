1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,750
You're dead,Spencer.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,320
What you doing, Shawn?

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,020
Nothing.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,600
Looks like something to me.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,920
Okay. I was running away

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,250
from Ryan Brickhouse.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,250
That him?

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,740
Is he the same kid

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,260
who's been hassling you all week?

10
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:23,101
Yeah.

11
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,291
And why is he chasing you today?

12
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:31,386
I might have thrown a rock at him.

13
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:34,335
Did you hit him?

14
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:35,502
Almost.

15
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,332
Get back out there.

16
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:40,981
What?

17
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:41,712
Can't run away

18
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:42,973
from the bad guys forever,Shawn

19
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:43,831
Eventually, you've got to

20
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,243
come up with a new approach.

21
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:46,361
So...

22
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,751
so... find one.

23
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:59,472
You're flunking math?

24
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:00,573
Proudly.

25
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:02,992
Here's the deal...

26
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:04,361
leave me alone,

27
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:05,581
I'll make sure

28
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,581
you ace the test tomorrow.

29
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:07,582
How?

30
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:09,102
Every third answer is "c".

31
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:11,120
There's a pattern to all her tests.

32
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:13,652
Mrs. Bodansky does it every time.

33
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:14,793
I memorized it.

34
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:15,861
I'll show you.

35
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:17,391
You better not be lying.

36
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,312
Not bad. You faced your fears.

37
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:24,433
You got a new result.

38
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,302
You came out ahead.

39
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,190
Did you really
memorize those test answers?

40
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:30,212
Yeah.

41
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:37,383
Who are you calling?

42
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,400
Your math teacher.

43
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:52,412
No. No. No. No. Yes.

44
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:53,982
Yes...

45
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:55,913
nickel...

46
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:56,833
that's a nickel.

47
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:59,340
Yes. Yes. Yes.

48
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:00,143
Who was that?

49
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:00,830
Who was who?

50
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,241
The girl sitting at our front desk.

51
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:04,482
You're talking
about the lovely Dagmar.

52
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,250
Dagmar?

53
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:06,520
She's our new receptionist.

54
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:07,472
How did she get the job?

55
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,782
The agency sent her over.

56
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,341
You contacted a temp agency

57
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:11,382
without consulting me?

58
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:12,973
Gus, anyone can get a secretary

59
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,081
from a temp agency.
It takes real foresight

60
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:17,443
and creativity to get
one from a modeling agency.

61
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:19,080
A modeling agency?

62
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:25,902
Now, why would a
beautiful lady like that

63
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,930
want to be our secretary?

64
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:30,931
Oh, that's a bit
of a story, you see.

65
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,533
Apparently,

66
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,541
she got it in her head
that this was a runway gig.

67
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:35,691
I blame the agent.

68
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:36,930
I was very clear on the phone.

69
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,873
But she's cool with sticking around

70
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:40,693
for the rest of the
day,seeing how it goes.

71
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:41,980
You know how slow it gets

72
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:43,422
when it's not modeling season.

73
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:44,822
Does she answer the phone?

74
00:02:44,936 --> 00:02:46,363
Yes, but only her cell phone.

75
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:48,203
She's expecting a call from milan.

76
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:48,940
Does she file?

77
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:50,313
Mostly her nails.

78
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,003
Coffee?

79
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:52,110
Yeah, she wants some.

80
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:53,751
Can I make you anything?

81
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:54,753
No.

82
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:56,731
Dude, I thought you weren't

83
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:57,780
coming in till, like, noon?

84
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,051
Big drama at the office today.

85
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,661
A doctor we supply
product to got killed.

86
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:02,502
Whoa!

87
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:03,303
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

88
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:04,233
You didn't call me immediately?

89
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,070
You don't know him.

90
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,831
Gus,This is what we do, remember?

91
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:07,862
We can solve the case.

92
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:08,723
The police are already there.

93
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:09,751
This means nothing to me.

94
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:10,781
They're going to need help.

95
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:13,033
Guidance. Psychic vibrations.

96
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:14,673
Dagmar!

97
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,653
She doesn't speak english?

98
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:25,141
Does she need to?

99
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,973
Where  in the name
of all that is holy

100
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,310
is my forensics team?

101
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:34,390
All right,

102
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:35,631
what can you tell
me about this doctor

103
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,003
that I can pretend to ascertain

104
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:38,141
from the spirit world?

105
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:39,602
Dr. Blinn wasn't on my route.

106
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:41,063
I did cover him a few times.

107
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,111
All I remember is he
always made you wait,

108
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:44,940
and he had an picture
of Pete Rose on his wall.

109
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,873
Look how cute she
is in the fuchsia.

110
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,262
I have been sent by
the spirit of Pete Rose.

111
00:03:51,345 --> 00:03:52,593
Pete  Rose isn't dead.

112
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,123
There was a photo of
Pete Rose on the wall.

113
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:55,261
Okay, why have I been drawn here?

114
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:56,091
Was there a murder?

115
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:58,342
Do I need the little
booties for the crime scene?

116
00:03:58,417 --> 00:03:59,702
Thanks, but we're doing just fine.

117
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:06,122
Don't go in the back room.

118
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:09,941
My grandpa loved Pete Rose.

119
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:11,303
I want you guys ringing doorbells.

120
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:12,330
If anybody saw anything,

121
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,382
I want to know
about it. Patient files?

122
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:15,693
Cabinet's locked. We
haven't found the key.

123
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:16,980
Get ahold of the D. A. 'S office.

124
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,661
Tell them I need
access to those files.

125
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:20,310
If they say we
need a warrant, get it.

126
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:22,410
Also, get me a copy
of his desk calendar.

127
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:26,173
I thought I told you no.

128
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:27,562
But your eyes said yes.

129
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,470
Hey, who's that Cincinnati red

130
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:31,060
with the bowl cut?

131
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,290
Let me be perfectly clear.

132
00:04:39,378 --> 00:04:40,473
This is my crime scene.

133
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:41,740
I don't need your help.

134
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:42,771
I don't want your help.

135
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:43,500
If you don't leave right now,

136
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:44,781
I will have you
arrested for interfering

137
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:47,813
with a police
investigation. Am I clear?

138
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,203
Like butter.

139
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,700
I've given this a
great deal of thought.

140
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:01,470
I think we should take
the rest of the day off.

141
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:02,442
What say you?

142
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,042
All we've done is eat a box

143
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:05,861
of animal cookies
and crash a crime scene.

144
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:06,931
The  case with the doctor...

145
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,216
they're coming back to us
eventually. You know this.

146
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,475
So let's go to the beach.

147
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:13,130
It's too nice a day
for murder and mayhem.

148
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,590
I have to see them
right now... nein! Nein!

149
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,863
It's important.

150
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,741
I'm sorry. I don't
mean to barge in, but...

151
00:05:19,358 --> 00:05:20,712
I need help.

152
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,602
Mr. Dunn... Robert...

153
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:25,741
how can we help?

154
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,130
And can I call you "Bob"?

155
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:28,961
This is difficult.

156
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,780
Take your time. We're here.

157
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,273
I'm just going to
come out and say it.

158
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,202
I'm being haunted.

159
00:05:38,326 --> 00:05:39,380
Haunted?

160
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:40,383
Yes.

161
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:42,381
There's a haunting...

162
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,401
Gus, can I talk to you outside?

163
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,881
Not now. We're in
the middle of something.

164
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:47,612
Gus.

165
00:05:47,745 --> 00:05:48,790
Stop talking. Sit down.

166
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:50,772
Now, what exactly do you mean

167
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:53,432
when you say "haunted"?

168
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:54,952
Well...

169
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:56,832
my home...

170
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:58,441
sometimes I smell perfume

171
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,230
when no one else is around.

172
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,630
Things get broken or moved.

173
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,821
I think you have a test message.

174
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:05,623
I'll get it later.

175
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:06,912
I think you should get it now.

176
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:16,393
Sorry.

177
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:17,870
Work business.

178
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:19,011
Okay...

179
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:21,941
can I ask you a question?

180
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:22,880
Yeah.

181
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:24,283
Do these spirits ever

182
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:26,531
speak to you?

183
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:28,201
No. No. Whatever...

184
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:29,921
whoever it is,

185
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,333
it hasn't spoken to me.

186
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:32,250
Oh.

187
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:34,112
Have you contacted the police?

188
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:35,710
Yeah,but they said

189
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:36,971
there was nothing they could do.

190
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:39,633
So here I am.

191
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:40,740
Robert,

192
00:06:41,016 --> 00:06:42,681
we deal with this
kind of phenomenon

193
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:43,763
all the time,

194
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:45,711
and what you need to realize

195
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:46,861
is that evicting a spirit

196
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:48,221
is a very time-consuming

197
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:51,241
and absurdly expensive process.

198
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,540
I don't care, okay?

199
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:54,991
I just can't go on living this way.

200
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:56,361
Excuse me.

201
00:06:58,037 --> 00:06:59,261
Oh, really?

202
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,150
Yes!

203
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:01,223
Yes, Shawn.

204
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,360
All I'm saying is that

205
00:07:02,445 --> 00:07:04,212
it might be
easier to try moving into

206
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,810
a different
house. One that's less...

207
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,450
haunted.

208
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:09,330
I tried that.

209
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:10,560
Whatever this
thing is,it followed me

210
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:12,053
all the way from san francisco.

211
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,000
Maybe it likes you.

212
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:15,622
No. I don't think so.

213
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:17,201
What makes you say that?

214
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:21,082
I think it tried to kill me.

215
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:48,903
Gus, what is all this?

216
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:50,543
Gear we might need.

217
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,390
If we're going to
be hunting for spirits,

218
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,490
we might as well do it right.

219
00:07:53,577 --> 00:07:55,173
Methodically,systematically,

220
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:57,790
scientifically. Who knows,

221
00:07:57,918 --> 00:07:59,351
we might be surprised what we find.

222
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,030
Video camera, nice.

223
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:03,250
Audio recorder. Motion detectors.

224
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:04,772
Gus, I am very impressed.

225
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:06,691
You only forgot one thing.

226
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:07,980
Really? What?

227
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:10,242
There's no such thing as ghosts.

228
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:11,071
Yes, there is.

229
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:12,630
Oh, Gus, no.

230
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:13,803
Okay.

231
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:15,161
Stop.

232
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,022
Please. Let's just...

233
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:18,052
let's just stop.

234
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,912
Come here, sit down. Please. Sit.

235
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:25,531
All right.

236
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:27,243
This is me talking. This is Shawn.

237
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,363
What's going on?

238
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:29,161
I usually have to drag you

239
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,910
to these cases
kicking and screaming,

240
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:32,402
and those are real police cases.

241
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:33,432
Now, all of a sudden,

242
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,491
we have some client

243
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:35,833
who is either bonkers,

244
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:36,972
or, judging by the size of the bags

245
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:38,440
under his
eyes,suffering from nothing

246
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:39,393
more than waking dreams

247
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,871
or hallucinations,and you,

248
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:42,932
you're ready to go ghost-hunting.

249
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:45,633
Talk to me.

250
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:47,243
All right.

251
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:50,160
All right.

252
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:52,541
I've never told
this to anyone before,

253
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:53,290
but...

254
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,962
I was 12.

255
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:58,583
Gus, it's me.

256
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,390
It  was late.

257
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:05,710
I was in my room
with the lights off.

258
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,182
I heard a voice.

259
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:08,660
Gus, I'm sure

260
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,410
there's a perfectly
logical explanation...

261
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:11,782
no, no, no, Shawn.

262
00:09:11,907 --> 00:09:14,073
It wasn't on TV
and it wasn't a radio.

263
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:15,733
It was coming from the walls,

264
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,261
and the voice...

265
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,300
the voice told me

266
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:20,901
that our house was built

267
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:22,543
on an old indian burial ground.

268
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:24,882
Shut up.

269
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:25,692
She said...

270
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:27,400
she said she was sad

271
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,001
because she had died many moons ago

272
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,880
and was trapped between worlds.

273
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,420
When I asked her her name, Shawn...

274
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:36,063
she said...

275
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:38,461
"my name... "

276
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,433
My name is Wilting Flower.

277
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:43,983
I died without knowing love.

278
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:46,571
Will you be my friend?

279
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,982
How... How did you know that?

280
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,152
I never told it to anyone before!

281
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:53,101
I was Wilting Flower.

282
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,353
Gus!

283
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:57,113
I can't believe
that you fell for that!

284
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,803
I put an old walkie-talkie

285
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,021
in  the wall when your dad...

286
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:02,370
When your dad put
in the new insulation.

287
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:05,762
The old indian burial
ground? You bought that?

288
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:07,281
I got that from "Poltergeist"...

289
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:09,152
or "Poltergeist II".

290
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,820
"Gremlins"?

291
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:12,463
No, it wasn't "Gremlins".

292
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,181
That's not funny,Shawn.

293
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:15,431
Okay, you know what?

294
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,053
Let's add a "Trixie" to that...

295
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:19,901
now, she is the
companion to "scrappy," right?

296
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,840
Okay, great, let's add that to

297
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:25,230
"girl with flowers"
and "merry musicians. "

298
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,301
Okay, now, listen,

299
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:28,241
I need the card to read,

300
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,261
"happy birthday.

301
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:34,171
'Ex' is the loneliest
letter in the alphabet. "

302
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:37,633
But I need you to
spell it e-x,as in...

303
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:39,990
oh, you got it?

304
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:41,840
Okay, well, listen,it continues...

305
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:46,600
"from your
not-yet-'ex'"... "e-x"...

306
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:49,220
"husband, Carlton. "

307
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:52,182
Perfect. These'll
go out today, right?

308
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,843
All righty-dighty.
Thank you very much.

309
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,733
I didn't know you
collected figurines.

310
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:58,813
You know, I have
a grandmother who...

311
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:00,331
do you not knock?

312
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:01,681
There's no door.

313
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,253
And?

314
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:04,693
Sorry.

315
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:05,952
The  D. A. 'S office called.

316
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:06,941
They said that we can have access

317
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,163
to dr. Blinn's patients' files.

318
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:09,383
About time.

319
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,252
Let's get in
there,get those addresses,

320
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:13,300
and bring these
nutjobs in for questioning.

321
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:17,701
Here's where I found

322
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:19,421
all my paintings last weekend...

323
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:20,791
Upside down.

324
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:21,822
I've got a cold spot.

325
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:23,083
Right here.

326
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:25,270
Feel it?

327
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:26,110
Yes.

328
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes, I do. Robert, we've definitely

329
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:29,291
got something here.

330
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,500
You're standing under a vent.

331
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:43,352
So all these are yours, huh?

332
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:44,290
Yeah.

333
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,383
I'm trying to get ready for a show.

334
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:47,620
No kidding.

335
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:48,953
Has anything strange

336
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:50,093
ever happened in here?

337
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,310
Sometimes I get the feeling

338
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:53,802
that the furniture has been moved.

339
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,630
Did you actually see it happen?

340
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,340
No, I just come into a room

341
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,403
and everything's
not where I left it.

342
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,573
Robert, do you have a photo album?

343
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:10,963
Yeah.

344
00:12:20,028 --> 00:12:21,583
That's a nice shot, huh?

345
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:23,830
Oh. Oh, oh, oh!

346
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:24,823
I feel it.

347
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:27,562
I feel it! Oh, Gus! Gus!

348
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:28,703
Oh!

349
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:30,453
Oh, she is angry!

350
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:31,600
She is angry!

351
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:34,451
She is soaring with rage and...

352
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,042
She wants to go into the bedroom!

353
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,220
Where's the bedroom?

354
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:39,003
It's here. Here.

355
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,073
Take me!

356
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:55,831
I've lost her.

357
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:00,062
You don't believe me,do you?

358
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,172
No, of course we do.

359
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:02,741
You saw it, too, didn't you?

360
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,022
Guys.

361
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:05,963
Please.

362
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:07,221
Stay the night.

363
00:13:07,457 --> 00:13:09,010
Then you'll see.

364
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:10,842
I mean, you don't
know what it's been like.

365
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,503
I can't work. I can't concentrate.

366
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,463
I wake up in the morning

367
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,073
more tired than when I went to bed.

368
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,093
Days pass and I can't remember

369
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,100
what I've done.

370
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:59,780
This pulls out into a
bed,but that's all I got.

371
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:00,741
Ah, no worries.

372
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:01,691
What's a little spooning

373
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,210
between old pals, huh, Gus?

374
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:04,511
Well, good night.

375
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:05,883
Good night, rob.

376
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,482
You got the floor.

377
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:08,811
We'll make it work.

378
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:10,441
You don't mind if I

379
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,531
nude up for the sleepover, right?

380
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,413
Seriously, Shawn.

381
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,051
Only one of us is
sleeping at a time.

382
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:16,070
The other one is on watch.

383
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,753
Oh, no, we'll both sleep.

384
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:18,783
I'll put on some socks,

385
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:20,041
make you feel more comfortable.

386
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:21,452
Stop playing, Shawn.

387
00:14:21,575 --> 00:14:22,923
We're here to solve a case.

388
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:26,263
I already solved it.

389
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:26,913
When?

390
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,473
When you were
flapping the book like a bird?

391
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:30,590
Gus, if you must know,

392
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,270
it was a bald eagle... and yes.

393
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:37,220
You found the ghost?

394
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:38,600
There's no such thing as ghosts.

395
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:39,843
Yes, there is, Shawn.

396
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:40,760
No, there isn't,but

397
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,800
there is such a thing as
a pissed-off ex-girlfriend.

398
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,050
What ex-girlfriend?

399
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:46,441
No one mentioned
anything about an ex.

400
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,873
You didn't look at the photo album?

401
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:50,830
Redhead.

402
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:52,121
She's cute.

403
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:53,342
What makes you think she's an ex?

404
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:54,143
Oh, come on.

405
00:14:54,265 --> 00:14:55,481
There's dirty dishes everywhere.

406
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:57,041
His bedroom is a mess.

407
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:58,520
His nails are filthy.

408
00:14:58,715 --> 00:14:59,851
His hair is horrible.

409
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,790
No girlfriend's
going to put up with that.

410
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,280
And exhibit "a"...

411
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:05,173
who else would "x" through his face

412
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:06,870
in all of these pictures?

413
00:15:07,076 --> 00:15:09,081
Okay, okay.

414
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:10,823
Say she's the ex.

415
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,080
We still don't know
she's actually been here.

416
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:14,202
There are strands of red hair

417
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:15,560
all over the studio.

418
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,032
Should we tell Robert?

419
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,721
How psychic would that be?

420
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:26,440
No. We'll spend
the night. It's fine.

421
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:27,883
Catch up with the ex tomorrow,

422
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:29,373
talk to her,see what's going on.

423
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:31,920
Meanwhile, I'm
going to do some sit-ups.

424
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:33,711
Come hold my feet.

425
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:36,451
I'm going to do a thousand!

426
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,400
Shawn! Get up!

427
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:55,411
What?

428
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:56,323
Fire!

429
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:57,542
Aah! Aah!

430
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:00,561
Ah! Get... Get Robert!

431
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,911
I could've died.

432
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:08,661
If you guys weren't here, I...

433
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:12,053
why is it doing this to me?

434
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,081
Why is it trying to kill me?

435
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:15,221
Okay. Okay.

436
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:16,970
Robert, hey, hey, hey.

437
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:20,931
Hey. Bobby. Look at me.

438
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,331
Now, who here

439
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,770
has communicated with more

440
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,061
dispossessed souls? You or me?

441
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:27,350
You?

442
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:28,110
That's correct.

443
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,690
Now I am telling you
that this, this fire,

444
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:32,730
was not an attempt on your life.

445
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:33,883
It wasn't?... No.

446
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:37,030
This was a sad and
desperate cry for help

447
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:40,000
from a very
frightened,very lonely apparition.

448
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:41,371
Are you sure about this?

449
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:42,440
Absolutely.

450
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:44,472
Of course,it's also possible

451
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,031
that someone simply
left a candle burning.

452
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:48,983
I don't burn candles.

453
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:50,273
Gus, did you burn a candle?

454
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:51,642
Why would I do that?

455
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:52,772
Cry for help it is.

456
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,171
No one came in
while we were sleeping.

457
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:56,593
I checked the
doors and the windows.

458
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:57,740
They were all locked...

459
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,442
from the inside.

460
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:07,972
Why are you
looking at me like that?

461
00:17:08,248 --> 00:17:09,493
That's all you did?

462
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,623
Check the doors and the windows?

463
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:11,702
Yeah. Why?

464
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:24,712
Where did that come from?

465
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:25,643
Don't look at me.

466
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:26,781
I'm not wearing lipstick.

467
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:31,301
This is the only post office box

468
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,550
listed for Regina Kane.

469
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:33,751
According to dr. Blinn's calendar,

470
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:34,663
she was his last appointment.

471
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:35,732
She might have seen something.

472
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,033
I want to find her.

473
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:38,071
Well, if this is
where she picks up her mail,

474
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,410
she probably lives close by.

475
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:40,781
Canvass the neighborhood.

476
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:41,660
See if anyone knows her.

477
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:43,072
That's a really smart approach.

478
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,853
What? That... that shocks you?

479
00:17:45,936 --> 00:17:47,112
I meant that as a compliment.

480
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,142
Really?

481
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:49,132
Yeah.

482
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:50,751
Well, thanks a lot.

483
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,751
Was that sarcastic?

484
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:54,710
No.

485
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:55,891
Oh.

486
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:57,192
Okay.

487
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,952
You're welcome.

488
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:02,000
You still think
it's the ex-girlfriend?

489
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,352
A woman scorned

490
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,593
is a woman with motive.

491
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:06,310
We need to talk to this woman.

492
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,140
You're on your own.

493
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:10,131
I'm tied up with work
for the rest of the week.

494
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:11,410
Gus, that's so lame.

495
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:13,581
Ooh! Pull over.

496
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,081
Good morning, detectives!

497
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:20,260
Collecting donations
for the policeman's ball?

498
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:21,822
We don't have balls.

499
00:18:24,108 --> 00:18:25,731
I honestly have
no response to that.

500
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,482
Need I remind you, mr. Spencer,

501
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:28,690
what happens when you interfere

502
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:29,993
with a police investigation?

503
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:32,030
Uh... the case gets solved?

504
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:32,742
Wait a minute!

505
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:33,542
You guys are working on

506
00:18:33,627 --> 00:18:35,330
that murder thingy,right?

507
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,630
I completely forgot about that.

508
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,273
How's that going?

509
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,252
Silly question.

510
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:45,390
We'll let you get
back to your investigating.

511
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:47,023
Bye, Juliet.

512
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,780
Okay, where to next?

513
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:51,070
Listen, we change our clothes,

514
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:51,881
we get some lunch,

515
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,253
and I have to get back to work.

516
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:54,851
Gus, the plot is thickening.

517
00:18:54,938 --> 00:18:56,443
Shawn, I've already
missed two days this week.

518
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:57,933
Oh, fine, fine, fine.

519
00:18:58,015 --> 00:18:59,340
I respect your wishes.

520
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,352
Thank you... jerk chicken?

521
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:01,233
You know that's right.

522
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:05,831
Oh, boy.

523
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:07,123
There he is!

524
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,523
What time is it?

525
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:10,470
Daytime.

526
00:19:12,795 --> 00:19:14,150
What happened?

527
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:17,220
I might have
dropped six allergy pills

528
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:18,861
in your frosty
while you were peeing.

529
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:19,751
You did what?

530
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:20,741
Where are we?

531
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:21,643
Palo Alto.

532
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:22,851
San Francisco?

533
00:19:22,976 --> 00:19:24,490
No, but close.

534
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:26,323
Robert's
ex-girlfriend lives up here, Gus,

535
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,631
and we really need to talk to her.

536
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:28,711
I will kill you,Shawn...

537
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:29,673
and then you're going to

538
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:30,581
buy me some new tires.

539
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:31,721
Oh, come on, this is fun.

540
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:32,832
Road trip.

541
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,751
Kidnapping.

542
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:35,752
That's exactly what this is.

543
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:38,003
That's it,we're not talking.

544
00:19:43,137 --> 00:19:44,620
What, seriously?

545
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,653
So, we're really not talking now?

546
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:55,223
Come on,how mature is this?

547
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,633
The silent
treatment is not how conflict

548
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:57,881
gets resolved, Gus.

549
00:19:57,966 --> 00:19:59,113
We need to work through this.

550
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:01,130
We need to share our feelings...

551
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,882
maybe a smoothie.

552
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:09,230
Yes?

553
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:11,362
Never mind.

554
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:12,512
It's not her.

555
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,350
Pardon me.

556
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:30,272
What do I mean,it's not her?

557
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:32,501
Lips.

558
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:33,843
Lips don't match.

559
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,321
Lips that kissed your forehead

560
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,920
do not belong to Amy Kessler,

561
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,862
therefore she's not our ghost.

562
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:46,011
You didn't drive
all the way out here

563
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:48,713
so you could
say,"it's not her,"and leave?

564
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:50,502
"We're talking to hep. "

565
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,490
"Her. "

566
00:21:00,908 --> 00:21:02,663
"Carlton...

567
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,700
separation means apart. "

568
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:09,500
Whatcha got there?

569
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:10,563
Nothing.

570
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:11,902
Are you okay?

571
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,202
Of course I'm okay.

572
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,701
You look sad.

573
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,163
I am sad.

574
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:17,061
Why are you sad?

575
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,212
I'm sad because I don't have my

576
00:21:19,215 --> 00:21:21,600
forensics report on my dead doctor,

577
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:24,100
or a lead on my
possible witness, Regina Kane.

578
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:25,761
What about that psychic guy?

579
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,201
Isn't Shawn great
at this sort of thing?

580
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:28,063
Finding people?

581
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:29,463
Maybe we should bring him in...

582
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:31,701
maybe you should just
keep your ideas to yourself.

583
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:34,703
That's a joke, right?

584
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:36,700
Yes.

585
00:21:37,806 --> 00:21:38,903
Yes, it is.

586
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:39,901
Okay.

587
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,503
Very nice.

588
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,903
Exquisite brush strokes.

589
00:21:50,937 --> 00:21:51,961
It's a print.

590
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:54,501
I'm referring, of
course, to the original.

591
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:55,660
I'm sorry...

592
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,801
what's the name of
your gallery again?

593
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,900
That's been a bit
of a problem, actually.

594
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:01,700
We wanted to call it...

595
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,260
"Le Petit Louvre"...

596
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:04,763
But apparently,

597
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:06,880
the art snobs in France think

598
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:09,903
they have a monopoly
on all things "Louvre".

599
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:12,600
We also tried "Louvre II"...

600
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:14,901
"Louvre Junior"...

601
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,001
night gallery.

602
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,063
Nothing cleared.

603
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:18,763
The important thing is,

604
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:21,803
we want to show the amazing work
of Robert Dunn,

605
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:24,063
and he listed you as a character
reference.

606
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,802
We are very select with the clients
that we take on.

607
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:29,202
Isn't that right, François?

608
00:22:29,236 --> 00:22:29,662
I have to admit,

609
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,701
I'm surprised Robert would list me
as a character reference.

610
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:33,912
We dated for a period,

611
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,101
and it didn't end well.

612
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,460
Can I ask why?

613
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:37,761
Not to pry,

614
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:39,202
but he did list you as a reference.

615
00:22:39,237 --> 00:22:40,060
The usual.

616
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:40,853
Forgetting dates.

617
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:41,561
Standing me up.

618
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,703
Sometimes he'd get so wrapped up
in his work

619
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,561
he'd disappear for days at a time.

620
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:47,900
The worst was when he cheated
on me and lied about it.

621
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,001
You must have been
burning with furious anger.

622
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,162
It was just so stupid.

623
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,961
A girlfriend of mine saw him
in a club with another woman.

624
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,413
He was drunk and pretended that

625
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,201
she had him
confused with someone else.

626
00:22:58,237 --> 00:22:59,201
He said his name was...

627
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:00,510
get this...

628
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:01,971
Martin Brody.

629
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:03,361
Martin Brody?

630
00:23:03,406 --> 00:23:05,403
Roy Scheider's character from "Jaws"?

631
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:06,160
Yes.

632
00:23:06,206 --> 00:23:06,901
How'd you know?

633
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:09,352
Well, I've seen "Jaws".

634
00:23:09,386 --> 00:23:10,361
It's his favorite movie.

635
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:11,562
Anyway, when I asked him about it,

636
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:13,703
he pretended he'd never
even heard of the club.

637
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:14,901
That's, uh...

638
00:23:15,905 --> 00:23:17,461
Horrible.

639
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:19,902
You must have wanted to kill him.

640
00:23:20,506 --> 00:23:21,461
But...

641
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:23,461
probably not so much anymore.

642
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:26,702
You're pretty
happily engaged, aren't you?

643
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,661
Yes.

644
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,901
Isn't the ring great?

645
00:23:38,907 --> 00:23:41,662
Okay, so she's not our ghost.

646
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:44,101
Even the longest journeys can
start with a tiny misstep.

647
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,000
Overall, it was
still a very good day.

648
00:23:47,036 --> 00:23:48,500
How was it a good day?

649
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:50,561
Oh, come on, Gus.

650
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:51,800
First of all, road trip.

651
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:53,062
Always fun.

652
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:54,503
We got some fresh-baked sourdough.

653
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:55,760
Very nice.

654
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:58,102
And the agency's sending us
a new secretary tomorrow.

655
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:58,560
And yes,

656
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:00,203
she speaks english, fluently.

657
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:01,810
Shawn, we talked about this.

658
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:03,362
We can't afford a receptionist.

659
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,903
I don't think we can
afford not to have one.

660
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:08,063
- Gus?
- What?

661
00:24:08,107 --> 00:24:09,900
I think maybe we should move.

662
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:11,600
Come on, Gus!

663
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:12,562
Get in gear!

664
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:13,501
Go, go, go!

665
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,201
The guy's like a whippet.

666
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:30,700
Tell me about it.

667
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:33,101
What's the supersmeller say?

668
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,603
Somebody had too much to drink.

669
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:43,501
What are you so happy for?

670
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:44,862
We almost got killed.

671
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:46,160
This was not an accident.

672
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:47,560
Whoever that is was waiting for us,

673
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:50,502
and we have a new
suspect for Robert's ghost.

674
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:54,302
He didn't answer his phone.

675
00:24:54,337 --> 00:24:55,400
Maybe he's not home.

676
00:24:57,707 --> 00:24:58,403
Robert?

677
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:01,060
Or maybe...

678
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:04,200
whoever tried to kill us last night
also paid Robert a visit...

679
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,201
and left the door unlocked.

680
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:07,403
Anybody home?

681
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,000
Robert?

682
00:25:09,035 --> 00:25:09,602
Bob?

683
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:14,601
Shawn, you might want to see this.

684
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:18,503
"Save me. I'm trapped. "

685
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:21,003
I don't want to
jump to conclusions here,

686
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,703
but this very well
may be a cry for help.

687
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:24,901
Maybe someone died here...

688
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:26,560
or was buried alive.

689
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,162
This could be the
cry of a tortured soul.

690
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:30,023
So this guy just
happens to move into

691
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,402
two haunted houses in a row?

692
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:32,702
Don't touch that.

693
00:25:32,736 --> 00:25:34,062
It's blood.

694
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:35,360
It's not blood.

695
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:36,962
Enjoy your hepatitis.

696
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:40,701
And this tortured soul might be
less tortured with a latex enamel.

697
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:42,601
He wouldn't get these messy drips.

698
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:00,700
Now what?

699
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:09,402
I've got it. I've got it.

700
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:10,461
I've got it.

701
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:11,500
Hallelujah!

702
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:19,503
What?

703
00:26:22,508 --> 00:26:23,903
You've got to see this.

704
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,503
Not what I was expecting.

705
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:35,900
Okay,

706
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:37,602
I know what I'm looking at, but...

707
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:38,900
what does it mean?

708
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:46,602
Is it a ghost?

709
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,062
No, buddy,

710
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,702
it's not a ghost.

711
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,300
Is there a woman living up here?

712
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:54,962
That would certainly explain

713
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:56,362
the perfume Robert's been smelling

714
00:26:56,405 --> 00:26:58,503
and all the red
hair laying everywhere,

715
00:26:58,538 --> 00:26:59,463
but no, no dice.

716
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:00,752
Then what is it?

717
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,002
Come on, Gus.

718
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,301
Look.

719
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:08,662
What?

720
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:10,502
Robert is a woman.

721
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:11,902
No, he's not.

722
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:13,311
Not all the time,

723
00:27:13,356 --> 00:27:14,701
but sometimes.

724
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:15,761
No,

725
00:27:15,806 --> 00:27:16,702
doesn't seem like the type.

726
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:17,400
He's not the type.

727
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:17,862
Then how?

728
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:21,901
Unless he has
that personality thing.

729
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:22,762
What personality thing?

730
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:24,001
Oh, you know what
I'm talking about...

731
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:26,600
the multiple personality disease.

732
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:27,713
You know, that...

733
00:27:27,755 --> 00:27:28,801
what's-her-name had.

734
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:29,461
The flying nun,

735
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,102
in the other thing, the tv movie.

736
00:27:31,138 --> 00:27:32,701
"Smokey and the Bandit"?

737
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:34,160
Yeah, dude.

738
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:35,400
"Smokey and the Bandit".

739
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:36,162
Yes.

740
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:37,900
What does that have to do with
multiple personalities?

741
00:27:37,938 --> 00:27:38,463
You asked.

742
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:39,463
I asked a real question.

743
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:41,502
Give me a real
answer, not a random guess.

744
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,613
Okay, fine.

745
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:43,700
Hooper.

746
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:44,902
Hooper?

747
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:45,361
Hooper.

748
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:47,460
Hooper was a stunt man.

749
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:49,101
I don't think Sally
Field was even in "Hooper".

750
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,201
Who are you thinking of?

751
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,663
You know.

752
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:52,500
Terry Bradshaw.

753
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:53,901
Yes.

754
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:55,602
Is it Norma Rae?

755
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:56,263
No,

756
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:58,201
but that would have
made that movie a lot cooler.

757
00:27:58,238 --> 00:27:59,962
The thing you're
asking about, Shawn,

758
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:02,801
is referred to as
dissociative identity disorder.

759
00:28:02,835 --> 00:28:03,263
That's it!

760
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:04,502
That's what Robert has, Gus.

761
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:05,460
It all makes sense.

762
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:06,460
Do you know how rare that is?

763
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:08,202
I'm not saying all of
Santa Barbara has it.

764
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:09,463
Just Robert, one guy.

765
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:11,403
I think that
qualifies as pretty rare.

766
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:12,500
I don't know, Shawn.

767
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:14,103
These are huge.

768
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:14,761
Look.

769
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:15,563
Think about it.

770
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:19,503
Two separate but
distinct personalities, one body.

771
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:20,262
One's a man,

772
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:22,161
the other's a woman.

773
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:24,160
The female
personality cooks dinner.

774
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,701
Robert thinks the meals
are the work of a ghost.

775
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,300
The female
rearranges the furniture.

776
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:30,861
Robert thinks,

777
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:32,860
the ghost is moving
things when he's not around.

778
00:28:32,905 --> 00:28:34,230
His old girlfriend did say that he

779
00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:35,803
would disappear for
stretches at a time,

780
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:36,861
which would explain.

781
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:39,300
When the female
personality was in control,

782
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:41,163
Robert would disappear.

783
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:43,901
And he would have no
clue about any of it.

784
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:45,502
Now, all we need to figure out is

785
00:28:45,536 --> 00:28:46,911
how to bring out the woman

786
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,301
so that we can talk to her.

787
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:49,503
Okay.

788
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:51,901
Okay, okay, okay.

789
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:55,403
Triggers.

790
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:56,212
Shoot him?

791
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:57,073
Then what?

792
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:57,860
No, no.

793
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,960
Sights, sounds, smells.

794
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:02,503
Something that would trigger
the personality to come out.

795
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:03,712
Triggers it is.

796
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:04,863
Gus, this is...

797
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:06,700
this is going to be kind of cool.

798
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:07,901
Or weird.

799
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:13,900
Where did all this stuff come from?

800
00:29:15,808 --> 00:29:18,601
Is this where she lives?

801
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:19,360
The... the...

802
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:22,502
the angry female
spirit that you sensed?

803
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:24,463
Yes.

804
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:27,900
I feel her very
strongly here, Robert.

805
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,903
Do you?

806
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:32,900
Do you feel...

807
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:36,501
pretty?

808
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:39,161
What?

809
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,503
Do you feel pretty?

810
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:43,760
He...

811
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:47,901
he means, do you
feel a female presence?

812
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:49,560
No,

813
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:52,502
but I'm not psychic.

814
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:55,501
Do you think that you can,

815
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:00,600
Communicate with her?

816
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm trying.

817
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:02,902
I am.

818
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:06,903
I'm sorry.

819
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:07,860
Okay.

820
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,900
You guys are
starting to creep me out,

821
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:11,760
so if I'm not needed,

822
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:13,400
I think I'll go back downstairs.

823
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:13,962
Okay.

824
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:15,353
Let me just put this away.

825
00:30:15,387 --> 00:30:16,700
We'll all go down together.

826
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,501
You coming, Shawn?

827
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,902
Yes.

828
00:30:28,508 --> 00:30:29,902
Robert.

829
00:30:31,507 --> 00:30:33,462
These are some terrific clothes.

830
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:36,903
I bet they look
absolutely beautiful on you...

831
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:38,901
Regina.

832
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,461
Regina? Who...

833
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:42,700
who are you talking to?

834
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:44,462
Yes.

835
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:45,462
Yes, Gus.

836
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:47,102
Why don't you tell...

837
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:48,862
Regina...

838
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:53,500
how much you like her nice clothes?

839
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,702
Yeah, Regina.

840
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,162
Regina.

841
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:04,900
You look beautiful.

842
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:11,800
Regina...

843
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:12,900
Regina...

844
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,503
Thank you, Gus.

845
00:31:20,608 --> 00:31:26,702
I can't tell you how glad
I am that you got my message.

846
00:31:27,906 --> 00:31:28,903
So...

847
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:31,903
do you think that you can help me?

848
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:35,900
Please?

849
00:31:38,406 --> 00:31:39,501
Dude.

850
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,502
This isn't right.

851
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,500
I must look horrible.

852
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:51,362
No, not at all.

853
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:53,461
You are too kind, but,

854
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:55,102
then again, I already knew that.

855
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:56,701
The way you comforted Robert...

856
00:31:57,608 --> 00:31:59,901
you were so sweet...

857
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:03,361
unlike most men.

858
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:05,900
Afraid to show their emotions.

859
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,660
I've been hurt a lot.

860
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:10,201
Now, if you two don't mind,

861
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,703
I really must put on my face.

862
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:18,362
So, Regina,

863
00:32:18,407 --> 00:32:19,860
this message on the wall,

864
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:22,902
this was your way of trying
to get Robert's attention?

865
00:32:22,936 --> 00:32:24,512
He doesn't even know I'm alive.

866
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,101
Why not write him a letter,

867
00:32:26,136 --> 00:32:27,663
or an e-mail,

868
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:28,802
or even a post-it, even?

869
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:30,360
I tried.

870
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,450
I really did try.

871
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,463
But every time,

872
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:35,003
something or someone stopped you.

873
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:35,763
What are you talking about?

874
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,800
I think there's
another personality.

875
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:38,363
Regina,

876
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,063
there's another
personality, isn't there?

877
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:42,302
I mean, you don't smash
pictures or start fires.

878
00:32:42,338 --> 00:32:43,903
You would never strangle Robert.

879
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:45,761
No, I wouldn't.

880
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:48,600
Regina, the police
would like to speak with you.

881
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:50,313
They're
investigating dr. Blinn's murder.

882
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:52,003
They think you
might have seen something.

883
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,461
You could be in danger.

884
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:54,860
I didn't see anything.

885
00:32:54,908 --> 00:32:57,201
I didn't even go to my appointment.

886
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:59,503
Why would anyone
want to hurt dr. Blinn?

887
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:01,262
He was such a nice man,

888
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:04,502
and he was doing
so much to help me.

889
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:07,702
With what?

890
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:11,202
You ought to know
better than to ask that.

891
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:13,703
That's between a
woman and her doctor.

892
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:15,900
Okay.

893
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:17,701
Unless you're going to ask her out,

894
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:19,061
I think we're done here.

895
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:20,402
How do we get Robert back?

896
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:21,661
I have no idea.

897
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:23,700
You're her very special friend.

898
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:31,900
Regina?

899
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:34,901
We would like to speak with Robert.

900
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:37,503
Can you let
Robert come out and play?

901
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:49,301
For you?

902
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:51,701
Of course I can.

903
00:33:51,735 --> 00:33:52,662
Thank you.

904
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:54,900
And I do hope that we meet again.

905
00:33:56,806 --> 00:33:57,901
Robert?

906
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:03,901
Robert?

907
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:06,901
Robert?

908
00:34:07,808 --> 00:34:08,900
Try "Bob. "

909
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:16,703
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

910
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:18,002
We know it seems weird...

911
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:19,763
and... And...

912
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,050
and actually, it is.

913
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:22,492
It's really weird.

914
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:23,902
But we have good news.

915
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:27,002
We figured out who your ghost is.

916
00:34:27,036 --> 00:34:28,301
Who?

917
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,403
You.

918
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:34,500
You're haunting yourself.

919
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:39,900
Life is good.

920
00:34:39,937 --> 00:34:41,261
Life is great.

921
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:43,561
Robert gets the help
he so desperately needs,

922
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:45,771
and we get to
marinate in the delicious

923
00:34:45,778 --> 00:34:47,900
satisfaction of
another job well done.

924
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,360
Leading Lassiter to Regina,

925
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:50,852
even though she saw nothing?

926
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:52,263
That's professional courtesy.

927
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:54,701
Plus, it helps
raise our stock, Gus.

928
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:56,260
Crime scene photos!

929
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,501
Love crime scene photos.

930
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,901
May I help you?

931
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:04,662
Detective O'Hara.

932
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:07,363
What a truly pleasant surprise.

933
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:11,201
I just dropped by to tell
detective Lassiter that I have...

934
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:12,363
we...

935
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:17,202
Have information regarding the
whereabouts of a one Regina Kane.

936
00:35:17,237 --> 00:35:18,700
How did you know about...

937
00:35:20,206 --> 00:35:20,660
never mind.

938
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:21,500
Stay right here.

939
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,460
Don't move.

940
00:35:22,507 --> 00:35:23,901
I'll go find him.

941
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,703
Shawn?

942
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,501
Shawn, don't do this.

943
00:35:56,308 --> 00:35:57,052
Gus, look at this!

944
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:57,692
Look, look, look!

945
00:35:57,726 --> 00:35:58,311
- What?
- Here,

946
00:35:58,348 --> 00:35:58,863
on the floor,

947
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,603
where poor dr. Blinn's
body was laying.

948
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:01,900
A toothpick.

949
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:06,303
A chewed toothpick.

950
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:09,263
So?

951
00:36:09,306 --> 00:36:09,960
Don't you remember?

952
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:12,603
The car that tried to rammed us?
On the seat?

953
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:13,901
Chewed toothpick.

954
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,063
That means...

955
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,443
the person that killed dr. Blinn is

956
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:18,901
the same person
that tried to kill us.

957
00:36:18,937 --> 00:36:20,212
It's a chewed toothpick, Shawn.

958
00:36:20,255 --> 00:36:21,460
Lots of people chew toothpicks.

959
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:23,703
Yes, but we were
working for Robert.

960
00:36:23,738 --> 00:36:25,160
Robert is also Regina.

961
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:26,601
Regina is a patient of...

962
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:27,361
dr. Blinn.

963
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:29,260
Yes! Take the baton!

964
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:33,202
So whoever the killer is
knew both Robert and Regina.

965
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,203
He said his name was...

966
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:35,363
get this...

967
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:36,650
Martin Brody.

968
00:36:36,688 --> 00:36:37,900
How dumb is that?

969
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,300
Martin Brody.

970
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:43,860
Of course.

971
00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:45,501
That's Robert's
other personality...

972
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,360
the violent one.

973
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:47,563
But why would he kill dr. Blinn?

974
00:36:47,607 --> 00:36:49,900
That depends entirely on what
Regina was seeing him for.

975
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:53,402
You've got to be kidding me.

976
00:36:53,437 --> 00:36:54,463
What?

977
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,902
Dr. Blinn's patient files.

978
00:36:58,306 --> 00:36:59,900
All we have to do is find Regina's.

979
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:15,702
What are you doing?

980
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:17,903
What are you doing?

981
00:37:18,408 --> 00:37:19,762
Shooting.

982
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,160
It relaxes me.

983
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,601
Shawn Spencer says he
has information for you.

984
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:24,661
Where is he?

985
00:37:24,707 --> 00:37:25,702
At your desk.

986
00:37:26,406 --> 00:37:27,903
Is anyone watching him?

987
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:30,703
Found it.

988
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:33,402
No.

989
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:34,562
What?

990
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:36,500
Gender reassignment?

991
00:37:38,707 --> 00:37:40,803
Regina's tired of feeling like
a woman trapped in a man's body,

992
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:42,501
so she wants to have her parts...

993
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:44,660
my g...

994
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,961
wait a second.

995
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:48,863
That means, if
Regina was successful,

996
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:51,140
both Robert and
the Martin personality

997
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,803
would also lose their parts.

998
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,301
But Martin can't do
anything to hurt Regina,

999
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:55,801
because he'd only
be hurting himself.

1000
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:56,461
So,

1001
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:57,463
dressed as Regina,

1002
00:37:57,505 --> 00:37:58,660
he goes after dr. Blinn.

1003
00:37:58,707 --> 00:38:00,903
That would explain how Robert
got the marks on his neck,

1004
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:02,061
and with dr. Blinn dead,

1005
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,642
Robert figured that
Regina would change

1006
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,201
her mind about the
gender reassignment.

1007
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:06,561
Right!

1008
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:07,901
We got that!

1009
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:09,902
Only she hasn't.

1010
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,303
Gus.

1011
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:14,863
No, no.

1012
00:38:14,907 --> 00:38:15,902
She found another doctor.

1013
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:16,502
She's seeing him.

1014
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:17,212
Today.

1015
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:17,902
When?

1016
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:20,763
Right now.

1017
00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:21,850
Right now, Shawn?

1018
00:38:21,886 --> 00:38:22,902
Like in 10 minutes.

1019
00:38:23,507 --> 00:38:24,702
Okay.

1020
00:38:34,705 --> 00:38:36,903
There had better be a really
good explanation for this.

1021
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:37,802
He was in some sort of trance.

1022
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:39,501
I couldn't control him.

1023
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:42,502
He says this is the killer.

1024
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:43,610
Kill...

1025
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:44,660
Kill...

1026
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:46,901
he's going to kill again.

1027
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:49,202
This is ridiculous.

1028
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:49,663
Who?

1029
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:50,602
Who's he going to kill?

1030
00:38:50,638 --> 00:38:51,902
What is it, Shawn?

1031
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:53,451
Watch out,

1032
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:54,401
watch out!

1033
00:38:54,438 --> 00:38:56,503
Watch out!

1034
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,502
Dr. Drake?

1035
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:11,660
Gender reassignment?

1036
00:39:11,707 --> 00:39:13,461
That's a big step, Regina.

1037
00:39:13,505 --> 00:39:15,702
Why don't you tell me
why it's important to you.

1038
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:17,761
It's okay.

1039
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:19,200
The machine can get that.

1040
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:20,701
This is your time.

1041
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:23,903
Thank you, dr. Drake.

1042
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:28,562
No answer.

1043
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:29,603
It's just the machine.

1044
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:30,562
We have to go now.

1045
00:39:30,607 --> 00:39:32,202
It could already be too late.

1046
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:33,502
Let's go.

1047
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,801
I know this can be
a difficult process,

1048
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:38,862
but it really is necessary to
ensure that

1049
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:42,200
you're ready psychologically
for a change like this.

1050
00:39:42,235 --> 00:39:45,501
You do seem like an excellent
candidate for surgery.

1051
00:39:45,537 --> 00:39:46,962
Our time is up.

1052
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:50,700
Why don't we pick up here again
next week, okay, Regina?

1053
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:54,501
Okey-dokey.

1054
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,503
Only...

1055
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:04,700
my name is not Regina.

1056
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:05,700
Hold it!

1057
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:08,701
Get up!

1058
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:11,600
What's going on?

1059
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:12,310
Robert?

1060
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:12,962
Bob?

1061
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:14,450
You back there, buddy?

1062
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:15,901
What am I doing here?

1063
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:24,801
Great.

1064
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:25,900
Thanks.

1065
00:40:27,906 --> 00:40:28,761
Good news.

1066
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:30,590
They're going to admit Robert into

1067
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:32,502
the H. T. Windsor
facility in Chicago,

1068
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:34,900
and his doctor thinks
his prognosis is good.

1069
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:38,061
Don't you understand, Shawn?

1070
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,601
That's the premier mental health
hospital in the country.

1071
00:40:40,636 --> 00:40:41,800
Yeah, that's good. That's awesome.

1072
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:42,900
Who is that?

1073
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:45,400
Leslie.

1074
00:40:45,436 --> 00:40:46,060
No.

1075
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:46,662
No, no, no, no.

1076
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,701
Leslie is supposed
to be a swimsuit model.

1077
00:40:48,735 --> 00:40:49,701
Unfortunately,

1078
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:50,863
he is,

1079
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,801
although he says he's getting
completely sick of the grind.

1080
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:53,760
I have to call the agency.

1081
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:55,701
They're completely misrepresenting
their clientele.

1082
00:40:55,738 --> 00:40:57,002
Leslie's a guy's name, too.

1083
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:57,902
Okay.

1084
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:00,902
We have to fire him.

1085
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:01,963
Fire him?

1086
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:02,652
On what grounds?

1087
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:03,261
What grounds?

1088
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:04,800
On the grounds that he's a dude.

1089
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,302
That's discrimination.

1090
00:41:06,337 --> 00:41:07,461
We can't do that.

1091
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,562
Okay, listen to me.

1092
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:09,861
No woman is going
to look at us twice

1093
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:12,300
if we're sharing our office with
that ridiculous adonis.

1094
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,102
He's better-looking than both of
us put together.

1095
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:14,902
Yeah.

1096
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:17,503
I'm not doing it.

1097
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:19,503
Gus.

1098
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:22,303
You know I can't fire people.

1099
00:41:22,335 --> 00:41:23,661
They look too sad.

1100
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:25,003
This was your idea.

1101
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:26,301
Figure it out.
