1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,668
Them niggas around the corner
tripped out, man.

2
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:11,002
- Fuck that shit, man!
- Let's go. I'll take my car.

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,442
Oh, fuck that. We should've
let these niggas have it.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,173
- Just pull up, just pull up.
- Get your shit ready, nigga.

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,545
Damn!

6
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,647
These niggas here?

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,379
All right, hold up.
Get ready, get ready.

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,319
Look out, nigga! What's up, punk?!

9
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,067
Possible 187 at corner of
Crenshaw and Century.

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,207
They shot my brother!

11
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,838
- Tre, you do your homework?
- What homework?

12
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,098
- Yeah, I did it.
- Can I copy it?

13
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,209
Hell, no. Too bad,
you should've done it.

14
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:23,542
- Did you hear the shooting last night?
- Yeah, I got under my bed.

15
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,410
Man, you a scaredy-cat.

16
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,883
My mama say, "A bullet
don't have no name on it."

17
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,354
I ain't afraid. My brothers
been shot and they still alive.

18
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,254
They lucky.

19
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,920
Y'all want to see something?

20
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,029
What?

21
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,632
I ain't saying what.
Want to see it or not?

22
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,913
Is that blood?

23
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,313
What happened?

24
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,182
Somebody got smoked. Look at
the hole in the wall, stupid.

25
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,485
Least I can tell my times tables.

26
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,321
Look! Why is the blood
turning yellow?

27
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,828
That's what happens when it
separates from the plasma.

28
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,502
So that's how the settlers
survived that long hard winter...

29
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,571
...that took so many of their lives,
is by eating foods...

30
00:02:55,775 --> 00:03:00,872
...that were given to them,
like the turkey and the squash...

31
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:06,318
...and all the foods that we think of
as our traditional holiday meal.

32
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,989
And that's why we celebrate
Thanksgiving...

33
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,283
...to commemorate the unity
between the Indians...

34
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,194
...excuse me...

35
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,454
...the Native Americans...

36
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:22,397
...and the early English settlers
who were called... Class?

37
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,364
Pilgrims.

38
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,867
That's right, the Pilgrims.
Very good.

39
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,370
The penguins!

40
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,034
Who said that?

41
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,576
- Mr. Styles.
- That's me.

42
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,646
How is it you always have
something funny to say?

43
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,579
Because I'm a comedian.

44
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,180
Would you like to come up
and teach the class?

45
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,551
Yeah, I can do that.

46
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,423
Very well, come on up. Instruct us.

47
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,371
- What's the basis of your lecture?
- What?

48
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,069
What are you going to talk about?

49
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,504
I'd tell you if you let me talk.

50
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,048
- What's the name of this place?
- That's Africa. I know that.

51
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,721
Right, that's Africa.

52
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,756
Did you know that Africa is where
the body of the first man was found?

53
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,790
My daddy says that's where
all people originated from.

54
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,362
That means everybody's really
from Africa. Everybody.

55
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,797
All y'all. Everybody.

56
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,129
I ain't from Africa.
I'm from Crenshaw Mafia!

57
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,376
Like it or not, you from Africa.

58
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:42,878
I ain't from Africa. You from Africa.
You African booty-scratcher!

59
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,072
Quiet.

60
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,979
Punk, I'll kick your ass.

61
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,814
That's enough.
Count to 10 and be quiet.

62
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,785
I'll get my brother to shoot you!

63
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:55,924
Get your brother, bitch!
I'll get my daddy. Least I got one.

64
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,097
I ain't your bitch.
Ain't nobody's bitch, bitch!

65
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,791
Are you listening to me?
Sit down, now! That's enough!

66
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:10,668
As I said, he's highly intelligent.
He has an enormous vocabulary.

67
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,805
It's just that...

68
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,477
Yes, go on.

69
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,910
It's just that he has
a very bad temper.

70
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,611
It's extremely difficult for him
to interact with the other children.

71
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,347
Perhaps I could recommend therapy
or a child psychologist.

72
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,152
No, thank you.
We can manage just fine.

73
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,423
Is there some problem in the home?
Are you employed?

74
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,161
That's none of your business, but...

75
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,496
...I am employed, and I'm studying
for my master's degree.

76
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:43,642
- Then you are educated.
- Are we gonna talk about me or my son?

77
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,504
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,807
Well, we'll be happy to see Tre
back in class on Tuesday.

79
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,813
His suspension was only
for three days, you know.

80
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,682
- No. You won't be seeing Tre again.
- And why is that, may I ask?

81
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,790
- Tre is going to live with his father.
- His father?

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,157
Yes, his father. Or did you think
we made babies by ourselves?

83
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:12,000
- You tell her go jump in the lake?
- What was our agreement?

84
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,537
What did we put down in writing?

85
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,837
"I, Tre Styles,
being of sound mind and body...

86
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,142
...agree not to get into any disputes,
physical or verbal...

87
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,515
...for the rest of the school year.
If I do not conform to this...

88
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:34,887
...I will go to live with my father,
Mr. Furious Styles."

89
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,391
"Signed..."
Oh, now, who wrote this?

90
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,695
"Tre Styles."

91
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,105
You have to work on your handwriting.

92
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,515
Bean pies. World-famous bean pies.
Like a bean pie, mister?

93
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,856
I just don't want to
see you end up dead.

94
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,552
Or in jail.

95
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:16,259
A drunk, standing in front
of one of these liquor stores.

96
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,628
Can you understand?

97
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,606
Look at me. I'm serious.

98
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,042
I love you.

99
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,609
You're my only son.

100
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,647
How you doing?

101
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,252
- I'm fine. How about yourself?
- I'm living. That's enough for me.

102
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,817
Well, here he is.

103
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,592
- What's the matter? You can't say hi?
- Hi, Daddy.

104
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,197
Go ahead, talk to your friends.

105
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,807
- What's up, Tre?
- What's up, Doughboy?

106
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,187
Well, there goes your son.

107
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,018
You wanted him, you got him.

108
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,397
Why you trying to make this so easy?

109
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,801
Well, it's like you told me:

110
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,536
I can't teach him how to be a man.

111
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,470
That's your job.

112
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,879
So it ain't no weekly thing
no more, huh?

113
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,742
You staying for good?

114
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,818
Chris, you know Tre, right?
Remember, we were playing ball?

115
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,251
Yeah. You the one collect
all those comic books.

116
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,152
You living here now?

117
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,886
Thank you, Reva.

118
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,665
Furious.

119
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,504
- Take care of my baby.
- He is my baby too.

120
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,707
You still collect comics?

121
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,939
This fool got more comics
than a motherfucker.

122
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,110
- Tre, come here.
- Watch my stuff.

123
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,412
What up, Tre?

124
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,215
What's up, Rick?

125
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,862
Well, it looks like you got
all your friends over here.

126
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,424
When you coming to pick me up?

127
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,696
Listen...

128
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,734
...this is just a temporary thing.

129
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,910
When I graduate, I'll get a better
job, a better place to stay.

130
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,242
Maybe a house?

131
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,475
Then you can come back, and things
will be better. Okay?

132
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,450
Okay, Mom.

133
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,586
Okay. Can I have a kiss?

134
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,227
- Love you, love you.
- Me too. Bye, Mommy.

135
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,888
- Doughboy, staying out of trouble?
- I ain't got no troubles.

136
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,295
- You got some troubles?
- Lawn trouble.

137
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,097
- Why don't y'all rake these leaves up?
- How much?

138
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,571
I'll give you $5
for the whole lawn.

139
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,904
Five dollars. Man, that ain't shit.

140
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,843
- I can make more doing nothing.
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?

141
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,773
He work for his uncle.

142
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,648
That's too bad. I guess I just
have to get my son to do it for me.

143
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,082
Do what?

144
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,020
Want you to rake up these leaves
off the lawn.

145
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:06,027
Boy, don't look at me funny if I
ask you to do something. Take this.

146
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:12,498
There's two trash bags right there
on the ground. See y'all later.

147
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,267
Damn, your daddy mean.
He's worse than the bogeyman himself.

148
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,415
Gotta do all these leaves.
Who he think you is, Kunta Kinte?

149
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,108
- Later, Tre.
- Later.

150
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,349
What you mean, a bogeyman?
There ain't no such thing.

151
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,649
- Yeah, there is.
- Lf there is...

152
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,293
...I'll bet you Hulk
could whip his ass.

153
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,225
Yeah, later.

154
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,826
Tre, I gotta lay down
the rules of the house.

155
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,197
Same thing as weekends,
you remember?

156
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,042
All right, what are they?

157
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,340
Clean the bathroom sink,
floor and tub.

158
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,376
I gotta clean that tub?

159
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,842
Yeah.

160
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,047
Clean my room and water the lawn.

161
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,194
Dad, can I ask you something?

162
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,896
What do you have to do around here?

163
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:54,102
I don't have to do nothing around here
except for pay the bills...

164
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:58,470
...put food on the table and put
clothes on your back, you understand?

165
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,142
Glad I don't have to pay no bills.

166
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,948
You may think I'm being hard
on you right now, but I'm not.

167
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,312
I'm trying to teach you
how to be responsible.

168
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:14,286
Your friends across the street,
they don't have anybody to show them.

169
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,824
You gonna see how they end up too.

170
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,892
I'm glad you're here, Tre.

171
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,234
You're a prince, you know that?

172
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,574
Yeah. You're the prince...

173
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,643
...I'm the king.

174
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:36,580
Right now, the king says it's time
for the prince to go to bed.

175
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,250
So get yourself together.

176
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,611
I'll see you in the morning, okay?

177
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:48,979
Oh, shit!

178
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,417
Somebody must've prayed for that fool.

179
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:32,596
- I swear I aimed right for his head.
- Should've blew it off.

180
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,093
Don't say that.

181
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,360
Don't say that.

182
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,739
It'd be contributing to killing
another brother.

183
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,147
Man, where are these fools?

184
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,586
We've been waiting out here
for almost an hour.

185
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:19,475
- We got a call of a burglary here.
- That was about an hour ago.

186
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,476
We didn't ask you that.

187
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,171
Yeah, well, I told you.

188
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,281
Besides, I don't like having
my son out in the cold.

189
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,854
Just tell me what happened, sir.

190
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,647
Somebody broke into the house.

191
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,688
I fired at him with my piece,
and he ran away.

192
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,491
- You didn't get him?
- Lf I did, he'd be laid out here.

193
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,527
- Is there anything missing?
- No.

194
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,326
Good, no need to make out a report.

195
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,836
- Got a 415 on Florence
between Vermont and Normandie.

196
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,937
Too bad you didn't get him.

197
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,772
Be one less nigger out here
we have to worry about.

198
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,313
Hey, little man, how you doing?

199
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,526
Go on in the house, Tre. Go on.

200
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,195
- Something wrong?
- Something wrong? Yeah.

201
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,030
It's just too bad you
don't know what it is...

202
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,571
...brother.

203
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,090
Ice-cream man!

204
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,882
Wait up!

205
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,502
What's up?

206
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,741
You ain't shit.

207
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,540
You just like your daddy.

208
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,014
You don't do shit and you never
gonna amount to shit.

209
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,281
All you ever do around here
is eat, sleep and shit.

210
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,688
Look at this place. Way y'all act,
y'all must think I'm the maid.

211
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,864
- Is that it? I gotta go.
- Hell, no, it ain't it!

212
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,932
It ain't it till I say
it's it, damn it!

213
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,571
Cigarette.

214
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:31,709
Don't get smart with me, I'll knock
your ass in the middle of next week.

215
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,882
Where you going, you little
fat fuck? You ain't got a job.

216
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,479
Who's that little fucker on my porch?

217
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:52,220
Oh, you're Furious' little boy, huh?

218
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,560
Boy, you look more and more
like your daddy every day.

219
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,962
So tell me something.

220
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,968
How come he don't play cards
with us no more?

221
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,435
I don't know.

222
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,669
I know he don't think
he's better than us.

223
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,969
Too busy shooting at people.

224
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,671
I heard what happened there
the other night.

225
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,314
He still got that same girlfriend?

226
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,021
Excuse me, Mama.

227
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:24,893
- Why do you always play football?
- Because that's what I want to do.

228
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,530
That's right.

229
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,505
I heard Furious shot
at somebody last night.

230
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,606
- He get him?
- No.

231
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,178
Who is that?

232
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,315
That's my lady, homie.
Her name's Brandi.

233
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,048
She ain't your woman. She's my woman.

234
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,551
- How, when she my lady?
- She's my wife.

235
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,690
I stick my ding-a-ling in her
every night, so that makes her mine.

236
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,454
Get your ass in here and quit
looking at them boys!

237
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,892
Punk!

238
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,794
Faggot!

239
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,731
Get off me, with your big
4-by-4 head! Get off!

240
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,630
Get off!

241
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,133
Man, forget that girl.
Come on, let's go see Chris.

242
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,244
- Where's my ball?
- Man, don't bring that ball.

243
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,416
Me and my daddy going fishing.

244
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,348
We ain't gonna stay long.

245
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,649
- Where's he live?
- He don't live far.

246
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:34,998
Rick, why you have to bring that ball?
I ain't saying nothing if it get took.

247
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,696
Y'all want to see a dead body?

248
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,601
Yeah.

249
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,002
Tre's daddy blasted
at somebody last night.

250
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,837
Really? What kind of gun
your daddy got?

251
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,510
I think it's a.357 Magnum.

252
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,742
Really? I got a deuce-deuce.

253
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,682
My brother gave it to me
before he went to jail.

254
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:00,847
I got it under my bed. Want to see?
It's loaded too.

255
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,027
It's up in here.

256
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,313
Damn!

257
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,449
It smell like a dog died.

258
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,383
- Look like Freddy Krueger got him.
- He stink.

259
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,121
That's how they smell after a while.

260
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,555
I wonder why it take them people
so long to pick him up.

261
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,929
Yo, man, I ain't going up in there.

262
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,628
- Oh, man.
- Damn, it's stinky in this motherfucker!

263
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,841
- Hey, throw the ball.
- You ain't gonna see it again.

264
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,411
Don't you know this is a dead body?

265
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,513
Yeah, I know that shit!

266
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,250
He ain't bothering you,
so don't fuck with him!

267
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,309
Throw the ball, little man.

268
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,513
I ain't gonna take it.

269
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,156
Chris, tell him I ain't
gonna take his ball.

270
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:11,157
I got enough money to buy me
a hundred balls. Shit!

271
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,298
Man, I told you not
to bring that ball.

272
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,040
Thanks, cuz.

273
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,674
Yo, dog.

274
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,877
Throw the ball.

275
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,816
Shit.

276
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,008
Let's start the game, man.

277
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,086
Man, you stupid! Don't have no sense.

278
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,386
Told you not to bring that ball.
Wait till I tell Mama.

279
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,960
Man, shut up. I don't care.
Tell Mama.

280
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,665
Y'all leaving?

281
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,300
Hell, no.

282
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,334
Give me my brother's ball back!

283
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,904
- No, no!
- Come on, man!

284
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,976
No, don't say nothing.
You're gonna lose, man.

285
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,918
- Give me my brother's ball back!
- What'd you say, fat boy?

286
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,916
- Give me my brother's ball back be...
- Before what?

287
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,816
What your fat ass gonna do?

288
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,498
Yo, Rock! Give the little
nigga the ball back.

289
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,899
Stupid motherfucker!

290
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,540
I was gonna give it to you too.

291
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,085
Man!

292
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,092
Hey, man, I got a football.

293
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,356
I never use it myself.

294
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,727
- I give it to you when we get home.
- He ain't gonna want it.

295
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,467
His daddy gave him that ball.

296
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,369
Wish I could kill that motherfucker.

297
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,552
Yo, Rock, give me the ball.

298
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,830
Give me the fucking ball!

299
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,261
Hey!

300
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,302
Hey, little man!

301
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,969
Catch!

302
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,581
Man, you sorry.

303
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,753
- I'm going to the store.
- Why? You ain't got no money.

304
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,948
I'm going anyway.

305
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:01,926
- So you a leader or a follower?
- I'm a leader.

306
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,261
Okay, then. What's the three rules?

307
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,665
Break it down for me. And, hey...

308
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,203
...think before you answer.
- I got it!

309
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:16,045
Always look a person in the eye.
Do that, they respect you better.

310
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,442
Two was to never be afraid
to ask you for anything.

311
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:22,517
Stealing isn't necessary.

312
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,289
And the last one, I think, was...

313
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,617
...to never respect anybody
who doesn't respect you back.

314
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,352
That right?

315
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,991
Yeah. Yeah, you got it.

316
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,033
What do you know about sex?

317
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,907
- I know a little bit.
- Oh, yeah? What little bit is that?

318
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,682
I know, I take a girl...

319
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,080
...stick my thing in her...

320
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,050
...and nine months later
a baby comes out.

321
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,657
You think that's it?

322
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,921
Basically, yeah.

323
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,766
Well, remember this:

324
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:18,004
Anyone with a dick can make a baby, but
only a real man can raise his kids.

325
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,377
I wasn't but 17 when your mother
was pregnant with you.

326
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,447
All of my friends was dropping out
of high school...

327
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:36,126
...hanging out in front of liquor
stores, getting drunk, getting high.

328
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,391
Some of them was robbing people.

329
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,895
Some of them was even killing people.

330
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,603
Hey, you remember my friend Marcus?

331
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,602
He got into robbing people,
wanted me to join him...

332
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:56,042
...but I said, "No,
I'm getting ready to have a son."

333
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,149
I knew you'd be a boy.

334
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,783
I wanted to be somebody
you could look up to.

335
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,721
So I guess that's why
I went to Vietnam.

336
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,623
Don't ever go in the Army, Tre.

337
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,965
Black man ain't got
no place in the Army.

338
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,163
Damn!

339
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,608
Why'd you get it all over me?

340
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,247
- Don't do that no more, that's nasty.
- What?

341
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,317
Oh, wait! Listen to this song!
I love this song!

342
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,681
Things are gonna get easier

343
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,490
Ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

344
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:49,095
Ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier

345
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,824
Oh, damn!

346
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,133
Looks like they going to juvie.

347
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,968
No, man. They going to the gates.

348
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,438
- Yo, man, what happened?
- They were stealing.

349
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:12,046
Someday we'll walk in
The rays of a beautiful sun

350
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,226
Someday when the world
Is much brighter

351
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:22,890
Ooh, child
Things are gonna be easier

352
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:27,337
Ooh, child
Things'll be brighter

353
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:34,171
Ooh, child
Things are gonna be easier

354
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,582
Ooh, child
Things'll be brighter

355
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:45,216
Someday, we'll get it together
And we'll get it undone

356
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,423
Someday

357
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:53,189
Come on, Tre. Let's go, son.

358
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,691
Come here, Rick.

359
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,757
Come on, man.

360
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,258
Come here, man. Look at all
these people back here.

361
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,894
There you go!

362
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,733
Want to learn how to barbecue? Huh?

363
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,644
You're not watching this meat.
You just standing here poking at it.

364
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,316
- Give him to me, Ricky.
- Shanice, I got him.

365
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,108
Go on back to your friends.

366
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:52,379
- He's wet. That's why he's crying.
- He ain't wet. Now, go on back.

367
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,491
- Okay.
- Listen, I'm sorry. Come here.

368
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,920
See? That's how y'all got that one.

369
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,630
Ricky, you make sure
she taking them pills.

370
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,065
I don't want a bunch of these around.

371
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,536
I'll be the one
taking care of them.

372
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,267
- I'll put him to bed.
- Go on to Grandma.

373
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,608
It's all right. All right,
okay, shut up, come on.

374
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,947
And flip that meat over.

375
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,589
I'm winning.

376
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,019
Domino, motherfuckers.
What you say about that?

377
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:36,098
Fool, that ain't shit.
I beat your ass three times already.

378
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,598
That's just once.
Let's play again.

379
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:44,534
Fuck that, I don't want to play no more.
Let's bust some spades.

380
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,175
- Yeah, I'm with that.
- Bust some spades?

381
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,938
Cool.

382
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,184
- Know how to play spades, Dook?
- Something like that.

383
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,447
I have something to suck on.
Here, cut that, G.

384
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,555
I want one of them hootchies
over there.

385
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:14,564
Dooky, you full of shit. No bitch
gonna give your ugly ass no pussy.

386
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,636
I bet I get more pussy than you.

387
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,509
Yeah.

388
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,034
You get dopehead pussy.

389
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,372
I get more pussy than your
wannabe mack-daddy ass...

390
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,345
- Who you calling wannabe mack daddy?
- You, nigga!

391
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,880
No-pussy-getting motherfucker!

392
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,021
Fucking them dopeheads,
you stupid-ass nigga.

393
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,887
You don't know what I be getting.
Don't be fucking no dopeheads.

394
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,064
I let them suck my dick,
but I don't fuck them.

395
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,491
They got AIDS and shit.

396
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,693
You can catch that shit from letting
them suck on your dick too.

397
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,030
Thank you.

398
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,008
But I ain't sick.
I ain't all skinny and shit.

399
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,211
What you mean, you ain't skinny?

400
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,744
Motherfucker's skinny enough to
hula-hoop through a Cheerio.

401
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:03,113
You ain't got to be skinny or sick.
You could die in five years from it.

402
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,686
- Mark ass.
- Y'all trying to scare me.

403
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,962
Can you really get it from
letting them suck it?

404
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,694
Mark.

405
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,448
Tre? How you doing, baby?

406
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,647
- Fine.
- Good, you just in time for the food.

407
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,122
I'm bringing out
the rest of the things.

408
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,658
Potato salad. You name it, we got it.

409
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,958
- Everybody's here, so have a good time.
- Okay.

410
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,602
Oh, and Tre? Baby, do me a favour.

411
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,329
Talk to Darin for me.
Talk to him seriously, you hear?

412
00:32:56,574 --> 00:33:00,010
I am so sick and tired of him
going in and out of there.

413
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,247
Maybe some of what you got
will rub off on him.

414
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,113
Okay.

415
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,757
What's up, Dough?

416
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:19,027
Oh, shit! What up, G?
Tre, love in effect.

417
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,787
Yo, what's up, Tre?

418
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:25,229
- What's up, Chris?
- Heard you're like Mr. GQ Smooth now.

419
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:30,869
- Working over at the Fox Hills Mall.
- I get discounts on clothes, you like?

420
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,272
You look like you selling rocks.

421
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:38,575
- Tre, you be slinging that shit?
- No, I don't be doing that shit.

422
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,750
Couldn't anyway.
Pops'd kick your ass.

423
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,822
You know, I'm out of the pen now.

424
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:49,423
Trying to keep my ass out this time.

425
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:53,461
- That's what we here to celebrate.
- Yeah.

426
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,991
Damn, brother, how did you get so big?

427
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,666
Pumping iron and eating, man.

428
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,406
Nothing else to do in
the motherfucking pen.

429
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,741
Three hots and a cot,
know what I'm saying?

430
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,575
Rest of the time I was
reading and writing my girl.

431
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,012
- Reading?
- Yeah, motherfucker.

432
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,516
I ain't no criminal.
I can read, bitch.

433
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,518
Who is that, Shanice?

434
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,020
That's Tre, Ricky's best friend.

435
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,161
He was best friends with Doughboy
when they was little.

436
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,661
They be trying to act
like they brothers.

437
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:32,595
Girl, he is fine!
I'd like to rush that!

438
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:36,638
- He go to Washington?
- He go to Crenshaw.

439
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,776
I seen him before.
He work at the Fox Hills Mall.

440
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,208
Do he got a girlfriend?

441
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,710
Yes.

442
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:57,660
Jamaica, girl, I was scoping
on this ho's man.

443
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,991
He fine, anyway. You better watch
his ass. Somebody might steal him.

444
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,003
All right, y'all, come and get it!

445
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:19,476
- Do you live here?
- Okay, girl. Sorry-ass niggas.

446
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,578
Come on.

447
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,846
Why don't y'all act like gentlemen
and let these ladies eat first!

448
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,689
Yeah, you act like you ain't
never had no barbecue before.

449
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,556
Let the ladies eat.
Hos gotta eat too.

450
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,994
Wait, nigga, who you calling a ho?
I ain't no ho.

451
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,533
Oops. I'm sorry, bitch.

452
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,262
- Hey, hey, watch your mouth.
- Just playing.

453
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,166
All right, enjoy.

454
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,343
And be nice.

455
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,778
Get out of the way!
You still up here?

456
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,177
- Hi.
- Hello.

457
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,447
So why haven't you called?

458
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,889
Just one minute.

459
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,904
What's up, my brother?
She wants to talk to you.

460
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:17,733
- I know. I'm just taking my time.
- Oh, I see.

461
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,877
- You trying to run that game on her.
- Yeah, how am I doing?

462
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,775
Well, you're doing just fine.

463
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,313
- Except for one thing.
- Yeah, what's that?

464
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:28,778
She left.

465
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,144
What?

466
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,553
- Damn!
- That's all right.

467
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,218
Hey, hey, hey.

468
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,761
Ain't this a bitch?

469
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,963
Wait! Wait!

470
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,246
- Don't worry about it. I got her.
- Is she all right?

471
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,782
All right, G.

472
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,649
Sheryl! Come on!

473
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,124
Keep your baby out the street.
She gonna get hit one of these days.

474
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:20,030
You got some blow? You got some rock?

475
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:24,638
- I'll suck your dick.
- Just keep the baby off the streets.

476
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:29,602
And change her diapers.
Girl almost smell as bad as you.

477
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,056
What up, punk? What up, fool?

478
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,994
Mark.

479
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,744
- What is that? Barbecue?
- Yeah.

480
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,225
- I know you didn't bring me no swine.
- No.

481
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,089
Mrs. Baker told me
to bring you a plate.

482
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,029
- Brenda, huh?
- Yeah.

483
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,395
She might've had a chance
if she didn't talk so much.

484
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,730
Let's see.

485
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,842
She ain't lost her touch.
She still can make some barbecue.

486
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,522
Hey, Pop, can you fix my fade
back here? And up here?

487
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,559
I'm eating.

488
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,462
After you eat.

489
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:57,623
Yeah.

490
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,529
Yeah, real close.

491
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,232
So I can brush it, you know,
hook up some waves.

492
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,876
Something wrong?

493
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,413
Nope.

494
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,828
What's the problem?

495
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,961
You're getting old, Pop.

496
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,160
- I'm getting old?
- Yeah.

497
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:37,272
I'm getting better, young brother.
You getting old.

498
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,999
- You older than dirt.
- I'm older than dirt?

499
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:44,407
- Yes.
- I am but 17 years older than you.

500
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:47,742
Your friends, they got fathers
in their 40s and 50s.

501
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,852
These cats are great big...
Just slobs, man.

502
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,854
- You know, bellies out to here.
- Yes. That's gonna be you!

503
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,324
That's gonna be you, man.
Big old fat, juicy roll...

504
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,124
...double-jelly-roll belly. Right?

505
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:06,132
Sitting in a rocking chair,
reading the funny papers!

506
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,430
Then your grandchildren will be
running around, saying:

507
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:13,336
"Granddaddy, give me something.
Give me a dollar."

508
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,670
You think so, huh?

509
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,272
Yeah.

510
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,339
Wait a minute, man.

511
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,450
What's all this about grandkids, man?

512
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,449
You using the rubbers I gave you?

513
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,714
I ain't ready to be a granddaddy,
all right? I just...

514
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,483
I ain't ready for all of that.

515
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,196
Don't worry.
I can take care of myself.

516
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,659
Why are you sweating me, man?

517
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,636
Tre, close the refrigerator.
Close it. Come here.

518
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:41,064
What?

519
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,798
All right?

520
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,242
What? I stink now?
I got something on me?

521
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,221
- You had some pussy yet?
- What?

522
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,823
- You had some pussy yet?
- Yeah! Yeah!

523
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,254
When?

524
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,326
- What?
- When?

525
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:12,067
All right, all right.
Just sit down for a second.

526
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,236
Go on, sit down, now.

527
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:26,877
It was a Sunday, right? Rick and I
were kicking it up on Crenshaw.

528
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,552
This group of females
rolled up in a Rabbit.

529
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:34,713
Everybody trying to bum-rush them.
Trying to jib and all, right?

530
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:39,521
Man, there was this one girl
everybody was trying to rush.

531
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,197
Baby was fine!

532
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,866
Body was booming,
like right out of Jet centerfold.

533
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,934
So I'm, like, eyeballing her.

534
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,974
She walks right up on me and
busts out, "Is this your ride?"

535
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,743
Then I say, "Yeah, you want to go
for a ride with me?"

536
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:01,213
She says, "No, I want to drive it."

537
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:05,047
I say, "Can you drive stick?"

538
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:09,420
She says, "I can learn
if you teach me."

539
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:15,324
I go into my mack-daddy mode because
I'm getting a woody in my sweats.

540
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:20,299
I says, "Why don't you give me your
number, I'll call you for a lesson."

541
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,300
She does.

542
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,435
About a week later,
I'm over at her house.

543
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:29,508
Her mom and grandma
are leaving for church.

544
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,279
I walk right up to the door, man.

545
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,974
As soon as I go inside, boom!
We go at it, nonstop.

546
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,813
Kissing, hugging, right?

547
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,989
So I pick her up, take her upstairs.

548
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:48,458
Well, about 20 minutes into it,
Mom and Grandma's come home.

549
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,858
Seems Grandma forgot her purse.

550
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:54,534
Wanted to make sure she has something
to put in the collection plate.

551
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:00,872
Yeah, I guess she could smell the sex
in the air or something, right?

552
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,781
She starts straight
towards Tisha's room.

553
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,215
That's the last I ever saw of Tisha.

554
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,353
I call her once in a while...

555
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:24,795
...but when I do, her mom or grandma
say, "She can't talk right now.

556
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,898
She busy, doing the dishes."

557
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,867
- What'd you use?
- I used the number she gave me.

558
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,539
Why are you sweating me?

559
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,718
I had to use nothing.
She said she was on the pill.

560
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,485
How many times I tell you?
If a girl's on the pill...

561
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,754
...you use something anyway.

562
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,363
A pill ain't gonna keep
your dick from falling off.

563
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,908
I don't know why you insist on
learning things the hard way...

564
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,739
...but you gonna learn.
Oh, yeah, you gonna learn!

565
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,084
Clean up that hair.

566
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,362
What's up, man?

567
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,932
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- What?

568
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,627
You slamming my door like
some gorilla on a football field!

569
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,396
- Damn, nigga, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

570
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,450
Guess what, man?

571
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,078
- Recruiter from SC's coming tonight.
- Cool.

572
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,748
You know, man,
I never lied to my father.

573
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,590
Never?

574
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,494
Well, almost never.

575
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,400
Where's all this coming from?

576
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,569
Where's all this coming from?

577
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:11,173
I lied to Pops yesterday.
Told him I weren't no virgin.

578
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,769
Well, you ain't a virgin, is you?

579
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:15,936
Is you?

580
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,309
Well, technically speaking,
I haven't.

581
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,881
You know, I fingered
a couple of honeys...

582
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:26,750
...and sucked on some titties,
but I ain't never stuck it in.

583
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,252
Why not, man?

584
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:32,259
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, I asked you, didn't I?

585
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,431
I was afraid.

586
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,831
- Shit!
- Get off me.

587
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:53,879
- See, man? Shut up. Shut up.
- What you doing, man?

588
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,711
What you afraid of, man?

589
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,047
Of being a daddy.

590
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,725
Oh. Well, yeah.

591
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:06,689
But I'm getting old now, see?

592
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,798
And now that I want to slap some skins,
Brandi ain't even down for it.

593
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:15,368
- Even with a jimmy she ain't down.
- Is that right?

594
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,546
- I don't see that.
- Why the silent treatment?

595
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,020
You haven't talked to me in five days!

596
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,354
You tell your father to say
you're not home.

597
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:43,498
- Then you take the phone off the hook!
- Well, I been busy.

598
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,364
Oh, well, don't give me no bald-ass
excuse for a lie like that!

599
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:52,701
What did I do that was so bad that
you just had to stop talking to me?

600
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:57,073
See, you know what you did.
See, you gotta get with the program.

601
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:02,017
I told you about that. I'm Catholic,
and it goes against my morals.

602
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:07,054
Yeah, but Catholic girls are supposed
to be one of the biggest hootchies.

603
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:12,092
- When you bust a cap on somebody?
- I bust a cap like, blam-blam.

604
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:14,596
Damn! God!

605
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,905
Come on, fuck him up, man!
Fuck him up!

606
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:40,288
You say you want to wait till
you get married first, right?

607
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,980
No, look at me. Right?

608
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,393
Yeah.

609
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:47,563
And I say that I'm gonna be
the one who marries you.

610
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:51,565
So it don't make no difference
when we do it...

611
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,326
...we still gonna get married, right?

612
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,261
Yeah, but I'm going
to college before I marry...

613
00:47:56,473 --> 00:48:00,068
...and there ain't no guarantee
that I'm gonna marry you!

614
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:09,680
Bad shit!

615
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,959
Hey, hey, yo. Yo, bonita.

616
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,826
Damn, look at that ass.

617
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:23,157
Chica bonita. You come to my casa
and let's do the loco thing.

618
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,527
Hey, Dooky, this fool trying
to speak Spanish...

619
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,664
- That shit worked.
- What up, baby?

620
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:34,037
So let me knock the stuffing
off that Egg McMuffin.

621
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,769
You got a phone number?

622
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:52,351
- You haven't even given me a ring!
- I ain't ready for all that yet!

623
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,996
But you're ready to act
like we are, though?

624
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,532
- What your man say?
- Don't touch me.

625
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,898
All right.

626
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:22,055
- You make me sick, man.
- I know, but I missed you.

627
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,725
I missed you too.

628
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,560
I missed you too.

629
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,533
He still ain't fucked her yet.

630
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,349
You better take your ass
to the store with that.

631
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,118
So you gonna give me
the skins or what?

632
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,452
No, that's not all I think about.

633
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,357
Yeah.

634
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,127
- Okay. Pop!
- Yo!

635
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,595
Brandi's mom say you're cute!

636
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:09,100
Ask her how come she don't say hi
when I speak to her.

637
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,537
He say, "How come she don't say hi
when he speak to her?"

638
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,770
Yeah.

639
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,815
Hey, I'm supposed to be talking
to you, not passing messages.

640
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:24,578
If my daddy mess with your mama,
we gonna be brother and sister.

641
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,289
Then we have to do that incest thing.

642
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,753
What?

643
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:33,325
No, no, I'm just kidding.
Wait, hang on, I got another call.
