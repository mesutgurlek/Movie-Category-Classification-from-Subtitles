1
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:10,260
Oh, God.

2
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,844
Well, what the hell happened?

3
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,307
- We're an old married couple.
- Mmm-hmm.

4
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:26,811
Was it the pot?

5
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:32,506
I don't think so, because we brought it
with us from New York.

6
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:34,327
- Yeah.
- It's the same.

7
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:38,618
What was that...

8
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:44,154
What was that old movie?

9
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:49,370
<i>You know, Blame it on Rio.</i>

10
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:54,712
It has to be that, it has to be that.

11
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,307
You got to feel my heart.

12
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:08,119
Are you going to make it till dinnertime?

13
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,410
After dinnertime.

14
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:24,117
Oh, God.

15
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:30,296
God, I'd love to live like this.

16
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:33,714
Yeah.

17
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,250
I'm willing, if you have enough money
to stay in Brazil for the rest of our lives.

18
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:47,286
I'll think about it.

19
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:51,666
Okay.

20
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:04,088
Do you think that's it, being away?

21
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,305
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,007
Hey, babe.

23
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:22,579
Where did you go?

24
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:27,473
Don't do this to yourself.

25
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,994
Everything is wonderful.

26
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,898
Everything is wonderful.

27
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:40,634
Mmm-hmm.

28
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:41,746
Yeah.

29
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:49,336
I don't feel like such a fuck-up
when I'm here, that's all.

30
00:04:28,922 --> 00:04:31,127
Good luck.
See you in a bit.

31
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:34,905
I love you.

32
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,314
Okay.

33
00:04:57,436 --> 00:05:00,435
Don't touch anything.
Don't say anything. Back up.

34
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,905
Turn off the lights. Turn them off.

35
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:09,264
Are you... Don't even think about the buzzer.

36
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:10,865
Get in the corner.

37
00:05:14,268 --> 00:05:16,788
Is the cash in here? Open it up. Open it up!

38
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,575
Quicker. Get over here. Get over here.
You want me to fucking shoot you?

39
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,563
Open it up. Open it up.

40
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:25,393
Get over in the corner. Get over
in the corner. Keep your hands down.

41
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:27,570
Keep your fucking hands down.

42
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:30,070
All right?

43
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,145
Come over here.
Get over here so I can see you.

44
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:40,243
Come over here. Stand at the corner.
Come over here.

45
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:42,933
Put your hands down. Put your hands down.

46
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,376
Oh, shit! Is this all you got in here?

47
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:53,334
I'm watching...
Stay away from the fucking buzzer, all right.

48
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:56,441
Fucking shit, it's all she...
Get back in your corner.

49
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,670
Get back in your fucking...
Get back in your corner!

50
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:08,754
All right, keep your hands down
by your side, all right. I'm watching you.

51
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:12,535
I will shoot you, all right.
I'll fucking shoot you in a second.

52
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,498
This is all shit.

53
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,516
Diamonds.

54
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:22,902
Where's the fucking keys for this case?

55
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:24,660
Where's the...
Where are the keys for this case?

56
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:27,130
- In the drawer.
- Shut up, all right.

57
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:31,354
These are them?
Don't fucking move, all right.

58
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:32,983
Don't move.

59
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,505
What, are they all the same?

60
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:36,980
Are they?

61
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,029
Fucking stupid bitch.

62
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,042
I'm watching you.

63
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:45,593
Which fucking key... Which fucking...
This is bullshit!

64
00:06:47,514 --> 00:06:49,204
What the fuck is up...

65
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:51,603
What type of glass is this...

66
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:54,289
Fuck is up with this glass?

67
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:55,991
Fuck this...

68
00:06:58,714 --> 00:06:59,893
Bullshit.

69
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,432
Fuck this...

70
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:05,651
Fuck, no.

71
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:12,210
Fuck you, you motherfucking stupid fuck.

72
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,248
Fuck.

73
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,440
My gun.

74
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:11,443
Fuck! Andy!

75
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:15,894
Hank, you're so stupid!

76
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,024
Fucking Andy!

77
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,432
Shit.

78
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:59,344
Hey, two for four. You're batting. 500.

79
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:00,627
No, Dad, the second one was an air...

80
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,704
- No, no. It was a perfectly placed bunt.
- Good game, sweetheart.

81
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,889
- Good game.
How many you got?

82
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,269
Yeah, who's going to want seconds?

83
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:07,094
Uncle Andy, can I have another hot dog?

84
00:09:07,195 --> 00:09:09,366
Yeah, the way you played today,
I'll buy you the whole stand.

85
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,157
No, her mother doesn't want
her eating junk, all right?

86
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:13,876
That's not junk, that's all right.
That's a hot dog, right, honey?

87
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:14,926
What do I owe you?

88
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,528
Hey, Hank,
your money is no good here.

89
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,063
No, I got it, okay.

90
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,828
- I got it.
- You sure?

91
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,057
- That was a good game.
- Yeah.

92
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,234
Hey, give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.

93
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:30,767
- All right. I'll see you next weekend?
- I love you.

94
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:33,241
All right, be good. Here's your ball.

95
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:36,272
- You didn't feed her junk, did you?
- No, of course not.

96
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:37,871
I don't want her to develop
bad eating habits.

97
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,570
- She looks puffy.
- She doesn't look puffy, all right.

98
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,583
- You look puffy.
- Fuck you.

99
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:43,957
- She wore sun block?
- It was cloudy, Martha.

100
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:46,643
There are rays, Hank.
Hey, you got my money?

101
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:50,543
Oh, Christ, Martha. Do you have any idea
what that school is costing me?

102
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,795
You're the one
who wanted to send her there.

103
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:54,385
Yeah, because it is a damn good school
and she wanted to go there.

104
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,726
- You owe me three months.
- I don't owe you.

105
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,476
- I owe Danielle.
- Don't get semantic.

106
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,748
- Bye.
- April, May and June.

107
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,661
No, I promise, all right.

108
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:14,672
What's up, Hank?

109
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:16,952
Piece of shit!

110
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:23,348
Fuck you. All right.
Can I borrow your cell phone?

111
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,681
I don't have one.

112
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:27,984
- Just...
- It's brain cancer. There's a pay phone

113
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,938
- over there by the bathroom.
- No, it can wait.

114
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:33,903
What's happening with you?

115
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,668
I used to think you had
the world by the balls.

116
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,257
Now, I'm not sure if you even got any.

117
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,215
I got them when I need them, all right?

118
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:41,328
Yeah.

119
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:44,086
Yeah, smart and funny.

120
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:47,412
What I always admired about you, your wit.

121
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:51,288
- You're a prick, Andy.
- I always was.

122
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,884
- So, let's see if there're any left.
- What?

123
00:10:58,777 --> 00:10:59,889
<i>Cojones.</i>

124
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,128
Well, you need money. So do I.
Let's solve it.

125
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:07,284
- What are you talking about?
- Well, there's a place we can knock off.

126
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:11,701
Know it like the back of our hand.
Easiest money you'll ever get.

127
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:19,027
What are you saying?

128
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,686
It's worth about 600 grand.

129
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:25,176
And it's insured, so it's a victimless crime.

130
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,990
I offer that in case
your faggoty little conscience bothers you.

131
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:30,642
I weigh it off on 20 cents on the dollar.

132
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:32,436
That's 60 grand each.

133
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,935
Give or take.

134
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:39,889
I can't believe this is you that's talking.

135
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:41,271
Believe it.

136
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:46,225
So, it's safe, nobody gets hurt,
everybody wins. It's perfect.

137
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,558
Why?

138
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,790
What do...

139
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:55,633
- Do you need money?
- Of course, I need money. But this is...

140
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:58,584
This is serious crime, Andy. I'm not
a serious crime kind of a guy. I got a kid...

141
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,175
You've got shit.

142
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,092
You have a whole lot of shit.
You said so yourself.

143
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:05,048
All the time. Every day.

144
00:12:09,464 --> 00:12:12,726
You know what?
It's not as serious as you might think.

145
00:12:14,072 --> 00:12:16,658
You're my little brother. Now, trust me.

146
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,677
God, Andy.

147
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,223
That's why you called me up?

148
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,474
That's why you wanted
to spend the night together,

149
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:29,813
- talk me into something crazy?
- That's why I called you up.

150
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:33,999
Talk you into something crazy.

151
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,997
Well, what's the place?

152
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,016
No, not another word till you commit.

153
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,015
Fuck.

154
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,387
It's all right.

155
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,234
So, how's the wife?

156
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:05,011
Hey, Hank.

157
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:10,199
Hey, I got an appointment.

158
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:14,420
- I'll be back in a few, all right.
- Of course, you will. It's Thursday.

159
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:29,395
- You're early.
- Well...

160
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:33,134
You know my days are so busy.

161
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,486
Just tell me that you'll think about it.

162
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:44,495
But I thought about it already.
And I came to the conclusion

163
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:46,193
that you're crazy.

164
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,043
I'm going to go where with you?

165
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:52,783
I mean, you've got child support.

166
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,050
You've got Danielle's school,
you've got the rent...

167
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,626
- The mortgage...
- Come on.

168
00:14:00,728 --> 00:14:04,406
...you're up to your ears in debt, Hank.
- I can solve all that. I know I can.

169
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:08,238
When are you going to grow up, Hank?

170
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,447
We have a really good thing going,

171
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:13,779
and you should just enjoy it.

172
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,459
We have a really good time in bed.
I don't ask for anything.

173
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,949
I love you. I want more.

174
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:25,840
So does Oliver Twist.

175
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:32,174
Can I help you to seconds?

176
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:36,881
Or do you really, really, really
have to get back?

177
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:42,958
Huh?

178
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:47,346
"The weight of this sad time we must obey.

179
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,448
"Speak what we feel
and not what we ought to say.

180
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:56,311
"The oldest hath borne most.

181
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,645
"We that are young shall never see so much,

182
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,370
"nor live so long. "

183
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,909
Bravo! Bravo!

184
00:15:14,743 --> 00:15:18,639
You were great. I'm so proud of you.

185
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:20,435
You were wonderful.

186
00:15:20,536 --> 00:15:22,838
Grandpa and I thought you were wonderful.

187
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:25,935
Excuse me, I'm sorry. It's just...
I have to have your autograph.

188
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,446
- Dad. No.
- What, you were incredible.

189
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:28,918
- No, stop it.
- What?

190
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:31,438
- I messed up some of my lines.
- No, you didn't. I didn't notice.

191
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:32,689
- Did you notice?
- I didn't notice at all.

192
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:34,734
Honey, you were great. What?

193
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:37,208
<i>Mom, can I go see The Lion King
this weekend?</i>

194
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,687
- There's a class trip, everyone's going.
- Did you ask your father?

195
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,477
- Can I, Dad?
- Yeah, sure. I got some money.

196
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,518
Well, it's $130.

197
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:49,552
But we're staying overnight
and that includes hotel and everything.

198
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:54,415
Okay, great. Yeah.

199
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,248
- Yeah.
- Hey, man. Can I talk to you?

200
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:22,035
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm down the hall, by the coffee.</i>

201
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,917
<i>- How about my office, 30 seconds?
- All right.</i>

202
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:30,576
Hank, the super at 111 Riverside
says the boiler's really kaput.

203
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,200
He needs you to... Hello?

204
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:52,268
So?

205
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:58,934
- That place that you were talking about.
- What place?

206
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:01,649
- The one that we were going to...
- To knock off?

207
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:02,766
Yeah.

208
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,175
To rob?

209
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:06,132
You say it.

210
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,653
Tell me about it.

211
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:10,415
I'm not going to tell you about it
until you say you're in

212
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:13,105
and once you say it, there's no way out.

213
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:20,848
I'm in.

214
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,555
Let me see your hands.

215
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,191
- Just say it again, "I'm in. "
- What're you talking about?

216
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:31,822
Just say it again, "I'm in. "

217
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,040
I'm in.

218
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,287
What?

219
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:40,917
I just wanted to see if you were pulling
any of that chickenshit baby stuff

220
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:41,964
like when we were kids, you know,

221
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:43,532
"It doesn't count.
I had my fingers crossed. "

222
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:45,908
I'm in. What're we doing?

223
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:48,724
- And when?
- It's a jewelry store.

224
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:51,186
- Does this ring a bell?
- No.

225
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,751
What if I tell you it's got

226
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:57,709
a Foot Locker on one side
and a Claire's Accessories on the other.

227
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:05,750
Yeah, that's right. You got it. Now, listen.

228
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:10,765
We don't want Tiffany's.
We want a Mom and Pop operation,

229
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:13,006
in a busy place,

230
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:16,466
on a Saturday
when the week's takes go in the safe.

231
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,837
We both worked there.
We know the safe combinations.

232
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:22,164
We know the burglar alarm signals.
We know where everything is.

233
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:25,459
I figure, between the week's take,

234
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,974
the jewelry and the cases,
the vault, there's a $500,000 haul.

235
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:30,868
I figure probably six.

236
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:33,422
That old dumb old lady that works there,
she's alone till noon.

237
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,698
She's not going to be a problem.

238
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:39,661
Andy.

239
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:41,454
Yeah?

240
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,654
That's Mom and Dad's store.

241
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:48,559
That's what I said.

242
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,838
A Mom and Pop operation.

243
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:55,636
- You can't do that.
- Yeah, we can. Think about it.

244
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,457
It's perfect. It's perfect.

245
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:59,184
In and out in a minute.

246
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:02,004
Insurance takes care of Mom and Dad,
so they're not hurt. Right?

247
00:19:02,103 --> 00:19:04,469
No one's going to give a shit.
After a week the cops

248
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:08,430
- will put it in the back of the filing cabinet.
- Jesus, Andy. I...

249
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:11,020
Why did you even want me in on this?

250
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,118
Well, it'll solve everything for both of us.

251
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,424
What has to be solved for you?

252
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:20,399
Same as you. I need money.
I'm going to start over again.

253
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:22,357
What do you mean?

254
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,430
What the fuck kind of...
It's none of your business.

255
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:27,022
I just want out. I just want to... That's all.

256
00:19:27,126 --> 00:19:30,160
I'm getting out,
I want to help my little brother.

257
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,367
Come on.

258
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,181
Yeah.

259
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:37,967
No, I don't think I can do this.
I don't think I can...

260
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:41,366
Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can.

261
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:43,152
I just...

262
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,037
That's $2,000.

263
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:56,780
It's an advance.

264
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,114
See what just that much does for you.

265
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:02,122
And,

266
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:05,389
imagine the rest.

267
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:20,592
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine hundred dollars.

268
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:22,765
You still owe me May and June.

269
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,489
Yeah, Monday. All right.
Everything on Monday.

270
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,801
- That's what I said.
- Such a loser.

271
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:28,332
You're such a fucking loser.

272
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:29,519
I come over here with $900.

273
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:32,143
- Yeah, well, if it was for me, maybe.
- And I'm the fucking... All right.

274
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:33,653
- May and June, asshole.
- Bye, bye, bye.

275
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:34,699
Danielle, dinner.

276
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:38,573
No, please don't put me on... Jesus.

277
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:40,020
- Yo, Bobby.
- What's going on?

278
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,006
- Hey, here, let me buy you a drink.
- I'm working.

279
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:45,364
- I ain't loaning you no more money.
- No, come on, man. I'm flush.

280
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:47,024
- You don't exactly...
- Yeah, something like that.

281
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,589
Look, you just...
If you're free tomorrow morning,

282
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:50,702
I got a proposition for you.

283
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,687
- Later.
- All right.

284
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,341
- What if there is a security guard?
- There isn't.

285
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:02,958
- Why?
- No, it's a Mom and Pop place.

286
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:05,808
Who ever heard
of a Mom and Pop jewelry store?

287
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,016
- What the fuck is that?
- It's in the suburbs, all right.

288
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:09,874
It's not in the city.

289
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,780
I don't know.

290
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,189
We drive out there, we check it out,
if anything looks off,

291
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:20,366
you know, we just drive away.

292
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,054
We say, "Fuck it,"
we drive our happy asses home

293
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,166
and I keep the money anyway.

294
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:27,634
Yeah, fine.

295
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,868
You keep the money anyway.

296
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,437
- Hanson?
- Yeah, that's me.

297
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:37,744
All right.

298
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,423
- Yeah.
- Bobby, for Christ's sakes,

299
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:02,474
- Bobby, we got to go.
- Just come on in.

300
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:04,491
I just got to throw on some clothes.
It'll only take a second.

301
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,678
We got to go.

302
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,920
- Just give me a second.
- God damn it.

303
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:12,051
Jesus Christ, Bobby, it's so fucking early.

304
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,373
Boo wakes up, you fucking sit up with him.

305
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:18,860
- I told you it was work.
- I don't give a fuck what it is.

306
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:23,473
Chris ain't used to getting up this early.

307
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:27,474
Oh, Christ.

308
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:31,024
Come on, babe. Here.

309
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:33,167
- Thank you, baby.
- Yeah, just keep it down, okay?

310
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,415
You wake Boo up, I'll kick your ass.

311
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:36,306
- All right.
- Yours, too.

312
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,699
All right.

313
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,175
Come on.

314
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,322
All right, let's do it.

315
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:37,614
Are we there?
- No.

316
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:01,905
All right.

317
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:05,842
Who the fuck are you supposed to be?

318
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:08,429
Look, I used to work there, all right.
I used to work there

319
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:11,184
and I can't take a chance
on being recognized. Don't... Look...

320
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:15,823
- You ain't never done this before, huh?
- Yeah, so?

321
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:18,259
I got to tell you something,
you look like a fucking asshole.

322
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:21,707
- Yeah, all right, look...
- I'm going to do this on my own.

323
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:24,432
- Really?
- You do the driving, I do the thing, all right.

324
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:27,632
- What if you need help?
- I got all the help I need.

325
00:24:29,077 --> 00:24:30,571
There's no shooting.

326
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,684
- I ain't looking for it.
- There's no shooting.

327
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:34,382
- You do the driving.
- Hey.

328
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:35,695
- I do the thing.
- No shooting.

329
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:37,935
You ain't got the balls to do the thing.
I got the balls

330
00:24:38,037 --> 00:24:40,111
- and I got a gun. That's the deal.
- Listen, no shooting.

331
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,702
- Or else I'm leaving right now.
- Hey, no!

332
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:44,561
Just no shooting, okay?

333
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,387
Okay. Ten more minutes.

334
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:07,310
What the fuck is this?

335
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,104
You can listen to that faggoty shit
all the way home.

336
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:11,725
Right now, I got to get into character.

337
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:13,355
- Right?
- Okay.

338
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:05,132
Okay.

339
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,089
This is it.

340
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:09,230
You ready?

341
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:14,734
Car out front. Door open.
I jump back in. You take off.

342
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:16,844
- Simple as a pimple, all right.
- Right.

343
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,258
- Right?
- Right.

344
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:20,211
- Let's do it.
- All right.

345
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:07,562
Yes, hi, hello.
Is Andrew Hanson available, please?

346
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,305
Uh...

347
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:17,771
Mooney. Mooney.
Okay, yeah, tell him it's Mooney.

348
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,223
<i>- Yeah.
- There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.</i>

349
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:23,950
<i>- He sounds like some nut case.
- Okay.</i>

350
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:26,255
<i>- But...
- All right, I'll take it.</i>

351
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:31,176
It just came apart, Andy.

352
00:28:32,181 --> 00:28:33,708
<i>Oh, my God, Andy.</i>

353
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:36,875
<i>What the fuck am I gonna do?</i>

354
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:48,113
No, honey, no, don't worry.
It's just some mistake.

355
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:51,213
It's either the bank's or mine.

356
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:55,858
Maybe I didn't put enough money
in the joint account.

357
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:59,119
Yeah. No. Listen, don't worry.

358
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,515
Of course, we have the cash.
I'll call, I'll take care of it. Okay?

359
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:05,423
Yes, okay?

360
00:29:53,812 --> 00:29:54,924
- Andy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

361
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:56,522
We're waiting for you
in the conference room.

362
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,416
Okay, I'll be right in.

363
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:08,051
Jesus.

364
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,209
Okay, next.

365
00:30:11,316 --> 00:30:13,007
The auditors.

366
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:16,653
Some of you guys might have heard,
we're getting hit with an IRS audit.

367
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:18,960
The auditors will be here on Monday.

368
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,710
They'll spend a day or two
with each department.

369
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:25,608
On Monday, they'll start with payroll,
so you're up first, Andy.

370
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:32,080
Great. Great. No problem.

371
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:06,125
How are you doing today, sir?

372
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,522
Thanks a lot.

373
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,788
Hungry?

374
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:56,113
Have a drink.

375
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,084
Right, tonic water.

376
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:02,759
You know,

377
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,915
the thing about real estate accounting
is that you can,

378
00:35:09,426 --> 00:35:11,978
you can head down the page
or across the page,

379
00:35:12,082 --> 00:35:16,141
and everything works out.
So, every day, everything adds up.

380
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,731
Well, the total is always the sum of its parts.

381
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,540
It's clean, it's clear, neat, absolute.

382
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:37,452
But my life, it...

383
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:41,580
It doesn't add up. It's...

384
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,327
Nothing connects to anything else. It's...

385
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:54,476
I'm not the sum of my parts.

386
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:02,124
All of my parts don't add up to one...

387
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,227
To one me, I guess.

388
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,334
Get a shrink or a wife.

389
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,680
- I got a wife.
- Get a shrink.

390
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:33,962
Excuse me. Sorry.

391
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,411
Was it me, honey?

392
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,930
What difference does it make?

393
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:48,046
It's another strikeout.

394
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:52,686
I swear it would make a lot of difference.

395
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:56,972
- You're all I want.
- Yeah, well...

396
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,673
I'm a lousy cook. The house looks like shit.

397
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:04,942
I'm a lousy lay,
I don't know why you wanna keep me.

398
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:11,723
You weren't in Rio.

399
00:37:13,457 --> 00:37:14,886
I wasn't what?

400
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,878
Lousy lay.

401
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:26,477
Well, like you said, just blame it on Rio.

402
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:35,463
Suppose I could get us back there.

403
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:36,584
What?

404
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:38,728
Rio.

405
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,032
- To live?
- Absolutely.

406
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,014
- You're just crazy. Crazy.
- No. It's not crazy.

407
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:51,462
The real estate market's booming in Rio.
There's a lot of new money.

408
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:53,804
And they're going to want
the same as Europeans, Arabs,

409
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:58,161
everybody wants real estate in New York,
in America and I know the market here.

410
00:37:58,257 --> 00:38:00,559
You don't even speak the language.

411
00:38:04,946 --> 00:38:08,361
I'll fucking learn it. Jesus Christ.

412
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:13,071
You know when...

413
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:19,081
When you met me, my biggest prospect
was inheriting a Mom and Pop jewelry store

414
00:38:19,186 --> 00:38:21,967
in a fucking shopping mall in Westchester.

415
00:38:23,377 --> 00:38:26,247
Now, I know it's not Trump Plaza, and...

416
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:30,544
But just take a look at how we're living now.

417
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:32,844
Now, I took that lousy job in that,

418
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,880
that real estate office,
I was practically a fucking gofer,

419
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:38,985
and I'm pulling down six figures now.
I'm smart.

420
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,921
I know the angles.

421
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:45,454
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

422
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:48,173
I bet you do.

423
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:50,601
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

424
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:52,941
Well, because there is
no extradition agreement

425
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,463
between Brazil and the United States.

426
00:38:56,945 --> 00:38:58,189
How the...

427
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:00,231
How the hell do you know that?

428
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:02,093
I saw it in a movie.

429
00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:07,333
Yeah, I guess I saw the same movie.

430
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,605
So, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

431
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:17,160
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

432
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,021
Don't ask, don't tell.

433
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:23,821
I just want us to get back there.

434
00:39:25,585 --> 00:39:29,066
I've seen Heaven, Gina,
it's a nice place to stay.

435
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:31,886
- Okay? All right?
- Uh-huh.

436
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:42,542
- What language do they speak there?
- Portuguese.

437
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,277
I speak a little Spanish.

438
00:39:48,656 --> 00:39:52,301
That's... I'm sorry, sweetheart,
that's not the same language.

439
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:54,700
- Yes, it is.
- I'm sorry, it's not.

440
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:57,452
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
- No.

441
00:39:57,553 --> 00:39:59,375
<i>- Yes, it is.
- Cómo se llama?</i>

442
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,664
<i>- Me llamo...
- Cómo? Me llamo...</i>

443
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:05,128
Gina.

444
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,330
Why'd you come to me?

445
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,795
I know you from way back,
I know what you do.

446
00:40:50,896 --> 00:40:52,271
You're a cop.

447
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:55,337
No, I'm not a cop,
I just want to make sure you're still around.

448
00:40:55,441 --> 00:40:57,896
I'll bring you what I've got soon,
either you take it or you don't.

449
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:59,211
But I know you will.

450
00:40:59,313 --> 00:41:01,353
You could work for the cops.

451
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:03,599
Check me out.

452
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:07,407
I'll be back.

453
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,902
That's $2,000.

454
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,134
It's an advance.

455
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:28,487
See what just that much does for you,

456
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,877
and imagine the rest.

457
00:41:48,943 --> 00:41:51,944
- Yeah, so how do we start? Oh, fuck.
- It's

458
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:53,609
not we, you.

459
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,086
Me?

460
00:41:55,184 --> 00:41:58,796
What the hell do I know
about robbing a jewelry store?

461
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:02,605
You'll learn it there.
On-the-job training, you know.

462
00:42:04,336 --> 00:42:05,830
Cut it out, man, this is serious.

463
00:42:05,936 --> 00:42:09,831
You know, I'm serious as a heart attack.
Listen, number one, I can't...

464
00:42:09,937 --> 00:42:12,303
- I can't go up to the mall.
- Why not?

465
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,610
Oh God, three months ago,

466
00:42:13,712 --> 00:42:16,101
I had to walk the whole goddamn area
with a Home Depot representative,

467
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,615
'cause they were thinking of buying up
a lot of space.

468
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:18,989
We own a lot of land in the mall,

469
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:21,510
and I'm getting a lot of big handshakes.
"Andy, baby, how are you?

470
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:22,631
"I haven't seen you in so long
since you left. "

471
00:42:22,736 --> 00:42:25,550
And telling me all that bullshit
because they figure I'm making a killing,

472
00:42:25,648 --> 00:42:27,885
because a big chain wants to buy them out.

473
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:31,367
I'm saying someone's going to
just recognize me too easy.

474
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:34,094
So we postpone, just...

475
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:38,183
Yeah, we could, you know, wait a year.

476
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:44,399
I mean, I don't know about you,
my problems are pressing.

477
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:47,912
Jesus, Andy, I... Andy!

478
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:51,248
- I wouldn't even know how to start, I mean.
- Well, you can stop being a baby.

479
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:52,904
- I'm not being a...
- Yeah, you're being a baby.

480
00:42:53,008 --> 00:42:56,356
Get a gun.
You get a toy gun in a kid's store.

481
00:42:56,464 --> 00:42:59,278
Right, that old lady that works on Saturday,
what's her name?

482
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,285
- Doris?
- Yeah, Doris, Mom's friend.

483
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:04,969
She's what, 60, 70? She's blind as a bat?

484
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:06,829
Look at me. Blind as a bat.

485
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:10,150
All right, those toy guns,
they look so real, they fool cops all the time.

486
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:11,849
All right, you go in at 8:00 a. m.,
just as she opens up.

487
00:43:11,952 --> 00:43:14,406
You put her old ass in the back room,
you empty the vault,

488
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:17,828
the cash, the trays
and you dump it in a fucking sack.

489
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,007
All right. You don't gotta be neat about it.

490
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:27,624
Jesus, Andy, I don't know.
I don't know, I don't... I...

491
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:29,102
I don't know.

492
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:37,063
Okay. Come on.

493
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:43,173
You can do it.

494
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:45,765
You can do it.

495
00:43:46,384 --> 00:43:47,726
Anybody can.

496
00:43:49,424 --> 00:43:52,740
- I just think...
- I know, I know. It's too late to think.

497
00:43:54,736 --> 00:43:56,165
It's too late.

498
00:43:56,879 --> 00:43:59,562
This is our future.

499
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:08,423
Okay.

500
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,736
<i>- Yeah.
- There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.</i>

501
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,945
<i>He sounds like some nut case. But...</i>

502
00:44:28,048 --> 00:44:29,477
Okay, I got it.

503
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:34,383
It just came apart, Andy.

504
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:37,452
Oh, my God, Andy.

505
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:42,822
<i>What the fuck am I gonna do?</i>

506
00:44:45,264 --> 00:44:46,246
Could he be in a different wing?

507
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,872
If you just pipe down a second, sir,
I'm trying to help you.

508
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:50,383
- What are you doing here?
- Keep quiet one minute.

509
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,137
Dad called me, all right. I just got here.

510
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,541
- This lady, she doesn't...
- Look, Miss, our father... I got it.

511
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,087
- I got it. I know, but you might...
- I told him, we've got no Charles Hanson.

512
00:44:58,191 --> 00:45:00,679
Wait a minute, I got a Nanette Hanson.

513
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:04,292
- What?
- There's a Nanette Hanson.

514
00:45:04,399 --> 00:45:06,985
- Brought in about three hours ago.
- What?

515
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:09,861
Gunshot wounds.

516
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:13,606
- Where is she?
- Emergency ICU.

517
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:18,218
Hey. Now. Hey, hold it.
Wait, are you related? Sir? Are you?

518
00:45:23,439 --> 00:45:24,421
Dad?

519
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,960
She's unconscious.

520
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:36,779
And they...

521
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:39,143
She's...

522
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,214
They...

523
00:45:43,631 --> 00:45:44,907
They say...

524
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:03,014
<i>So, how are you feeling?</i>

525
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,646
Yeah, I feel old.

526
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,877
I've been studying all week,
and I can't retain a thing.

527
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:11,845
<i>Come on, you're going to pass
with flying colors, Dad.</i>

528
00:46:11,951 --> 00:46:15,977
That's how I'm going to spend my birthday,
taking that stupid test.

529
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,256
Have you spoken to your brothers?

530
00:46:18,927 --> 00:46:20,171
Few weeks ago.

531
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,344
<i>Yeah? How are they?</i>

532
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:26,151
Busy.

533
00:46:26,255 --> 00:46:29,484
You know, Dad,
Hank is Hank and Andy's Andy.

534
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,078
No more cramming, birthday boy.
It's the moment of truth.

535
00:46:36,623 --> 00:46:38,827
What time is Doris coming to the store?

536
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:40,902
She said 12:00 at the latest.

537
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,462
She has to baby-sit for her daughter.

538
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,534
I'll pick you up right after my test.

539
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:50,148
Come on, come on.

540
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:52,939
All right, all right, all right.

541
00:47:08,143 --> 00:47:10,509
- Perfect score, Mr. Hanson.
- Bingo!

542
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:13,828
Congratulations.

543
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,844
If you'll take this to Window C,

544
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,372
they'll give you the eye test.

545
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:22,632
I might not do so well on that one.

546
00:47:22,735 --> 00:47:26,030
- I've been studying hard, of course. Thanks.
- All right.

547
00:47:56,013 --> 00:47:57,901
That's my store!

548
00:47:58,703 --> 00:48:00,645
- What happened? What's happening?
Let's go!

549
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:02,475
- Sir, sir, just stay behind the yellow line.
- What's happening?

550
00:48:02,574 --> 00:48:04,200
- I want to know what's happening.
- Behind the yellow line.

551
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:06,724
- Where's my wife? Where's my wife?
- Calm down. Please calm down.

552
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:42,315
I love you.

553
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:56,364
There are more tests we can do, but from
what we've seen so far, it's very unlikely.

554
00:48:57,454 --> 00:48:59,177
There's no brain activity.

555
00:48:59,278 --> 00:49:03,370
And statistically speaking,
there's very little chance for recovery.

556
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:10,536
Why was Mom working?

557
00:49:11,758 --> 00:49:14,441
I thought she didn't work at the store
anymore, that's what Katherine told me.

558
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:18,982
Doris had to baby-sit, I had to get down
to the DMV, get my eyes tested.

559
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,401
Today's my birthday.

560
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:26,281
Where's your brother?

561
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:32,068
He...

562
00:49:34,158 --> 00:49:36,973
He says he can't take it. To let him know if...

563
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,201
If he can help,
but he just can't see her like that.

564
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:24,005
He's 28 years old.

565
00:50:24,941 --> 00:50:26,949
He's a goddamn punk from Red Hook.

566
00:50:27,054 --> 00:50:30,828
Red Hook. What was he doing up here?
What in the fucking world? What he...

567
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:34,122
I mean, did he put a map on the wall
and throw a dart?

568
00:50:37,678 --> 00:50:41,387
It's so absurd. It's so goddamn arbitrary.

569
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:44,164
Why me? Why her?

570
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:46,980
What was this goddamn kid doing?

571
00:50:48,909 --> 00:50:50,535
You belong in hell.

572
00:50:52,621 --> 00:50:54,826
Yeah. I understand. All right. Thank you.

573
00:50:55,438 --> 00:50:57,958
Look, it might be better if you call,
make an appointment?

574
00:50:58,061 --> 00:50:59,817
Well, I'd rather wait.

575
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:03,781
Please. Steve...

576
00:51:37,965 --> 00:51:38,947
Dad.

577
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:43,818
You have to make a decision, Dad.

578
00:51:47,085 --> 00:51:48,394
The gun was bought in Texas.

579
00:51:48,492 --> 00:51:51,756
Stolen Texas driver's license, his ID, fake,

580
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:56,456
the gun turns up in New York, a year later.

581
00:51:56,558 --> 00:51:59,241
- Mom needs you to make a decision, Dad.
- Andy, just leave him alone.

582
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:01,129
Well, something has to be done,
he has to make a decision.

583
00:52:01,229 --> 00:52:02,789
Just leave him to his grief for one minute.

584
00:52:02,893 --> 00:52:06,209
- Mom is in the hands of Jesus.
- Now, will you cut it out with that crap?

585
00:52:06,316 --> 00:52:08,487
You shouldn't push Dad to make a decision
he doesn't wanna make.

586
00:52:08,588 --> 00:52:10,082
Well, he has to make a decision.

587
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,499
Hey, Patrick.

588
00:53:11,629 --> 00:53:13,963
We know it's difficult, Mr. Hanson.

589
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,610
Let her go.

590
00:53:43,661 --> 00:53:44,970
Let her go.

591
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,322
Let her go.

592
00:53:54,221 --> 00:53:56,642
"Almighty and ever living God.

593
00:53:56,748 --> 00:54:01,637
"Remember the mercy with which you
graced your daughter, Nanette, in this life.

594
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:06,345
"Receive her, we pray,
into the mansions of the saints.

595
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:09,707

596

597
00:54:13,356 --> 00:54:15,778
"And comfort them in their loss.

598

600
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:28,492
I'm so sorry for your loss.
She was a wonderful person.

601
00:54:29,485 --> 00:54:30,597
- She was a wonderful woman.
- Yes.

602
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:33,635
- I'm so sorry.
- You have my deepest condolences.

603
00:54:33,964 --> 00:54:35,557
She was a dear friend.

604
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:37,286
So sorry for your loss,
your mother was a good person.

605
00:54:37,388 --> 00:54:38,794
I'm so sorry.

606
00:54:39,852 --> 00:54:41,260
God bless you.

607
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:45,194
There's no way I can make this scene, Andy.

608
00:54:47,853 --> 00:54:49,762
He was always such a baby.

609
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:04,864
Yeah.

610
00:55:09,197 --> 00:55:10,790
I can't really talk right now.

611
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:13,832
I can't, I...

612
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:15,874
I have to go. Andy needs me.

613
00:56:06,957 --> 00:56:08,167
<i>22nd precinct.</i>

614
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:10,156
Detective Barrett, please.

615
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:11,910
<i>Just a moment, sir.</i>

616
00:56:14,892 --> 00:56:16,201
<i>I'm sorry, he's not in right now.</i>

617
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,871
Is there anyone down there that knows
anything about the Nanette Hanson case?

618
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:23,874
<i>- Who's speaking, please?
- Charles Hanson, yeah.</i>

619
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,367
<i>Just a moment, sir.</i>

620

<i>Sergeant Sullivan.</i>

621
00:56:33,548 --> 00:56:35,009
Yeah, good morning, Sergeant.

622
00:56:35,115 --> 00:56:39,109
I've been trying to reach Detective Barrett
but he doesn't return my calls.

623
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:40,585
<i>Would you like to leave a message, sir?</i>

624
00:56:40,683 --> 00:56:43,586
No, I wouldn't like to leave
another message.
