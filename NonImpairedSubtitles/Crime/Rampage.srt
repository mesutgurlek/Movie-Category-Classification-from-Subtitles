00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,767
Hey, darling.

2
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,335
Hey, honey.
How are you doing?

3
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:12,320
Did you sleep okay?

4
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:14,890
I did. You were
a tiger last night.

5
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:17,894
Oh, did you put
milk out already?

6
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:19,895
Yeah.
Okay.

7
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:21,297
I want to see if there's a
mirror I can--

8
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,065
Hey, honey. How are you doing?

9
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,066
Good.

10
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:25,201
Oh, you've already got
everything.

11
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:26,935
Sweetheart, you're
taking care of business.

12
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:28,171
That's fantastic.

13
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,405
I've got your coffee.
Let's move things along.

14
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:30,973
Sweetie, I just want to mention

15
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,443
that these should have
been put away, okay?

16
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:36,147
I mean,
you've got to chip in.

17
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:38,149
I thought I--
I thought I did that.

18
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:47,791
Okay, but find
a way that's not--

19
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,794
because you know what--

20
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:53,732
I don't want to do this
on a rush,

21
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,167
because it's an important thing.

22
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:57,670
But your mother and I were
talking last night.

23
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:01,574
We didn't get a lot of sleep--
not for the reason you think.

24
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,910
That's gross.

25
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:07,280
We think it's time you
moved on and moved out.

26
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:10,716
Fuck!

27
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:11,717
Oh, don't worry about it.

28
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:12,719
Okay.

29
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I'll get a napkin.

30
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,756
I'm sorry.

31
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:18,760
Help your father.

32
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,860
You got it, Dad?

33
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:23,631
Sorry, Mom.

35
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:24,732
No, it's okay.

36
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:26,968
But it's just that,
look, you're 23...

37
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,669
You've got to get your
own place, right?

38
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,038
I know. You keep saying that.

39
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,305
You just spilt more on me.

40
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:32,407
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,909
But you-- I know you
guys keep saying that.

42
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,113
Sorry.

43
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:39,283
You keep saying that,
but it takes time,

44
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:42,185
because I have to, obviously,
raise the money

45
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:46,457
for my own post-education,
right?

46
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:50,427
So the deal was is that
I would do that by own,

47
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:52,262
do my best to
save up that money.

48
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:55,332
In the meantime,
I would stay with you guys.

49
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,902
How about putting some of that
money into some rent?

50
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:59,687
What did I do last month?

51
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:01,521
We talked about the fridge.

52
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:03,324
Remember, when you
first suggested it?

53
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:04,610
I said I didn't--
Honey, what did--

54
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,629
And then you said that that
would buy me some--

55
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,367
That's a classic guilt trip by
the way, and I appreciate that.

56
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:11,766
No, but he did say--

57
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,734
I know what you're doing.
You learned from the best.

58
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,104
If you guys want me
to go back to school,

59
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:17,106
then obviously I have to have a
little bit of money

60
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,241
to do that too.

61
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:22,178
Look, honestly, Bill,
you don't want to be the--

62
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,414
We shouldn't have
gotten into it now,

63
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:24,914
because you and I--
we have to go.

64
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:26,782
Yeah.

65
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:27,850
I'm just saying--
I'm just saying, okay--

66
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,453
Five o'clock, mister,

67
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,538
we're going to have
a roundtable discussion.

68
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,141
Do me a favour.

69
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,742
Do me a favour. Do me a favour.

70
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,461
--you guys need to
help me out a little.

71
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,478
Give me a call at work.
Give me a call at work.

72
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,481
We're going to-- we're going to
have a bite to eat.

73
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,948
We'll grab some lunch.

74
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,083
We'll grab a newspaper.

75
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,685
We'll go look at some
apartments,

76
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,988
and we'll have you in a new
place by the end of the week.

77
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,658
Okay, just as long as you're
paying for the lunch, because--

78
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,360
Wow, man.

79
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:52,997
Now, you guys.

80
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,832
You can push each other's
buttons like no one,

81
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,034
birds of a feather.

82
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:02,139
I'm fine. I thought we had a
good situation, but obviously--

83
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,475
We have a good situation.
But let's not make it a bad one.

84
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:06,910
That's what we're saying.

85
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,479
We're going to help you out
for the first--

86
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,014
for the first couple
of years, okay?

87
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,815
We will help you out.

88
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:13,417
I'm not saying that we're
going to pay 100 percent,

89
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:14,652
but we will help you out.

90
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:16,588
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

91
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,491
We're going to meet here. I'm
going to pick up some pizzas,

92
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:20,324
and then we're going to sit
and have a nice discussion.

93
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:21,694
But I have to go.

94
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:23,160
I mean, if you guys are willing
to help me out, I'm cool.

95
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,428
Yeah.

96
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:25,898
Okay?
Yeah.

97
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:27,264
We still love you, man.
It's not to, you know--

98
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,568
I know.

99
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:31,135
Okay, have a good one today.
Okay?

100
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,205
Okay.

101
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:33,205
Give me a call at work.

102
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:34,707
Be safe.

103
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:11,063
(Radio chattering)

104
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,225
There you go, enjoy.

105
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,358
Hey, how are you doing?

106
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,628
Good, man.

107
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,762
A double espresso macchiato
with extra foam.

108
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:43,599
Sure, that will be $4.50.

109
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:49,223
There you go.
Thanks, man.

110
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,961
Extra foam, man.

111
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:57,848
You got it.

112
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:05,907
There you go.

113
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:08,009
That's not what I ordered, man.

114
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,778
Yeah, it is.

115
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,647
That's not a macchiato.
There's no foam in there at all.

116
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:14,048
Yeah, there is.
There's some right there.

117
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:15,216
No, no, no.

118
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,051
No, a lot of foam,
a lot of foam.

119
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:19,788
Dude, look,
this is like half milk.

120
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,191
That's not a macchiato.

121
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,192
Look, there's--
there's foam in there.

122
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:28,063
There you go, more foam.

123
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:30,367
Yeah, but take-- take some of
the milk out of it, man.

124
00:09:30,368 --> 00:09:31,434
I'm not taking any
of the milk out.

125
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:33,703
That's a perfectly good
macchiato.

126
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:34,838
Give me back my money, man.

127
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:35,838
I'm not giving you--

128
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,873
Give me back my money.

129
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:38,309
I'm not giving you
your money back.

130
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,743
Just take your coffee.

131
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:41,344
I'm not paying for something
that I didn't order, man.

132
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:42,479
Give me back my money.

133
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,216
I make the best
coffees in this town.

134
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,349
Take your coffee and go.

135
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,950
I don't give a f--
what you make, bro.

136
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,904
But I didn't-- I didn't order
this, so I don't want it.

137
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:50,305
I don't care.

138
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,840
That's a good coffee.
Take it.

139
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,010
You know, just take it and shove
it up your ass, all right?

140
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,434
Fucking idiot, man.

141
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:11,260
Hey, man, you don't want
to give me back my $4.50?

142
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:14,148
You don't want to give
me back my $4.50?

143
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,149
No.

144
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:16,150
No?

145
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:18,153
No.

146
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:20,889
All right, man.

147
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,623
Here, take a--

148
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,860
take a fucking roll while you're
going out the door.

149
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:30,882
Fuck.

150
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:33,786
(Radio chattering)

151
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,324
Bill!

152
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:55,126
Bill!

153
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:56,126
Bill!

154
00:10:58,597 --> 00:11:00,064
Bill!
Yeah, what?

155
00:11:00,065 --> 00:11:02,216
Come on. Your lunch has been
over like 15 minutes ago.

156
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:03,902
What do you mean? I took my
lunch break 15 minutes ago.

157
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:06,955
Bill, take the mask off.
I've got tons of cars in there,

158
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,792
and you're wasting
time on this van?

159
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,760
All right?

160
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:12,644
I already finished
three cars today, Jim.

161
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,947
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Three cars?

162
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:18,452
Come on. Get in there.

163
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:20,820
Okay, the clock says work, work.

164
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,990
Okay, you should check
your clocks, though.

165
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:25,175
Maybe I should clock you, eh?

166
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:32,915
I don't think you should treat
your best worker like that, Jim.

167
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,184
Bill, just get in there and make
some money for us, okay?

168
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,337
How about a raise?

169
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:37,606
Yeah, Bill?
Why don't you fuck off?

170
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:38,606
Nine bucks.

171
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,541
Yeah, nine bucks.

172
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:03,249
That's it, yeah. Right.

173
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,251
It's all prepped and ready.

174
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,890
RADIO:
The stresses from war do not
make a man do this.

175
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:28,577
What makes a man do this are
shame and rage.

176
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:30,696
(Singing)
What do you do when
the sun sets?

177
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,965
Gonna get down
when the sun sets.

178
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:34,134
Yeah!

179
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:36,169
Late.

180
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,638
Sorry, I'm late.

181
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,040
The funniest thing is that you
and this piece of shit--

182
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,243
only you would do a burn out

183
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:44,611
coming into a
shit hole like this.

184
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:46,314
Yeah, it's $300.

185
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,066
I know you've got to work for
six months to make that, but...

186
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,689
Hey, I got you a present.

187
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,923
Why? What the fuck, man?

188
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,291
Read up.

189
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,427
Listen, by the way, you've got
to stop having these things

190
00:12:58,428 --> 00:12:59,628
sent to my fucking house, man.

191
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,395
Yes, these are
the last ones, man.

192
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:03,330
Yeah, but my dad
is getting pissed, okay?

193
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:05,434
And what the fuck is in this?

194
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,136
What did he say?

195
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:08,804
He was asking what it was.

196
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,506
What did you tell him?

197
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:11,907
To mind his own
fucking business.

198
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:15,344
Good, good.

199
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:17,263
No one can know.
It's a surprise.

200
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,965
Piece of shit.
Watch your head.

201
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:24,654
Fuck. Yeah!

202
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,356
Let's go eat.

203
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:28,024
Do you really want
to fucking eat

204
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,560
in this shit hole Chicken Den
piece of shit?

205
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:32,947
This is America, man.
This is what we eat, okay?

206
00:13:32,948 --> 00:13:33,949
I love it.

207
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,183
Dude, Chicken Den?

208
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:36,284
Do you know what they do with
these animals?

209
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:37,586
It's all-American.
This is America, baby.

210
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:38,804
They sit in cages,
sitting in their shit all day.

211
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:42,323
You're such a fucking prick.

212
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:43,457
How are you doing?

213
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,226
Welcome to Chicken Den.
How may I help you?

214
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:47,029
Give me, uh...

215
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,598
Give me the four-piece,

216
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,100
a four-piece mixed meat.

217
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,101
Do you want the combo?

218
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:53,570
Combo.

219
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:57,274
Fuck.

220
00:13:57,275 --> 00:14:01,879
A salad, a garden salad.

221
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,548
A four-piece combo?
Hi, sorry.

222
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,082
A four-piece combo,
you said?

223
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,217
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

224
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,637
You're just gonna have salad?

225
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:11,171
Draw cartoon chickens
saying, "Eat me."

226
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:12,472
$10.70, please.

227
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:13,474
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,552
How is your day, love?

229
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:24,387
Perfect. How is yours?

230
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,872
Sunshine and rainbows.

231
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:32,612
A combo and a salad.

232
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:34,181
She seem a little bit
pissed off, huh?

233
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:36,049
Yeah.
Thank you.

234
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,050
High-five.

235
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,419
Don't leave me hanging.

236
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,457
This is a fresh, fresh salad.

237
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,793
I'll bet they went out and
picked it this morning.

238
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:49,498
That looks disgusting.

239
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:52,233
Your salad probably has bugs
crawling all over it.

240
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:55,336
Dude, move this.

241
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:56,503
You're going to knock
it off the fucking edge.

242
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:58,206
So tomorrow, 1:00.

243
00:14:58,207 --> 00:14:59,541
Yeah. Tomorrow, 1:00.

244
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,110
Paintball, right?
No problems with work?

245
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:02,945
Dude, I've got to call in sick.

246
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,180
You haven't done that yet?

247
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:06,783
Well, dude, I have
to call it on the day.

248
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:08,251
I'm not going to
call today and say,

249
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,353
"Listen, tomorrow I'm not going
to be in, because I'm sick."

250
00:15:10,354 --> 00:15:12,590
I talked to you about
this two weeks ago.

251
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,157
Yeah, I have to call in
tomorrow.

252
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:15,559
I said, you said--

253
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,360
Can I have the tray?

254
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:18,996
I took the day off work too.
We have to play.

255
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:21,432
Holy shit!

256
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,435
Crap!

257
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:28,339
Would you get me a napkin?

258
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,506
Like, she didn't even say
anything.

259
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:30,743
She didn't go, "I'm sorry."

260
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:31,960
No like, "I'm sorry."

261
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:34,164
Hi!
You brought napkins.

262
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:36,800
No, no. We'll probably need
like-- I don't know-- a mop.

263
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:38,033
Are you going to apologize?

264
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:39,502
I mean, you fucking got
this shit all over us.

265
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:40,937
Look, I'm sorry.

266
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:42,104
I'm laughing because you got it
on him, and he's a prick.

267
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:44,139
Could you
get me more chicken,

268
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,275
because this is right
all over the place.

269
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:46,210
Yeah, I'll make that.

270
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,326
What's your problem?

271
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:48,327
I don't have a problem.
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,779
Is there something
wrong with you?

273
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,931
Look, I'll get
this replaced. That's fine.

274
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:52,432
She's upset with her life.

275
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,268
Jesus!

276
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,186
Can I get my money back?

277
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,871
Look, I'll get you more stuff,

278
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,173
but I'm not giving
you your money back.

279
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,307
I don't want more stuff.

280
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,509
I'm sorry I dumped stuff on you,

281
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,775
but I'll just have
it replaced, okay?

282
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,246
Lady!

283
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:06,014
It's okay.

284
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,448
Do you have a manager?

285
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:08,818
Hey, it's okay. It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

286
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,986
Hold on. No, no, no.
Do you have a manager?

287
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:13,355
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
It will dry.

288
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:16,591
This is why I don't want to eat
in these fucking places, man.

289
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:17,861
Look at this shit.

290
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:18,994
Do you think she likes it?

291
00:16:18,995 --> 00:16:20,832
Dude, do you think that I like

292
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:24,568
having whatever-the-fuck this
kind of salad is,

293
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:29,139
this salad dressing,
extra ranch?

294
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,375
Is this quality service?

295
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:32,643
Hello? Hello?

296
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:39,234
Yeah, don't forget
the tray, right?

297
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:44,306
That's great. It's all clean.

298
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,474
Thank you.

299
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:47,574
Like, take this guy.

300
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,928
You see him walking
down the street?

301
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:51,613
Smile on his face.

302
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:54,500
He's got nice clothes on.

303
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,502
What's he doing? What do you
think he does?

304
00:16:56,503 --> 00:17:00,072
I don't know. What's he do?

305
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:02,042
Maybe a banker.

306
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,611
He's delirious, though.

307
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:06,714
Maybe a travelling salesman?

308
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:09,316
He's delirious, why?

309
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:10,917
That guy helps to
wreck the economy.

310
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:12,586
He helps to wreck the world.

311
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:16,925
He eats in Styrofoam
fucking cups.

312
00:17:16,926 --> 00:17:19,060
He's terrible, delirious.

313
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:21,462
That's not what the world needs.

314
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,316
What does the world need?

315
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:25,150
The world needs change, man.

316
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:27,119
What kind of change?

317
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,023
Who is going to do it?

318
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:32,424
Dude, the problem is--

319
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:34,258
As one person,
what could you do?

320
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:36,028
--that this fucking world grows

321
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:38,147
by like 70 million people a
year. That's the problem.

322
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:40,417
There's too many people.

323
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,385
And so our natural resources
are running out.

324
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:44,821
And no one, and no one--
look, we have trains.

325
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:47,824
We have-- we have cars,
tons of cars

326
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,794
that are just burning up gas and
making this place disgusting.

327
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:52,264
We've got a hole in the ozone.

328
00:17:52,265 --> 00:17:54,332
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

329
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,303
You have chicken that looks
like-- yeah, of course, man.

330
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:59,103
It's just disgusting.
That's all.

331
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:01,138
It's just absolutely
fucking sick.

332
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:03,175
It makes me just sick.

333
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:05,745
But what are you supposed
to do, stop living?

334
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:07,964
There's two kinds of people--
leavers and takers.

335
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:11,984
And the leavers coexist.

336
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:14,820
We need people that coexist.

337
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,124
And the takers is the
society of the world.

338
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,527
The takers is the
people that fucking--

339
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:25,466
that just, like, drive
Ferraris not caring.

340
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:26,985
Because people
have to make money.

341
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:28,886
No, people don't
have to make money.

342
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:30,388
People have to make money.

343
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:31,855
That's the thing. That's what
I'm talking about, man.

344
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:33,491
People don't have to.

345
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:35,161
That's the thing that society
drills in your head

346
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,963
over and over and over since
you've been fucking 5-years-old

347
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:38,663
that you have to have
a big bank account.

348
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:39,998
You have to make a lot of money.
You have to have a fast car.

349
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,867
It makes life a lot easier,
doesn't it?

350
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,202
Dude, but what happens--

351
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,439
Would you want to be poor?
Do you want to be poor?

352
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,973
Do you want to have no money?

353
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:50,010
You keep going down this road.
Do you know where it's going?

354
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:51,778
So you just think just keep
going down the reckless path,

355
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,198
just fucking-- pile straight
ahead, because there's no--

356
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,366
We're all just fucked.

357
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,633
What's the point?

358
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:57,867
That's the most pessimistic
point of view

359
00:18:57,868 --> 00:18:59,269
I've ever heard in my life.

360
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,956
You're a prodigy of the world,
my son, a prodigy of the world.

361
00:19:02,957 --> 00:19:04,624
You're all talk, buddy.
You're all talk.

362
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,511
Oh, snap.

363
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,981
All talk?

364
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,514
All talk, no action.

365
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,765
That's helping. I stood on my
feet all day today.

366
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:45,369
Not to change the subject,
but when is dinner?

367
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,771
No-- hi.

368
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:49,407
Hey, hey, hey.

369
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:50,442
Yeah?

370
00:19:50,443 --> 00:19:52,194
No phone call?

371
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:53,395
Sorry.

372
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:54,414
Where have you been?

373
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:55,515
What are you guys doing?

374
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:56,581
What do you mean,
what have we been doing?

375
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:57,983
We've been waiting for you?

376
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:00,201
Remember, we had this meeting
planned, right?

377
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:01,202
I was going to pick up pizza--

378
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,505
How long is
it going to take?

379
00:20:02,506 --> 00:20:04,941
Oh, come on.

380
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:08,145
It's just going to
take as long as it takes.

381
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:12,014
No, no, no, no.
Can we do it tomorrow morning?

382
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:14,751
I've got some very exciting
news for you guys,

383
00:20:14,752 --> 00:20:18,938
and I actually ate at the
Chicken Den--

384
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,708
Oh, come on, Bill.

385
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,109
We organized this.

386
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,211
I know.

387
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:24,781
We talked about it this
morning, remember?

388
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:26,882
It was like nine hours ago.

389
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,216
Tomorrow--
Oh, jeez.

390
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:29,617
We'll talk about
it at breakfast,

391
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:32,354
and I've got very, very exciting
news for you guys, okay?

392
00:20:32,355 --> 00:20:34,656
Okay, are you going to
be on time for once?

393
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:35,723
Yes, on time.

394
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:36,859
That's exciting news.

395
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,927
Okay, well, I will make a
special breakfast.

396
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:42,331
No-- no coping out this time.

397
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:43,983
No, absolutely, I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

398
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,218
You promise?

399
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:47,988
Promise. Good night, guys.

400
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:51,493
Wow, I kind of figured
that would happen.

401
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:53,660
Yeah, that's typical.

402
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:58,099
That's typical, every,
every time.

403
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,950
Why is he resisting
this so much?

404
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:01,118
I don't know.

405
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:03,588
Do you think he's hiding
something? Is he okay?

406
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:05,624
I just think he's--

407
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:07,959
(Newscasters overlapping)
...Psychiatrist Michelle Histow
has a theory about Kyle.

408
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,581
When I saw him, he had already
murdered seven people.

409
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:15,818
Our work is gripping and
unpredictable.

410
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:19,555
This is not the way
conventional psychiatry works.

411
00:21:19,556 --> 00:21:22,425
Up next, an interview with
Michelle Histow.

412
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,425
We have the right to drive
whenever, wherever,

413
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:11,161
and whatever we want, but we
need to understand the effects

414
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:12,595
of the carbon footprint

415
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,064
and realize the
environmental damage

416
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:15,850
cars are causing
to our planet.

417
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,270
Al Qaeda is all over Iraq.

418
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:19,737
The administration
of the U.S. president

419
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,674
will likely
double the bounty on...

420
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:23,409
The BTK killer has confessed

421
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,177
to killing 10 people and
tonight...

422
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,311
The United States will deploy
30,000 additional troops...

423
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:31,783
EVAN:
The global population grows by
over 70 million people a year.

424
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,486
At the same time, our natural
resources are dwindling--

425
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,588
coal oil, gas, water.

426
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,623
Okay, and with the development
of the third world

427
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,226
we're just creating a ticking
time bomb,

428
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:42,830
and even though we know that
forests are essential

429
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:46,984
to reducing carbon emissions,
we continue to cut them down,

430
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:51,689
whether it's for housing,
farming, alternative energy,

431
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,390
or just useless furniture

432
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:56,461
instead of truly getting
together and fighting

433
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,682
for something, fighting
against global warming,

434
00:22:59,683 --> 00:23:03,252
against political
and social unrest.

435
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:06,256
Our politicians are using the
same lame band-aid techniques

436
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:09,609
up for re-elections,
over and over.

437
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,845
What we need is change.

438
00:23:11,846 --> 00:23:13,679
We can't stand
for this anymore.

439
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,198
Any why do we accept this?

440
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,668
Because we're a society
built on wants.

441
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:19,903
Not needs.

442
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:22,139
What are we taught
to want from childhood?

443
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,607
Hmm? Big bank accounts.

444
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:29,247
Fast cars, plasma screen TVs,
liposuction.

445
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,615
Okay, facelifts.

446
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:32,417
Does this help anyone? No.

447
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:35,219
What is this? This is ego.

448
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:38,323
This doesn't help the world.

449
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:40,426
We need to bind together.

450
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:41,860
We don't need to be
individuals.

451
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:46,816
We need to become whole as a
country, as world.

452
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:49,686
We need someone who
will stand for something.

453
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:52,923
We need someone who
believes in what they say

454
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:55,409
and believes in actions
changing the way

455
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,043
that we view our world.

456
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:35,451
We can't survive with our
politicians focusing their time

457
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:37,421
on fighting religious wars,

458
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:41,058
fighting over control
of natural resources.

459
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:44,228
Can anyone do this?

460
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:46,730
Well, I don't know.

461
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:48,599
Do you have any thoughts?

462
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:54,673
We're so precious, aren't we?

463
00:24:54,674 --> 00:24:56,609
Everyone has got to live.

464
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,045
Everyone has got to be happy.

465
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:01,913
It's a joke.

466
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,650
It's an absolute joke.

467
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,668
Humanity can't survive
over the next 100 years.

468
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,169
The facts don't lie.

469
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,772
We need someone who will
stand for something.

470
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:13,060
We need someone who
believes in what they say

471
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,963
and believes in action,
believes in positive action.

472
00:25:15,964 --> 00:25:20,768
It's an absolute joke.

473
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,772
Evan, that's what
you didn't get.

474
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,306
That's what you didn't get.

475
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:27,742
You think people are equal.
They're not.

476
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:30,828
They're not.

477
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:42,407

...just like President Richard
Nixon did to the Vietnamese

479

back in the late '60s--

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,663
Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda,

481
00:26:01,664 --> 00:26:03,865
these people are out
to kill us. People don't--

482
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,633
All of these things
contribute

483
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:08,003
to the problem of
overpopulation.

484
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:09,605
People don't comprehend
the danger

485
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:12,174
that this country
creates for the world.

486
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:15,010
If just 15 millilitres is
released and becomes airborne,

487
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,012
this chemical could kill a
million people.

488
00:26:17,013 --> 00:26:19,950
--About society and people
in the humanitarian sense.

489
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,183
We need to changes
to protect the--

490
00:26:27,442 --> 00:26:28,826
Thessalonians 3:10 says,

491
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:32,145
"For even when we are with you,
this we commanded you,

492
00:26:32,146 --> 00:26:35,882
that if any would not work,
neither should he eat."

493
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:38,670
The global population grows by
over 70 million people a year.

494
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:50,366
And why do we accept this?

495
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:53,102
Because we're a society
built on wants.

496
00:26:53,103 --> 00:26:55,537
Not needs. What are we taught
to want from childhood?

497
00:26:55,538 --> 00:26:57,139
Hmm?

498
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,241
Big bank accounts.

499
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:02,393
Fast cars, plasma screen TVs,
liposuction.

500
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:03,863
Okay, facelifts.

501
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:05,464
Does this help anyone? No.

502
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:07,484
What is this? This is ego.

503
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:09,787
We need someone who
will stand for something.

504
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:13,024
We need someone who
believes in what they say

505
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:17,227
and believes in action,
believes in positive action

506
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:19,046
and changing the way
that we look at things,

507
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:22,217
changing the way that
we view our world.

508
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:23,886
BILL:
So that's what I'll do.

509
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:25,019
My name is Evan Drince.

510
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,022
Why not?

511
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,994
Bill?

512
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:34,379
Breakfast is ready, Bill.

513
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:38,286
What?

514
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:40,054
I said breakfast!

515
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:42,289
I'll be up in 15 minutes!
I'm working out!

516
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,855
Good morning, honey.

517
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,923
Morning.
That smells really good.

518
00:27:57,924 --> 00:27:59,724
I'm glad we're actually having a
nice breakfast together,

519
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:02,578
because yesterday
was a bit tense.

520
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:05,446
Well, you guys dropped a--
dropped a bomb on me.

521
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:07,782
I know, but I feel like--

522
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:10,419
I think we've reached some
kind of agreement, right?

523
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:13,172
And today, what I'm
going to do for you guys

524
00:28:13,173 --> 00:28:16,426
is that I'm going
to be proactive.

525
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:19,146
And today, I'm going to stay in.
I've got the day off.

526
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:21,232
I'm going to fill out some
college applications,

527
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,399
and I'm thinking--

528
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,136
What did my ears just hear?

529
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:29,240
That I'm going to fill out some
college applications,

530
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,275
mechanical engineer.

531
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,276
Honey!

532
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,612
Who kidnapped our son?

533
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:35,380
What's going on?
That's fantastic!

534
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,947
Yeah, it makes sense, right?

535
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,117
Okay, you know, I--

536
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:39,685
That's fantastic. Good job.

537
00:28:39,686 --> 00:28:41,288
So are you guys happy?

538
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:44,022
I've got to say
I'm really proud of you.

539
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,458
Uh-huh.

540
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,192
Well, I think it's
about time, right?

541
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:50,696
I think our little talk maybe
got in there somewhere, huh?

542
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:55,051
You guys kicked my little
tushie out the door.

543
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:56,353
With love.

544
00:28:56,354 --> 00:28:58,055
Absolutely.

545
00:28:58,056 --> 00:28:59,005
You know what?
Here's the thing.

546
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:00,541
You're going to feel better
about yourself

547
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,342
once you have, like, goals.

548
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,579
I know. I do have goals, Mom.

549
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,379
Look, I've got to go.

550
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,384
We'll talk about
it more later.

551
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:09,384
Okay, chin up.

552
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:10,951
Okay. Bye, Dad.

553
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:12,303
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

554
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:14,873
Okay, we'll talk at dinner.

555
00:29:14,874 --> 00:29:15,940
I'm really, really
proud of you.

556
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:17,441
I think what you're
going to feel

557
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:21,881
is that you have goals in life
now and a direction.

558
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:22,883
Right.

559
00:29:22,884 --> 00:29:24,149
Yeah.

560
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,787
Yeah, I woke up today
feeling enthusiastic.

561
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:31,290
My little boy,
he's growing up.

562
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,209
Come here.

563
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:37,748
It's out of love that we kick
your bum-- your bum.

564
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:39,182
Sorry about the language.

565
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:40,767
Have a good day at work, okay?

566
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:43,487
I will, sweetheart.
I'm very excited for you,

567
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:45,489
and I want to see how this turns
out with the applications.

568
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,657
Okay.
Okay.

569
00:29:46,658 --> 00:29:47,657
I'll see you tonight.

570
00:29:47,658 --> 00:29:48,660
Bye, honey.

571
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,663
All right.

572
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:55,066
BILL:
Evan, you think
people are equal.

573
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:58,586
They're not. They're not.

574
00:29:58,587 --> 00:30:00,956
Evan, Evan, Evan, Evan.

575
00:30:00,957 --> 00:30:04,326
You're such an idiot.

576
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:07,430
They're like a drop in a bucket.

577
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:11,284
I just poured the bucket out.

578
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:14,722
Yeah, you couldn't do anything.

579
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:18,092
All you could do is talk--
meaningless.

580
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:20,961
Do anything.

581
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:24,865
Well, I guess I did.

582
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,201
(Newscasters overlapping)
...shot about five or six
times and everybody...

583
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,037
...most of the shooting right
here at this location

584
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,256
where most of the
bullet casings are...

585
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:33,491
BILL:
In nature, there's
survival of the fittest.

586
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:36,411
What separates us
from the animals?

587
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:39,364
It's our consciousness.

588
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:41,100
It's our ego.

589
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:43,236
It's our sense of self...

590
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:47,205
So, all of a sudden, we care
about ourselves too much.

591
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:50,477
We care about our
fellow man too much.

592
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:55,817
We have to do anything that
we can to keep them alive.

593
00:30:55,818 --> 00:30:58,753
You know, the animals
just want to eat.

594
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:02,339
They just want to eat.

595
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,342
They'll kill you
so they can eat.

596
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:14,853
EVAN:
Can anyone do this?

597
00:31:14,854 --> 00:31:16,855
I don't know.

598
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:19,157
Do you have any thoughts?

599
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:30,587
BILL:
Let's face it.

600
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:35,392
If we could just kill everybody,

601
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,431
you know, in the third world,

602
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:42,401
people with cancer, you know,

603
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,305
people that are sucking up
our resources,

604
00:31:45,306 --> 00:31:47,239
maybe we could survive.

605
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,606
(Voices overlapping)
The Bible says
we must not kill.

606
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,709
The bible says we must not
commit adultery.

607
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,177
...Most of the shooting right
here at this location

608
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,345
where most of the bullet
casings are,

609
00:31:53,346 --> 00:31:54,680
and then ran off
in that direction

610
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:56,115
while still shooting...

611
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:59,854
Survival of the fittest is
really, is a real theory.

612
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:03,789
That's a way to create balance.

613
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,291
I don't believe in god.

614
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:09,130
I believe in what I see,
the pain and suffering I see.

615
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:10,697
I believe that when I go out in
the street

616
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:12,265
and I see a mother who can't
feed her child...

617
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:15,368
Described as a loner who never
fit in with his classmates...

618
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,337
Couldn't do anything.

619
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:20,008
All you could do was talk...
Meaningless.

620
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:30,085

Don't forget Bingo at
Tenderville Bingo Hall.

622
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,071
Now back to the local news...

EVAN:
The world needs change, man.

624
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:34,388
BILL:
What kind of change?
Who's going to do it? You?

625
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:41,698
How long is it going to take?

626
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:45,617
EVAN:
Can anyone do this?

627
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:47,086
I don't know.

628
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:49,905
Do you have any thoughts?

629
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:12,949
All talk, no action.

630
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,212
Start up.

631
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,463
(Engine starting)

632
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,716
Here we go.

633
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:49,621
Jesus.

634
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:50,855
Oh, fuck.

635
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,774
(Crashing)

636
00:35:21,189 --> 00:35:23,290
Come out with your hands up!

637
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:28,981
Open the back.

638
00:35:28,982 --> 00:35:30,982
Whoa...

639
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:36,754
(Explosion)

640
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:37,789

You're scared as shit, huh?

653
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:00,277
Here we go.

654
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:01,278
Please...

655
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:15,978
(Screaming)

656
00:39:33,847 --> 00:39:45,209
¶

657
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,984
Hey, man, how are you?

658
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,571
Oh, hey, man,
you remember me?

659
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,056
Uh...

660
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:06,681
Why don't you make me
a double espresso macchiato

661
00:41:06,682 --> 00:41:08,417
with extra foam?

662
00:41:08,418 --> 00:41:09,652
You got it.

663
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:10,954
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

664
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:13,105
Why don't you make it like
your life depends on it?

665
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,945
With extra foam!

666
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:31,042
You like to take your sweet
fucking time, don't you?

667
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:33,077
There you go.

668
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:45,908
Why is this so difficult?

669
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:50,662
I mean, how hard can it be?

670
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:51,580
I'm going to give you
five seconds

671
00:41:51,581 --> 00:41:52,916
to get the fuck out of here.

672
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,284
I'm going to start counting
right now.

673
00:41:55,285 --> 00:41:56,519
One...

674
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,888
Are you serious?

675
00:41:57,889 --> 00:42:01,490
Yeah, yeah!
I'm pretty fucking serious!

676
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:03,659
One...

677

Two... hurry up, motherfucker!

678
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:08,365
Run, Forrest!

679
00:42:08,366 --> 00:42:10,852
Now you're getting it!

680
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:12,854
Five, bitch!

681
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:37,764
TV:
Again, we are strongly advising
people to stay inside,

682
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:41,469
as early reports indicate that
chaos in downtown Tenderville

683
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,337
is caused by a
heavily-armed individual

684
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:46,706
firing randomly
at innocent bystanders.

685
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:50,243
Hello, beautiful ladies.

686
00:42:50,244 --> 00:42:51,244
(Gunshot)

687
00:42:51,245 --> 00:42:53,314
(Screaming)

688
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:54,882
Whoa, hold on a minute.

689
00:42:54,883 --> 00:42:56,817
No, calm down. No, no.

690
00:42:56,818 --> 00:43:01,490
You get over there.
You get over there.

691
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:04,826
Hey, ladies. Out of the kitchen.

692
00:43:04,827 --> 00:43:06,494
Go join your pretty friends.

693
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:07,696
You too.

694
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:09,763
Come on.

695
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:11,366
Let's go.

696
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:13,536
There you go. Come on.

697
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:14,704
You too, Blondie.

698
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:17,607
Who else is here?

699
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:18,908
There's no one else here.

700
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:19,909
No one?

701
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:20,910
It's just us here.

702
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:22,513
What about this door?

703
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:23,780
Come on, ladies.

704
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:25,782
Come over here. Get down.

705
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:43,469
It gets so hot in this thing.

706
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:54,262
I have my cell phone here.

707
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:07,294
(Ladies whimpering)

708
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,698
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp,
chirp, chirp, chirp...

709
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:20,241
I've got--
I've got two kids at home.

710
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:22,209
I've got a husband.
I've got--

711
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,045
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp,
chirp, chirp, chirp...

712
00:44:24,047 --> 00:44:27,033
Please! Let us go!
What is it you...

713
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,121
I feel nauseous.

714
00:44:58,318 --> 00:44:59,919
Come on...

715
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:01,488

716
00:45:01,489 --> 00:45:05,390
Shh...

717
00:45:05,391 --> 00:45:07,225
Oh, my God!

718
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:14,100
Is everybody okay?

719
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:16,571
What a fucking dickhead!

720
00:45:16,572 --> 00:45:18,540
Are you guys okay?

721
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,740
Holy shit!

722
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:21,375
Oh, my God! Does anybody have--

723
00:45:21,376 --> 00:45:24,277
Where's the phone?

724
00:45:24,278 --> 00:45:28,884
(Screaming)

725
00:45:28,885 --> 00:45:31,186

Please!

730
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:41,781
BILL:
I don't know why I did that.

731
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:45,986
Maybe I shouldn't
have taken off my mask.

732
00:45:45,987 --> 00:45:48,889
Please, don't do it. Please!

733
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,240

Everyone is out there.
What are you doing in here?

810
00:52:21,949 --> 00:52:24,218
Get the fuck out here! Come on!

811
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:26,088
Come on!

812
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:28,189
What do I want?
What do you think I want?

813
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,192
Money.

814
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:30,594
Come on,
quick.
Money, money.

815
00:52:30,595 --> 00:52:32,695
Money? Oh, you're
a smart one, genius.

816
00:52:32,696 --> 00:52:33,696
Get in the back!

817
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:34,730
It's in the safe.

818
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:36,031
Where? In the safe? Go!

819
00:52:36,032 --> 00:52:37,400
I don't have the key.
I don't have the key.

820
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:38,701
You don't have the fucking key?
Where is the fucking key?

821
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:39,703
In my office.

822
00:52:39,704 --> 00:52:41,387
Go get it.

823
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:43,356
Don't fuck around!

824
00:52:43,357 --> 00:52:47,361
You, you work here or do you
just dress like an idiot?

825
00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:49,664
Empty the registers, fuck face.

826
00:52:49,665 --> 00:52:51,465
Empty the registers.

827
00:52:51,466 --> 00:52:52,867
You look like a fucking idiot
when you're scared,

828
00:52:52,868 --> 00:52:54,769
you know that?

829
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,471
I have the key.
I've got the key!

830
00:52:57,472 --> 00:53:00,942
Come here!
Come here!

831
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:03,312
Hurry up!

832
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:08,066
Open the safe. Open the safe.

833
00:53:08,067 --> 00:53:10,452
Hurry up. What are you,
retarded?

834
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,597
Give me-- give me the bag.
Give me the bag.

835
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,036
Keep it.

836
00:53:29,357 --> 00:53:32,059
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

837
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,996
Bro, calm down.

838
00:53:34,997 --> 00:53:37,082
Calm down, all right?

839
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:39,017
Everything is going to be okay.

840
00:53:39,018 --> 00:53:40,001
I'm not going to kill you.

841
00:53:40,002 --> 00:53:43,922
I don't know why I'm not.

842
00:53:43,923 --> 00:53:46,758
Is this your first time?

843
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:50,263
Is this your
first time?

844
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:52,698
What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

845
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:54,683
What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

846
00:53:54,684 --> 00:53:56,687
Punch in the code!

847
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:00,892
I got it! I got it!

848
00:54:00,893 --> 00:54:02,425
There you go.
There it is.

849
00:54:02,426 --> 00:54:04,312
Fill it up.

850
00:54:07,832 --> 00:54:11,035
(Laughing)

851
00:54:11,036 --> 00:54:12,569
You see? You see?

852
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:14,406
It's money.

853
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:17,443
It's about as
worthless as you are.

854
00:54:17,444 --> 00:54:18,477
Hurry up.

855
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:19,678
I'm hurrying.

856
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:20,480
Hurry up.

857
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:22,698
Please, just don't shoot.

858
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:26,151
That's it. That's all of it.

859
00:54:26,152 --> 00:54:28,771
Give me the fucking bag.
Stay there.

860
00:54:28,772 --> 00:54:30,172
Thank you.
Pinhead.

861
00:54:54,315 --> 00:54:57,452
Your fucking money
doesn't mean anything,

862
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:59,722
because all you use it for

863
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:03,260
is stupid and senseless shit!

864
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:06,096
What is he doing out there?

865
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:18,942
Say goodbye!

866
00:55:24,683 --> 00:55:26,150
Lock the door!

867
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:29,087
Have a nice day!

868
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:40,299
Just stay inside.

869
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,745
RADIO:
Once again,
please stay indoors.

870
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:25,414
Do not go outside
until local authorities

871
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,417
have told you that
it's safe to.

872
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,355
Sheriff Malvoy.

873
00:56:47,356 --> 00:56:49,892
The blaze is keeping all
available fire trucks

874
00:56:49,893 --> 00:56:52,161
and fire-fighters
extremely busy

875
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:55,664
with no news on any survivors
in the collapsed building.

876
00:57:04,008 --> 00:57:07,812
...individual went amok in the
downtown shopping district,

877
00:57:07,813 --> 00:57:11,515
seemingly killing random people
without motive or reason.

878
00:57:11,516 --> 00:57:13,716
I don't know how this
could happen here,

879
00:57:13,718 --> 00:57:15,486
or anywhere, for that matter.

880
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:22,143
Tenderville? Tenderville,
this is Sheriff Malvoy.

881
00:57:22,144 --> 00:57:24,145
Come back.

882
00:57:26,682 --> 00:57:28,467
Tenderville,
this is Sheriff Malvoy.

883
00:57:28,468 --> 00:57:31,335
Clark and Bradley has been
robbed by an armed assailant.

884
00:57:31,336 --> 00:57:33,640
We're heading back into town on
Cross Road.

885
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:35,409
30 minutes out. Over.

886
00:57:38,897 --> 00:57:40,680
What the hell is going on, Ray?

887
00:57:44,686 --> 00:57:46,420
RADIO:
Again, please be advised

888
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,357
of the location of a suspected

890
00:57:50,825 --> 00:57:53,027
Therefore, we still
strongly recommend

891
00:57:53,028 --> 00:57:55,028
that everyone stays indoors.

892
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:00,369
MOM:
Oh, honey. Hi, sweetheart.
Are you okay?

893
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,737
Hey, Mom. Yeah, I'm okay.

894
00:58:01,738 --> 00:58:03,672
Do you know what's
going on right now?

895
00:58:03,673 --> 00:58:05,641
You haven't--
you haven't seen anything?

896
00:58:05,642 --> 00:58:06,875
What happened?

897
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:08,211
No, turn on the
television, Honey.

898
00:58:08,212 --> 00:58:10,278
There's, I guess,
one guy, they think,

899
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:11,780
killing people all over town.

900
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:12,781
What do you mean?

901
00:58:12,782 --> 00:58:13,782
Yes, yes! Killing people!

902
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:14,784
What do you mean
he killed people?

903
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:16,052
It's crazy, but you're fine.

904
00:58:16,053 --> 00:58:17,520
You're at home working
on your stuff, right?

905
00:58:17,521 --> 00:58:19,189
I'm fine. I'm just--
I'm at home. Where are you?

906
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:22,660
I'm watching it on the news at
work, and it's terrible.

907
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:25,261
You're at work?
You're going to stay there?

908
00:58:25,262 --> 00:58:26,530
No, I don't think so.

909
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:28,031
You're not going to come home?

910
00:58:28,032 --> 00:58:29,567
No, not just yet, sweetheart.

911
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:31,302
I'm going to go meet your dad,
and we're going to wait there.

912
00:58:31,303 --> 00:58:32,871
Okay, when are you
going to be back?

913
00:58:32,872 --> 00:58:34,272
Well, sweetheart, as soon
as we can get there, okay?

914
00:58:34,273 --> 00:58:35,539
Just please stay safe.

915
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,808
Okay, I'll be back--
I'll be here.

916
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:38,576
Sorry, honey,
you're breaking up.

917
00:58:38,577 --> 00:58:40,711
I'll be back--
I mean, I'll be here.

918
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:42,881
Yes, stay there, okay?

919
00:58:42,882 --> 00:58:44,950
Sweetie, I love you.
Please be safe, okay?

920
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:46,351
Okay, stay safe.

921
00:58:46,352 --> 00:58:48,621
All right, baby. I love you.
Bye-bye.

Yeah, where are you?

930
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,460
I'm running some
errands right now, man.

931
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:41,862
What errands?

932
00:59:41,863 --> 00:59:43,547
I'm coming right now, Bro.
Don't go anywhere, okay?

933
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:45,082
Yeah, I'm not going.

934
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:46,984
Don't go anywhere. I'm getting
in my car right now. Okay, bye.

935
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:09,290
Oh, I'm going fucking nuts.

936
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,947
Yeah, who's the winner, Bill?

937
01:00:14,948 --> 01:00:16,949
Who is the winner?
No, I'm not going to shoot you.

938
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:18,919
Oh, I'm just fucking kidding.

939
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,124
Seriously, though, seriously.

940
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,125
Have you ever seen
a fucking cowboy?

941
01:01:32,701 --> 01:01:34,585
Fuck this kid.

942
01:01:34,586 --> 01:01:36,020

Evan.

947
01:01:53,739 --> 01:01:55,741
I'm leaving.
I'm fucking leaving!

948
01:01:55,742 --> 01:01:57,375
No, you're not, man.

949
01:01:57,376 --> 01:01:58,543
Dude, you're taking
for fucking ever!

950
01:01:58,544 --> 01:02:00,411
I've had a lot of shit
to do today, okay?

951
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:03,483
It's been a fucked up afternoon.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

952
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:04,485
Don't go anywhere.

953

I've been wait--
Dude, I've been waiting.

954
01:02:06,454 --> 01:02:07,988
Ten minutes, my fucking ass.

955
01:02:07,988 --> 01:02:10,056
I've been waiting here for
fucking 45 minutes.

956
01:02:10,057 --> 01:02:12,426
Paintball. Paintball.
Paintball, bro.

957
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:13,344
So?

958
01:02:13,345 --> 01:02:16,263
We're going to play paintball.

959
01:02:16,264 --> 01:02:17,449
Give me a fucking good reason--

960
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:20,418
and I want a fucking articulate
reason-- why I should stay.

961
01:02:20,419 --> 01:02:21,253
Why should I stay?

962
01:02:21,254 --> 01:02:24,572
I'm going to fucking
kill you, man.

963
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:25,773
Listen, you're the one--
You're going to be needing

964
01:02:25,774 --> 01:02:27,108
some fucking target practice,
all right?

965
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:30,678
You're not going to
go anywhere, right?

966
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:32,547
Just stay there for ten
minutes, okay?

967
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,951
I'm coming. I promise.
I love you, man.

968
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:36,286
All right. I'll see you soon.

969
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,437
Okay.

970
01:02:55,173 --> 01:02:58,377
We can go a little faster, Ray.

971
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,168
(Explosion)

972
01:03:34,968 --> 01:03:38,570
(Siren wailing)

973
01:03:42,492 --> 01:03:43,992
Closer, Ray.

974
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:13,257
¶

975
01:04:24,604 --> 01:04:26,155
Shit.

976
01:04:26,156 --> 01:04:27,557
Bump him.

977
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,798
(Explosion)

978
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:07,099
(Laughing)

979
01:06:26,854 --> 01:06:28,421
This is Sheriff Malvoy.

980
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:29,990
I'm at the roundabout
in the County Park.

981
01:06:29,991 --> 01:06:31,591
I've got two more
deputies down.

982
01:06:31,592 --> 01:06:33,760
I'm pursuing the
suspect on foot.

983
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:32,759
(Groaning)

984
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,761
(Gunshot)

985
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:44,404
You got blood on me.

986
01:07:56,518 --> 01:07:58,519
60 to 80 seconds.

987
01:08:56,251 --> 01:08:57,250
You ready?

988
01:08:57,251 --> 01:08:58,919
What the fuck?

989
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,620
Is that what you took two
fucking hours doing?

990
01:09:00,621 --> 01:09:03,190
I'm glad you
didn't leave, buddy.

991
01:09:03,192 --> 01:09:05,193
I brought you a gift.

992
01:09:09,697 --> 01:09:11,166
What the fuck?

993
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:12,166
Check it out.

994
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:14,269
Dude!

995
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:16,004
Dude, this is real money.

996
01:09:16,005 --> 01:09:18,807
It's a shit-load of money.

997
01:09:18,808 --> 01:09:22,411
Where the fuck did you get all
of this fucking money?

998
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:23,679
Hey, Evan?

999
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,248
Yeah?

1000
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:26,415
Check it out.

1001
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:28,784
(Electrical buzzing)

1002
01:09:28,785 --> 01:09:29,818
(Moaning)

1003
01:09:29,818 --> 01:09:32,721
You all right?

1004
01:09:32,722 --> 01:09:35,157
Give me your hand.

1005
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:39,062
Hold this. Hold this.

1006
01:09:39,063 --> 01:09:42,165
You kind of asked
for it, right?

1007
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:44,568
I kind of made you the martyr
you always wanted to be.

1008
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:48,607
(Gunshot)

1009
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,607
EVAN:
You are a prodigy of the world,
my son, a prodigy of the world.

1010
01:12:08,608 --> 01:12:10,961
DAD:
We'd like you to...

1011
01:12:10,962 --> 01:12:13,746
EVAN:
Stop having these things
sent to my fucking house.

1012
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:15,582
BILL:
Last ones, man.

1013
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:17,217
You're making me pay
for my own post education.

1014
01:12:17,218 --> 01:12:19,337
EVAN:
I've been waiting
for fucking 45 minutes.

1015
01:12:19,338 --> 01:12:22,090
BILL:
I made you the martyr
you always wanted to be.

1016
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:25,143
MOM:
Okay, sweetie.
I love you. Be safe.

1017
01:12:25,144 --> 01:12:29,547
WOMAN:
You're going to pay for this!
Do you hear me?

1018
01:12:29,548 --> 01:12:32,150
BILL:
What do you think I want?
Come on, quick.

1019
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:34,754
MANAGER:
Money! Money! Money!

1020
01:12:34,755 --> 01:12:37,274
EVAN:
I don't know.
My name is Evan Drince.

1021
01:12:37,275 --> 01:12:39,192
Do you have any thoughts?

1022
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,193
BILL:
Your fucking money
doesn't mean anything!

1023
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:19,302
TV:
...dozens of Tenderville
residents and police officers

1024
01:13:19,303 --> 01:13:22,339
earlier today, during what can
only be described

1025
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,692
as a massacre.

1026
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:27,260
The rampage began with
a massive explosion

1027
01:13:27,261 --> 01:13:28,545
that destroyed Tenderville
police station.

1028
01:13:28,546 --> 01:13:31,915
MOM:
Oh, God, honey.
There you are, sweetheart.

1029
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:33,166
This is just so awful.

1030
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:36,404
I'm so glad you're here.

1031
01:13:36,405 --> 01:13:38,774
You're okay, though, yeah?

1032
01:13:38,775 --> 01:13:42,443
I'm so glad you
weren't out in this. This was--

1033
01:13:42,443 --> 01:13:43,778
Are you okay, Bill?

1034
01:13:43,779 --> 01:13:45,013
You were back here
when this started?

1035
01:13:45,014 --> 01:13:47,083
I drove by the bakery,

1036
01:13:47,084 --> 01:13:48,785
and the whole glass was
shattered out of the bakery.

1037
01:13:48,786 --> 01:13:49,952
This is the forest.

1038
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:53,323
Look, this is where
they found the guy.

1039
01:13:53,324 --> 01:13:54,324
They found the shooter already?

1040
01:13:54,325 --> 01:13:55,358
Yeah.

1041
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:56,358
Wait a second.
One guy did all of this?

1042
01:13:56,359 --> 01:13:57,927
It was Evan.

1043
01:13:57,928 --> 01:14:00,863
Evan got shot?
Did Evan get shot?

1044
01:14:00,864 --> 01:14:04,451
No, Mom. Evan did it.
My friend, Evan.

1045
01:14:04,452 --> 01:14:05,886
Oh, my God.

1046
01:14:05,887 --> 01:14:07,722
Shot all of the--?

1047
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:10,357
Have they announced his name or
you just recognized him?

1048
01:14:10,358 --> 01:14:12,425
They just said it,
Evan Drince, Evan Drince.

1049
01:14:12,426 --> 01:14:14,997
Breaking news.
Unbelievable.

1050
01:14:14,998 --> 01:14:17,799
How did they find him? Like,
what? Did he give himself up?

1051
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,301
They just found
him in the woods.

1052
01:14:19,302 --> 01:14:20,836
He shot himself in the head.

1053
01:14:20,837 --> 01:14:22,037
He's dead?

1054
01:14:22,038 --> 01:14:24,805
He committed suicide.
He committed suicide.

1055
01:14:24,806 --> 01:14:26,475
This is insane.

1056
01:14:26,476 --> 01:14:27,877
This world is a crazy place,
isn't it?

1057
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:29,577
He was a fucked up kid.

1058
01:14:29,578 --> 01:14:31,430
Oh...

1059
01:14:31,431 --> 01:14:33,299
I thought he was--
I thought he was a bit odd,

1060
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,967
but I didn't think
he was a--

1061
01:14:34,968 --> 01:14:36,886
Psychopath?

1062
01:14:36,887 --> 01:14:38,956
He looked like he had secrets.

1063
01:14:38,957 --> 01:14:40,958
I mean, I'm just
an armchair psychologist,

1064
01:14:40,959 --> 01:14:43,328
but a mother knows.

1065
01:14:43,329 --> 01:14:45,463
Like, you just intuit.

1066
01:14:45,464 --> 01:14:46,830
Yeah.

1067
01:14:46,831 --> 01:14:49,784
Nevertheless, it must be a shock
for his parents.

1068
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:51,385
Have you spoken to them?

1069
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:52,954
Uh, yeah.

1070
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,189
I don't even want to ask you

1071
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,657
about the college
applications now.

1072
01:14:55,658 --> 01:15:00,345
It all seems
so trite, I guess.

1073
01:15:00,346 --> 01:15:02,013
I'm glad you guys
are okay, right?

1074
01:15:02,014 --> 01:15:03,015
Oh, yeah.

1075
01:15:03,015 --> 01:15:06,152
Oh, we're fine.

1076
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:07,703
Presently, the only
thing we know...

1077
01:15:07,704 --> 01:15:09,605
This is where I drove by.

1078
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:10,874
I told you I saw
that poor woman.

1079
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:13,576
Do you think
it's Mrs. Blakeslee?

1080
01:15:13,577 --> 01:15:16,412
I didn't want to stay around
long enough to find out?

1081
01:15:16,413 --> 01:15:18,214
Guys, I'm so tired.
I'm going to go to sleep.

1082
01:15:18,215 --> 01:15:20,685
Oh, of course, honey.

1083
01:15:20,686 --> 01:15:22,086
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

1084
01:15:22,087 --> 01:15:23,555
I'm really sorry.

1085
01:15:28,326 --> 01:15:29,995
You give us a shout if
you need anything, okay?

1086
01:15:29,995 --> 01:15:31,795
All right.
Take care, guys.

1087
01:15:31,796 --> 01:15:33,230
Get some sleep.

1088
01:15:33,232 --> 01:15:34,834
Yeah, sweetheart. Bye-bye.

1089
01:15:34,835 --> 01:15:37,235
I think he's
holding it in.

1090
01:15:37,236 --> 01:15:39,338
Maybe we should take
him to see somebody.

1091
01:15:39,339 --> 01:15:41,006
Well, for sure after this.

1092
01:15:41,007 --> 01:15:42,507
He's going to have
to go talk to someone.

1093
01:15:42,508 --> 01:15:44,543
Yeah.

1094
01:15:44,544 --> 01:15:47,346
Just, I don't want anyone to
know that we're taking him.

1095
01:15:47,347 --> 01:15:48,815
Yeah, fair enough.

1096
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:50,617
I don't want people to know and
think he's crazy or something.

1097
01:15:50,618 --> 01:15:53,286
Oh, my God.
This is awful.

1098
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:55,055
Let's have a drink
or something, huh?

1099
01:15:55,056 --> 01:15:58,025
Yeah, make me a
double, something.

1100
01:15:58,026 --> 01:16:01,245
TV:
Stay tuned to this station for
an update of this tragic story

1101
01:16:01,246 --> 01:16:03,381
as more details
become available.

1102
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:27,807
Tenderville resident
Lloyd Drince,

1103
01:16:27,808 --> 01:16:31,328
the father of Evan Drince
was arrested at his home

1104
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:33,180
when local authorities

1105
01:16:33,181 --> 01:16:35,449
attempted to enter the
premises.

1106
01:16:35,451 --> 01:16:38,786
Close sources reveal that Lloyd
Drince used to be a radical

1107
01:16:38,787 --> 01:16:43,757
and extreme protester
in the '60s and '70s,

1108
01:16:43,758 --> 01:16:46,461
especially at the height
of the war in Vietnam

1109
01:16:46,462 --> 01:16:49,096
and has always been
strongly outspoken

1110
01:16:49,097 --> 01:16:51,166
against the government.

1111
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:54,404
With the current evidence that
his son, Evan Drince,

1112
01:16:54,405 --> 01:16:57,340
has been identified as being
behind the massacre

1113
01:16:57,341 --> 01:16:59,708
in downtown Tenderville today,

1114
01:16:59,709 --> 01:17:02,043
it appears that
radical measures

1115
01:17:02,044 --> 01:17:05,749
to get your opinions
out runs in the family.

1116
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,485
To recap, the offender
has been identified

1117
01:17:08,486 --> 01:17:13,023
as 21-year-old Tenderville
resident Evan Drince,

1118
01:17:13,024 --> 01:17:16,561
who took his own life
in a nearby forested area

1119
01:17:16,562 --> 01:17:19,564
after completing his
destruction and killing spree.

1120
01:17:19,565 --> 01:17:21,099
LLOYD DRINCE:
You've got the wrong kid!
My kid wouldn't do this!

1121
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,867
My kid's innocent!

1122
01:17:22,868 --> 01:17:24,569
Bill Williamson!

1123
01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:28,506
Bill Williamson did this!

1124
01:17:28,506 --> 01:17:30,876
Check Bill Williamson's house!

1125
01:17:30,877 --> 01:17:34,980
My kid is not a murderer!

1126
01:17:34,981 --> 01:17:38,418
My son is innocent!
Bill Williamson!

1127
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:40,871
NEWSCASTER:
The authorities have not
pressed any charges

1128
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:44,574
or revealed information
about suspects

1129
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:47,244
since they feel a thorough
investigation is needed...

1130
01:17:56,171 --> 01:18:00,541
BILL:
It's a...

1131
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,078
It's a downward spiral

1132
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:07,015
to the end of all times.

1133
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:11,252
And there's no chance
that we can survive.

1134
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,521
I mean...

1135
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:15,323
70 million
people every year

1136
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:17,494
are brought onto this Earth.

1137
01:18:17,495 --> 01:18:18,628
What are they doing?

1138
01:18:18,629 --> 01:18:20,397
Sucking up our resources.

1139
01:18:20,398 --> 01:18:23,701
There's too many people,
so what do we do?

1140
01:18:23,702 --> 01:18:25,736
Just keep them around?

1141
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:27,338
Let's kill them.

1142
01:18:27,339 --> 01:18:29,607
Let's get rid of them.

1143
01:18:29,608 --> 01:18:31,075
Good, thank you.

1144
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:33,344
Thanks for--
thanks for coming out.

1145
01:18:33,345 --> 01:18:34,847
But you know what?

1146
01:18:34,848 --> 01:18:36,915
We're at capacity.

1147
01:18:36,915 --> 01:18:38,048
We're at capacity now.

1148
01:18:38,049 --> 01:18:41,453
So... sorry, no more.

1149
01:18:41,454 --> 01:18:42,988
No more.

1150
01:18:42,989 --> 01:18:45,340
So that's what I'll do.

1151
01:18:45,341 --> 01:18:47,309
Why not?

1152
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:48,911
That's my plan.

1153
01:18:48,912 --> 01:18:50,447
That's what I want to do.

1154
01:18:50,448 --> 01:18:53,450
Let's just clean the world,

1155
01:18:53,451 --> 01:18:56,920
so maybe the rest of us can
sustain a little bit of life.

1156
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:03,344
So maybe that's what
I'll do in the future.

1157
01:19:03,345 --> 01:19:06,147
I'll help you out.

1158
01:19:06,148 --> 01:19:07,749
I'll help you out,

1159
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:11,519
and I will cleanse,

1160
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,589
make more room for you.

1161
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:19,460
I will exhibit my own brand of
population control...

1162
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:21,463
for you.

1163
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,402
That's it.

1164
01:19:27,402 --> 01:19:37,402
