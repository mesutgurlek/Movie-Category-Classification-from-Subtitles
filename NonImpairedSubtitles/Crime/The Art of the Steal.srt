1
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:50,816
<i>Seasoned crooks swear you only remember
two days about your stretch in jail:</i>

2
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,484
<i>The day you get in...</i>

3
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,755
- Oh, boy.
<i>- ...and the day you get out.</i>

4
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,394
<i>But I'll tell you,</i>
<i>those guys,</i>

5
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,229
<i>they never been</i>
<i>to a Polish prison.</i>

6
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,632
'Cause, buddy, you don't forget
<i>a second of your stay</i>

7
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,268
<i>in the Warsaw penal system.</i>

8
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:14,373
Oh, boy.

9
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:19,711
<i>And you never stop thinking about
what you done that got you there,</i>

10
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,247
<i>and what you're going to</i>
<i>do when you get out.</i>

11
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,818
<i>And who you're going</i>
<i>to do it to.</i>

12
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,424
<i>I reckon it takes</i>
<i>a betrayal before you realize</i>

13
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:37,729
<i>the real currency in the world</i>
<i>ain't money... it's trust.</i>

14
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,569
Hey. So, guess
I'm topsies, huh?

15
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:50,209
<i>'Cause if you got no trust...</i>

16
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,711
Oh, boy.

17
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,581
<i>then what do you got?</i>

18
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,463
<i>Now, there's no such thing</i>
<i>as one last big job,</i>

19
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,699
<i>but Poland was pretty close.</i>

20
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,468
<i>We were doing a smooth switch</i>

21
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,871
<i>using a standard base</i>
<i>to our scam.</i>

22
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,140
<i>The first thing you</i>
<i>need is a mark.</i>

23
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:24,143
<i>Stash Bartkowiak was just like</i>
<i>all the others:</i>

24
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:28,247
<i>rich, corrupt and most</i>
<i>definitely dangerous.</i>

25
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:31,517
<i>So Stash picks up a stolen Gauguin
ripped from an Oslo gallery</i>

26
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,418
<i>by a couple of smash</i>
<i>and grabbers.</i>

27
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,387
<i>So, of course, he wants to</i>
<i>get the painting authenticated.</i>

28
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,356
<i>But what he didn't know,</i>

29
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,826
<i>was the man he turned to</i>
<i>was Nicky Calhoun.</i>

30
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,629
<i>And Nicky Calhoun</i>
<i>is my half-brother.</i>

31
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,432
<i>A crew needs an idea man</i>
<i>and ours was Nicky.</i>

32
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,469
<i>Paddy McCarthy,</i>
<i>he was our Rolodex,</i>

33
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,671
<i>the guy who knows</i>
<i>any guy you need to know.</i>

34
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,641
<i>And Guy De Cornet</i>
<i>was our forger.</i>

35
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,743
Best scratcher I've ever known.

36
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,812
<i>Now there was a time,</i>
<i>if you ask anyone in our game,</i>

37
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,715
<i>who the best damn wheelman</i>
<i>around was,</i>

38
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,252
<i>and I'm guaranteeing you, you're going
to hear the name Crunch Calhoun.</i>

39
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,355
<i>And that's got nothing to do</i>
<i>with how fast I drive</i>

40
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,558
<i>and everything to do</i>
<i>with trust.</i>

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,427
<i>'Cause without that</i>
<i>you've got anarchy.</i>

42
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,962
I like that jacket.

43
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,830
Well, clothes tell
you a lot about the man.

44
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,465
That's why it's a saying.

45
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,301
I don't know, Nicky.
Take Guy there.

46
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,537
The only thing his fancy white
leotard tells me is that

47
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,439
he ain't circumcised.

48
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,908
- You misunderstand fashion.
- Fatsoes. Look at you.

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,810
- Fatsoes?
- Women go crazy for this...

50
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,745
Boys! There it is!

51
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,617
I'll see you
at the lab, Crunch.

52
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,363
Don't touch the art, lad.
All alarmed.

53
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,450
Wow! Love the track suits.

54
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:14,620
Fellas, I'd like you to meet
Professor O'Connor.

55
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,822
Doc, these are the fellas.

56
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:20,392
As I said, Dr. "O" here,
is real discreet.

57
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,394
Very discreet, gentlemen.

58
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:29,668
Oh. Paul Gauguin.
"Tahitian Beach," 1893.

59
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,271
Painting is stolen.
But is real?

60
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,841
We'll see.
Needs a density scan.

61
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,643
What is density scan?

62
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,912
I'm not so sure myself,
but doctor knows best.

63
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:03,635
OK, great. So a guy
walks into a bar with a monkey.

64
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,820
Oh. What is this?

65
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,822
What?

66
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,358
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

67
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,393
- More red. More red.
- No, no, no, no, no.

68
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,828
Don't do this, Guy, please.
You're killing me.

69
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,930
They're identical.
Just swap the frames!

70
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,565
My work...

71
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,701
Oh fuck, Guy! Come on,
they're identical!

72
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,704
- Just change them!
- My work must be perfect-o!

73
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,407
You've got five minutes.

74
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,844
So I say,
"I'm looking for Mario."

75
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,980
And this kid says, "There's
a thousand Marios in Naples."

76
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,983
I say, "Yeah,
but this one's a criminal."

77
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,453
And he goes, "Two thousand!"

78
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,791
Guy. Guy.

79
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,561
Guy! They will fuckin' kill
Nicky and Paddy

80
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,930
if I don't make it
back there in time!

81
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:09,601
Guy, you got ten seconds.
That's it. Ten!

82
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:15,440
Nine, eight, seven, six, five.
Put it in.

83
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:20,011
- Three, two, one. Now!
<i>- Au revoir.</i>

84
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,582
Ah, fuck!

85
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,959
Bastard!

86
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,566
So naturally I tell the Turkish
prostitute, "I'll take two."

87
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:15,500
So are any of you guys
Ukrainian?

88
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,669
No? OK then.

89
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,082
Ah, fuck!

90
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:09,955
She's a genuine Gauguin, boys.
Priceless.

91
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,696
I don't believe this.

92
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,665
There's millions of dollars of
paintings and we're doing nothing.

93
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,901
- Leave it, lad.
- This is Poland!

94
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,103
We can do whatever
the fuck we want.

95
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,907
Nicky, boy, the Gauguin's worth more than
five rooms of paintings in this place

96
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,008
and they're all alarmed.

97
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,977
Are you kidding me?

98
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,078
There's no alarms.

99
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,649
There's alarms.

100
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,610
Boys, let's all split up!

101
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:09,981
Train to Berlin. Ten AM.
Bright and early like!

102
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,118
Shit!

103
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:29,868
Go! Here. What are you...
what are you...?! Wrong way!

104
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,906
<i>That crash</i>
<i>was a stroke of luck.</i>

105
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:39,110
<i>And the cops showed up before</i>
<i>Stash could kill him.</i>

106
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,314
Uh...

107
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:45,784
Did I tell you the one
about the, uh,

108
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,253
three prostitutes
and the bruised melon?

109
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,058
We only want painting back.

110
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,927
One painting, one arrest.

111
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,630
It could be you or someone else.

112
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:06,371
You have record in Europe,
so that's 20 years sentence.

113
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,140
We make deal, huh?

114
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:12,944
The painting and a fall guy.

115
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,049
<i>For Nicky, I figure</i>
<i>it was just basic math.</i>

116
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,885
<i>He's facing 20 years</i>
<i>and I got a clean sheet.</i>

117
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,655
<i>I can't blame him for that.</i>

118
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,923
<i>But I can hate him for it.</i>

119
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,361
Oh, boy.

120
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,081
<i>So I went home.</i>

121
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,385
<i>And I couldn't go back</i>
<i>to the life.</i>

122
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,021
<i>The trust was gone.</i>

123
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,989
<i>Crew was gone.</i>

124
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,692
<i>And everybody went</i>
<i>their separate ways.</i>

125
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,395
<i>And I met a girl.</i>

126
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,664
<i>Someone I could bank on.</i>

127
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,666
<i>And even if I couldn't, buddy,</i>
<i>I'll tell you,</i>

128
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,769
<i>she wasn't the worst person</i>
<i>I shared a bunk with lately.</i>

129
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,371
<i>But I could bank on Francie.</i>

130
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:17,442
<i>Francie was a young buck I caught
pinching hubcaps off my truck.</i>

131
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,412
<i>Most folks probably would have called
the cops, but I gave him a job.</i>

132
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:25,684
<i>'Cause every now and then, you</i>
<i>got to take a leap of faith.</i>

133
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,721
Hey, Crunch. Lace 'em up.

134
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,927
The only way we're gonna get the crowd
tomorrow is if you take a dive today.

135
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,697
Nope, not gonna happen,
not again.

136
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,098
It pains me to say it,
Crunch,

137
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,866
but the only reason
why these folks are here

138
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,902
is in the hope that
you crack your skull open.

139
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,038
You have to crash your bike.
That's what you do.

140
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,208
[man on P.A.) A 188 stitches,
26 broken bones.

141
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:54,079
Twelve totaled bikes.
Three comas.

142
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,181
Twice pronounced legally dead.

143
00:11:56,183 --> 00:12:02,020
- I'll give you $700.
- The one, the only, Crunch Calhoun!

144
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,123
Let me say this out loud,

145
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,058
'cause I can't believe
my own ears.

146
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,261
You expect me to deliberately
take a dive, risk my life,

147
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,764
for 700 bucks?

148
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,468
- Twelve.
- Seven.

149
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,203
- Eleven.
- Six.

150
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,271
- Eight.
- Deal.

151
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,506
Call the ambulance.

152
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,975

Ladies and gentlemen,

155
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,016
let's give old Crunch
a moment of silence

156
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:36,855
as he prepares to go down, down,
down into the ring of fire!

157
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,456
How'd she do? Tell
me at least a thousand.

158
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,926
No, $800. So just
don't do it, Crunch.

159
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,095
I'll pay you $800
not to spill 'er.

160
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,397
If you got $800,
I'm payin' you too much.

161
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,901
Just don't do it, bud.

162
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,904
I'll be all right,
Francie. Besides,

163
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,773
"Fortune favors the bold."

164
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,341

00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,843
- Virgil.

Excuse me, sir. Would you
consent to a voluntary search?

178
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:12,984
Right this way, please.

179
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:15,587
Bad luck, chief.

180
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,991
Thank you.

181
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,864
Ground rules,
same as last time.

182
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,232
You talk when
I tell you to talk

183
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,167
and when I don't,
you do not talk.

184
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,302
Don't bark at me.
I'm not your dog.

185
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,238
Did I say to talk?

186
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,273
Because I don't recall
telling you to talk.

187
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,275
How many more times
must I do your job

188
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:40,011
before I've paid my
proverbial debt to society?

189
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:44,015
Warning: You make me look
stupid, I will crush you.

190
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,086
- That looked hot.
- Yes, a little bit.

191
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,921
We're going to start
with "good cop, bad cop".

192
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,389
- I'm not a cop.
- OK.

193
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,458
How about "good cop,
just do what I fuckin' say"?

194
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,193
You're not a cop.

195
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:59,063
Correction. The "pol" in
Interpol, it stands for police.

196
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,365
Then where is your pistol?

197
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,033
I don't need a gun.

198
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,135
I've got something far more
dangerous than that.

199
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,071
Is it a whistle that you blow
to summon the real police

200
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,907
when a crime
is being committed?

201
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,175
No. It's actually a pen.

202
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,379
And, with it,
I can deny your parole.

203
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,382
So why don't you shut the hell
up and follow my lead?

204
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,219
Where's the fucking painting,
fucko?

205
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,189
Whoa.

206
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,693
My name is Agent Bick. This is
my associate, Samuel Winter.

207
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,462
I know Sam.

208
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,197
Sam, what are you doing
with Dirty Harry, here?

209
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,600
You know how they pair
professional athletes

210
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,402
- with slow kids?
- Yep.

211
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,170
It's kind of like that.

212
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,541
Two weeks ago, this painting
"Model, Rear-View"

213
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:47,011
by Georges Seurat was stolen by
an art collector in Mexico City

214
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,579
by a woman we had
under surveillance.

215
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,716
Yeah, I've never seen
that woman before...

216
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,184
before yesterday.

217
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,553
Do I look like
a fucking clown to you?

218
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:59,023
Clowns try to be funny. You're
just unintentionally hysterical.

219
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,361
Shut your giggle hole
and open the damn case.

220
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:07,598
It's called "Tio Puno Loco".

221
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,301
Which translates
"Uncle Crazy Fist."

222
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,438
Now, if you gentlemen will excuse
me, I've got to water ski...

223
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,975
Sit down! Winter,
this is not "pointerism".

224
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,377
Every painting tells a story.

225
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,280
All good art tells a story.

226
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,315
This one tells two.

227
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,319
<i>Say Nicky here</i>
<i>is stopped at Customs.</i>

228
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,490
<i>All they see is this rubbish,</i>

229
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,360
not the masterpiece underneath.

230
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:39,163
<i>Acetate solution loosens</i>
<i>the top acrylic layer.</i>

231
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:45,136
<i>Peel it on back and you're left with
the original oil painting underneath.</i>

232
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,039
What the fuck is that?

233
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:52,710
It's a marvelous picture.
I'm delighted to have it as
part of my collection.

234
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:58,449
Well, boys, have a nice day.

235
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,318
Where's the Seurat?!

236
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,388
Long gone.

237
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,028
- Sunny.
- Yeah. How'd it go?

238
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,496
Ah, it went.

239
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,065
Bad luck, chief.

240
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,736
You got the money?

241
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,372
There you go.

242
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,575
It feels a little light.

243
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,077
Well, why don't you open it?

244
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,213
"I'm sorry.

245
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,682
I'm sorry for hitting you
with a lead pipe."

246
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,718
What the fuck...

247
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,299
Crunch, honey,
we're out of ice.

248
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,701
Oh yeah, all right.

249
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,572
Thank you, Crunchie.

250
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,673
Adios, fellas.

251
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,242
Ice? $50 for ice?

252
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,544
It's wintertime.

253
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,579
Crunch, she's, she's not
even trying anymore.

254
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,648
Happy wife,
happy life, right?

255
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,349
So you say.

256
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,819
Oh, I don't know, Francie.

257
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:11,622
When I was a young buck
I thought I'd make history,

258
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:15,193
not just sit there
reading about it.

259
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,198
Hell, I thought
I'd be a great man.

260
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,500
OK, so you're not...

261
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:26,304
stereotypically great,
like Alexander the Great.

262
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:31,309
But you're great like,
great like, like...

263
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,844
You're a great guy!

264
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,481
Great men don't take dives
for a couple of hundred bucks.

265
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,586
And great men
don't miss their fate.

266
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:45,223
Somewhere along the line I...

267
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,192
I missed mine, Francie.

268
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,262
I was probably staring at
it the whole time and I just...

269
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,565
I missed it.

270
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:01,405
My God, you're a downer.
A fuckin' boner killer.

271
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,442
And what are you going to do? Are you
gonna sell fuckin' insurance or something?

272
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:07,812
Just shut the fuck up
and cheer up, please.

273
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,649
Allow me.

274
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,520
Yo, Dennis Calhoun?

275
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,688
Who's asking?

276
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,458
- It's fuckin' Sunny.
- Sounds about right.

277
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,429
Hey, Crunch, there's some guy with
an eye-patch here to see you.

278
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,548
Oh, easy, man!

279
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,850
Where's your fuckin' brother?

280
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,892
I was gonna cut bait and go home then I
realized Nicky said he had a brother.

281
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,892
Oww. Fuck!

282
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:01,465
Sweet Baby Jesus.
What are you, a pirate?

283
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,403
Hey, hey, hey. Look! I don't
know where Nicky is, all right.

284
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,572
- He said you work with him.
- Yeah, a long time ago.

285
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,308
Now, look, I got like $300
stashed in the bedroom there.

286
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,244
It's yours. A guy in your line of
work might prefer doubloons...

287
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,412
I'm not a fuckin' pirate!

288
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,649
I don't even talk to Nicky.
I hate him.

289
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,352
Here's what's what.
I want the 30 grand

290
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,521
- or I want that fuckin' painting.
- What painting?

291
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:24,689
The Seurat.

292
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,357
Whoa! Whoa! What?

293
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,658
- The Seurat!
- What?

294
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,428
The Georges Seurat,
you ignorant fuck!

295
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,630
The seminal French
"Post-Impressionalist".

296
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,298
The father of pointillism.

297
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,767
That Georges Seurat,
you fuckin' baboon.

298
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,270
Now I want the 30 grand,

299
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,504
the painting

300
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,840
or a bullet in your
fucking head!

301
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,312
Hey, uh...

302
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,015
- Crunch, is everything OK?
- Yeah.

303
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,818
What... what's happening,
exactly?

304
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,388
- Nothing.
- What?

305
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,690
I'm being held at
gunpoint by a pirate.

306
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,359
I'm in the bathroom.
What do you think, Francie?

307
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:04,028
All right. Sorry
for fuckin' askin'!

308
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,831
I ain't leavin'
without the 30 grand.

309
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:11,736
Sorry, Sinbad, but I don't think
that musketoon's gonna even fire.

310
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:15,339
So go ahead and pull the trigger
'cause I got no painting,

311
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:19,277
no Nicky and
no 30 fucking grand!

312
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,616
Who owns that
fuckin' bike outside?

313
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,051
Wait a minute, man.

314
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,398
- What the fuck?
- What's going on?

315
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,401
- Nicky's back.
- What?

316
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,835
And so am I.

317
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,938
What the fuck just happened?

318
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,310
Fate! Fate is
what just happened.

319
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,978
<i>Uncle Paddy.</i>

320
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,547
How are you, lad?
Still in the land of the living?

321
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,517
You wanted to know when I was
ready to go back to work.

322
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,485
Well, I'm ready.

323
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,692
- Citizenship?
- Various.

324
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,026
Anything to declare?

325
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:12,596
Nothing but my undying
love for you, beautiful.

326
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:15,933
Pull over.

327
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,674
Hey, Paddy?

328
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:35,820
What's that?

329
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,688
A Seurat.

330
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,592
If this is even close to real,
Paddy's gonna make a bundle.

331
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,428
Oh, it's real.

332
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,898
I was hoping to get Paddy
to move it for me.

333
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,004
Oh, hi. I'm Nicky...

334
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,639
I know.

335
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,875
Right.

336
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:03,514
Well, could you be so kind as to give me
and my brother a moment here to catch up?

337
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,091
So.

338
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:18,462
How'd you get the scar?
Motorbike?

339
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,899
No.

340
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,601
All right, man.

341
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,748
You must be Francie, are ya?

342
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,684
Paddy McCarthy.
But for you, it's Uncle Paddy.

343
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,246
So, is there a donnybrook a-brewin'
in there? How she gettin' on?

344
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:47,958
I understood the word "Francie".

345
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,961
Fightin', are they? Ha.
So much alike those two.

346
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,797
They're literally nothing alike.

347
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,732
Oh, different mothers.

348
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,567
They grew up on different
sides of the country.

349
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,170
Their father was the
Johnny Appleseed of sperm.

350
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:01,005
That's revolting.

351
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:04,542
You're gettin' old, Crunch.

352
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,811
You never used to be that easy.

353
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:10,448
Look, if it's an apology you
need to put this thing to bed...

354
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,551
An apology? You sent me
to prison, man.

355
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,186
Exactly. I owe you one.

356
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:18,823
No. You owe me
five and a half.

357
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:22,193
But right now,
I just wanna go back to work.

358
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:24,228
Let's do that, then.
Let's go back to work.

359
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,964
I mean, I practically
apologized here.

360
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,600
You boys done fistin'
in to one another?

361
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:33,070
Ah, man. I wish you wouldn't
use that turn of phrase.

362
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,772
So, can we get down to work now?

363
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,107
No, Paddy. I'm not gonna help
Nicky fence that painting.

364
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,943
This has nothin' to do
with Nicky's paintin'.

365
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,178
And, by the way, Dennis,
he is your brother

366
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,908
and one day you're gonna
have to forgive him.

367
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,148
Please don't call me Dennis.

368
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,117
And, Nicky Boy, you're gonna pay the
piper for what ya did to Dennis.

369
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,054
- I'll see to it meself.
- I want to pay the piper.

370
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,490
Still not workin'
with Nicky, Paddy.

371
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:55,059
Oh, just listen to the story
before you say no, lad.

372
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,694
There's a good moral
to this story.

373
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,796
How big a moral are
we talking about here?

374
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,866
One and a half million dollars.

375
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,568
Jesus.

376
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,005
<i>Two weeks ago,</i>
<i>I gets a knock on me door.</i>

377
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:17,114
Julius Friedman.
You've heard the name.

378
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,950
Just stories.
I've heard stories.

379
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:22,520
<i>The things in this</i>
<i>man's collection, I mean,</i>

380
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:27,057
<i>if it were public knowledge, it'd close
the books on a hundred major art thefts.</i>

381
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,295
<i>Believe me, I've seen it.</i>

382
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:35,266
So then Friedman asked me if I've
ever heard of the Gutenberg Bible.

383
00:25:36,054 --> 00:25:39,069
<i>Gutenberg invents
the printing press in 1440.</i>

384
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,672
<i>It changes everything.</i>

385
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:44,942
<i>The first book he printed</i>
<i>was the Gutenberg Bible,</i>

386
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,877
<i>the Mona Lisa of books.</i>

387
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,713
<i>The most valuable</i>
<i>book in the world.</i>

388
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,248
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>whoa. Back that shit up.</i>

389
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,284
We can't steal
a Gutenberg Bible.

390
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:55,953
We're not stealing
the Gutenberg Bible.

391
00:25:55,955 --> 00:26:00,558
The second book Gutenberg printed was
well outside the beliefs of the Church.

392
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,995
<i>The Gospel According to James.
Well, that's a legend.</i>

393
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,997
<i>The church has been</i>
<i>trying to bury this gospel</i>

394
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,567
<i>since before the time</i>
<i>of Constantine.</i>

395
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:13,203
<i>And, to Friedman, that makes</i>
<i>the Gospel According to Jimmy</i>

396
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,738
<i>even more priceless.</i>

397
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,675
So we nick your fancy book,

398
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:21,145
hand it on over,
and make scads of loot.

399
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,314
But the thing is,

400
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:25,916
it's already been stolen.

401
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:32,189
<i>So last month at the Vanderloos
Gallery in Amsterdam,</i>

402
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:37,094
<i>our man almost gets nabbed by a cop
who sees him crawlin' out the window.</i>

403
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,332
So how is it I've not heard
that such a fancy,

404
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,334
famous book
as yours was nicked?

405
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,269
No one knows it's stolen.

406
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,172
<i>We swapped it out for a fake.</i>

407
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:53,611
No one's gonna know it's
missing... until Saturday.

408
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:55,980
Now, here's
where we come in.

409
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,782
<i>They flew the book from</i>
<i>Europe to Canada.</i>

410
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,252
<i>Since 9/11 you can't fly</i>
<i>anythin' into America anymore.</i>

411
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:06,190
<i>It was supposed to go from Montreal
to Detroit, crossin' through here.</i>

412
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:08,872
<i>But the driver got greedy
and tried to smuggle</i>

413
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:11,095
<i>a brick of hash along
with the Gospel.</i>

414
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:14,264
So they arrest our man,
put the Gospel in storage

415
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:17,167
and have an expert coming
in on Saturday.

416
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:21,972
But any expert's gonna look at that Gospel
and know it's the Guttenberg original.

417
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,241
Which means the Gospel
According to James

418
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:27,778
<i>is gonna be put under so many</i>
<i>locks and so many keys</i>

419
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:33,150
that Julius Friedman will never
<i>catch a whiff of it again.</i>

420
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,688
We get the Bible,
we take it to Detroit.

421
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,957
We collect one and a half
million dollars.

422
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,726
And that, laddiekins, is that.

423
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,067
Well, you're shittin' me, right?

424
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,971
First off, I ain't ever heard of
this Gospel According to Jimmy.

425
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:59,243
And number two, we're not equipped to
rob an international border station.

426
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:03,847
Look! There's guards.
There's cameras everywhere.

427
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,117
This would take, like, months of planning
and skill sets we just don't possess!

428
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,020
Forget it! We're not
the A-Team here, guys.

429
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,424
I'd peg us at a D-minus
for this kind of thing.

430
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,960
I thought you had something,
Paddy.

431
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,397
- I'm out.
- Hey, Crunch...

432
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,000
- Leave him, lad.
- I got him.

433
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,302
Let's go, boy.

434
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,839
Sir, I'm telling you,
it's happening.

435
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,175
<i>- What's happening?
- Paddy's here, Nicky's here</i>

436
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:34,445
and they all just happened to converge
in the city where Crunch lives?

437
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,714
And Crunch, we know he's
desperate for money.

438
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,248
Sir, this is
all about the Seurat.

439
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,218
So I need you to authorize eyes
on every entry point

440
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
into the country within
a half a day's travel.

441
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,223
I need a full surveillance kit, I
need manpower and I need a gun.

442
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,118
<i>Look, there's no fuckin' way
you're getting a firearm.</i>

443
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:49,985
<i>OK. No gun.</i>

444
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,430
Come on! Hold up!

445
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,432
Let's take it down,
you're a little testy.

446
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,768
Yeah, well, jail
will do that to a man.

447
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,205
Let me add that "Polish Prison" isn't
quite as hilarious as it sounds.

448
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,240
Whoa! Pardon me.

449
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,843
I can't believe
you're still doin' that.

450
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:06,977
- What?
- That.

451
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,846
Eh, keeps me sharp.

452
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,914
Listen...

453
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,785
Bottom line is, I know that
you're hard up for cash.

454
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:17,254
And let's just say,
hypothetically,

455
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,791
I feel bad and I wanna
make it up to you.

456
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,994
So we do this thing
with Paddy

457
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,497
and I cut you in
for ten percent on my end.

458
00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:30,033
A sort of "Sorry for fucking
you over" money. Huh?

459
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,503
Oh. Hi, little girl.
What's your name?

460
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,773
- Robin.
- Oh yeah? Very cute.

461
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:40,177
Everything out of
your mouth is nothin'.

462
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,013
- How could you say that?
- Gee, I don't know.

463
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,283
Maybe 'cause you just knocked over a
nine-year-old little Chinese girl.

464
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,485
There's supposed to be
a code, Nicky!

465
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,288
You never prey upon
the virtuous or the poor.

466
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,323
You never put the paycheck
over your honor.

467
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,325
And you never,
ever betray your family!

468
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,961
Sure, maybe it's all
just horseshit

469
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,330
that we feed ourselves
so we can go to sleep at night.

470
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,833
Maybe it's horseshit so that
we can fancy ourselves

471
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:05,536
a cut above the thugs and
the gangsters of the world.

472
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,538
But I bought into that
horseshit, Nicky!

473
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,074
And you, you just trample
all over that horseshit.

474
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,845
And you just, now you, you got shit
all over your, your boots, you know.

475
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:17,047
You, you just... you,
you got shitty boots.

476
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,582
Hey, the analogy's
breaking down.

477
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,184
Yeah, maybe a little.
You know what I fuckin' mean.

478
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,451
Hey, what's a fella got to do

479
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,920
to make amends with you?

480
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,188
The only thing I trust about you

481
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,223
is you'll be a greedy,
snaky motherfucker

482
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:28,492
- the second you see an angle.
- There is no angle.

483
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,294
There's always
an angle with you, man.

484
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,963
You're always hedging,
you're always working it.

485
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,834
You think this is
about money, Crunch?

486
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,569
Well, I got news for you.

487
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,273
Think again.

488
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:46,310
Gotta be a cheaper
way to do this.

489
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,379
<i>♪ Now tell me, baby</i>
<i>Tell me ♪</i>

490
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,381
<i>♪ What kind Of man are you?</i>

491
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:55,285
Just because he says he's sorry
doesn't make him a changed man.

492
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:59,323
Like just 'cause you like being drunk
doesn't make you an alcoholic.

493
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:00,624
Ah, shit. Lola. Lola.

494
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:04,394
Babe. Yeah. Hey.

495
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,431
Go. I need
to talk to Crunch.

496
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,435
What are you doin' with him?

497
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:13,537
Nicky told me you were out.

498
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,572
- Yeah.
- I told him you're back in.

499
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,007
Forget it.
This thing smells.

500
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,942
Crunch! We need the money.

501
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,011
How are we gonna
pay our bills?

502
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,913
Wow! She's good.

503
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:26,583
Oh. So, so you
made her do this?

504
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,919
No. Crunch needs this.

505
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:31,121
He needs me.

506
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,957
It's a brother thing.
You wouldn't understand.

507
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,660
Oh. Well, what I
understand is that,

508
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:40,030
that's my guy and
he doesn't need you.

509
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:45,135
Well, he needs someone to stop
him from taking dives for $800.

510
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,107
Take care.

511
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:05,222
All right. I'll do it.
But this one we do my way.

512
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:07,057
What did ya have in mind?

513
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,394
Well, let's just say things are
gonna get a little loud.

514
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,133
<i>That's where</i>
<i>the motorcycle kicks in.</i>

515
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,936
<i>Simultaneously, Francie</i>
<i>has broken out</i>

516
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:21,104
<i>of our giant,</i>
<i>ceramic Trojan Horse</i>

517
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,073
<i>with at least three minutes</i>
<i>of oxygen left.</i>

518
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,342
<i>Paddy's taking care of</i>
<i>the guards, after rappelling</i>

519
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,945
<i>through the ceiling and</i>
<i>changing out of his cat suit.</i>

520
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,314
<i>And Nicky's already</i>
<i>dealt with the main gate</i>

521
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:34,651
<i>using 2.5 pounds</i>
<i>of all-American TNT.</i>

522
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:37,487
<i>In and out in 4.25 minutes.</i>

523
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:41,725
This may be the worst idea
in the history of the world.

524
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,560
We just need a computer guy!

525
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,330
Crunch, there is no
computer guy!

526
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,807
There's no dude who can
feed a video loop to make

527
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,034
some security guard think
all is hunky dory,

528
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,638
while burglars in cat suits
rappel from the ceiling.

529
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,376
By the way, I think Uncle Paddy's black
Spandex days are way behind him.

530
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:02,446
And as for
your Trojan Horse thing,

531
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,748
well, I don't even know
where to begin with that.

532
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,217
I actually thought that
was kind of bad-ass.

533
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,019
Pardon me, you are who?

534
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,053
He's my apprentice.

535
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:13,056
Oh. So you're a wizard now?

536
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,025
Ah, fuck you, Nicky.

537
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:18,061
Look, the Reverend's got
somebody on the inside.

538
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,098
And we need to find out
who that is. Uncle Paddy,

539
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,633
I want you to call the Reverend
and get us a name.

540
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,619
Call me Ponch.

541
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,389
I'm Nicky. Paddy.
Francie. Crunch.

542
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:49,192
Those are some shitty aliases.
Y'all sound like chocolate bars.

543
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,329
Where's Twix?

544
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:56,767
Oh, wait. Crunch Calhoun?

545
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,569
No! Dude.

546
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:04,374
I once saw you almost jump six
cars in Buffalo. Changed my life.

547
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,077
Listen, the Reverend said that you
could help us out for 10,000.

548
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,735
Tempting, but not a chance. No.
I told the Reverend everything

549
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:10,747
I know for twice that.

550
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:14,084
And I got so sick from nerves I
didn't eat, shit or sleep for a week.

551
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,118
I'm not your guy.

552
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,654
If you were our guy.

553
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,191
If I were your guy, I'd go about
forgetting it.

554
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:25,095
There's 12 cameras, 12 of them.
That's one dozen cameras.

555
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,531
- Any in the storage room?
- No, but everywhere else.

556
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:31,301
Three guards, backup generator.
It's impossible.

557
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,203
I don't accept that.

558
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,172
Well, accept it, Snickers.

559
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,240
There's always a way.

560
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:40,343
All right, look.

561
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:42,345
I'll tell you what I told
the Reverend, OK?

562
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,815
That we called an expert.
She comes in Saturday at 10.

563
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,817
Don't call me again.

564
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:49,619
You said, "She".
Who's the "she"?

565
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:52,255
- Who?
- The expert.

566
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:54,524
Olga Something-Long.

567
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,527
Olga Something-Long?

568
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:01,832
Olga Panofsky-Cienfuegos?

569
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,733
Something like that.

570
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,472
Later, Crunch.

571
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,477
Wait, why... Who's,
who's Olga Something-Long?

572
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:14,845
A badly burnt bridge.

573
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:16,880
Oh, she was intoxicating.

574
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:20,183
Thanks to Uncle Fucks-A-Lot, there's
no way we can get near her.

575
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,318
Wait. Why not?

576
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,353
Old Sloppy Balls McCarthy here

577
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,222
slept with her and then
slept with her sister.

578
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,357
She was intoxicating too.

579
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,861
It's too bad. Olga would've
helped out for a little cash.

580
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,262
She wasn't exactly a nun.

581
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:34,364
No, she certainly was not.

582
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:36,266
There's gotta be like,
what, ten experts

583
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:38,435
in the whole country
they could've called.

584
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:41,139
Paddy probably balled half of them.
Let it go.

585
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:42,806
There's always another way.

586
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:46,676
Can we please stop
talking about old people fucking?

587
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:54,618
OK. I got the plan.

588
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,754
No. You've got "a plan."

589
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:59,789
This ain't a dictatorship,
Nicky.

590
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,591
We need a forger.
Let's call Dirty Ernie.

591
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:06,296
Dirty Ernie? No, if we
need a forger we call Guy.

592
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,831
What time is it in France?

593
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,706
- Hello?
<i>- Yeah, Guy, it's Nicky.</i>

594
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,343
I do not know you, Nicky.

595
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,279
The son-of-a-bitch
hung up on me.

596
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:23,914
Here. Come on.

597
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,553
- Hello?
- Hey, Guy.

598
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:32,822
Hey, Crunch!

599
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,625
Wow, no. Sorry. I just used up
the totality of my French there.

600
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:39,729
It's OK. When you speak French,
it's like a donkey cock right in my ear.

601
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:43,767
I'm on Paddy's phone so I'm gonna keep
it short. How ya fixed for work?

602
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,469
You are working? With Paddy?

603
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,939
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- With Nicky?</i>

604
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,907
Listen, I'll explain it all
to you if you come over here.

605
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,878
- To America? <i>Absolument.</i>
<i>- Not exactly America. Canada.</i>

606
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,713
Hm. America Light.

607
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,592
OK, you want to throw
things? Throw things, OK!

608
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,627
I don't give a shit! Motherfuck!

609
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,330
OK. OK. No, be careful with
that. No, don't do that, OK?

610
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,665
I want to see the piece of paper
that says you can go through that!

611
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,400
No, don't touch it.
That is $2,000...

612
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:21,871
He's clean. First Nicky,
then Paddy, now Guy.

613
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,374
- I'm telling you, something's up.
- This is bullshit!

614
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:27,310
- And you know it and you know it!
- I thought we had a 10-32.

615
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:32,449
Ten thirty-two? You trying
to impress me with numbers?

616
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:37,354
I'll give you an
impressive number: 52.

617
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:40,457
That's the number of millions
they said I stole.

618
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:42,926
I got a number for you: one,

619
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,328
as in you help me land this one
and you're out.

620
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,496
On the lives of my kids.

621
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,697
I've seen your kids.

622
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,266
You'd be better off
without them.

623
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,333
You're a cunt.

624
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:51,801
You wouldn't know a vagina

625
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,471
if it was four foot tall
and staring you in the face.

626
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:57,040
I'm gonna punch you
in the fucking...

627
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,679
- Aw, shit. Interpol.
- Interpol?!

628
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:04,547
No, no, no. Don't look.

629
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,951
There's no way
that's a coincidence.

630
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,686
That can't be a coincidence.

631
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,588
What do we do?
What's the play?

632
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,390
- I'll talk to him.
- No.

633
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,724
He'll talk to me.
He won't talk to you.

634
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:15,725
I said no!

635
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:18,028
Interpol's a real thing?

636
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,398
I'm not going to cut
my fuckin' leg off.

637
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,066
- Five minutes.
- Get outta here, Francie.

638
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,868
- Crunch... Yeah, OK.
- Now.

639
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,043
- Crunch.
- Sam?

640
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:38,481
Men of our vintage
should be retired.

641
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,852
You know, when I heard you were
working for the other side,

642
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:46,356
I just couldn't believe it.

643
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:49,092
At least tell me they don't
make you wear a wire.

644
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:52,095
No. They don't make me
wear a wire.

645
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:56,599
And I get to see
some fine art.

646
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:00,937
So... what do you think they're
talking about down there?

647
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,874
Still about the art, huh?

648
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,810
My mother got me into it.

649
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:11,715
We were always hard up,
but she did her best.

650
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:14,484
Worked as a barmaid
between kids.

651
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,121
When I was ten or 11,

652
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:22,392
she took me to
the V and A in London.

653
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,129
And I saw an object
that blew my mind.

654
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:32,902
It was a drinking cup fashioned
from a single piece of jade.

655
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:37,874
It was just a cup,
but it was perfect.

656
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,544
And it made me look at
everything differently.

657
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:46,816
Turner, Monet, Vermeer,
those guys kept my eyes open.

658
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,685
It was a feeling I had,

659
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:52,155
a completeness when
art touched me.

660
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:59,529
I only started getting into trouble
when I wanted to possess it.

661
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:05,101
And you...
what makes you do it?

662
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,503
Money.

663
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:09,639
Well, at least you're honest.

664
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,542
It's always nice to know...

665
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,912
who you can trust.

666
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,415
I'm gonna find this painting.

667
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:22,786
Not because I want to get
you or your brother in trouble.

668
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,989
I just want to hold it.

669
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,429
Let me ask you a question.

670
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,464
You ever seen the inside
of Sing-Sing?

671
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:37,066
- I haven't.
- 'Cause I know a lot of guys

672
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:40,103
who would like to
fuck you inside there.

673
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,073
Are you hitting on me?

674
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,844
I will...

675
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,446
Fuck!

676
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,081
It's been a breath of fresh air.

677
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,150
Looking good, Sam.

678
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,724
Interpol? Fucking Interpol?!

679
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,961
I'm not going to fuckin' prison!
I'm not cut out for that shit!

680
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,863
You see these fuckin' arms,
man?

681
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:10,200
These wet noodles will prevent
very few prison rapes.

682
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,535
Francie, I promise
you on my mother's eyes,

683
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,938
- you're gonna be fine.
- You don't know that.

684
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,476
You gotta trust me. Look, ever
since I've been back,

685
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:23,079
you've been there for me
like nobody else.

686
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:28,551
Now... I might have to
toss in the "f" word here

687
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:32,255
to make this a bit easier but...
I fuckin' love you, man.

688
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:34,791
OK, my turn.

689
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,627
That has to be Guy.

690
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:42,832
All right, Guy just landed
and we got a little problem.

691
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,202
<i>- Interpol.</i>
<i>- All right. Well, we'll adapt.</i>

692
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,238
OK?

693
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,544
So?

694
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,780
I'm curious to know what kind
of game you're running?

695
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:00,817
I was curious about your game.

696
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:04,621
We need to get on the same page.

697
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,789
What do we do first?

698
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,292
- First, we're gonna need a fake.
- How good must it look?

699
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,027
Good enough to fool the eye.

700
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,162
<i>Identical on the outside,</i>

701
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:15,632
<i>inside doesn't matter.</i>

702
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:18,067
You've got four days.

703
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:22,705
Crunch, I'm sorry for making fun of your
Trojan Horse idea because it actually plays.

704
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,708
We're gonna hide that fake
in a Trojan Horse of our own.

705
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,943
Something that draws attention.

706
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,012
Paddy, see what you can
come up with.

707
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:31,881
I got the perfect thing in mind.

708
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,750
I don't know,
what do you think?

709
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:36,953
It makes me feel...

710
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:40,256
safe and scared.

711
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,226
Mostly scared.

712
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,963
It's weird. It's
like it follows you.

713
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,833
First, you caress.

714
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:54,137
Too rough, she cracks.

715
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:57,173
Too soft, she will not
succumb to the touch.

716
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:03,112
Just right. It's you. Ahh.

717
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,849
Then we need to get our horse
into their corral.

718
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:08,685
But, how?

719
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,154
You say this border station,
they inspect everything.

720
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,190
Exactly. Everything going in,
everything going out.

721
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:17,293
<i>We can't walk in our fake</i>
<i>or walk out our original.</i>

722
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:20,863
So we're gonna get them
to take it in for us.

723
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:25,902
We're going to use our sullied
reputation to our advantage for once.

724
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,841
<i>- Crunch sets off the bells and whistles.</i>

725
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:35,612
<i>There's a standard 30-day</i>
<i>impound on undocumented art.</i>

726
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:38,348
<i>And, because it's Crunch,</i>
<i>convicted art thief,</i>

727
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,351
<i>transporting art without</i>
<i>the proper paperwork,</i>

728
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:44,387
<i>they're gonna call the gallery
where it was purchased right away,</i>

729
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,689
<i>to make sure</i>
<i>that it's not stolen.</i>

730
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:49,092
<i>But it ain't goin' anywhere</i>
<i>until Crunch shows up</i>

731
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:51,794
<i>with the proof of ownership,</i>
<i>which we've got.</i>

732
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,163
<i>And we know</i>
<i>where it's being kept.</i>

733
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:56,132
The toad is in the hole.

734
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,900
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>are you talking about?</i>

735
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:01,204
The fuckin' huge vagina is
in the border station now.

736
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,939
<i>Because of Crunch's record,</i>

737
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,974
<i>Interpol will be brought in.</i>

738
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:08,778
<i>But, since no crime has been</i>
<i>committed, they can't touch us.</i>

739
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,014
What the hell
am I looking at?

740
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:14,250
It's four foot high and
staring you in the face.

741
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,853
And on the day,
what about Interpol?

742
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:19,255
They're going to be watching us,
which we need to fix.

743
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:23,760
Francie and I will distract them while the
switch goes down at the border station.

744
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:27,730
But most important thing is we've
gotta deal with Olga Something-Long.

745
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:29,298
Paddy?

746
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,300
Well, that'll be something hard.

747
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:34,370
Things between Olga and me
are rough as a bear's arse.

748
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,938
She's got to miss
that appointment.

749
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,374
But, more importantly,
is we need those forms.

750
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,978
- No paperwork, no access.
- I'll start tomorrow.

751
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,120
Olga, darlin'.

752
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,456
Oh, no.

753
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:56,025
No, no, no, no,
you don't get to do this.

754
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,195
It took me years to forget.

755
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,832
You are dead to me.
You are dead!

756
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,434
I'm not asking
for forgiveness.

757
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:06,969
God can forgive me,
that's his job.

758
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:09,405
You have no control over me.

759
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,007
We should never be together.

760
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:12,909
I hate you.

761
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:16,312
You crushed me heart
and you stained me soul.

762
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:18,314
Fuck you.

763
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:21,217
No, darlin'.

764
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,455
Fuck you.

765
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,932
Are we ready to do this?

766
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,505
Let's roll!

767
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,375
Just, uh, try to act natural.

768
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:49,045
Yeah. I, I don't
know what that means.

769
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:51,748
What do we have here?

770
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:57,220
Two perps, one box, red.

771
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:59,322
I betcha there's
something in that.

772
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,893
Here we go.
They're on the move.

773
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:06,763
Thank you.
I needed to know that.

774
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:10,466
Please continue to point out the
obvious to me as it comes up.

775
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:13,402
- You're starting the car.
- OK. That's enough.

776
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:14,837
You're putting
the car into gear.

777
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,373
I so very much want to stab you

778
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,142
in the face and throat.

779
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:21,544
With your magic pen, no doubt.

780
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,186
Saturday, ten AM.

781
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:32,889
Guy walks into
the border station.

782
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:34,323
And, man, will you
please wear a suit?

783
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,959
No offense, but you look
like a slutty elf.

784
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:40,863
What... is "elf"?

785
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:44,167
<i>The station gets</i>
<i>a call the day before</i>

786
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:46,235
<i>from a woman</i>
<i>they think is Olga.</i>

787
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,437
I cannot make it,
but my colleague, Philippe,

788
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,840
<i>- he should be there.</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

789
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:54,410
Oh. I think I chipped a tooth.

790
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,257
<i>Olga gets a call</i>
<i>the day before from a man</i>

791
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,892
<i>she thinks is</i>
<i>from the border.</i>

792
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:13,296
So, while we'll not be
requiring your services,

793
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:16,032
we will, of course, still pay.

794
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,548
Yeah, where're we at?

795
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,016
I got Guy on the other line.

796
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,219
OK, I'm in. How
will I know where it is?

797
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:38,387
It's pink and
three feet tall.

798
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,356
You're a Frenchman,
you'll find it.

799
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,167
<i>Like Ponch said, with no
security cameras in the room,</i>

800
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:54,003
<i>Guy can make the switch.</i>

801
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,205
All right.
We got an hour to go.

802
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,976
- Did you get the nylons?
- I did indeed.

803
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:02,445
- One?
- Well, it says one pair.

804
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:05,214
- One pair? Like a pair of pants.
- Yeah.

805
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,450
Well, I'm sorry,
Mr. Condescending,

806
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:09,185
I don't buy a whole lot
of fuckin' pantyhose.

807
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:11,020
- Fishnets?
- Yes.

808
00:48:11,022 --> 00:48:12,188
Put these over our heads

809
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,590
we'll look like
a couple of waffles.

810
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,652
This is just great.

811
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:44,186
OK, let's go.

812
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,135
- Yeah?
- Finished.

813
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:01,637
All right,
Crunch, you're up.

814
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:18,621
No. Something's not right.

815
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,092
OK, here we go.

816
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:24,593
What are you doing?

817
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,429
This is usually how it works.

818
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:28,965
Perps go on the move,
cops get moving.

819
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,034
A little pro tip for you:
"perps", short for perpetrators.

820
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:36,472
Just trust me for a second.
Don't switch the engine on.

821
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,713
Seriously,
what are we doing?

822
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:45,381
Why do I listen to you?

823
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,484
You're being distracted.

824
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:52,021
Like at the Quebec airport.

825
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,095
The border.
They're at the border.

826
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,440
They stopped following us.

827
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,621
Pick up. Come on, pick up.

828
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,527
Two minutes away.
Come on!

829
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,696
Whoo!

830
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,082
I'm clear.

831
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,559
<i>♪ Stand up</i>

832
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,296
I'm trying to,
I'm trying to. This is what I...

833
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:11,100
Hey! Hey! Here we go.
Here we go.

834
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:15,704
Whoo!

835
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,642
Atta boy, Crunch!

836
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,747
All right, just like
the old days.

837
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:27,450
Yeah, the old days
were you threw me to the cops?

838
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:29,752
Or the old days where a one-eyed
pirate steals my bike?

839
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:33,522
Uh, uh, uh.
Now, now, gentlemen.

840
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,558
Let us drink to James.

841
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,661
- To James!
- To James!

842
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,365
And to Nicky Boy.
One for the ages.

843
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,841
- Now you take a bow, Guy.
<i>- Moi?</i>

844
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:55,644
Four days to fake
a 500-year-old masterpiece.

845
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:57,513
Oh, to have your talent, lad.

846
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:00,649
It was an inspired effort.
I admit.

847
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,785
But I am no Yves Chaudron.

848
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:06,355
Who's that,
Yeeves Show-row?

849
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:07,623
Stay, Crunch.
You'll like this.

850
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,225
Nah, I've heard
this tale a time or two.

851
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:11,293
- I gotta take a piss.
- Come on, Crunch.

852
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:13,429
Wait. Who's Yves Shmo-boh?

853
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,831
I shall tell you
of Yves Chaudron.

854
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:18,901
For this is a story
of inspiration.

855
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:21,604
He was everything
I aspire to be.

856
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:24,673
A master, a legend.

857
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:28,744
A man so gifted his work
would make angels cry.

858
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:34,583
He was the one true talent behind
the greatest art theft in history.

859
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:38,320
The theft of the Mona Lisa.

860
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,625
<i>The story begins</i>
<i>in Paris, 1911.</i>

861
00:52:42,627 --> 00:52:45,161
<i>Not with Chaudron,</i>
<i>but with an Italian,</i>

862
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:47,296
<i>a poor carpenter named Perugia</i>

863
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,465
<i>who, a few months</i>
<i>before the theft,</i>

864
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,367
works a contract at the Louvre.

865
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:55,171
<i>As with any menial job,</i>
<i>he learns many menial things.</i>

866
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:56,906
<i>Such as where the</i>
<i>entrances and exits are,</i>

867
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:59,675
<i>the guards' names,</i>
<i>rotations and the like.</i>

868
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:03,746
<i>Little did he know that this
otherwise useless information</i>

869
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,282
<i>would prove to be</i>
<i>quite important.</i>

870
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,552
<i>For it is when</i>
<i>Perugia's contract ends</i>

871
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:12,488
<i>that his destiny begins.</i>

872
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:16,258
<i>Fate taps Perugia</i>
<i>on the shoulder.</i>

873
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,529
<i>Eduardo de Valfierno,</i>
<i>a criminal mastermind.</i>

874
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:24,833
<i>Valfierno asks Perugia</i>
<i>to steal the Mona Lisa</i>

875
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:29,371
<i>for $30,000.</i>
<i>It's like a million back then,</i>

876
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:33,442
<i>an offer a poor carpenter</i>
<i>could never refuse.</i>

877
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:36,345
<i>The adventure of the theft</i>
<i>is a story in and of itself.</i>

878
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:39,682
<i>In short, through luck,</i>
<i>cunning, lazy security</i>

879
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:41,884
<i>and the horrible disadvantage</i>
<i>of being Italian,</i>

880
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,452
<i>he actually succeeds.</i>

881
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,888
<i>The carpenter</i>
<i>steals the Mona Lisa</i>

882
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,958
and the theft makes world news.

883
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,264
<i>As promised,</i>
<i>he produces the Mona Lisa.</i>

884
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:56,799
<i>Valfierno produces the money.</i>

885
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,834
But he makes a strange request.

886
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:01,403
<i>He asks him to hold on to her</i>
<i>just a little longer</i>

887
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,306
<i>so he can arrange for</i>
<i>her transit overseas.</i>

888
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:07,309
<i>Perugia agrees and waits,</i>

889
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,912
<i>and waits and waits.</i>

890
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,481
His story ends here.

891
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,618
And it is now that I tell you
of Yves Chaudron.

892
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,753
<i>Six months before the theft,</i>

893
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,289
<i>Valfierno commissions</i>
<i>Yves Chaudron,</i>

894
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,757
<i>the world's greatest forger,</i>

895
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:25,027
<i>to reproduce the Mona Lisa</i>
<i>six times and perfect,</i>

896
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:28,330
<i>an Herculean task only</i>
<i>Chaudron could accomplish.</i>

897
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:30,299
Valfierno then sails to America

898
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,701
<i>and finds six of the greediest</i>
<i>art collectors</i>

899
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,937
<i>and poses this question</i>
<i>to them:</i>

900
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,873
<i>"Should the Mona Lisa</i>
<i>suddenly become available,</i>

901
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,676
<i>would you pay three hundred</i>
<i>thousand dollars for it?"</i>

902
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:44,947
<i>He asks all six,</i>
<i>and all six say, "Yes."</i>

903
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:49,285
<i>And that is when Valfierno pays
Perugia to steal the Mona Lisa.</i>

904
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,754
<i>He then ships</i>
<i>Chaudron's perfect fakes</i>

905
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:55,324
<i>and collects $1.8 million.</i>

906
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:58,394
<i>A fortune beyond</i>
<i>comprehension.</i>

907
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:05,367
<i>You see, all he needed</i>
<i>was the news of the theft,</i>

908
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,671
<i>not the Mona Lisa.</i>

909
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:14,810
<i>To him, she herself,</i>
<i>is worthless.</i>

910
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:20,849
And that is the story of
the theft of the Mona Lisa.

911
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:26,388
I first heard that story
when I was a small boy.

912
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:31,560
I knew even then I wanted to have the
skills to pull something that great off.

913
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:32,861
And that's why
I do what I do.

914
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,897
I do it for the ladies.

915
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,603
Well, here's to tomorrow,

916
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:44,673
and the Reverend gets his goods
and we get our just rewards.

917
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,943
- Tomorrow!
- Tomorrow!

918
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,960
Ohhh, fuck.

919
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:07,963
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

920
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:12,634
I, I taste an ashtray
and battery acid

921
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:15,504
and, like, stripper perfume.

922
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:17,473
So, we headed for Detroit?

923
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,708
Finish things up with
the Reverend, or what?

924
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,144
Yeah, that's right.
We all just pile into the car

925
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:25,748
like the Brady Bunch and just
breeze on into the States, right?

926
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,549
They already flagged me
for coming over here.

927
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,385
- Yeah, me too.
- Me too.

928
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:30,886
They don't like
me a lot either, so...

929
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,021
what exactly is your plan?

930
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:37,459
Well, we need someone with a
clean sheet. Francie, you're up.

931
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:38,794
Me?!

932
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,570
Really? Why am I
wearing this shit?

933
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,072
Because Interpol
knows what you look like.

934
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:53,509
OK, but don't the Amish ride
horse and carriages?

935
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:57,045
- Well, you're progressive.
- I can't fucking do this!

936
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,516
Well, you better get your best
Brando on, hoss, 'cause we need you.

937
00:57:00,518 --> 00:57:03,452
Yeah, look, Francie,
it's not <i>The King's Speech.</i>

938
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,422
Come here.
You got two lines:

939
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:09,158
"Going to Detroit."
And "Nothing to declare."

940
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,593
You're gonna be great.

941
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,763
- I'll meet him there.
- Oh. Will you?

942
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,498
Yeah.

943
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,100
Hey, look, somebody's got
to be in Detroit

944
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:19,701
to close the deal
with the Reverend.

945
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:21,837
Nicky, I'm goin' with ya.

946
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,939
- We're both hiding in the trunk.
- The trunk?

947
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,442
I'm not hidin' in a trunk.

948
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:29,178
Well, then no one's
going to Detroit.

949
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,780
'Cause if you're alone when you
get your digits on that money,

950
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,449
we'll never see you again.

951
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:38,020
All right, man. Fine.

952
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:40,556
Pop it, Francie.

953
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:43,459
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, what are you doing?

954
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:44,927
Hopefully, you
won't have to know.

955
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:48,230
Yes, sir. But if you
just give me...

956
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:51,467
Sir, we are so very
close on this. We just...

957
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,671
No, I realize I'm not supposed
to be in the field,

958
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,939
but that's not the...

959
00:57:56,941 --> 00:58:00,108
OK. Yeah.

960
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,479
<i>Are we clear?</i>
<i>Are we clear? Goodbye.</i>

961
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:10,486
OK. We need to just
start at the beginning here, OK?

962
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,555
Square one...

963
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,727
art.

964
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,498
- They pay you for this?
- Shut up!

965
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,202
Do you often feel that your life
is just passing you by?

966
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:32,074
I cannot even be
in the same room as you!

967
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:43,852
OK. OK, Francie.

968
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,224
I got an idea.

969
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:53,028
I think we can make a lot more
money off that Gospel.

970
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,963
Hold out for
more from the Reverend?

971
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,032
No, we don't
even deliver it to him.

972
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:00,035
OK. I fail to see
how that makes us rich.

973
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,804
Guy telling that
story about the Mona Lisa

974
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:04,640
got me thinking.

975
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,875
There's a real parallel here.

976
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,879
Great. Parallel.
Not interested.

977
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,881
Listen, don't dismiss the idea
out of spite.

978
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,016
Not interested.

979
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:15,984
Hear me out!

980
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:21,089
Uncle Paddy can come up
with at least ten more buyers.

981
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:24,293
And we can get Guy to duplicate
a book for each one of them.

982
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:28,564
We contact the gallery, we let
them know their book is stolen.

983
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:30,832
The news hits the paper
and boom.

984
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:33,902
Meanwhile we ship off
ten copies to ten buyers.

985
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,671
Each one thinks
they have the original.

986
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,940
Goddamn it if it's not perfect.

987
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,279
You know...

988
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:48,183
I think we could make
half a mil. per book.

989
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:51,219
No, you know, twice that.

990
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,024
- You know how much that is?
- Ten million.

991
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,960
That's right.

992
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,801
Uh, all right, boys.

993
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:09,171
We're here so just be quiet, OK?

994
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:11,907
- Just be cool!
- Two lines!

995
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,710
"Going to Detroit!
Nothing to declare!"

996
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:15,844
OK, I know!

997
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,713
Act normal. Be normal.
Act normal.

998
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:20,115
Just be a cool guy.
You're a cool guy, Francie.

999
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,719
You're a fuckin' cool guy.
I am not cut out for this.

1000
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,991
- Citizenship...
- My name is Francie Tobin!

1001
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:31,927
Well, that's great, son.

1002
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,762
- Where you headed?
- Canada!

1003
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:35,330
Uh, you're heading in the wrong
direction...

1004
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:37,265
Arrgghh!

1005
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,067
Canada's, that's where
I came from.

1006
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,303
Where I'm... Detroit
is where I'm heading,

1007
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:45,073
not, not Canada,
which is where I'm from.

1008
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,908
Anything to declare?

1009
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:50,145
No. Not...
not even a little bit.

1010
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,848
Uh, your beard's falling off.

1011
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:58,020
Oh. That's, that's 'cause
I'm, I'm in a play.

1012
01:00:58,022 --> 01:00:59,655
What's the play called?

1013
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,690
<i>Witness, The Musical.</i>

1014
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:03,358
<i>Witness,</i> exclamation mark.

1015
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,795
Are you sure there's nothing
you want to declare?

1016
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,764
The play is terrible.

1017
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,368
- Anything in the trunk?
- No!

1018
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:17,005
Are you absolutely positive

1019
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,306
you have nothing to declare?

1020
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,178
I'm sorry?

1021
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,380
Do you think I have
smugglers in my trunk?

1022
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:28,150
- No!
- I have two American thieves

1023
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:31,853
in the trunk of this car that I'm
crossing your border with right now.

1024
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,822
Please! Please, have a look.

1025
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:38,193
See, see all the criminal activity
happening in my trunk right now!

1026
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,162
Open the trunk, sir.

1027
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:42,330
- Open the...
- Open the trunk, just open the trunk.

1028
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:44,866
- So I'll just... Oh!
- Nicky, Nicky, Nicky!

1029
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,768
Yep. Got 'em. Got 'em.

1030
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,937
- On the count of three.
- Drugs, son?

1031
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:50,072
Oh, no. I'm good, buddy.

1032
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:51,807
No, I mean, are you on...

1033
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:52,941
Just open the trunk, please.

1034
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:54,843
- Yeah, OK.
- One.

1035
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,978
Two. Three.

1036
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,716
OK, here we go!

1037
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,321
Alrighty, looks like
you're good to go.

1038
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,225
Uhh! I just need
to tell you something.

1039
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:14,496
I liked <i>Predator Two.</i>

1040
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:17,065
Well, yeah, I didn't mind
<i>Predator Two.</i>

1041
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,201
- It's not bad.
- Its OK. Danny Glover.

1042
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:21,236
- You can't go wrong.
- No.

1043
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,371
- Break a leg.
- Oh, yeah! Thank you.

1044
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:25,273
- Because I'm an actor.
- Yeah.

1045
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:27,809
Oh, fuck, this sucks!

1046
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:47,963
<i>♪ I wandered in</i>
<i>late one night ♪</i>

1047
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:54,269
<i>♪ Signs all said "open"</i>
<i>But there was no one in sight ♪</i>

1048
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,307
- I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.
- Wait your turn.

1049
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:01,510
Come on!

1050
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,178
I'm never doing this shit again!

1051
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,280
- You motherfucker!
- No, no! Hold on!

1052
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,948
What the fuck is this!
Come on!

1053
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:10,051
- Fuck you!
- Hold on! Hey!

1054
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:11,453
Fuck the both of you!

1055
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:12,921
- You fucked up, man.
- I fucked up!

1056
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:14,256
All right,
all right, all right!

1057
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:16,391
I promise you,
I'm not gonna hit the kid.

1058
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:18,994
- All right.
- You fucker!

1059
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:21,163
- What did you do that for?
- Fuck you! Oh!

1060
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:24,099
You had to do it.
You proud of yourself?

1061
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:26,935
- You motherfucker! Ah, you motherfucker.
- Please!

1062
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:29,571
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, man. How's business?

1063
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:34,209
It's fucking slow, man.

1064
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,952
All right,
what is this place?

1065
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,420
His office
is on the third floor.

1066
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,989
I think he paid like
three grand for the whole place.

1067
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,525
He overpaid.

1068
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,195
This is a golden
opportunity.

1069
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:55,564
I'm not doing this for me.

1070
01:03:55,566 --> 01:03:58,867
You know I'm flush.
I'm doing this for you.

1071
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:01,369
We're dropping this off, we're making
a hell of a decent score here.

1072
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:02,871
And in five minutes
we're going home.

1073
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:04,606
Give me a reason.
Give me one reason.

1074
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:08,410
OK. Where do we find the money
to pay for these fakes?

1075
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:11,046
It cost Guy ten grand
to fake one.

1076
01:04:11,048 --> 01:04:13,315
These fakes would have to
stand up to carbon dating

1077
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:15,016
and expert scrutiny shit.

1078
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,918
Ten grand a book,
that's a hundred grand.

1079
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,987
- I can front it.
- You got a 100 grand laying around, Nicky?

1080
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:21,156
Yes, I do.

1081
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,928
You know,
I guess this is it.

1082
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:28,864
This could have been big.

1083
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:32,000
We could have made history.

1084
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:44,112
Damn it.

1085
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,417
All right, let's go downstairs
and talk about it.

1086
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:58,293
A million per book.
Ten million bucks, guys.

1087
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:01,396
- You interested?
- Of course, I'm fucking interested.

1088
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,965
- Wonderful.
- Uncle Paddy?

1089
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:05,600
Ten buyers, I can find.
Maybe more.

1090
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,402
No, no, no.
Let's stick with ten.

1091
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,204
Let's not get greedy here.

1092
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:12,140
- Guy, when can you get started?
- Today. Now.

1093
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:15,176
It will take me maybe
three weeks... No, one month.

1094
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:17,946
- I just need money.
- OK, 100 grand, that's covered.

1095
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:20,015
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1096
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:22,384
Seven hundred,
fifty thousand, minimum.

1097
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:24,319
You just made
one for ten thousand.

1098
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:28,223
No. I made the cover for ten
grand. The pages are total shit.

1099
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:32,294
And if you want these to pass the carbon
dating and the professional scrutiny,

1100
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:33,995
seven hundred fifty.

1101
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:35,497
Do we need
to carbon date them?

1102
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:38,033
With our buyers,
most certainly.

1103
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:41,269
That's it, man.
Let's go take it back.

1104
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,471
All right, look.

1105
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:47,075
I could come up with
about $300,000.

1106
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,176
- But...
- What?

1107
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:49,945
Gonna take me a couple days.

1108
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:51,479
We still need 450.

1109
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:54,316
I can pull together
a hundred thousand.

1110
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:56,151
I can do one hundred.

1111
01:05:56,153 --> 01:06:00,188
OK. That's five.
We're still 250 short.

1112
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,424
Yeah.

1113
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,294
OK, we'll be home at dawn.

1114
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,029
Let's figure this out tomorrow.

1115
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:09,497
OK.

1116
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,435
- Crunch.
- What?

1117
01:06:13,437 --> 01:06:16,404
- How much money have you got?
- I got nothin'.

1118
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,277
If there was ever a reason
to mortgage your home...

1119
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,745
Oh, no, no, no, no, man.
I'm not doing that.

1120
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,014
No, not the house.
That's all I got.

1121
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:28,616
If we pull this off,
you can buy ten of 'em.

1122
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:31,186
Look, man, I just...

1123
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:32,420
Look, I don't know, OK?

1124
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:33,555
Listen, I gotta think about it.

1125
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:35,223
I wanna run it by Lola.

1126
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:37,392
Well, don't take too long.
We don't have time to lose.

1127
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:41,096
Don't talk to me
about lost time, Nicky.

1128
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,410
I know what you want.

1129
01:06:55,412 --> 01:07:00,148
Good. 'Cause you're
gonna need to talk to him.

1130
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:02,684
He will never give
you all that money.

1131
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,252
No, but he'll
give it to you.

1132
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:06,521
- To me?
- He trusts you.

1133
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:09,424
And we're gonna be wiring money
all over the world.

1134
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,694
You're the only one that's not
on any watch list.

1135
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,730
- Francie isn't.
- Francie hasn't taken a bath in six weeks.

1136
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,667
Come on.

1137
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,038
Can you convince him?

1138
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,310
It's no good. It's no good.
She's making you, Crunch.

1139
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,079
She's probably
fucking Nicky.

1140
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,815
Hey, easy. Easy,
Francie, come on.

1141
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:36,584
We should just walk.
I mean, he's juicing you

1142
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:39,621
for hundreds of thousands
of dollars, Crunch.

1143
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:44,092
Cowards die many times
before their actual death.

1144
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:46,828
The brave, only but once.

1145
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,696
Is that Julius Caesar?

1146
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:53,802
Yes! Look, I know how you feel
about Nicky, believe me.

1147
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,604
But this...

1148
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:02,177
this is the one we're
all gonna be remembered for.

1149
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,813
Ah, Jesus Murphy.

1150
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,108
Ah, you waste no time.

1151
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:35,110
What can I say?
I'm excited.

1152
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:37,245
OK. Great, we're all here.

1153
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:40,348
So, starting tomorrow,
there'll be no contact.

1154
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:43,384
During that time period
Paddy will have made the sales,

1155
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:45,353
Guy will have completed
the books.

1156
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:46,888
Crunch will be ready
to ship them.

1157
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:49,824
And Lola will be
handling the money.

1158
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,660
In a month's time,
we'll contact Amsterdam,

1159
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:56,764
the news will get out, we ship
the books and we get rich.

1160
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,200
Ha. The Reverend's
gonna be some pissed.

1161
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:00,335
I'll take care of the Reverend.

1162
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:01,603
I'll call you
with his number.

1163
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:04,372
All right, Nicky, I just
gotta say this.

1164
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:07,375
If you're gettin' ready to
do me wrong here somehow,

1165
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:10,145
this is your chance. Just don't
take this and all is forgiven, man.

1166
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,679
No harm, no foul.

1167
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:17,218
Crunch, I'm sorry
about what happened.

1168
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,554
OK, I fucked up.

1169
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:21,789
I wish I could do it
all over again.

1170
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,160
But I can't.
We gotta move on.

1171
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:31,199
Look, you've always wanted to do
something big, we all have.

1172
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,800
This is our chance.

1173
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:38,773
Come on, man, let's do
this together, like brothers.

1174
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,381
OK, man, I'm in.

1175
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:50,552
All right.
Here's to us, huh?

1176
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:52,487
Right!

1177
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,658
Gettin' our just rewards.

1178
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,442
Truly breathtaking, it is.

1179
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:17,946
Oh, bloody hell. Hey, Midge.
How you fixed for quarters?

1180
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:20,315
- Dirty Ernie.
- Hey, Nicky!

1181
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:23,585
- Give us a hug!
- I'm not a big hugger, Ernie.

1182
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:28,223
Huh. Midge, go take a walk.

1183
01:10:28,225 --> 01:10:30,225
I'll see you at the hotel.

1184
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:34,429
Now watch it, Ernie.

1185
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:36,231
The hookers in this town
aren't the cleanest.

1186
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:38,700
Hey! That's my wife.

1187
01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:41,236
Oh. Ernie, I'm sorry.

1188
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:45,406
Yeah, it's just, I guess the fashion
in Europe is so much further ahead...

1189
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:50,411
I'm pulling your chain,
mate. That's a hooker.

1190
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,383
So, what's the plan?

1191
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:02,657
OK. You're gonna knock off ten copies
of the Gospel According to James.

1192
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:04,926
- All right.
- Simultaneously,

1193
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:07,729
Guy De Cornet will be in that
building doing the same.

1194
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:09,297
No. He sickens me, he does.

1195
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:10,965
His work is so ostentatious...

1196
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:14,269
Oh, forget him.
Just focus on your own work.

1197
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:15,770
Here's a key to the building.

1198
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,573
All right.

1199
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:20,575
Guy's books will be perfect.

1200
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:23,344
They'll pass carbon dating,
expert analysis, everything.

1201
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:27,882
However, your copies, they won't
need any of that carbon dating crap.

1202
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:30,018
They'll just need to
look convincing.

1203
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,786
Oh, that's much, much cheaper.

1204
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:33,621
But tell me this, why?

1205
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,491
Why bother getting all that
proper paper for Guy's books?

1206
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:39,060
Why... why bother
working that lot at all?

1207
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:41,963
Because I plan on sending
your ten copies of the book

1208
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,599
to the buyers before
they can send theirs.

1209
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:46,836
This way, you and I can
split it two ways instead

1210
01:11:46,862 --> 01:11:48,936
of me having to cut it
up five ways with them.

1211
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:51,506
I see. Family's family,
but money's money, eh?

1212
01:11:51,508 --> 01:11:55,476
Yeah, well, let me tell you
something about family.

1213
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:58,980
Crunch would do the same damn thing
if he had any brains in his head.

1214
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:02,583
Yeah, but then he
delivers his books

1215
01:12:02,585 --> 01:12:05,320
a week after you've
delivered yours,

1216
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:09,424
they're gonna crucify him,
and that greasy twat, Guy.

1217
01:12:09,426 --> 01:12:12,360
But then they're gonna come
after you, my fine chum.

1218
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,564
I won't be around.

1219
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,933
<i>Yeah?</i>

1220
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:22,003
Nicky, you still want
the Reverend's number?

1221
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:25,873
- Text it to me, Paddy.
<i>- Consider it done.</i>

1222
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:35,717
<i>- Reverend: Yeah, what?
- Yeah. Hi, Reverend. It's Nicky Calhoun.</i>

1223
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:40,621
What? Nicky Calhoun?

1224
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:42,890
What are you doin'
callin' me?

1225
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:45,960
Listen, I just wanted to let you
know that we've got your book

1226
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:49,731
and just wanted to give you a
heads up, there's a slight delay.

1227
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:51,632
<i>- Delay?</i>
<i>- Right. With the delivery time.</i>

1228
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,668
It might take a month or so.

1229
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:59,474
Look, I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.
Don't call me again.

1230
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:02,543
Listen, I'm gonna come see you

1231
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,846
and we can discuss it then.
How's that?

1232
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:10,084
Reverend? Reverend?

1233
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,556
<i>Not here. Leave a message.</i>

1234
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:16,958
<i>Reverend, again,</i>
<i>I apologize about the delay.</i>

1235
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,526
<i>I'm on my way to Detroit</i>

1236
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:20,428
<i>so you and I can have</i>
<i>a face-to-face.</i>

1237
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,677
Reverend?

1238
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:06,607
<i>I think he paid, like,
three grand for the whole place.</i>

1239
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:09,477
<i>Why is it I've not heard that
such as famous book as yours was nicked?</i>

1240
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:12,925
Paddy, come on.

1241
01:14:12,951 --> 01:14:15,950
Just listen to the story,
before you say no, lads.

1242
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,685
There's a good moral
to this story.

1243
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:19,520
<i>Paddy McCarthy here.</i>

1244
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:21,222
<i>- Leave me a message and I'll call you back.
- Fuck!</i>

1245
01:14:21,224 --> 01:14:24,125
<i>The special Gospel.</i>

1246
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,726
<i>Last month,</i>
<i>at the Vanderloos Gallery...</i>

1247
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:29,997
I'd like to report a theft.

1248
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,699
<i>I don't understand.</i>

1249
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:33,034
<i>We're not the police.</i>

1250
01:14:33,036 --> 01:14:35,136
No, no, no.
It's a book in your collection.

1251
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:37,638
A Gospel printed by
the Gutenberg Press.

1252
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,640
Yeah. I think you are mistaken.

1253
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,176
No, no, no. It's the Gospel
According to James and it's a fake.

1254
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:44,745
- Check it out.
<i>- I can't do that.</i>

1255
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:47,048
- Why not?
- We are sculpture museum.

1256
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:52,153
We have no books or paintings.
We have only sculpture.

1257
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,956
<i>The Reverend's</i>
<i>got somebody on the inside.</i>

1258
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:56,958
We have an
expert coming in on Saturday.

1259
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:58,259
Paddy, get us a name.

1260
01:14:58,261 --> 01:15:00,962
<i>We're sorry. The number
you have reached is not in service.</i>

1261
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:03,664
- Later, Crunch!
<i>- There's gotta be like, what...</i>

1262
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,166
Fuck!

1263
01:15:04,179 --> 01:15:06,100
ten experts in the country
<i>they could have called.</i>

1264
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:08,503
<i>- Olga Something-Long.</i>
<i>- Hello?</i>

1265
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:09,604
<i>It's Nicky Calhoun.</i>

1266
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:11,939
Have you... Have you seen Paddy?

1267
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:14,075
- What?
- Did you fuckin' see Paddy?

1268
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:16,644
He left a couple of days ago.

1269
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:20,014
<i>What about the Gospel? Did Customs
ask you to look at the Gospel?</i>

1270
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,817
- Gospel?
- The fuckin' Gospel According to James!

1271
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:25,219
<i>Did they ask you to look at it?</i>

1272
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,122
<i>What?</i>

1273
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,106
And that is the story of
the theft of the Mona Lisa.

1274
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:50,278
<i>You just took five and half of the
best years of my life away, Nicky.</i>

1275
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,146
<i>Nicky Boy,</i>

1276
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,681
you'll pay the piper for
what you did to Dennis.

1277
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:54,982
<i>I'll see to it meself.</i>

1278
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:56,183
I'll take care of the Reverend.

1279
01:15:56,185 --> 01:15:57,818
I'll call you
with his number.

1280
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:00,087
Yeah?

1281
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:03,190
Nicky, want
the Reverend's number?

1282
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,102
We could have made history.

1283
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,580
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1284
01:16:25,582 --> 01:16:27,882
Lola, pick up the phone.

1285
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:30,785
Call me! We got a problem!

1286
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,757
So, so what are you
telling me? You don't trust me.

1287
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:39,760
It's not like I
don't trust you. Come on.

1288
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:42,663
- Everybody's fuckin' lyin' to me.
- Nobody's lyin'.

1289
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:46,200
It's like, uh, well, I'll tell you
what it's like, it's like Claudius.

1290
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:49,670
For my money, the greatest
Roman Emperor of them all.

1291
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:55,076
You know how Claudius survived some of
the most brutal rulers of his time?

1292
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:58,346
How he outlived all those crazy-assed
homicidal family members?

1293
01:16:58,348 --> 01:17:00,748
- How?
- Played the fool.

1294
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,118
Played the fool
and fooled them all.

1295
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,754
Even those he loved.

1296
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:11,359
Bick.

1297
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:14,729
Uh, OK.

1298
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,966
Hello?

1299
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:21,702
Four twenty-six?

1300
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,205
OK.

1301
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:32,847
How long have you
been cooking this thing up?

1302
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:35,349
Well, you remember
Lola's little hot tub party?

1303
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:37,752
And great men don't
miss their fate.

1304
01:17:37,754 --> 01:17:39,954
I missed mine, Francie.

1305
01:17:39,956 --> 01:17:44,859
I was probably staring at it the
whole time and I just missed it.

1306
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:48,229
So everyone was in on this
except for my lanky ass.

1307
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:51,265
People are predictable Francis,
you, me.

1308
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:53,134
If we weren't,
we'd just spend all our time

1309
01:17:53,136 --> 01:17:55,803
trying to figure out what crazy
shit everybody else was up to.

1310
01:17:55,805 --> 01:17:59,273
<i>All I did was</i>
<i>drop off a sculpture.</i>

1311
01:17:59,275 --> 01:18:02,109
<i>And then picked it on up.</i>

1312
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:05,312
I just needed to plant the idea and
let his imagination do the rest.

1313
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:08,182
<i>Saturday, ten AM. Guy</i>
<i>walks into the border station.</i>

1314
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,218
- I got Guy on the other line.
- OK. I'm in.

1315
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,408
Yeah.

1316
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:55,162
- You got a warrant?
- I don't need a warrant. I'm not a cop.

1317
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:57,465
But these guys are.

1318
01:18:57,467 --> 01:18:59,900
Domenic Calhoun,
we've received information

1319
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:03,270
giving us probable cause
for a search.

1320
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:05,406
Look who we have here.

1321
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,309
Georges Seurat.

1322
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:12,813
"Model, Rear-View," 1887.

1323
01:19:12,815 --> 01:19:14,181
Pointillist phase.

1324
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,126
This is so beautiful.

1325
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,263
I love all the little dots.

1326
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,799
It's very artistic.

1327
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,812
- You got it?
- I do.

1328
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,515
Where's your filly?

1329
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:50,417
She'll be here, Paddy.

1330
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:54,955
The lady has $750 grand
of our capital.

1331
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,793
I don't know,
<i>mon frere,</i> she's maybe...

1332
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:01,929
How do you say it?
The scheming bitch.

1333
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:04,064
Hey, guys, she's doin'
something, all right?

1334
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:07,067
Says she's got some kind
of surprise for me.

1335
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:09,370
She's just runnin' late,
that's all.

1336
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,940
We should just go.
We should leave.

1337
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:16,010
Yeah, Crunch, bud,
I love you.

1338
01:20:16,012 --> 01:20:18,946
You know I'm with you.

1339
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:22,049
I really think she
just fuckin' split.

1340
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:25,553
Just as likely to see a police cruiser as
her car comin' around the corner, lad.

1341
01:20:31,293 --> 01:20:34,428
- Oh, cool.
- What?

1342
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:38,132
I, I saw you fight at the bar.

1343
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:39,600
Did you?

1344
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:42,603
Then he said you could
hold onto it as insurance.

1345
01:20:42,605 --> 01:20:45,039
Now I'm gonna
point at you really hard.

1346
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,761
OK, fine. Then I'm
gonna raise up my arms...

1347
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:50,044
OK, fine.

1348
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:56,050
So, you mean, you really went
through all this trouble

1349
01:20:56,052 --> 01:20:59,119
just to rob Nicky
of 300 grand?

1350
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:02,423
Three hundred thousand?
Try 20 million.

1351
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:05,292
This is where the story
becomes interesting.

1352
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:07,361
Two weeks ago,
this painting was stolen

1353
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:08,629
from an art
collector in Mexico.

1354
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:10,965
Fate, Francie.

1355
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:12,633
Fate is what just happened.

1356
01:21:12,635 --> 01:21:15,269
I need you to find
something for me.

1357
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:17,504
Uncle Paddy could
come up with ten buyers easily.

1358
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:19,874
Ten buyers I can find,
maybe more.

1359
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:23,277
You see, all he needed was
the news of the theft.

1360
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,213
Paddy McCarthy here.
I got a piece you might be interested in.

1361
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,415
And she's a real beauty.

1362
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:29,884
Where's the Seurat?

1363
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:31,552
Georges Seurat,
you ignorant fuck!

1364
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,954
<i>The seminal French</i>
<i>"Post-Impressionalist".</i>

1365
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:35,456
<i>The father of pointillism</i>

1366
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:38,058
- That Georges Seurat!
- This is all about the Seurat.

1367
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,326
This has nothing to do
with Nicky's painting.

1368
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,628
If this is even close to real,

1369
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,496
Paddy's gonna make a bundle.

1370
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:44,531
We still need
four hundred and fifty.

1371
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:47,301
I can pull together
a hundred thousand.

1372
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,904
I can do one hundred.

1373
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:57,211
This is the one we're all
gonna be remembered for.

1374
01:21:57,213 --> 01:21:59,413
Ah.

1375
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:04,285
Ten forgeries,
seven already shipped.

1376
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:06,220
That's twenty million.

1377
01:22:06,222 --> 01:22:09,156
I really like
this heist shit.

1378
01:22:09,158 --> 01:22:11,091
Ah, careful!
That's the original.

1379
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:13,060
Wait, you kept the real one?

1380
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:15,596
The one... Interpol know the
one in Nicky's room is fake?

1381
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:17,932
Interpol already thinks
they have the real one.

1382
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:19,967
I just want to hold it.

1383
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:22,369
How would you
like live with it, Sam?

1384
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,976
I think I'd like
that very much.

1385
01:22:28,978 --> 01:22:30,444
The first time you see it,

1386
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:34,114
<i>you say it's real,</i>
<i>whether it is or not.</i>

1387
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:39,553
Absolutely, positively,
the real thing.

1388
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:43,123
Boom! Oh ho!
Come on, boys in blue!

1389
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:46,327
Suit guy! Whoo! Come on!

1390
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:49,129
- One for the good guys!
- Indeed.

1391
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:52,566
Well, everybody,
it's truly been a pleasure.

1392
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:56,403
- You did it, Dennis.
- One for the ages, eh?

1393
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:58,272
Either write something
worth reading about,

1394
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:00,240
or do something
worth writing about.

1395
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:03,310
Don't spend it all
in one place.

1396
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,550
<i>Seasoned crooks swear</i>

1397
01:23:09,552 --> 01:23:11,452
<i>there's only two days</i>
<i>you remember</i>

01:23:11,454 --> 01:23:13,988
<i>about your stretch in prison:</i>

1399
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,489
<i>the day you get in...</i>

1400
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,093
<i>and the day you get out.</i>

1401
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,463
<i>And you'll</i>
<i>only remember your last</i>

1402
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:25,699
<i>so long as you've got</i>
<i>something waiting for you.</i>

1403
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:28,369
- One wallet. One watch.
<i>- As of the day you're released,</i>

1404
01:23:28,371 --> 01:23:30,537
<i>they can't inspect your mail.</i>

1405
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:35,476
Oh, and this arrived this
morning. Just cleared.

1406
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:37,444
Who's it from?

1407
01:23:37,446 --> 01:23:39,113
Doesn't say.

1408
01:23:39,115 --> 01:23:40,714
<i>I could never be certain,</i>

1409
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:43,417

1410
01:23:43,419 --> 01:23:46,086
<i>I had trust.</i>

1411
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:50,257
<i>And if you've got no trust...</i>

1412
