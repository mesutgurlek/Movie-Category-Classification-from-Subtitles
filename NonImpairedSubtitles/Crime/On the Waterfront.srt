1
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,942
You take it from here, Slugger.

2
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,862
Joey!

3
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,269
Joe Doyle!

4
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,012
What do you want?

5
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,278
I got one of your birds.
I recognized him by the band.

6
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,253
It must be Danny Boy.
I lost him in the last race.

7
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,188
He flew into my coop.
Do you want him?

8
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,192
I gotta watch myself these days.

9
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,693
Know what I mean?

10
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,322
Listen, don't worry.
I'll take him up to your loft.

11
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,832
Okay, I'll see you on the roof.

12
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,416
How goes it?

13
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,156
- He's up on the roof.
- The pigeon?

14
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,725
Yeah, white.

15
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,838
I think somebody
fell off the roof.

16
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,339
I thought he was gonna sing to
the Crime Commission. He won't.

17
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,977
- I thought they was gonna talk to him.
- That's the idea.

18
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,578
I thought they was gonna talk to him
and get him to dummy up.

19
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,089
Maybe he gave them an argument.

20
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,059
I figured the worst they'd do
was lean on him a little bit.

21
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,061
Like I said, maybe he
gave them an argument.

22
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,462
He's been giving Johnny, the boss,
a lot of arguments lately.

23
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,102
- He wasn't a bad kid, thatJoey.
- A canary.

24
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,605
Maybe he could sing,
but he couldn't fly.

25
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,844
Hey, come on.
Can I buy you a drink?

26
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,582
Well, I'll be in there later.

27
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,755
Father Barry is here.

28
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,171
Same thing happened to my Andy
five years ago.

29
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,503
- You're Pop Doyle, the boy's father?
- That's right.

30
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,102
Looks like he fell off the roof,
or maybe he was pushed. Got any ideas?

31
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,773
He was the only longshoreman that had
guts to talk to the crime investigators.

32
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,783
- Who asked you?
- Everybody knows that.

33
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,547
Shut up. LfJoey took my advice,
he wouldn't be...

34
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,918
- Everybody knows that.
- I said, shut up!

35
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:54,289
I know how you feel about cops,
but if you give me some leads, I could...

36
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,626
I kept telling him,
"Keep quiet. You'll live longer."

37
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,361
I've been on the docks
all my life...

38
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,494
and there's one thing I learned:

39
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,939
You don't answer no questions,
unless you want to wind up like that.

40
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,246
Edie. Edie, come here.

41
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,580
I want to talk to you.
Come with me.

42
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,815
Father, who'd want to killJoey?
Who'd want to killJoey?

43
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,751
Stay away from him.
Stay away from him!

44
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,624
Edie, listen!

45
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,392
Remember: Time and faith
are great healers.

46
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,332
Father, my brother's dead
and you talk about time and faith!

47
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,802
My brother was the best kid in
the neighborhood, and everybody said so.

48
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,135
I'm in the church if you need me.

49
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,309
You're in the church
if I need you?

50
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,346
Did you ever hear of a saint
hiding in a church?

51
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,973
I want to know
who killed my brother!

52
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,315
What's the matter with you, punk?

53
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,861
Hey, boss, Packy wants
another drink on the cuff.

54
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,058
- Give it to him!
- Right.

55
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,126
Here's the cut on the shakeup.
891 men, three bucks a head.

56
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,640
That's 2673.

57
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,641
Charley, you count them.

58
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,168
Got a banana boat on 46 tomorrow.

59
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,771
If we could pull a walkout, it might
mean a few bucks from the shippers.

60
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,283
- Bananas go bad in a hurry.
- Ask two G's.

61
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,876
Twenty-six seventy-three.

62
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,047
These clowns can't fight.

63
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,616
There's nobody tough anymore.

64
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,559
Hiya, Slugger.

65
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,563
- Hi, Johnny.
- Hi, kid.

66
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,067
The tough nut!
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

67
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,399
Where's Morgan?
Where's that big banker of mine?

68
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,702
- Right here, Mr. Friendly.
- Hiya,J.P.

69
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,369
- How's business?
- Having trouble with Kelly again, boss.

70
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,413
He won't take no loans,
and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.

71
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,778
- He's my wife's nephew.
- But he won't take no loans!

72
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,545
I gotta put him to work!
She'd murder me!

73
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,951
That's why I never got married.

74
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,218
Here's the interest
on the day, boss: 532.

75
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,089
Here, you count it.
Countin' makes me sleepy.

76
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,095
Hey, Skins!

77
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,425
Did you handle that sheet metal
all right?

78
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,988
Yeah. The checker faked the receipt.
Here it is.

79
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,296
When you talk to me, take the cigar
outta your mouth...

80
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,065
- Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
- Yeah. Sure.

81
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,368
Here you are. 45 bills.

82
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,841
Hey, Terry. You count this.

83
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,573
Go, on. Go, on. It's good for you.
Develops your mind.

84
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,913
- What mind?
- Shut up. I like the kid.

85
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,578
Hey remember the night he took
Farella at Saint Nicks, Charley?

86
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,420
We won a bundle.
Real tough. A big try.

87
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,857
I lost the count.

88
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,292
Okay. Forget it, Einstein.

89
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,094
How come you never got an education
like your brother Charley?

90
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,499
The only arithmetic he ever got
was hearing the referee...

91
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,197
count up to ten.

92
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:56,332
You know, you're not
too funny today, fat man.

93
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,808
- Hey!
- Stop.

94
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,971
What gives with our boy, tonight,
Charley? He ain't himself.

95
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,016
It's just theJoey Doyle thing
and how he exaggerates some things.

96
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,644
Just too much Marquis of Queensberry.
It softens him up.

97
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,654
Listen, kid. I'm a soft touch too.

98
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,917
Ask any rummy on the dock
if I ain't good for a fin...

99
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,925
anytime they put the arm on me.

100
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:20,091
But my old lady raised us ten kids
on a stinkin' watchman's pension.

101
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,468
When I was sixteen I had to beg
for work in the hole.

102
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,633
I didn't work my way up
outta there for nothin'.

103
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,573
I know that, Johnny.
I know it.

104
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,702
You know takin' over this local
took a little doin'.

105
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,370
Some pretty rough
fellas in the way.

106
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,314
- They gave me this to remember them.
- He had to keep his hand...

107
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:40,181
over his throat and he still
went after them.

108
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,654
- I know.
- I know what's eatin' ya'.

109
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,692
Well, I got 2,000 dues-payin'
members in this local...

110
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,058
that's 72,000 a year... legitimate.

111
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,991
Now, when each one of them
puts in a couple bucks a day...

112
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,056
just to make sure
the work's steady...

113
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,295
well, figure it out.

114
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,203
And that's just for openers.
We got the fattest piers...

115
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,138
and the fattest harbor in the world.

116
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,438
Everything moves in and out,
we take our cut.

117
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,138
Why shouldn't we?
If we can get it.

118
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,737
We're entitled to it.

119
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:12,910
You don't suppose I can afford
to be boxed out of this deal...

120
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,612
a deal I sweated and bled for...

121
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,815
on the account of one lousy little
cheese-eater, that Doyle bum...

122
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,916
who thinks he can go squealin'
to the crime commission, do ya'?

123
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,058
Well, do ya'?

124
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,802
Well, no, Johnny. I just figured
I should have been told.

125
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,774
I make it 26-23.

126
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,605
You're 50 short, Skins.

127
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,248
Gimme.

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,947
I must have miscounted.

129
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,648
Gimme.

130
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,122
Gimme!

131
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,395
You come from Greenpoint.
Go back to Greenpoint.

132
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,127
You don't work here no more.

133
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,640
Here, kid. Here's half a bill.
Go get your load on.

134
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:16,171
- No, I'm okay, Charlie. Thanks.
- Present from your UncleJohnny.

135
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,772
And Mac...

136
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,818
Tomorrow morning when you shape
the men...

137
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:24,219
Put Terry up in the loft.
Number one. Every day.

138
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,951
It's nice, easy work.

139
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,222
You check in and you goof off
on a coffee bag, okay?

140
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,202
You got a real friend here.
Now don't forget it.

141
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,706
Why should he forget it?

142
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,608
Yeah. Thanks, Johnny.

143
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,551
All right, payday.

144
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,544
Hi, Terry.

145
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,484
- Hiya, kid.
- I was just gonna feed them.

146
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,457
- I already fed them.
- You must've been up early, huh?

147
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,518
I was up anyhow,
so I figured I might as well.

148
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,999
They sure got it made, huh?

149
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:44,059
Eating, sleeping,
flying around like crazy...

150
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,331
raising gobs of squabs.

151
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,873
Well, I better get over there.

152
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,981
Don't spill no water on the floor,
'cause I don't want them to catch cold.

153
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,088
I'll see you around, huh?

154
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,062
Come on, Tony,
give me the tabs.

155
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,505
He was a good boy,
that Doyle kid.

156
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,669
That's why he got it in the head.

157
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,179
Yeah, but he couldn't learn
to keep his mouth shut.

158
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,251
Hey, Pops,
why don't you go home?

159
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,018
- The boys working today will chip in.
- That's right, Pops.

160
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,549
No, thanks, fellas.
Who do you think'll pay for the funeral?

161
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,563
Johnny Friendly,
that great labor leader.

162
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,121
That's a good one.

163
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,691
- Keep that big mouth of yours shut.
- What are you, a wise guy?

164
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,103
If I was wise, I wouldn't be
no longshoreman for 30 years...

165
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,232
and poorer now
than when I started.

166
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,469
- Wise guy.
- Big mouth.

167
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,343
- Don't mess with those guys.
- Here.

168
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,541
I brought you Joey's windbreaker.

169
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,381
Might come in handy.
Go ahead, wear it.

170
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,083
Thanks, Pop. Mine's more full of holes
than the Pittsburgh infield.

171
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,457
Hey, Joe.
I got a coat for you.

172
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,437
Do you know Terry Malloy?

173
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,942
- No, I don't know him.
- Never heard of him.

174
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,448
Say, you're Terry Malloy,
aren't you?

175
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,317
So what?

176
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,048
Didn't I see you fight
a couple of years ago?

177
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,057
Without the birdseed.
What do you want?

178
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,991
Our identification.

179
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,199
Waterfront Crime Commission.
What's that?

180
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,201
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

181
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,533
We're getting ready to hold
hearings on waterfront crime...

182
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,664
and underworld infiltration
of the longshore union.

183
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,573
- I don't know nothing.
- You haven't heard the questions yet.

184
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,078
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

185
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:12,174
There's a rumor that you're one of
the last people to seeJoey Doyle alive.

186
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,684
I don't know nothing.

187
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,414
- Nobody's accusing you of anything.
- I hope you understand that.

188
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:19,480
Just want to ask you some questions
about some people you may know.

189
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,398
- People I may know?
- That's right.

190
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,128
- You better get out of here, buster.
- Now slow down, boy, huh?

191
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,168
I don't know nothing,
I ain't seen nothing...

192
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,800
and I'm not saying nothing,
so you and your girlfriend take off.

193
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,279
You have every right not to talk,
if that's what you choose to do.

194
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,838
But the public has a right
to know the facts too.

195
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:48,080
- We'll be seeing you again, Mr. Malloy.
- Never will be too soon for me, shorty.

196
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,351
Take it easy.

197
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,923
How do you like them mugs,
taking me for a pigeon?

198
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,463
- Who was he?
- I don't know who they are.

199
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,557
You're three weeks behind on the last
25, but I'm willing to take a chance.

200
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,695
Some chance at 10% a week.
And if he don't borrow, he don't work.

201
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,433
May you rot in hell,J.P.

202
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,442
When I'm dead and gone,
you'll know what a friend I was.

203
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,445
Why don't you drop dead now
so we can test your theory?

204
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,105
Condolences.

205
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,213
Hey, Pop, look.

206
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,424
Let her go, Tony.

207
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,773
Now, the following hatch bosses
with their gangs.

208
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,366
I guess I spoke
out of turn last night.

209
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,014
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider
with a turned-around collar.

210
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,220
Don't you? Huh?

211
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,725
I see the sisters
taught you not to lie.

212
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,229
All right, loft gang!

213
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,730
Malloy!

214
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,323
Hendricks!

215
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,163
Krajowski!

216
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,759
Westerfield!

217
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,464
Maguire!

218
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,739
I've been thinking about your question,
and you're right, Edie.

219
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,581
This is my parish.
I don't know how much I can do...

220
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,984
but I'll never find out unless I come
here and take a good look for myself.

221
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,224
All right, I need
some extra banana carriers.

222
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:37,422
Bananas. I wonder when we'll get a boat
from Ireland with some Irish whiskey.

223
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,930
Dugan, my boy,
you're dreaming again.

224
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,833
All right. Kelly.

225
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,003
Richy.

226
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,273
Yeah, you.

227
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:02,044
What's the matter?
Nobody want to work today?

228
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,914
Yeah, you.

229
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,486
Yeah, you.

230
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,300
- Who do you see to get a day's pay?
- I got a couple of kids.

231
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,344
- Meatballs!
- Definitely!

232
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,681
Come here!

233
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,558
Hey, Terry, grab that one!

234
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,792
Give me that!

235
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,894
- Are you gonna work?
- Give it to me!

236
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,098
Why? Why? Huh?

237
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,233
Give it to me!
Give me that!

238
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,937
What makes you so special?

239
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,948
- Things are looking up on the dock.
- Dope, that's Joey Doyle's sister.

240
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,643
You give me that!

241
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,580
You Joey Doyle's sister?

242
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,521
Yes, I am.

243
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,726
You don't want to go
to work today anyhow.

244
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,330
Well, it's been nice
wrestling with you.

245
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,173
Pop, here's your tab.
Take it.

246
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,110
Give it to me.
I can use it.

247
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,170
Now get back to the sisters
where you belong.

248
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,240
I'm surprised at you, Father,
if you don't mind my saying so...

249
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:43,311
letting her see things
ain't fit for the eyes of a decent girl.

250
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,152
All right, that's all.
Come back tomorrow.

251
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,724
Hey, what do you do now?

252
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,892
Like Big Mac said,
come back tomorrow.

253
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,902
Tomorrow?
No ship tomorrow.

254
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,736
I've been standing here for five
mornings, and that bum over there...

255
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,002
Get out of here.

256
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,010
Come on, get out of here.

257
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,444
I'm sorry, Father.
I didn't mean it.

258
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,109
- What do you want to do?
- Let's go get a bowl.

259
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,449
Wait a minute. Is this all you do,
just take it like this?

260
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,154
Well, what about your union?

261
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,363
No other union in the country
would stand for a thing like that.

262
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,197
The waterfront's tougher, Father,
like it ain't part of America.

263
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,705
- You know how a trigger local works?
- No. How?

264
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,206
You get up in the meeting,
you make a motion...

265
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,573
the lights go out,
then you go out.

266
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,841
That's how it's been ever sinceJohnny
and his cowboys took over the local.

267
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,747
Name one place where it's safe
to talk without getting clobbered.

268
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,147
The church.

269
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,045
What?

270
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,988
The bottom of the church.

271
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:54,025
Do you know what
you're letting yourself in for?

272
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,828
You got a cigarette on you?

273
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,000
Right over there.

274
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,678
- You working hard?
- Yeah.

275
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,017
You wouldn't mind working
just once in a while...

276
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,956
just to justify this
lofty position, would you?

277
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,424
I finished the work.
I counted all them bags.

278
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,055
We have an extra detail for you.

279
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:37,227
That's if you don't mind
being disturbed or anything.

280
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,361
The priest and this Doyle girl...

281
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,669
they're getting a meeting
up together down at the church.

282
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,642
We want a rundown on it, the names
and numbers of all the players.

283
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,976
Wait a minute.
All right, you're nominated.

284
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,539
Why me, Charley?
I feel funny going down there.

285
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,883
- Besides, I'd just be stooling for you.
- Let me tell you what stooling is.

286
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,889
Stooling is when you rat on
your friends, the guys you're with.

287
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,120
LfJohnny wants a favor,
don't think about it.

288
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,718
Do it.

289
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,787
Now go on,
join the congregation.

290
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,584
Well, I thought there'd be
more of you here, but...

291
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,918
The Romans found out
what a handful could do...

292
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,014
if it's the right handful.

293
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,821
I'm just a potato eater,
but isn't it simple as one-two-three?

294
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,129
One, the working
conditions are bad.

295
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:45,294
Two, they're bad because
the mob does the hiring.

296
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,304
Three, the only way
we can break the mob...

297
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,806
is to stop letting them
get away with murder.

298
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,811
Now, if one of you would just answer one
question, we'd have a very good start.

299
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,006
And that question is...

300
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,675
who killed Joey Doyle?

301
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,423
Not one of you has a line
on who killed Joey Doyle?

302
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,299
I have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it.

303
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,334
All right,
then answer this one.

304
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,566
How can we call
ourselves Christians...

305
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,871
and protect these murderers
with our silence?

306
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,383
Jimmy Collins,
you wereJoey's best friend.

307
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,182
How can you just sit there
and not say anything?

308
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,849
And I'll always think of him as my
best friend, but what do you want me...

309
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,859
Who asked him in here?

310
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:46,527
I'm trying to find out what happened
toJoey Doyle. Maybe you can be helpful.

311
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,965
Helpful?
The brother of Charley the Gent?

312
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,333
They'll help us get
to the bottom of the river.

313
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,338
Better leave Charley out of this.

314
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,237
You don't think
he'd be helpful?

315
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,276
Why don't you ask him yourself?

316
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,675
Maybe I will
one of these days.

317
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,878
One of these days.

318
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,043
Now listen,
you know who the pistols are.

319
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:11,353
Are you going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one?

320
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,723
Are you?

321
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,594
Hey, Dugan,
how about you?

322
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,789
One thing you gotta
understand, Father.

323
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:23,232
- On the dock we've always been D and D.
- What's that?

324
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,032
Deaf and dumb. No matter how much
we hate the torpedoes, we don't rat.

325
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,367
Rat?

326
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,965
Now boys, get smart.

327
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,510
I know you're getting
pushed around...

328
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,638
but there's one thing we've got
in this country: Ways of fighting back.

329
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,980
Getting the facts to the public,
testifying for what you know is right...

330
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,746
against what you know is wrong.

331
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,052
And what's ratting to them is telling
the truth for you! Can't you see that?

332
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,760
Can't you see that? Huh?

333
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,481
It seems to me we've gone just about
as far as we can at this time.

334
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,483
I think you'll agree
with that, Father.

335
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,979
So I'd like to close
with a few words from St. Matthew.

336
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,989
"Come unto me all you..."

337
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,124
That's our friends.

338
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,357
What did I tell you?
This is a police problem, not ours!

339
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,960
- These people need our help, Vince!
- Okay! Okay!

340
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,302
Only don't blame me when
they ship you off to Abyssinia!

341
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,806
I won't!

342
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,118
Edie, you'd better go home in pairs.
Two's in two, you know.

343
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,383
Come on!

344
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:30,653
- What's happened to Pop?
- He's an old man. They won't hurt him.

345
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,658
Get out of here!

346
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,571
Here, up.
Are you all right, Dugan?

347
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,268
Yeah, considering they were
using my head for a baseball.

348
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,640
You still D and D?
You still call it ratting?

349
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,941
- Are you on the level?
- What do you think?

350
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,175
If I stick my neck out
and they chop it off...

351
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,241
- are you willing to go all the way?
- Down the line.

352
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,517
They'll put the muscle on you too,
turned-around collar or not.

353
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,356
Wipe your face. Listen to me.
You stand up and I'll stand up with you.

354
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:05,590
- Right down the wire?
- So help me God.

355
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,061
I think we're okay.

356
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,899
Steel pipes and baseball bats.

357
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,462
Well, they play pretty
rough around here.

358
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,804
I can make it home now all right.

359
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,473
Which side are you with?

360
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,981
Me? I'm with me, Terry.

361
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,712
Hey, you got a dime
for a cup of coffee?

362
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,313
- Beat it, will you?
- Just a little dime you don't need?

363
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,316
Hey, I know you.

364
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,487
- You're Edie Doyle.
- Come on, beat it.

365
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,623
Your brother was a saint, the only one
who ever tried to get me compensation.

366
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,895
What are you doing?
Get out of here.

367
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,233
You remember, Terry.
You was there that night...

368
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,534
- Get out of here!
- You remember.

369
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,871
Get out of here.

370
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,309
Here's some change.
Go have yourself a ball.

371
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:58,577
You don't buy me.
You're still a bum.

372
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,777
So long, Edie.

373
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,150
Lord have mercy on Joey.

374
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,317
Who's calling me a bum?

375
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,527
Everybody loved Joey...

376
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,030
from little kids
to the old rummies.

377
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,561
Did you know him very well?

378
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,968
Well, you know,
he got around.

379
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,609
- What did that man mean just now?
- Don't pay no attention to him.

380
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,010
He's drunk, he's falling down,
everything.

381
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,605
He's just a juice-head
that hangs around the neighborhood.

382
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,174
Don't pay no attention.

383
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,243
I'd better go now.

384
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,256
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not gonna bite you.

385
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,857
I guess they don't let you walk
with fellas where you've been, huh?

386
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,919
You know how the sisters are.

387
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,789
Are you training to be a nun?

388
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,960
It's just a regular college.

389
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,799
Wait a second.

390
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,965
It's run by
the Sisters of St. Anne.

391
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,202
Where is that?

392
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:01,609
- It's in Terrytown.
- Where's that?

393
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,739
In the country.

394
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,545
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.

395
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,084
Say, how often
do you get in here?

396
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,649
I guess I haven't been here
since last Christmas.

397
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,322
We were going to have
a Thanksgiving party.

398
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,732
That's nice.

399
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,998
What do you do up there?
Just, what, study?

400
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,303
- I want to be a teacher.
- Teacher?

401
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,674
That's very good.
You know, personally I admire brains.

402
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,872
My brother Charley
is a very brainy guy.

403
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,677
He had a couple
of years of college.

404
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,583
It isn't just brains.

405
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,555
- It's how you use them.
- Yeah, I get your thought.

406
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,023
You know, I see you
a lot of times before.

407
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,392
Remember parochial school
on Pulaski Street?

408
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,455
Seven, eight years ago?
You had your hair...

409
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,466
Braids.

410
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,468
Looked like a hunk of rope.

411
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,767
You had wires on your teeth
and glasses, everything.

412
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,866
I mean,
you was really a mess.

413
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,375
I can get home all right now.
Thanks.

414
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,915
Listen, don't get sore.
I'm just kidding you a little bit.

415
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,474
I just mean to tell you
that you're...

416
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,248
You grew up very nice.

417
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,256
Thanks.

418
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,316
You don't...
You don't remember me, do you?

419
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,490
I remembered you
the first moment I saw you.

420
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,498
By the nose, huh?

421
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:36,073
Well, some people just got faces
that stick in your mind.

422
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,573
I remember you were
in trouble all the time.

423
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,738
Now you got me.

424
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,341
Boy, the way those sisters
used to whack me, I don't know what.

425
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,211
They thought they was gonna beat
an education into me, but I foxed them.

426
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,121
Maybe they just didn't
know how to handle you.

427
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,628
How would you have done it?

428
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,889
With a little more
patience and kindness.

429
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:08,470
That's what makes people mean.
People don't care enough about them.

430
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,872
What, are you kidding me?

431
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,575
I'd better get you home.

432
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,813
There's too many guys around here
with only one thing on their mind.

433
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,221
Am I gonna see you again?

434
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,026
What for?

435
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,990
I don't know.

436
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,029
- I really don't know.
- Come on.

437
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,806
Come on.

438
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,561
You're all packed, here's your ticket,
and you're on your way to St. Anne's.

439
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,833
I'm not ready
to go back yet, Pop.

440
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,739
For years your mom and me
put quarters in the cookie jar...

441
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,073
to keep you up there
with the sisters...

442
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:24,274
and keep you from things
like I just seen outside the window.

443
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:28,376
My daughter walking arm in arm with
Terry Malloy. Do you know who he is?

444
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,943
Who is he, Pop?

445
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,854
He's the kid brother
of Charley the Gent...

446
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:37,088
who's Johnny Friendly's right hand
and a butcher in a camel hair coat.

447
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,197
Are you trying to tell me
Terry is too?

448
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,632
He tries to act tough...

449
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,637
but there's a look in his eye.

450
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,730
Yeah, a look in his eye.

451
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,867
Hold your hats, brothers.
Here we go again.

452
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,071
You think he's
one of them cases...

453
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,580
you're always dragging into the house
and feeling sorry for...

454
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:01,346
like that litter of kittens
you brought in.

455
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,150
The only one you wanted to keep
had six toes...

456
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,589
and is cockeyed to boot.
Look at him.

457
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,593
The little bum.

458
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,357
He said he wants to see me again.

459
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,495
Look.

460
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,503
See this arm?

461
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,437
Two inches longer
than the other.

462
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,276
That's from years of working
and sweating...

463
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,646
and lifting
and swinging a hook.

464
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:39,283
Every time I heist a box
or a coffee bag, I says to myself...

465
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,849
"That's for Edie, so she can
be a teacher or something decent."

466
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,194
I promised your mom, Edie.
Don't let her down.

467
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:55,639
I don't want you to think that I'm not
grateful for everything you've done.

468
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:59,006
For giving me the education,
for keeping me away from all of this.

469
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,740
But, Pop, I've seen things
that I know are so wrong.

470
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:07,148
How can I go back to school and keep my
mind on things that are just in books?

471
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,482
That aren't people, living?

472
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,316
I'm gonna stay, Pop...

473
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,156
and I'm gonna keep on trying
to find out who is guilty forJoey!

474
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,220
Hey, Terry.

475
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,770
What are you doing
up here on the roof?

476
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,907
Just looking.

477
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,545
Take a look at the
champion flock of the neighborhood.

478
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,949
Fly pretty nice, huh?

479
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,018
Golden Warriors?

480
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,088
I started them Golden Warriors.

481
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:32,031
You might say that I was
the original Golden Warrior.

482
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,098
This bum here is my shadow.

483
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,904
He thinks I'm a tough man
because I boxed pro for awhile.

484
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,706
Think you're a tough guy, huh?

485
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,112
Joey used to raise pigeons.

486
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,286
Joey used to raise pigeons.

487
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,815
Yeah, he had a few birds.

488
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,321
I've been taking care of them.

489
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,958
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be so interested in pigeons.

490
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,502
I just go for it.

491
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,373
You know,
this city is full of hawks?

492
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,812
That's a fact. They hang around
on the top of the big hotels...

493
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:20,282
and they spot
a pigeon in the park.

494
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,842
Right down on them.

495
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,581
You got a second?
One second?

496
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,361
I wanna show you something.

497
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,266
Here you are.
What do you think of that bum?

498
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,774
She's a beauty.

499
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,538
She's a he.
His name is Swifty.

500
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,705
Oh, look what he went and did.

501
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:59,116
He's my lead bird.
He's always on top of the perch.

502
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,853
If another bum tries to come along
and take his place, he lets him have it.

503
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,296
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

504
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,802
There's one them about them, though.
They're very faithful.

505
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,838
They get married
just like people.

506
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,204
Better.

507
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,470
And they stay that way
till one of them dies.

508
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,745
That's nice.

509
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,419
He, go fix the roof.

510
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,260
Hey, you want that egg?

511
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,595
Thanks.

512
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,370
Do you like beer?

513
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,708
I don't know.

514
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,735
I bet you never had
a glass of beer.

515
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,804
You ever have a glass of beer?

516
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,581
Wanna have one with me?

517
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,590
- In a saloon?
- Well, yeah.

518
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,151
I know a nice
little dump down here...

519
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,631
that has a special entrance
for ladies, all like that.

520
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,837
Come on. It won't hurt.

521
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,969
Come on.

522
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,943
Okay? Good.

523
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,220
Hey, Mac?

524
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,290
Two glockenheimers
and two for chasers.

525
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,595
Did you see the fight last night?

526
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,063
A kid named Riley, both hands.

527
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,067
Like you used to do.

528
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,237
I hope he got
better dice than me.

529
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,931
A comedian.

530
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,736
Were you really
a prize fighter?

531
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,471
I used to be.

532
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,479
How did you get
interested in that?

533
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,678
Well, I don't know.

534
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:13,246
I had to scrap all my life.
I might as well get paid for it.

535
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,758
When I was a kid,
my old man got bumped off and...

536
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,795
And... Never mind how.

537
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,923
Then they stuck
Charley and me in a...

538
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,559
a dump they called
a children's home.

539
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,998
Oh, boy, that was some home.

540
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:32,167
Well, anyhow,
I ran away from there...

541
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:36,304
and I fought in the club smokers and
Johnny Friendly bought a piece of me.

542
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,974
- Bought a piece of you?
- Yes.

543
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,552
Then, uh, I was going
pretty good there for awhile.

544
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,187
And after that...

545
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,252
Well, I don't know.

546
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,355
What do you really care?
Am I right?

547
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,636
Shouldn't everybody care
about everybody else?

548
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,403
Boy, what a fruitcake you are.

549
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:08,571
I mean, isn't everybody
a part of everybody else?

550
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,910
And you really believe that drool?

551
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,744
Yes, I do.

552
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:18,377
Well, here we are.
One for the lady and for the gent.

553
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,551
Here's to the first one.
I hope it ain't the last.

554
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,729
Go ahead.

555
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,764
Good?

556
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:35,135
No, not like that.
One hum.

557
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,646
You wanna hear
my philosophy of life?

558
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,585
Do it to him
before he does it to you.

559
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,021
I never met anyone like you.

560
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:03,064
There's not
a spark of sentiment...

561
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,729
or romance or human kindness
in your whole body.

562
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,398
What good does it do you
besides get you in trouble?

563
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:13,933
And when things and people get
in your way, you just knock them aside.

564
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,741
- Is that your idea?
- Don't look at me when you say that.

565
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:20,580
It wasn't my fault what happened
toJoey. Fixing him wasn't my idea.

566
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,548
Who said it was?

567
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,591
Well, everybody's
putting the needle on me.

568
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,559
You and them mugs in the church
and Father Barry.

569
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,562
I didn't like the way
he was looking at me.

570
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,996
He was looking at everybody
the same way.

571
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,260
Oh, yeah?

572
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,495
Anyhow, what's with
this Father Barry?

573
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,403
- What's his racket?
- His racket?

574
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,067
Yeah, his racket.
Everybody's got a racket.

575
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,303
- But he's a priest.
- Are you kidding? So what?

576
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,312
That don't make no difference.

577
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,940
You don't believe anybody, do you?

578
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,780
Listen, down here
it's every man for himself.

579
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,752
It's keeping alive...

580
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:00,518
standing in with the right people so
you get change jingling in your pocket.

581
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,958
- And if you don't?
- If you don't? Right down.

582
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,127
- It's living like an animal.
- All right.

583
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,032
I'd rather live like an animal
than end up like...

584
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,693
LikeJoey?

585
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,496
Are you afraid
to mention his name?

586
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,336
Well, what do you keep
harping on that for?

587
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,474
Come on, drink up.
You gotta have a little fun out of life.

588
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,074
Come on,
I'll stick some music on.

589
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,826
What's the matter?

590
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:47,202
Look, what's the matter?
What's the matter with you?

591
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,307
Help me if you can,
for God's sakes.

592
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,342
Edie, I'd like to help.

593
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,249
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

594
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,888
All right.

595
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,584
I shouldn't have asked you.

596
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,257
Here. Come on,
have a little beer.

597
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,129
Come on, come on.

598
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,937
I don't want it.

599
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,037
You just stay here
and finish your drink.

600
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,306
Listen, don't go.

601
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,974
I got my whole life to drink.

602
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,952
You sore at me?

603
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,451
What for?

604
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,692
Well, I don't know.

605
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:50,894
For not...
For not being no help to you.

606
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,637
You would if you could.

607
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:12,413
Here I come!
Here I come!

608
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,855
- Wait a minute.
- Pick a winner.

609
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,951
Wait a minute.
First I gotta kiss the bride.

610
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,223
Go on!
You kissed her before.

611
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,609
We'll get out that way.
You want me to take you?

612
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,317
What's going on here?

613
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:45,321
- Give me a cigarette.
- You gotta stop smoking so much.

614
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,755
Come on,
we'll get out through here.

615
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,455
What's the matter with you?

616
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,597
- Come on.
- That's a pretty tune.

617
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:10,275
Here's a stick of gum.
Do you good.

618
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,612
Do you like that music?

619
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,517
If I had my tuxedo
I'd ask you to dance, but...

620
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,829
Come on, you want to...
want to spin?

621
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,402
Come on, don't be afraid.

622
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,331
Ah, you dance divinely.

623
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,218
Say, we're doing pretty good.

624
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,414
The sisters ought to see you now.

625
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,426
Wait a minute.

626
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,093
I feel like I'm just floating.

627
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,298
Just floating.

628
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,302
Just floating.

629
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,884
I've been looking all over for you.
The boss wants you.

630
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,419
Right now?

631
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:27,514
Yeah. He just got a call
from Mr. Upstairs.

632
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:31,220
Something's gone wrong.
He's plenty hot.

633
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,731
- Well, I'm gonna take her home first.
- I'll see the little lady home.

634
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,526
Just tell him I'll come
over there when I'm ready.

635
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,770
Hey, Edlow!
Edlow, wait up!

636
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,407
Who was that?

637
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,576
I don't know.
Some mug.

638
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,782
Who was he?

639
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:58,618
Edie, you gotta quit trying
to find out aboutJoey. It ain't safe.

640
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,055
I'm telling you, it ain't safe.

641
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,219
Mr. Malloy,
I was hoping I might find you here.

642
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:07,957
Excuse me, Miss. You're being
served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.

643
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,330
A what?

644
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,699
Be at the State House,
Court Room Nine, 10:00 Friday morning.

645
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,033
I told you,
I don't know nothing about that.

646
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,041
You can bring
a lawyer if you wish.

647
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,168
And you're privileged
under the Constitution...

648
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,772
to protect yourself against questions
which might implicate you in any crimes.

649
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,609
You know what
they're asking me to do?

650
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,313
All we want you to do, Mr. Malloy,
is tell the truth.

651
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,325
Good night, kid.

652
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,985
Nice wedding.

653
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,433
- Look at that.
- What are you going to do?

654
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,271
I ain't gonna eat cheese for no cops,
and that's for sure.

655
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,872
It was Johnny Friendly
who had Joey killed, wasn't it?

656
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:59,472
He had him killed or he had
something to do with it, didn't he?

657
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,609
He and your big brother Charley?

658
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,787
You can't tell me, can you,
because you're part of it.

659
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:09,417
You're as bad as the worst of them.
Tell me the truth, Terry.

660
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,757
You'd better go back
to that school out in Daisyland.

661
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,356
You're driving yourself nuts,
you're driving me nuts.

662
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:19,630
Quit worrying about the truth
all the time. Worry about yourself.

663
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,967
I should have known
you wouldn't tell me.

664
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:25,440
Pop said Johnny Friendly used to
own you. I think he still owns you.

665
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,836
No wonder everybody
calls you a bum.

666
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,583
Don't say that to me, Edie.
Don't say that to me now.

667
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,315
No wonder.

668
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,119
- No wonder.
- I'm only trying to help you out.

669
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:46,185
I'm trying to keep you from getting
hurt. What more do you want me to do?

670
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,197
- Much more.
- Wait a minute.

671
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,199
Much, much, much more.

672
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,524
Where you going?

673
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,025
- Hi there, Johnny.
- Genius.

674
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,296
I was just coming over there.

675
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,464
- By way of Chicago?
- No, I was on my way over there.

676
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,666
How many times you been
knocked out, Terry?

677
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,837
Knocked out?
Two times.

678
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,380
That's once too often.

679
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,974
Your brains must be rattling.
What do you got up there? Chinese bells?

680
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,815
- What's the matter?
- You were to attend that church meeting.

681
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,718
I was there.

682
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,417
- There was nothing happening.
- Nothing happening, he says.

683
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:52,588
Some operator we got. One more like him,
we'd all be wearing striped pajamas.

684
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,632
I'm telling you, it was a big nothing.
The priest did all the talking.

685
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,394
He did?

686
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:01,198
Half an hour later, a certain
TimothyJ. Dugan had a secret session...

687
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,206
with the Crime Commission,
and he done all the talking.

688
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,977
Well, Dugan, what does he know?

689
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,014
Just 39 pages of our
operation, that's all!

690
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,084
- Where'd you get that?
- I got it.

691
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:18,952
He got it. It's the complete words
ofTimothyJ. Dugan.

692
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,993
- I knew he had the guts, but...
- Guts?

693
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,929
Why, that crummy pigeon.
He ought to have his neck wrung.

694
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:31,126
That's what we get for getting mixed up
with this punch-drunk brother of yours.

695
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,396
He was all right hanging around
for laughs, but this is business.

696
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,870
- I don't like anyone goofing off.
- I wasn't goofing.

697
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:37,873
What are you going around
with his sister for?

698
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:40,375
- I'm not go...
- Just shut up!

699
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,446
Look, Johnny, it's just that...

700
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:48,109
the Doyle broad has got him
so he doesn't know where his feet is.

701
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:51,621
- It's an unhealthy relationship!
- Definitely.

702
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,687
Get rid of her,
unless you're both tired of living.

703
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,659
You got her address?

704
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,719
We gotta do something
to muzzle this Dugan...

705
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:02,230
or he'll raise the biggest stink
this town has ever seen.

706
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,494
We got the best muscle
on the waterfront.

707
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,765
The time to use it is now,
pronto, if not sooner.

708
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,272
You know where you're going?
Back in the hold.

709
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,400
No more cushy job. It's down
in the hold with the sweat gang...

710
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,604
till you learn your lesson, see?

711
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,341
Ah, you.

712
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,051
- Let's go.
- Wise up!

713
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:58,778
All right, let's get him.

714
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,624
At last, an Irish shipment.

715
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,260
And loaded to the gunnels
with fine Irish whiskey.

716
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:17,136
- Kayo, the good Lord takes care of us.
- That he does.

717
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,300
Come on out, Kayo.
Get it up.

718
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,174
All right, take it up.
Take it away.

719
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,478
And don't go walking off
with any of that.

720
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,314
You know how the boss feels
about individual pilferage.

721
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,286
All right, all right.

722
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,482
Now you see the advantage
of a little man in a big coat.

723
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,025
- Kayo, let me see you afterward.
- What are you down here for?

724
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,865
To see that we don't steal any
of Mr. Friendly's precious cargo?

725
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,531
- I want to talk...
- Get away from me, will you?

726
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,403
- All right, take it up.
- Take it up.

727
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,067
Take it away.

728
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,950
Kayo, you're a walking distillery.

729
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,471
Get a doctor!

730
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,372
He don't need a doctor.
He needs a priest.

731
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,153
I came down here to keep a promise.

732
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,196
I gave Kayo my word that
if he stood up to the mob...

733
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:50,290
I'd stand up with him...
all the way.

734
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,326
And now Kayo Dugan is dead.

735
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:57,196
He was one of those fellows
who had the gift for standing up.

736
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:00,835
But this time they fixed him.
Oh, they fixed him for good this time.

737
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,210
Unless it was an accident,
like Big Mac says.

738
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:08,684
Some people think the crucifixion
only took place on Calvary.

739
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,277
They better wise up.

740
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:15,757
Taking Joey Doyle's life to stop him
from testifying is a crucifixion.

741
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:19,061
And dropping a sling
on Kayo Dugan...

742
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,428
because he was ready
to spill his guts tomorrow...

743
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,525
that's a crucifixion!

744
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:28,162
And every time the mob
puts the crusher on a good man...

745
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,729
tries to stop him from
doing his duty as a citizen...

746
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,435
it's a crucifixion!

747
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:36,911
And anybody who sits around
and lets it happen...

748
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,313
keeps silent about something
he knows has happened...

749
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,874
shares the guilt of it
just as much as the Roman soldier...

750
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,887
who pierced the flesh of our Lord
to see if he was dead.

751
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:52,894
Go back to your church!

752
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,830
Boys, this is my church!

753
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:00,096
If you don't think Christ is here on the
waterfront, you've another guess coming!

754
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:04,106
Get off the dock, Father!

755
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,608
Tillio, don't do that.

756
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,201
- Who side you're on, boy?
- Let him finish.

757
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,440
Every morning...

758
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,674
when the hiring boss
blows his whistle...

759
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,822
Jesus stands alongside you
in the shape-up.

760
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:23,052
He sees why some of you get picked
and some of you get passed over.

761
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,686
He sees the family men
worrying about getting their rent...

762
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,356
and getting food in the house
for the wife and the kids.

763
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,594
He sees you selling your souls
to the mob for a day's pay!

764
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,530
The next bum that throws
something deals with me!

765
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,766
I don't care
if he's twice my size!

766
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,832
What does Christ think
of the easy-money boys...

767
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,070
who do none of the work
and take all of the gravy?

768
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,238
And how does he feel about
the fellows who wear...

769
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:47,909
$150 suits and diamond rings...

770
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:51,420
on your union dues
and your kickback money?

771
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,978
And how does he...

772
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:56,548
who spoke up without fear
against every evil...

773
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,355
feel about your silence?

774
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,259
Shut up about that!

775
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,195
Just watch this.

776
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,601
You see that?

777
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:12,631
You want to know what's wrong with our
waterfront? The love of a lousy buck.

778
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,643
It's making love of a buck,
the cushy job...

779
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,009
more important than
the love of man!

780
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,481
It's forgetting that every fella
down here is your brother in Christ!

781
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,609
But remember,
Christ is always with you.

782
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,779
Christ is in the shape-up,
he's in the hatch...

783
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:28,312
he's kneeling
right here beside Dugan.

784
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:31,224
And he's staying with all of you.

785
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,455
"If you do it
to the least of mine...

786
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,794
you do it to me."

787
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:39,198
And what they did toJoey and what
they did to Dugan, they're doing to you.

788
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:42,161
And you, you.

789
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,001
All of you!

790
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,542
And only you...

791
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:50,807
Only you, with God's help, have
the power to knock them out for good.

792
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,850
Okay, Kayo?

793
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,438
Amen.

794
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,111
All right, come on.
Let's go.

795
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,204
Break it up.
Let's go to work.

796
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,521
Edie, Joey's jacket.

797
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,625
I'm sure Kayo would
wish you to have it back.

798
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,048
I brought you Joey's jacket.

799
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,242
Yours is coming apart.

800
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,158
Pigeons.

801
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,320
Yeah. They're nervous.

802
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,920
There was a hawk around here before.

803
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,874
Father, I wanna
speak to you a minute.

804
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:16,209
Remember what you said about Kayo Dugan
and about keeping your mouth shut?

805
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,777
I'm not hearing your confession.
I'll dig it out for myself...

806
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,948
and use it
where it'll do the most good.

807
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,958
Take your turn.
Father Gregory will hear you.

808
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,926
I don't wanna talk to...

809
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,032
Wait a second.
Wait a minute.

810
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,669
I just wanna talk to you
one second.

811
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,874
You gotta listen to me.

812
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,884
I'm the one who setJoey Doyle up
for the knock-off!

813
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,154
Take a walk with me, kid.
Give it to me straight.

814
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,258
There's nothing I haven't heard.
Come on.

815
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,443
It started out as a favor.

816
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:24,748
Favor... who am I kidding?
It's do it or else.

817
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:28,279
Believe me, I just thought they
was gonna lean on him a little bit.

818
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,519
I never figured
they was gonna knock him off.

819
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,686
I really tried to tell Edie
the other night.

820
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:38,394
I wanted to tell her she's the first
nice thing that ever happened to me.

821
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,595
What are you gonna do about it?

822
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,833
- You mean about telling her?
- Yes. About the Commission...

823
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,703
your subpoena.

824
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:49,472
- I know you got a subpoena.
- I don't know.

825
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,775
It's like carrying a monkey
around on your back.

826
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:53,782
A question of who rides who.

827
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,886
You know if I spill,
my life ain't worth a nickel.

828
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,752
How much is your soul worth
if you don't?

829
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:04,691
They're asking me
to put the finger on my own brother.

830
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,290
And Johnny Friendly took me
to ball games when I was a kid.

831
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,832
Ball games.
Don't break my heart.

832
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,836
I wouldn't care if he gave you
a life pass to the polo grounds.

833
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,236
You've got a brother.
Let me tell you something.

834
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:20,070
You've got other brothers
getting the short end...

835
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,738
whileJohnny's
at the polo grounds!

836
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:25,371
Ball games!

837
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:30,943
Listen! If I were you,
I'd walk right... Never mind.

838
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:36,858
I'm not asking anything.
Your conscience has gotta do the asking.

839
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,985
Conscience.

840
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:42,327
- That stuff can drive you nuts.
- Good luck.

841
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,034
Is that all you gotta say?

842
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,704
Come here.

843
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,768
Edie called me this morning.

844
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,005
She's coming here
to talk to me.

845
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,976
Come on.
Why don't you tell her?

846
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,854
No curves.

847
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,095
Thanks.

848
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,699
- You?
- Honest to God, l...

849
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,274
You gotta believe me.
I swear to God.

850
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,529
Terry, guess who's here?

851
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:06,700
That joker from
the Crime Commissioner's office.

852
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,990
If I knew a guy that knocked somebody
off, think I oughta turn him in?

853
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:34,195
You mean, call a cop?
Are you kidding?

854
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,636
You don't think I oughta
turn him in.

855
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,640
You was a Golden Warrior once.

856
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,999
That's right.

857
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:45,007
You started the gang.

858
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,803
Looking for me?

859
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:12,432
Not exactly. I was just
resting my dogs a minute.

860
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:16,103
On the next investigation, I hope
it's got buildings with elevators!

861
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,806
So far, this one's
just been climbing stairs.

862
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,950
- What are you climbing for?
- It's worth it...

863
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:27,422
if we can tell the waterfront story the
way the people have a right to hear it.

864
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,424
Don't you think?

865
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,840
Say, didn't I see you in the Garden
three or four years ago...

866
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:53,040
with a fellow named Wilson?

867
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:59,718
Thought you were gonna take him
that night. He really dumped you.

868
01:06:01,557 --> 01:06:03,491
He dumped me?

869
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:10,964
What would you say if I told you
I held that bum up for half a round?

870
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:14,298
Yeah. I could see he was hurt.

871
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,806
What do you think I was doing
with them combinations? Petting him?

872
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:22,970
- Just couldn't finish him off, huh?
- Don't monkey around there.

873
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:26,037
- Why didn't you finish him off?
- What are you talking about?

874
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:29,607
- I did a favor for some pals of mine.
- Favor?

875
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:33,712
- That's the way it was.
- That's the way it was.

876
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,553
If I'd have put him down,
I'd have had a title shot.

877
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:40,584
- I was ready that night.
- That's when I figured it was all over.

878
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:44,030
It was all over,
except for the lousy bet.

879
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,330
- My own...
- Yeah?

880
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,401
Well, I guess I better get going.

881
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,376
Hit those stairs again.

882
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:02,816
Say, was that a hook or an uppercut
you caught him with that first time?

883
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,581
I didn't use no hooks.
I was strictly a short puncher.

884
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:06,985
Looked like a hook.

885
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:11,015
I had that bum all figured out.
He had a good left hand.

886
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:13,755
I let him tag me
for a couple of rounds.

887
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,763
Just when he starts...
he thinks he's getting cute...

888
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:19,824
I step inside a jab with a left,
with a right, with a left.

889
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:23,269
I had him in my arms,
and from there we were just dancing.

890
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:26,001
- I see.
- And that's a fact!

891
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:29,567
When those guys wanna win a bet,
there's nothing they won't stop at.

892
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,937
"Longshoremans Local 374"

893
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:37,950
I didn't hear them,
but I sure seen them nose to nose.

894
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,715
The flatfoot was eating it up.

895
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,622
So they've been seen together
and he smiled at her.

896
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:44,682
That doesn't mean
he's going to talk.

897
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,321
There's no evidence
until he gives public testimony.

898
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,025
Thanks for the legal advice.

899
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,364
It's what we always
kept you around here for.

900
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,370
How do we keep him
from giving testimony?

901
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:59,067
Ain't that what you call
the main order of business?

902
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:01,075
He's a good kid.

903
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,077
- You know that.
- He's a bum!

904
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:05,443
After the days I gave him
in the loft, he's got no gratitude.

905
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:10,975
- You shut up!
- Mac, I'm conducting this investigation.

906
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:14,145
Look...

907
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:17,283
this girl and the Father,
they got their hooks in so deep...

908
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,759
he doesn't know
which end is up.

909
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:22,423
I ain't interested
in his mental condition.

910
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,830
I wanna know,
is he D and D or is he a canary?

911
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,832
I wish I knew.

912
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:33,341
So do I, Charley.
For your sake.

913
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,850
- What do you want me to do?
- It's simple.

914
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:44,818
Drive him out to this place
we've been using.

915
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:48,288
Try to straighten him out.
If you don't, give him the Gerry G.

916
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:51,349
You can't do that!

917
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:55,557
Maybe the boy is out of line,
but he's just a confused kid!

918
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,223
Confused kid?

919
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:03,796
First he crosses me in public,
gets away with it.

920
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,205
Pretty soon, I'm just another
fellow around here!

921
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,709
Johnny, I can't do that.

922
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,148
Then don't.

923
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:28,224
- Who do you like in the third?
- It's gotta be New Hope.

924
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,162
Definitely.

925
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,240
He's my kid brother.

926
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,468
That's for you to figure out.

927
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:44,343
You can have it your way or his way,
but not both ways.

928
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,347
- Am I right, Truck?
- Definitely.

929
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,317
Okay, on your horse.

930
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,915
Deep thinker.

931
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,853
I'm glad you stopped by.
I've been wanting to talk to you.

932
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,791
- Sure, kid.
- Where to?

933
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:35,227
Go to River Street
and I'll tell you where to stop.

934
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:39,597
- I thought we was going to the Garden.
- I wanna cover a bet on the way over.

935
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,831
Besides, this'll give us
a chance to talk.

936
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:46,432
Nobody ever stopped you
from talking, Charley.

937
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:52,310
Listen. The grapevine says
that you got a subpoena.

938
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,407
The guys know you're not
a cheese-eater...

939
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:59,045
but they think you shouldn't
be on the outside so much...

940
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:02,454
have a few things working for you
down at the docks.

941
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:06,426
A steady job,
a couple extra potatoes.

942
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,727
- That's all I want.
- That's great when you're a kid...

943
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,562
but you're pushing 30.

944
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:15,900
It's time to think about
getting some ambition.

945
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:21,566
I always figured I'd live
a little bit longer without it.

946
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,546
Maybe.

947
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,945
Look.

948
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:37,357
There's a boss loader slot open
on the new pier we're opening up.

949
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,986
It pays six cents...

950
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:43,429
on every hundred pounds
that goes in and out...

951
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:45,524
and you don't have
to lift a finger.

952
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,798
That's two, three,
four hundred dollars a week.

953
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,602
Four hundred dollars a week
just for the openers.

954
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,609
I get all that
for not doing nothing.

955
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:58,704
You don't do anything
and you don't say anything.

956
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:00,715
You understand?

957
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,215
There's more to this
than I thought, Charley.

958
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:12,954
I'm telling you,
there's a lot more.

959
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,122
You're thinking of testifying against
some people we might know?

960
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,758
I don't know, Charley.

961
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,826
I'm telling you I don't know.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

962
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:24,896
You know how much those piers are worth
that we control through the local?

963
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:27,032
- I know.
- You thinkJohnny'll jeopardize...

964
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:30,704
everything for one rubber-lipped
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels?

965
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,576
- What the...
- Been better!

966
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,582
- That's not the point!
- I could have been a lot better!

967
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,050
The point is,
we don't have much time!

968
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,178
I haven't made up my mind yet!

969
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:43,691
Make up your mind before we get
to 437 River Street!

970
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,165
Before we get to where, Charley?

971
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,940
Listen to me.
Take the job! Just take it!

972
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:03,170
No questions.
Take it!

973
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:06,906
Terry, take this job.
Please!

974
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:10,842
Please take it.

975
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:36,311
Look, l...

976
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,814
Look, kid...

977
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,684
How much do you weigh, son?

978
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:51,749
When you weighed 168 pounds...

979
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,728
you were beautiful.

980
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,664
You could have been
another Billy Conn.

981
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:03,796
That skunk we got you
for a manager.

982
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:07,831
He brought you along too fast.

983
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,538
It wasn't him, Charley.
It was you.

984
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,809
Remember that night in the Garden
when you said...

985
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,407
"Kid, this ain't your night.

986
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:19,386
We're going for the price on Wilson."

987
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,047
You remember that?

988
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,456
"This ain't your night."

989
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:27,620
My night.
I could have taken Wilson apart.

990
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:33,267
So what happens? He gets the title shot
in the ballpark. What do I get?

991
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:35,701
A one-way ticket to Palookaville.

992
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:40,208
You was my brother, Charley. You should
have looked out for me a little bit.

993
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,038
You should have taken care of me...

994
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,635
so I didn't have to take dives
for the short-end money.

995
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:47,204
I had some bets down for you.

996
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:50,809
You don't understand!
I could have had class!

997
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:56,017
I could have been a contender.
I could have been somebody...

998
01:14:56,091 --> 01:15:00,528
instead of a bum,
which is what I am... let's face it.

999
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,558
It was you, Charley.

1000
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:22,412
I'll tell them...

1001
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,475
I couldn't find you.

1002
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,714
Ten to one he won't believe it.

1003
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,092
Here.

1004
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,925
You take this.

1005
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:38,228
You're gonna need it.

1006
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:41,364
You... pull over!

1007
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,380
Take me to the Garden.

1008
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:34,822
Stay away from me!

1009
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,857
Please open the door!

1010
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,262
Stop it!

1011
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:53,365
- I want you to stay away from me.
- I know what you want me to do...

1012
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,376
but I ain't gonna do it,
so forget it!

1013
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,378
I don't want you
to do anything.

1014
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,846
Let your conscience
tell you what to do.

1015
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:02,941
Shut up about that conscience!
That's all I been hearing!

1016
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:06,351
I never mentioned it before.
You stay away from me!

1017
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,286
Edie, you love me!

1018
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:12,884
I didn't say I didn't love you.
I said stay away from me!

1019
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:16,226
- I want you to say it!
- Stay away from me!

1020
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:53,094
Hey, Terry!

1021
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:58,128
Terry, your brother's down here!
He wants to see you!

1022
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:15,087
Your brother's down here.

1023
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,819
Come on down here!
He wants to see you.

1024
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:23,794
Come on down!

1025
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:28,329
- What is it?
- Charley. I think he's in trouble.

1026
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,337
Be careful!

1027
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:46,677
Your brother's down here!

1028
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,385
You hear what I hear?

1029
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:11,138
That's the same way they called Andy
the night I lost him.

1030
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:13,909
Edie, be careful!
Edie, be careful!

1031
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,199
Edie! Watch out for the truck!

1032
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,727
They got Charley.

1033
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,132
I'm frightened.
Let's get out of here, please.

1034
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:17,694
FirstJoey, then Dugan
and now Charley.

1035
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:20,002
Please. Someplace where
we can live in peace.

1036
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:23,272
I'm gonna take it out
on their skulls.

1037
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,981
I'm gonna take it out
on their skulls.

1038
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:36,455
Please, Terry.
They'll kill you too.

1039
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:40,517
Go get the Father.
Tell him to take care of Charley.

1040
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:43,689
Then come back here
and stay with him till he gets here.

1041
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:46,928
Please don't do anything.
Please!

1042
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:51,999
For God's sake,
don't leave him alone here long.

1043
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,041
- Please, Terry.
- Do what I tell you.

1044
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,063
Where's John Friendly?

1045
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:24,196
He's not here now.

1046
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,600
Give me a shot.

1047
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,839
- Take it easy.
- Don't give me no advice.

1048
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,848
Give me the shot.

1049
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:15,151
Why don't you go home
before Big John gets here?

1050
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:16,918
Just give me the whiskey.

1051
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:25,731
Stick around!

1052
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:32,968
Sit down.

1053
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,687
Get out of that phone booth!

1054
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,710
Stay where you are, Tillio!

1055
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:21,811
- I want to see you, Terry.
- I'm right in front of you.

1056
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,055
Don't give me a hard time.

1057
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:35,025
What do you want?

1058
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:39,966
- Your gun.
- Go and chase yourself.

1059
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:43,477
- Come on. Give me the gun.
- You go to hell.

1060
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,813
- What did you say?
- Go to hell.

1061
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:55,385
- Sorry. Let me help you up.
- Get your hands off of me!

1062
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:58,358
- Now what am I gonna do?
- You wanna be brave?

1063
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:01,862
- You wanna fire lead into another man?
- It's none of your business!

1064
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,659
Mind your own business!

1065
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:07,326
- Firing lead into a man isn't brave!
- It's none of your business!

1066
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:09,632
You wanna hurtJohnny Friendly?

1067
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:12,905
Do you wanna fix him?

1068
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:15,340
Do you?
Do you really wanna finish him?

1069
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:19,210
- What do you think?
- For what he did to Charley and others?

1070
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,182
Then don't fight him like a hoodlum,
because that's just what he wants!

1071
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:26,516
He'll hit you in the head
and plead self-defense!

1072
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:29,682
You fight him in the courtroom
with the truth...

1073
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:31,691
as you know the truth.

1074
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,758
Now you get rid of that gun.

1075
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:45,465
Unless you haven't got the guts,
and if you haven't, then hold on to it!

1076
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,212
Give me a beer!

1077
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:03,588
Wanna beer?
Make it two.

1078
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:46,725
You mean to tell me
that your local takes in...

1079
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:52,034
$65,500 every year
and keeps no financial records?

1080
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:55,507
- Sure. We got records.
- Where are they?

1081
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:59,946
We was robbed last night
and we can't find no books.

1082
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:02,414
- You know you're under oath?
- Sure.

1083
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:16,721
Isn't it odd that five different locals
were broken into last night?

1084
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:19,824
The only item missing from
all of them was the financial records.

1085
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,870
What do you mean "odd"?
I told you, we was robbed.

1086
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:30,643
That's all.

1087
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:38,716
Call the next witness.

1088
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,688
Before you call the next witness...

1089
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:45,123
are all the officers of Local 374
present this morning?

1090
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:47,127
Call the roll.

1091
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:50,653
Will the following please rise
as the names are called?

1092
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:54,327
MichaelJ. Skelly, also known
as Johnny Friendly, president.

1093
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:59,540
Mr. Lewis Janotta,
vice president.

1094
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:04,135
Daniel D. Coogan,
financial secretary.

1095
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:06,942
Mladen Sekolivitch, delegate.

1096
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:09,176
Tillio A. Rodelli, delegate.

1097
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,377
Recording secretary.

1098
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:17,350
- Yeah. Recording secretary.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

1099
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:20,258
- Next witness.
- Mr. Malloy.

1100
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:33,198
Raise your right hand.

1101
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:35,139
- Name, please?
- Terry Malloy.

1102
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:37,473
Do you swear to tell the whole truth,
so help you God?

1103
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:39,740
- Right.
- "I do."

1104
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:41,748
Be seated, please.

1105
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,288
Is it true that the night
Joey Doyle was found dead...

1106
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:51,485
you were the last one to see him
before he was pushed from the roof?

1107
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:53,083
Yes. That's right.

1108
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:56,619
- And it is true...
- Except for the guys that pushed him!

1109
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:59,758
Is it true you went immediately
to the Friendly bar...

1110
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:03,201
and there expressed your feelings
to Mr. Johnny Friendly?

1111
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:05,068
John Friendly. Right!

1112
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:10,406
<i>Can you tell me whether Mr. Friendly,</i>
<i>or I should say, Mr. Skelly...</i>

1113
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:14,972
<i>said anything to indicate</i>
<i>his responsibility in this?</i>

1114
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,210
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>- Would you say...</i>

1115
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:19,446
<i>that he made it</i>
<i>very clear to you...</i>

1116
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,750
<i>that it was absolutely necessary</i>
<i>he murderJoey Doyle...</i>

1117
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:23,688
<i>to maintain his control?</i>

1118
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:26,192
- Turn that thing off!
<i>- Is that correct?</i>

1119
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:29,459
Anything else, sir?

1120
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:32,931
Yes. If Mr. Friendly calls,
I'm out.

1121
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,525
- Any time today?
- If he calls ever, I'm out!

1122
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:37,662
Very well, sir.

1123
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,297
Thank you.

1124
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,866
You've done more
than break theJoey Doyle case.

1125
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:47,508
You're making it possible
for honest men to work the docks...

1126
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:49,573
with job security
and peace of mind!

1127
01:29:52,587 --> 01:29:56,455
You may step down now.
That's all for now.

1128
01:29:56,524 --> 01:29:58,958
Mr. MichaelJ. Skelly, please.

1129
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:13,932
You just dug your own grave.
You're dead on this waterfront...

1130
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:16,442
and every waterfront
from Boston to New Orleans.

1131
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:20,277
You don't drive a truck or a cab,
you don't push a baggage rack.

1132
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:22,578
You don't work no place!
You're dead!

1133
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,613
Get your hands off me!

1134
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:44,235
Come on! Quit following me!
Why don't you get off my tail?

1135
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:46,603
You ought to be glad
we're following you.

1136
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:48,505
I feel like a canary.

1137
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:50,737
- Well...
- Lay off.

1138
01:30:54,048 --> 01:30:55,982
Hi, Chickie.

1139
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,619
Who's your friend?

1140
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:35,915
I made some hot coffee.
I thought you might want some.

1141
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,262
Anyway, it's all over.

1142
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:45,957
My friends don't want
to talk to me.

1143
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:48,297
Are you sure
they're your friends?

1144
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:58,337
I'll see you later.

1145
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:16,225
Hi, Champ.
How's the kid?

1146
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:21,801
What's the matter?

1147
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,815
A pigeon for a pigeon!

1148
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:27,901
The kid.

1149
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:36,234
What'd he have to do that for?

1150
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:41,213
Every one of them.

1151
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:45,412
There's no place that's safe
for you now on the waterfront.

1152
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:49,388
Maybe inland, out west someplace.

1153
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:51,618
A farm.

1154
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:53,751
A farm?

1155
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:57,525
You can do anything, as long as
you're away from Johnny Friendly.

1156
01:33:57,598 --> 01:34:00,726
Even the longshoremen. You tried
to help and they turn their backs...

1157
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:03,395
and stick to their
stupid D and D.

1158
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:07,032
Are they taking chances for you?
Why should you...

1159
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:10,441
You're not even listening to me,
are you?

1160
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:19,252
You're going down there.

1161
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:23,814
Just becauseJohnny warned you not to,
you're going down there.

1162
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:27,418
You think you gotta prove
you're not afraid of them or something!

1163
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,429
Go ahead!
Get it over with!

1164
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,465
Go and get yourself killed!

1165
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:34,797
You stupid, pigheaded...
What are you trying to prove?

1166
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:40,406
They always said
I was a bum.

1167
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:45,372
Well, I ain't a bum, Edie.

1168
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:48,415
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

1169
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:52,384
I'm just gonna go down there
and get my rights.

1170
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:42,128
All right.
Everybody works today.

1171
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:19,663
- What do you think, Boss?
- That ain't such a bad picture of you.

1172
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:23,676
Stop breathing that clam sauce on me.
What's doing?

1173
01:36:23,744 --> 01:36:27,840
Let me work on that cheese-eater.
I'll top the bum off lovely.

1174
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:30,213
Wait'll we get off
this front page.

1175
01:36:30,284 --> 01:36:34,243
Then he's mine!
I want him.

1176
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:37,017
You hear that?
He's mine.

1177
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:45,865
Where're them cops of yours, stoolie?
You're gonna need them.

1178
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:54,132
You're still short
in the hatch, Mac.

1179
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:59,038
Spec! Bring me
the first man you see.

1180
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:01,976
Hey, you!

1181
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,644
Here's your man, Mac.

1182
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:13,716
You want more of the same?
Come back tomorrow.

1183
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:18,596
All right.
That's it.

1184
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,088
I hope that bum comes down here.

1185
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:46,092
I love he come down here.

1186
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,821
Did you ever hear
of the Sullivan law?

1187
01:37:47,895 --> 01:37:50,989
They'll be down on us
for the slightest infraction.

1188
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,192
I'm gonna be indicted any minute!

1189
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:55,531
Come on, now!
Give me! Give me!

1190
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,098
Will you get it
through your heads?

1191
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:03,268
They're dusting off
the hot seat for me!

1192
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:08,974
We're a law-abiding union.
Understand?

1193
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,245
Hey, Friendly!

1194
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:51,480
John Friendly,
come out of there!

1195
01:38:55,129 --> 01:38:57,063
Come on out of there!

1196
01:38:58,165 --> 01:39:00,099
You wanna know
the trouble with you?

1197
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:03,466
You think it makes you a big man
if you give the answers.

1198
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:06,233
At the right time,
I'll catch up with you.

1199
01:39:06,307 --> 01:39:08,241
Now beat it.
Don't push your luck.

1200
01:39:08,309 --> 01:39:10,277
Wait a minute, you!

1201
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:13,336
You take them heaters away
and you're nothing! You know that?

1202
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:15,075
You'll talk yourself
in the river.

1203
01:39:15,149 --> 01:39:17,674
Take the good goods away
and the kickbacks...

1204
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:21,744
the shakedown cabbage
and the <i>pistoleros</i> and you're nothing!

1205
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:25,121
Your guts is all in your wallet
and your trigger finger!

1206
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:27,126
You ratted on us!

1207
01:39:27,194 --> 01:39:30,493
From where you stand,
but I'm standing over here now!

1208
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:33,499
I was ratting on myself all them years
and didn't know it!

1209
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:34,693
Come on!

1210
01:39:34,768 --> 01:39:38,932
You give it toJoey, to Dugan,
to Charley, who was one of your own.

1211
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:41,873
You think you're God Almighty.
But you know what you are?

1212
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:44,638
- Come on!
- You're a cheap, lousy...

1213
01:39:44,712 --> 01:39:46,907
dirty, stinking mug!

1214
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:49,472
And I'm glad
what I done to you!

1215
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:53,384
You hear that?
I'm glad what I done!

1216
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:56,150
- I'm gonna keep doing it till I get...
- Come on!

1217
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:28,784
That boy fights like he used to!

1218
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,692
- They'll kill him.
- It's a massacre.

1219
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:44,863
He's one of theirs anyway.

1220
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:51,043
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go!

1221
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:55,340
That's enough.

1222
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,350
Just let him lay there.

1223
01:41:20,474 --> 01:41:21,839
What happened?

1224
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:25,274
What happened?

1225
01:41:25,345 --> 01:41:27,313
Jimmy, what happened?

1226
01:41:34,788 --> 01:41:36,221
Where you going?

1227
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:38,485
- Let me by.
- Come here!

1228
01:41:52,973 --> 01:41:54,565
You want him?

1229
01:41:57,077 --> 01:41:58,408
You can have him!

1230
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:07,110
The little rat's yours.

1231
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:20,199
Get some fresh water!

1232
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:31,410
- Who's in charge here?
- Yours truly's in charge here!

1233
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:34,276
We gotta get this ship out of here!
It's costing us money.

1234
01:42:34,348 --> 01:42:38,751
Blow your whistle.
Come on, you guys! Get to work!

1235
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:40,411
Come on!

1236
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:43,547
- What goes?
- I'll have them working in two minutes.

1237
01:42:43,624 --> 01:42:45,717
He'd better get these men working.

1238
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,726
Go on down!

1239
01:42:48,795 --> 01:42:50,524
Come on! On the double.
Get to work!

1240
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:53,395
You heard me.
Come on! Get in there!

1241
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:55,264
Get in there!

1242
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:58,463
- How about Terry?
- He don't work, we don't work.

1243
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:01,201
Work?
He can't even walk!

1244
01:43:01,275 --> 01:43:04,938
You wanna know who works?
The ones I pick to work! Now get going!

1245
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:09,312
All of you! Get in there!
Come on! Get to work!

1246
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:10,680
Come on!
Get up here!

1247
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:13,413
Come on, Pop. On the double.
You work today.

1248
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:15,512
All my life,
you pushed me around.

1249
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:17,614
Come on!

1250
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:30,168
How do you like it?
How do you like it?
