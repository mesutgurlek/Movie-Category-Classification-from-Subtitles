to talk to Taylor in private. Sorry.

306
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,129
There's a phenomenon
known as the attachment theory...

307
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,596
...which is what it sounds like.
I can't believe the guy got published...

308
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,897
...coining a term that self-evident.
But the point is that children...

309
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,708
...can forgive and look past a lot
when it comes to their parent...

310
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:54,974
...even if that parent
is a very, very imbalanced mother.

- Fourteen.

312

When I was your age...

313
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,552
...my mother used to duct tape oven mitts
to my hands to keep me from masturbating...

314
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,783
...which was such a violation,
and it didn't work, by the way...

315
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,985
...and I started to harbor
a lot of resentment.

316
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,563
Yet here I am
still making excuses for her.

317
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,096
Why are you telling me this?

318
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,762
Because I don't believe you when you say
you'll notify us if your mom contacts you.

319
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,073
Hey, I empathize.

320
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,871
But you have to know there's a price
you pay for covering for an unfit mom:

321
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,570
It's your own self-worth.

322
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,748
You seem like a well-adjusted young man
with good moral development.

323

Don't let your mom wring that out of you
because of her mistakes, okay?

Lilah was an active pen pal-er.

She should never have been

Her jerk of a husband was abusive...
