<i>MOTHER</i>

2
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:13,883
At ease!

3
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,387
Salute!

4
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,892
Do-joon!

5
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,589
Hey, Benz! You asshole!

6
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,701
Do-joon, are you okay?

7
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,200
Oh no, blood!

8
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,099
Oh no, blood!
Do-joon, you're bleeding!

9
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,605
Shit, mom, get back in the store!

10
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,602
You're bleeding!

11
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,282
He's bleeding!

12
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,383
I knew it!
This is your own blood!

13
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,581
To the golf course.
Royal Palace Country Club!

14
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,989
Did they go there?

15
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,184
You idiot,

16
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,989
Where else in this town
would a Benz be going?

17
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,999
Is this hit-and-run?

18
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,591
Bastards who slam on the gas
after hitting someone

19
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,397
deserve to have
their faces slammed.

20
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:06,896
Look!

21
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,601
- I'm bleeding!
- All right, All right.

22
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,104
Plate number 5362...
White Benz...

23
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,283
It's 5293, idiot.
A black Benz, fuck.

24
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,285
Ah, a black Benz, black...

25
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,584
How could you mix up...

26
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,191
It could happen.

27
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,090
For you, it could...
That head of yours is special.

28
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:33,597
Oh, there it is!

29
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,079
That must've hurt.

30
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,786
Come on, stupid.

31
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,299
Enough, it's not a surgery.

32
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,205
What are you, a doctor?

33
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:22,102
Wait, don't move your finger.
What are you doing?

34
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,275
This is driving me crazy.

35
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,880
Where the heck has he gone?

36
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,382
It's a golf course.

37
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,891
Right. It's a golf course.

38
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,987
But you don't remember
why we came, do you?

39
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,293
Yay!

40
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,103
Twelve of them!

41
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,502
What does she see in you anyway?

42
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,310
Your mom?

43
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,980
Right, mom...

44
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,677
The car... Vroom.

45
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,980
Crash!

46
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,884
My blood!

47
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,690
This is revenge.

48
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,592
Right, we're here for revenge.

49
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:15,701
Anyway,

50
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,401
Where the fuck are
these Benz assholes?

51
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,403
They should have passed by now.

52
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,602
Wow, look!

53
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,812
What're you gonna do
with all those golf balls?

54
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,689
I'll give it to a girl.

55
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,487
You got someone to give it to?

56
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,089
Uh... Yeah.

57
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,897
You ever slept with a woman?

58
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,096
Idiot...

59
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,296
You with your pretty face.

60
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,997
I slept with a woman.

61
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,402
What woman?

62
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,702
Mom.

63
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,773
Where the fuck are they...

64
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,302
Come on!

65
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,601
They're here!

66
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,707
Revenge! Revenge!

67
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,804
What's that idiot doing?

68
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,505
What's with him?

69
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,011
Fucking assholes!

70
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,283
Stop the car! You!

71
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,477
What are you doing?

72
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,087
Who do you think you are?
What is this?

73
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,790
You shitheads!

74
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:27,593
Who was driving the car?
You hit-and-run bastards!

75
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,394
Who was driving? You?

76
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:37,807
What is this?

77
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,104
- What's gotten into you?
- Who was it?

78
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,712
Were you the one driving?

79
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,691
Excuse me.

80
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,798
This person is
too important to be here...

81
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,501
As I was saying, settlement
would be better for both of you.

82
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,109
After all, respected professors
such as yourselves

83
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,875
being involved in a hit-and-run...

84
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,577
And these two aren't
some kind of hustlers.

85
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,085
They're just local kids.

86
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:29,188
So we're going to settle, okay?

87
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,199
The hit-and-run and the assault

88
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,296
cancel each other out.

89
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,199
<i>Do-joon</i>
The verbal threats don't factor in.

90
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,298
Dean Kwon, the car...

91
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:46,207
They smashed my rearview mirror
in the parking lot.

92
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,313
A Mercedes Benz 280.

93
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,989
Aw fuck, why the hell
did you smash their mirror?

94
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,689
That'll cost a lot.

95
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,386
You bet.

96
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,796
Damn... Why did I do that?

97
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,496
You know how much that cost,
you dumb retard?

98
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,309
Retard?

99
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,511
What are you doing?

100
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,285
Let go! Let me go!

101
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,580
That bastard,
who does he think he is?

102
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,779
Sit down, Mister.

103
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,389
The mirror on a Benz...
That would cost...

104
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,690
A lot.

105
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,995
$1500? $2000?

106
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,899
Ah, here she comes...

107
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,600
Good afternoon, sir.

108
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,083
Eat up.

109
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,482
Eat.

110
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:12,689
Always eat well after
coming back from the police station.

111
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,501
Fuck...

112
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,103
I can feed myself.

113
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,479
I boiled this
with deodeok root and gugija.

114
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,586
It's good for your virility.

115
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,382
Really? My virility?

116
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,483
Why are you
so concerned about that?

117
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,494
Women.

118
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,590
Are you seeing someone?

119
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,397
Sure. Gonna sleep with her.

120
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,697
Sleep with her?

121
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,100
Who is it?

122
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,704
Gonna sleep with a woman.

123
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,777
How could you do that to
that Benz-whatever?

124
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,180
That expensive mirror?

125
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,380
Smash! With my foot.

126
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,985
It was revenge!

127
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,591
Good boy.

128
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,692
But I've got no money.

129
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,391
Where will I dig that up?

130
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,001
Whose yard will I dig it up in?

131
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,298
Why dig it up?
Just borrow it from Jin-tae.

132
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,700
Jin-tae!

133
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,708
Stay away from him.
Rotten kid.

134
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,812
He's from bad seed.

135
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,776
Okay.

136
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,581
Where are you going?

137
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,983
To meet Jin-tae.

138
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,988
You should finish dinner.

139
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,392
Have some medicine then.
You shouldn't skip medicine.

140
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,506
Do-joon, you didn't finish this.

141
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,612
Come home early!

142
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,174
Don't be late.

143
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,785
It doesn't hurt, right?

144
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,779
No, it's fine.

145
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:29,089
This won't hurt,
and I won't charge you for it.

146
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,389
So can you lend me some money?

147
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,397
How much?

148
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,698
It's really urgent.

149
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,895
And I'll give you medicine
instead of interest.

150
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,707
- Medicine?
- Yes!

151
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,809
To make you pregnant,

152
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,003
guaranteed effective.

153
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,807
Is there such a thing?

154
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,075
It really works.

155
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:55,175
I took some, and then
I got pregnant with Do-joon.

156
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,585
Your son will be
just as good-looking.

157
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,385
Do-joon...

158
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,486
His eyes are a work of art.

159
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,994
Like a deer's.

160
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,598
- Like mine?
- Yeah.

161
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,995
They're just like yours.

162
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,796
They're beautiful.

163
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,602
Anyway,

164
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,507
you're looking sexier these days...

165
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,106
- I mean...
- Yeah, whatever.

166
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,874
Why hasn't Jin-tae shown up?

167
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,686
He's not?

168
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,685
He should be here by now.

169
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,591
You've been saying that for hours.

170
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,287
Don't mess with me.

171
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:42,298
I just came back
from the police station.

172
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,493
Have some respect.

173
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,607
Jin-tae, where the hell are you?
Hurry up!

174
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,876
Go to bed, mom!

175
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:08,586
I'm staying up late.
I told you to go to sleep.

176
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,400
Good shot!

177
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,379
Hey, wake up.

178
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,078
Wake up!

179
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,283
Do something about him.

180
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,306
Did you have a nice sleep?

181
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,603
Wipe the spit off your face.

182
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,812
Goddamn freak,
piss off and go to hell.

183
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:07,385
Call your mom and tell her
to come pay the bill!

184
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,577
This is driving me crazy.

185
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,278
Do-joon!

186
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,287
Hey, I told you
to use the backstairs.

187
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,689
- Mina!
- How have you been?

188
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:20,292
Yeah, you wanna
have a drink with me?

189
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,592
Really?

190
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:26,397
- Turn around and march!
- Call me.

191
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,306
Okay, I'm going.

192
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,409
Shut up
and go do your homework.

193
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,005
That skirt is pretty.

194
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,614
You! Turn around!

195
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,478
Her legs are prettier.

196
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,585
Get your eyes off her!

197
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,584
Get out of here!

198
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,779
<i>BAR MANHATTAN</i>

199
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,784
Please fuck off, okay?

200
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,086
Wait...

201
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,789
To pay for the drinks...

202
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,695
Expensive ones...

203
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:26,893
Hey!

204
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,597
Hey!

205
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,297
Where are you going?

206
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,612
How about you and me...

207
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,106
have a drink?

208
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,484
With a guy... Don't want to?

209
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,790
You don't like guys?

210
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:23,581
So late...

211
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,784
What was her name, Ah-jung?

212
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,794
It's Moon Ah-Jung.

213
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,990
Seorin Girls' High School,
second year, fourth class.

214
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,000
You called her house?
She has guardians?

215
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,196
There's a grandmother,

216
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,605
but she's a real loon.

217
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,905
Always walking around with
a rice liquor bottle in her fist,

218
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,307
making a scene.

219
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,274
So the kid is the guardian.

220
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,682
She takes care of her grandma.

221
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:42,485
Anyway, how long has it been
since we had a murder case?

222
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:49,100
It's the first since I came here.

223
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,501
Has it been that long?

224
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:53,695
Yep.

225
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,111
The crime scene seems intact.

226
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,475
It is.

227
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,082
Quite a picture, huh?

228
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,680
Cops these days...

229
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,185
You know, CSI and all that on TV.

230
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,381
They all watch it.

231
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,890
The forensics team
is pretty sharp, too.

232
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,095
Anyway,
a rain shower passed earlier.

233
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,589
So things must be
pretty mucked up.

234
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,499
I suppose.

235
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,898
Anyway, it must have been
a blunt object.

236
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,707
A fractured cranium,
lots of blood...

237
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:43,985
What's with this?

238
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,885
Didn't this come in last week?

239
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:50,990
God, that smell...

240
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,994
Yeah, well...

241
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,099
This smells like a rotting corpse.

242
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,402
My god!

243
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,697
Look at this if you're not blind.

244
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,102
And the appearance...

245
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,108
People are going to think
they're from China.

246
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,112
Ma'am, these are from China.

247
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,304
Hey!

248
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,478
Give me a break.
Don't even mention China.

249
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,279
Besides, Chinese imports
aren't that bad.

250
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,688
Don't tell me...

251
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,182
You're still giving acupuncture
without a license?

252
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,191
No, no way!

253
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,695
My husband is a public official.

254
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:27,992
You know how much trouble
we'll be in?

255
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,101
Sure, I know.

256
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:31,800
He'll be promoted soon,

257
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,497
so let's not cause any trouble.

258
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,804
Last year, do you know how hard
it was to cover for you?

259
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,611
You think only you will
get in trouble?

260
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,272
It will ruin my family completely.

261
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,476
Listen when someone's
talking to you.

262
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,677
Mom!

263
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:58,295
Do-joon! Do-joon!

264
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,600
Mom!

265
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,198
Get down!

266
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,297
Oh geez...

267
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,306
She's a good runner.

268
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,278
Yoon Do-joon, you're charged with
the murder of Moon Ah-jung.

269
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,686
You have the right to remain silent

270
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:03,586
but there's no way
you'll be able to afford a lawyer.

271
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:06,296
There she is.

272
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:07,796
Not that she can
afford to do anything.

273
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,996
Can't you drive, idiot?

274
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,699
Are you hurt anywhere?

275
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,000
Turn your head.
Your head isn't hurt?

276
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:19,508
Turn your head around.

277
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,771
Why is he...

278
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,788
- A dog?
- Dog...

279
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,890
- A wolf?
- Dog...

280
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,788
It's usually hot here.

281
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,896
We're all guys here,
so take that off.

282
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,691
Your pants too, okay?

283
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,096
- Pants?
- Take off your pants, it's okay.

284
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:48,604
This isn't police torture.

285
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,903
I'm taking my pants off too.
It feels good.

286
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:58,980
Anyway Do-joon,
Have you heard of Sepaktakraw?

287
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,177
- You have, right?
- No.

288
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,182
Only likes mainstream sports,
the fucker.

289
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:08,893
Bite it!

290
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,497
Come here and bite it.

291
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,701
That's right, turn around.

292
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:20,998
The sin always turns around.

293
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,700
Stand straight. Close your eyes.

294
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,505
Don't move or you'll get hurt.
Bite it hard!

295
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,479
Did you see it?

296
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:31,973
I bet not.

297
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:36,578
This is power of Sepaktakraw.

298
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,282
It's one of the basic moves.

299
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:46,987
From now on, if you don't
answer clearly yes or no,

300
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,101
I'll kill you right here.

301
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,601
I'll be watching you.

302
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,602
Do-joon,

303
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,003
what did you do last night?

304
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,404
Hey, spit out the apple.

305
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,805
What did you do?

306
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,470
I had a drink...

307
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,775
Where?

308
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,579
- Manhattan.
- That's right. And then?

309
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,286
I slept at home.

310
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,885
You slept, of course.

311
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,689
But before that, I mean...

312
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,592
At home, no,
after drinking at Manhattan

313
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,996
on your way home,
what did you do?

314
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,403
The lady at Manhattan said

315
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,301
you were like a dog in heat.

316
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,998
Her daughter, what's her name?

317
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:32,905
- Mina.
- Right. Mina.

318
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,512
You were hitting on her?

319
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,772
Well, I...

320
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,680
Answer clearly!

321
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,287
I slept at home. With mom.

322
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:49,783
- That's simple.
- You sleep with your mom?

323
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,794
You don't have to answer.

324
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,704
Anyway,
you say you don't remember

325
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,406
but everyone remembers you.

326
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,511
There was a guy who saw you
while feeding his dog.

327
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:11,279
You were following
after Moon Ah-jung.

328
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,179
Heading towards
the scene of the murder.

329
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,581
Isn't that right?

330
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,288
I don't remember...

331
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,791
You wanna
die here right now, punk?

332
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,792
We've got plenty of apples.

333
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,295
- Open your mouth.
- Never mind that.

334
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,395
You know,

335
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,194
we also found something

336
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,803
next to the body.

337
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,480
Why didn't you put up
a marker next to the body?

338
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,379
With your name written right on it.

339
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,480
- Don't laugh.
- Do-joon,

340
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,884
Just between us...

341
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:53,882
Why did you do it?

342
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,790
On personal level,
I'm really curious.

343
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,199
So did you want to do it
with Moon Ah-jung?

344
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:13,709
We need to know why,
then the judge can be lenient.

345
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,980
Maybe we can
do something for you.

346
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,475
He's asking this
for your own benefit.

347
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,178
Do-joon.

348
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,190
To be honest,

349
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,693
you're not the kind of person
to commit murder.

350
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,194
Not everyone
is able to kill someone.

351
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,490
You've never been a bad kid.

352
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,999
I can be bad.

353
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:44,301
Jesus...

354
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:50,076
Right, anyone can commit murder.

355
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,574
It's not like you need a license.

356
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,379
Anyway,
you don't know the motive,

357
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,392
but you killed her, right?

358
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,399
The fact that you killed her,
that's what's important.

359
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,297
He confessed.

360
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:16,905
Anyway, this document contains
all the details of the case, see?

361
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,908
Check it over.

362
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,878
But you can read, right?

363
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,573
Want me to read it for you?

364
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,479
I can read.

365
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:32,386
Sure, anyway, don't just sign it
without reading it.

366
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,083
Check the contents, and sign.

367
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,784
Read it well.

368
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,689
Why did you do it!

369
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,295
How could you do that?

370
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,001
They hit you?

371
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,504
The cops beat you, didn't they?

372
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:57,071
Where did they hit you?

373
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,577
An apple...

374
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:00,977
Apple

375
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,677
Apple

376
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,193
Do-joon,

377
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,701
at times like this,
you need to focus your mind.

378
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:21,498
Focus. Take a deep breath.

379
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:29,977
Do-joon...

380
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,881
Everyone says I killed her.

381
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,678
Breathe like me.

382
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,677
And so...

383
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,182
the sin turns around
a few times

384
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:42,988
- and comes back to me.
- What are you mumbling about?

385
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,187
Did you really sign
that confession?

386
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,799
Why? Why? Why?

387
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,496
Even if you really did it,
you have to deny it.

388
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,005
If I killed her, I should admit it.

389
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,301
Did you kill her?

390
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,707
Are you crazy? Of course not.

391
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,506
Then why did you sign it, idiot!

392
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,774
Don't call your son an idiot!

393
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,492
Je-mun,

394
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,103
How could you
of all people do this to him?

395
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,398
You know him,

396
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,508
he couldn't even hurt a water bug.

397
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,679
A water bug...

398
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,587
Wipe off your face first.

399
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,299
Je-mun,

400
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:05,699
here's some of the camphor ginseng
you used to take in high school.

401
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:10,678
You said it helped you think clearly.

402
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,681
- Take it.
- Listen.

403
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,580
From early morning,

404
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,382
I'm going to be up dealing

405
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,491
with the Juhwang county
robbery case.

406
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,483
And... that crazy kid JP ran away

407
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,095
from the sanatorium
on Mt. Dogye.

408
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,392
I gotta go there and then...

409
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:32,492
I know, I know
how busy you are, but...

410
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,197
What I mean is...

411
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:42,908
regarding Do-joon,

412
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:48,984
his case is closed, okay?

413
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,186
Do you understand?

414
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,496
It's finished, 100%.

415
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,600
Bastard,
you sure were having fun.

416
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,576
I left early, you ass.

417
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,488
Excuse me, people. Step aside.

418
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,903
What the hell are you doing?

419
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,806
What's inside this thing anyway?

420
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,683
Put it down there.

421
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,285
Turn it over.

422
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,592
What in god's name
are you doing?

423
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,199
Are you kidding me?

424
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,804
Turn the damn thing over.

425
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,902
Mister, don't touch it!

426
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,905
Actually I'm not a relative,

427
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:22,910
but I'm close to them.

428
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,173
Sir!

429
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,882
If there's a reason
you believe he's not guilty, tell us.

430
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,788
If you read through this here,
you see this golf ball?

431
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,393
The golf ball has
already been reported.

432
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,995
What's this?
'Apple-biting human rights abuses'?

433
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,695
Mister, please read it
before throwing it away.

434
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,199
Read it carefully first,
then throw it away.

435
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:50,903
It's my only son.

436
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,902
Is she crazy?

437
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,772
Why is that woman here?

438
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:33,881
Who?

439
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,683
Yoon Do-joon's mother...

440
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,383
No...

441
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,489
How the hell could you?

442
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,193
Are you out of your mind?

443
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,488
I'm just...

444
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:52,501
As a member of this community
I wanted to pay my respects.

445
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,598
You came to apologize?
For your son?

446
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,300
Does that make sense?

447
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:10,181
Actually, my son didn't do it.

448
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:17,592
Listen everyone,
regardless what the world may think,

449
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,288
you of all people
must understand!

450
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,696
It wasn't my son!

451
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,100
She's completely insane!

452
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,297
Hey bitch!

453
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,408
How could you
bring your ugly face here?

454
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:32,804
Throw some salt at her!

455
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,411
I just wanted to tell you
that my son is innocent.

456
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:36,410
Stop it!

457
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,571
What do you mean he's innocent?

458
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,478
It was your son, Yoon Do-joon!

459
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,585
- The murderer!
- Bring back our Ah-jung!

460
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,777
Bring her back to us!

461
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,683
Let's talk civilly!

462
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,192
Bring Ah-jung back to life!

463
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,190
- It's a misunderstanding!
- Misunderstanding my ass!

464
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,894
Let go!

465
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,195
What's there to discuss?

466
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,795
How could she dare?

467
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,004
Shut up you fuckers!

468
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,805
What's this god damn racket?
Fucking bitches.

469
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,081
How could you
raise such a rotten son?

470
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,775
That goddamn son of a bitch!

471
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,282
Don't curse my son.
I won't stand for it!

472
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,785
Rip that bitch's tongue out!

473
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,691
Don't hate him!

474
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,990
I won't...

475
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,087
This place has the best seafood.

476
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,590
You know everything, don't you?

477
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,389
It's true.

478
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,396
Shall we sit down here?

479
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,393
When I come to a buffet,
I never sit down.

480
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,593
Don't run!

481
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,794
I just keep scooping it up
and eating it.

482
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,602
Yes of course,
because you're so busy.

483
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,404
I save time that way.

484
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:52,773
This is the lawyer, Gong Suk-ho.

485
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,782
Say hello to him.

486
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,483
Do-joon,

487
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,284
Tuck your shirt in.

488
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,996
That side, too.

489
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,493
It looks better this way.

490
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,997
Does it?

491
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:15,000
Are you getting
along well enough here?

492
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,197
Yes,

493
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,808
the food is good.

494
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,504
The rice with beans
is better than I thought.

495
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,477
Rice with beans?
That's what prisoners eat.

496
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:27,884
Do-joon!

497
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:32,978
The most important thing is
what you remember that night.

498
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:38,789
However small a detail,
just tell him what you can think of.

499
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,590
You understand?

500
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,494
What you saw, what you heard,

501
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,194
even what you smelled,
tell him everything in detail.

502
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,995
Anyway, you need to try
really hard to remember.

503
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,208
That's your only task in here.

504
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,406
Isn't that right?

505
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:58,682
Right.

506
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,677
Yes, do this.

507
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,082
Is this some kind of exercise?

508
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:11,490
No, we call it
the Temples of Doom.

509
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,097
From childhood,
whenever he does this

510
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,789
it helped him remember.

511
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,992
- So for memory?
- Yes, for memory.

512
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,399
Yes, it's some kind of,
what do you call it...

513
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,096
acupressure.

514
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,603
Oh, I remember!

515
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,302
What?

516
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,576
I didn't do it.

517
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:33,583
It wasn't me!

518
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,777
That's right!
Of course you didn't kill her.

519
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,286
No,

520
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,286
not that.

521
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,389
I didn't kick it off, the mirror!

522
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,292
On the Benz... Jin-tae...

523
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:55,794
It was Jin-tae who did it.

524
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,599
I went whoosh!
And he went crunch!

525
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:03,670
Sir.

526
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,373
Let me explain.

527
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,780
What he is saying is...
It's a long story.

528
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,976
Wait!

529
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,795
I just got an urgent message
from the office.

530
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,593
I need to go.

531
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,294
Then what about us?

532
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,407
For a first meeting,
this is enough.

533
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:33,101
- Should I Call you?
- I'll call you.

534
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,573
Then when will you call?

535
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,073
Sir...

536
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:47,791
What?

537
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:52,484
Did he leave?
He doesn't like us, does he?

538
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,790
He's a very busy man.

539
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,991
The most expensive lawyer
in our county.

540
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,500
Damn, wasn't there
anything else to tell him?

541
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,899
I should have said more.

542
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:04,007
Right, who cares about
the mirror?

543
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,201
But, you mean
it was Jin-tae who did it?

544
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,971
I knew it.

545
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,176
That rotten little scoundrel.

546
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,287
That jerk never came
to visit me even once.

547
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,883
But Do-joon,

548
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:28,091
that night, didn't you go out
to meet Jin-tae?

549
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,294
Then you never met him.

550
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,796
And the golf balls,

551
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,906
he knew about those, right?

552
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:58,092
Good afternoon.
I've come to see Attorney Gong.

553
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,788
He's not in now.

554
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,593
His car is outside.

555
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,302
He's really not here.

556
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:08,199
He is, isn't he?

557
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,399
Oh, Mr. Gong! Excuse me!

558
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,906
Oh, look who's here!

559
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,703
- Sir, I...
- Yes?

560
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,608
- Miss Kim, some green tea!
- What I'd like to say is...

561
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,376
If he's here, why can't I...

562
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,576
Ma'am,
would you prefer coffee?

563
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,485
To be honest,
about your case,

564
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:31,686
we are proceeding
slowly and methodically.

565
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:32,796
Here, have some.

566
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,388
I understand you feel impatient.

567
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,501
But what can we do?

568
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,796
You just need to wait patiently.

569
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:45,705
But we need to open an investigation
on Do-joon's friend, Jin-tae!

570
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,107
Ma'am!

571
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,879
Let me be honest with you.

572
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,875
In monetary terms,

573
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,177
if this were Seoul,

574
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,184
the fee we're charging

575
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,586
wouldn't cover an assault case
involving two broken teeth.

576
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:05,889
You should understand that.

577
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,102
<i>This is Jin-tae's house.</i>

578
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,480
<i>I'm out right now,</i>
<i>so leave me a message.</i>

579
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,573
<i>If you are interested</i>
<i>in fishing equipment or bait</i>

580
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:34,680
<i>You can call me at</i>
<i>010-3154-1406.</i>

581
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,192
Son of a bitch.

582
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:02,705
<i>Files on Scientific Investigation</i>

583
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,082
Blood...

584
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,603
Stop.

585
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,209
I said stop.

586
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,579
Let me look at this first.

587
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:18,976
Let me take this off first.

588
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,886
- Cooperate a little.
- Just a sec.

589
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,682
Okay, okay.

590
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,984
There you go.

591
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:32,994
Shit, this is the climax.

592
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,573
Spa-ghet-ti!

593
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,077
Ti-ra-mi-su!

594
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,384
Tsu-na-mi!

595
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,488
Mi-ner-al!

596
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:33,589
Al-arm!

597
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,589
Arm-a-dil-lo!

598
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,381
Where's Je-mun?

599
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,279
- Detective Nam Je-mun.
- What's the problem?

600
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,478
Out of my way.

601
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,091
Push this.

602
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:05,695
<i>It's not yours, right?</i>

603
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,200
<i>Yes!</i>

604
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,502
<i>Do I look pretty?</i>

605
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,606
She put way too much on.

606
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,403
Isn't that...
the Manhattan lady's daughter?

607
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,679
Is this what you do together?

608
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,684
Lucky bastard.

609
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,193
Watch this part, here.

610
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:36,690
That's what it is, lipstick?

611
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,392
But do you play golf?

612
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:41,203
Me, golf?

613
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,705
Those professors
gave it to me when they left.

614
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,308
Excuse me. Sir?

615
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,079
Do we really have to call
the forensics team?

616
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:55,776
Anyone can tell
this is just lipstick.

617
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,186
All right,
tell them not to bother.

618
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,012
Wait!

619
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:29,581
Take an umbrella.

620
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,684
Wait a minute.

621
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,990
I went to pick you up
at the station.

622
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:54,497
Please get in.
Attorney Gong wants to see you.

623
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,374
Welcome, ma'am.

624
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:11,475
We started without you.

625
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,486
You, wait outside.

626
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:17,682
Have a seat.

627
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,587
You've had quite a day today.

628
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,994
I heard it from the police chief.

629
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,402
I feel so sad for you.

630
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,001
It's the first time I've seen
you sitting down.

631
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,472
Ah, you have a fine wit.

632
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,676
Pass her a drink.

633
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,381
Ma'am, do you remember
the 2002 World Cup?

634
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,887
The Red Devils,

635
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,493
Gus Hiddink!

636
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,790
Four years passed in a flash

637
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,496
I could still feel
the excitement of 2002.

638
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,901
But then suddenly
it was 2006.

639
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,702
The Germany World Cup!

640
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:10,469
Four years
is no time at all, I mean.

641
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,782
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

642
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,180
Regarding Do-joon,

643
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,788
let's send him off
for just four years.

644
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,894
It'll be a hospital, not a jail,

645
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,395
and he won't
have to serve 15 years.

646
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,102
Ma'am!

647
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,098
We need to think realistically.

648
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:41,302
Four years in a mental institution
for this case is a legal jackpot!

649
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:49,275
Music!

650
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,881
Ma'am.
I forgot to introduce you.

651
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:03,097
To my right,
my high school classmate,

652
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,598
the president of
Agape Psychiatric Hospital,

653
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:08,295
Doctor Yoon Jong-gu!

654
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:12,403
Hey, wake him up?

655
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,402
And next to me

656
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:18,776
my bar exam classmate,

657
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,475
Attorney Park Jong-pyo!

658
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,379
He's handsome.

659
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,681
What? Are you holding a protest?

660
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,685
He's smashed
after just a few drinks.

661
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:30,986
Mr. Gong!

662
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,899
Look, my son is...

663
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,003
Do-joon!

664
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:04,581
Why are you so late?

665
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:10,986
You've been drinking, haven't you?

666
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,591
It's so late...

667
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,188
Did you eat?

668
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:20,002
Eat?

669
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:23,601
I was wondering if you ate.

670
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,602
Thanks so much for asking.

671
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,907
Anyway,
I feel so fucking betrayed.

672
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:31,673
How could you
do this to me, bitch!

673
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:38,278
Jin-tae, I did a terrible thing.

674
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,082
Forget that.

675
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:44,088
Just pay me $5000
as a settlement.

676
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,087
In cash.

677
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:50,294
All I have right now...

678
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:52,792
it's not much...

679
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,798
Wait...

680
01:02:54,937 --> 01:03:04,369
I've been saving this
to pay back my debt.

681
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,175
Take this for now.

682
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:15,685
Okay.

683
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,795
Send the rest to my bank account.

684
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,898
I'll text you the account number.

685
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,192
You know what texting is?
