1
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,930
Aside from the money wasted,

2
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,367
and the embarrassment
to our American friends,

3
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,723
the debacle at the Turkish-Syrian border
has put us back five years

4
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,883
in terms of intelligence sourcing
with Syria and the Middle East.

5
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,126
I'm extending the meeting
so we can fully explore the reasons

6
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,961
why the operation went ahead
with such poor and corrupted intelligence,

7
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,330
and what lessons can be learnt
to ensure this never happens again.

8
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,409
What led you to believe
that British arms were being exported

9
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,050
under the counter through TradePass?

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,564
I was shown fake MOD end user certificates

11
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,049
for seven different arms companies,
UK and US.

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,001
Do you mean these?

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,447
Yes.

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,728
Those are genuine MOD export certificates
for Bulgaria and Italy.

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,881
That's not true.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,369
I have signed letters from both Italian and
Bulgarian governments confirming the sales.

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,800
This is a cover up.

18
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,522
Angela, are you accusing me of lying?

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,801
I spoke
to Rex Mayhew during his handover,

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,450
before he joined the Royal Commission.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,531
He said that you persuaded someone to leak
information from the River House.

22
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,081
Someone you referred to as the Boatman?

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,489
I've never heard of such a name.

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,160
Then how did you
get hold of those certificates?

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,970
They're classified documents.

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,129
An angel gave them to me.

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,611
With a halo.

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,170
You do understand the seriousness
of this enquiry, Ms Burr?

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,051
Let us now move on to
the arms swoop itself.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,803
Based on what we now know
to be flawed intelligence,

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,770
you authorised, through
an American Enforcement connection,

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,490
and behind the FCO's back,

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,567
a full US military raid on 20 aid trucks
crossing the Turkish-Syrian border.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,321
Rex Mayhew authorised it. Not me.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,521
On his last day.

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,088
And on your cast-iron guarantee
that the intelligence was solid.

37
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,645
Where did you get this intelligence?

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,049
A source close to TradePass
and Richard Roper.

39
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,850
Can you be more specific?

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,048
To do so would be to put lives at risk.
No, I can't do that.

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,971
Mmm, this is a behind-closed-doors
enquiry, Ms Burr.

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,361
Names will be redacted
from the records. So,

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,440
why can't you tell us?

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,891
You know why.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,570
You all know why.

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,125
They pulled out this morning.

47
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,011
Order from the Ministry.

48
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,449
So it's just you and me again then, is it?

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
Not even that, I'm afraid.

50
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,562
Two weeks and they close the office.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,289
The International Enforcement Agency
is officially mothballed.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,286
Go home, Angela.

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,840
Have your baby.

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,401
Be a teacher's wife.

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,006
You mean give up? What about Pine?

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,923
Pine gave you false intelligence.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,960
- I don't believe that.
- Are you sure about that?

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,960
I went to him. I got him involved in this.
I can't just leave him in there.

59
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,840
I don't see what choice you have.

60
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,840
Oh, didn't you hear?
You don't work here any more.

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,082
I just wanted to say thank you.

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,480
And if you ever needed help in the future.

63
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,885
Ah, well, don't hold your breath.

64
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,961
Angela Burr.

65
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,127
Who is this?

66
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,440
<i>Yes, is Sophie there, please?</i>

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,887
- Sophie? No there isn't a...
<i>- Well, when she comes,</i>

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,369
<i>could you tell her we're all here.</i>

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,805
<i>At the same hotel.</i>

70
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,250
<i>Tell her we're all here.</i>

71
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,161
He's in Cairo.

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,882
Mr Roper, your courier has arrived.
I'll send him up.

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,121
Thank you.

74
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,165
Thank you very much.

75
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,960
You ever been to Cairo before?

76
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,886
No, erm...

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,482
I've spent some time in Morocco and Tunisia,
but this is my first time in Egypt.

78
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,846
Well, you should take advantage.

79
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,888
See the sights while
we're off down the Nile.

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,606
Andrew isn't coming with us?

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
Absolutely not.

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,683
You and I are going to be very busy.

83
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,288
Why, Richard Roper,
I do declare...

84
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,410
Speaking of true love...

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,001
What's she doing here?

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,884
Thought you might want some
female company.

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,401
Caroline.

88
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,281
Look who's back.

89
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,050
Caro, lovely to see you.

90
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,521
- Thank you.
- Morning, Sandy.

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,002
- Morning.
- Hi, darling.

92
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,641
Great to see you.

93
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,171
Er, listen, I just need a few minutes
with the young prince here,

94
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,210
so why don't you girls
go and lay waste to the local bazaar?

95
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,646
Fine, baby.

96
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,481
Tabby, would you?

97
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,200
- See you later.
- See you later.

98
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,409
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

99
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,525
You know what this reminds me of?

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,567
Winston Churchill and TE Lawrence
in a Cairo hotel

101
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,371
dividing up the Middle East
over champagne and a cigar.

102
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,731
Drew a map on a napkin and shook hands.

103
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,165
Kings of Arabia.

104
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,648
I'm guessing that you're
Churchill in this scenario.

105
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,961
If you insist.

106
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,606
Damn shame about Corky, though.

107
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,766
I feel as if...

108
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,448
If I'd known, I could probably have
talked him round.

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,602
Could have explained that
even traitors can be forgiven.

110
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,050
Actually be pretty useful.

111
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,805
Keep tabs on the enemy.
Blow smoke in their face.

112
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,521
But they have to commit, that's the thing.

113
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,810
Have to make a decision.

114
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,889
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
You've already made your decision,
haven't you?

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,640
A long time ago.

117
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,401
Kings of Arabia.

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,643
Freddie Hamid, how are you?

119
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,763
- Hello, sir.
- Good to see you.

120
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,642
May I introduce Andrew Birch, our director.

121
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,723
Pleasure to meet you, Freddie.
Dickie's told me lots about you.

122
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,765
Welcome to Cairo.

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,569
- Thank you.
- It's going to be fun.

124
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,321
Oh, I can't wait.

125
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,086
Well. Shall we?

126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,886
Mr Kouyami.

127
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,841
East is East and West is West.

128
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,443
And never the twain shall meet.

129
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,406
Good to see you, Mr Roper.

130
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,081
After you.

131
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,761
So, spec list, not changed?

132
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,121
It's all there, sir.

133
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,000
The consignment's being held in a secure
military zone on the outskirts of the city.

134
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,327
Ready for collection.

135
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,331
And the payment structure?

136
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,842
As discussed.
Half now and half on exchange.

137
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,004
We'll meet again in 48 hours' time.

138
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,402
Then, if all parties are satisfied,

139
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,802
I suggest we sanction
the first half of the payment

140
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,445
to be made to the TradePass account.

141
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,401
Wait.

142
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,051
We had report of an incident
involving US military at the Syrian border.

143
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,642
I want your reassurance that there is
no risk attached to this transaction.

144
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,409
Can you give this assurance, Mr Roper?

145
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,407
We had a minor issue.

146
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,601
Internal.

147
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,361
It's been investigated and addressed.

148
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,087
You have my word.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,001
Let us proceed.

150
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,040
It's done.

151
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,401
Thank you.

152
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

153
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,246
Who needs another drink?

154
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,366
Oh, not for me.

155
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,160
Smile at me. Laugh.

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,001
Tell me a joke then.

157
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,450
I can't do this any more, Jonathan.

158
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,162
I can't. I can't sleep
with him another night.

159
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,761
You have to.

160
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,640
Why can't we go away?
Just the two of us. Now.

161
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,730
It isn't just about you and me.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,729
Funny, funny joke.

163
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,246
A courier came last night.

164
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,085
Delivered papers about the shipment.

165
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,440
They're in the safe.

166
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,200
Do you know the combination?

167
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,081
I'll get it for you.

168
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,041
Be careful.

169
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,764
Excuse me, sir,
could I have a vodka martini, please?

170
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,046
You're up early.

171
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,606
We're going shopping.

172
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,769
You can't have too many rugs, apparently.

173
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,007
Right.

174
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,686
Look at you.

175
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,328
Quite the Roper acolyte.

176
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,051
How things change.

177
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,961
Yes, they do, don't they?

178
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,007
Me? Oh, I'm the prodigal wife brought to heel.
Didn't you hear?

179
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,961
Brought to heel by what?

180
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,724
Roper made me an offer.

181
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,566
Let bygones be bygones
and return to the fold.

182
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,244
Very... Very decent of him.

183
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,927
That may be.

184
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,447
Or maybe he just wanted someone
to spy on his girlfriend.

185
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,601
Careful, Caro.

186
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,641
Sun's hot out there.

187
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,921
Caro, is that true?

188
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,690
He said if I didn't agree,
I'd never see the children again.

189
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,647
I hate him.

190
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,848
Message from London.

191
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,211
I didn't expect you to come.

192
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,686
Oh, ye of little faith.

193
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,648
Actually, it was me that took
some persuading.

194
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,606
- I don't know who you are.
- Oh, sorry.

195
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,802
Joel Steadman,
American Enforcement Agency.

196
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,321
- Pine.
- And I think you might be playing both sides.

197
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,245
Wait. What are you talking about?
What is this?

198
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,367
There was a leak.

199
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,320
The leak was at your end, not mine.

200
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,801
I killed a man to patch it.

201
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,681
Corkoran?

202
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,401
Jonathan, if you want to get out now,
I can get you out.

203
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,527
- No.
- There is still time left...

204
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,324
You don't want that and nor do I.
We're so close.

205
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,084
I don't have an organisation any more.

206
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,611
I've got no recourse to troops.

207
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,250
No international enforcement support.

208
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,922
Just a cowboy and a pregnant woman.
That's your army.

209
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,930
Jonathan, if things go wrong,
I can't guarantee I can get you out.

210
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,164
I was living half a life when you met me.

211
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,131
I've got nothing to lose.

212
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,611
But I will need your help.

213
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,207
OK.

214
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,681
What can we do?

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,240
<i>Yalla,</i> one mixed salad.

216
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,566
Erm, I'm looking for
someone called Youssef.

217
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,361
That's me.

218
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,371
I hear you're a good man to speak to
about a recipe for, um, tourli.

219
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,967
- Tourli?
- Tourli.

220
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,486
- We can speak about that?
- You want to speak about tourli?

221
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,686
Yes.

222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,365
- OK.
- OK.

223
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,487
OK.

224
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,727
Wait.

225
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,361
How are you?

226
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,569
- Jonathan, you look great. Look at you.
- Oh, come on, look at you, Mr Head Chef.

227
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,530
- You got the hat and everything.
- Are you serious? Look at your watch.

228
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,886
- Oh, come on...
- How much is this, huh?

229
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,040
Come on, it's just a watch.

230
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,606
How are you?

231
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,284
What happened to you? You just disappeared.

232
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,124
I know. I know.

233
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,846
And how is your Arabic, eh?

234
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,280
You remember everything I taught you?

235
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,966
Ah, it's a little rusty.
I am... I am practising.

236
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,446
Your brother, Akhmed. He's well?

237
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,760
Is he still active?

238
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,040
What do you mean, still active?

239
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,320
Come on, you know what I mean.

240
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,887
His people had their moment
and they screwed it up.

241
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,765
I need to talk to him.

242
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,361
OK.

243
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,086
How was shopping?

244
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,880
Did you get me some of
those curly slippers?

245
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,206
No, I tried.

246
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,527
Apparently,
Egyptian men have tiny little feet.

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,650
Well, you know what they say?

248
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,688
Tiny feet, tiny shoes.

249
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,850
It is good to have Caro back, though.
She's fun.

250
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,880
Maybe she and Sandy should
come to Luxor, too.

251
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,007
Oh, no.

252
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,123
That is for the lovers.

253
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,967
Baby, I got these new silver earrings
at this souk.

254
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,920
Could you put them in the safe for me?

255
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
I don't feel comfortable leaving them out.

256
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,922
Not all Arabs are thieves, darling.

257
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,486
I didn't mean that.

258
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,160
- We always use the safe when we're...
- I'm joking.

259
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,162
They are all thieves. Give 'em here.

260
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,525
Anything unusual happen today?

261
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,484
- Oh, yes.
- What?

262
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,126
I've never been to Cairo, Sandy.

263
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,521
I've never been to Egypt. It's all unusual.

264
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,881
You know what I mean.

265
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,450
Ah, Andrew.

266
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,724
- Feeling lucky?
- Very.

267
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,524
- Caro.
- Dickie.

268
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,650
Right. Well, let's go and roll some dice.

269
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,045
Jed meet with anybody?

270
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,967
- Make a phone call?
- Nothing at all.

271
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,371
I don't know why he's so suspicious.
She's just a silly girl.

272
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,767
Except if she isn't just a silly girl,
that may be exactly how she wants to appear.

273
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,047
- Did you think about that?
- No.

274
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,966
I don't have to think like that.
That's your world.

275
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,643
My world pays for your world.

276
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,601
Don't you forget it.

277
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,405
You can keep Luxor, Dickie.

278
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,245
This is a temple.

279
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,368
You are
an inspiration to us all, Sandy.

280
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,566
I am.

281
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,326
You married?

282
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,246
Uh, no.

283
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,970
- I am married.
- Right.

284
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,644
You want me to sort out a girl for you?

285
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,326
- Easily done.
- Oh, no, no, no.

286
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,448
Thank you. It's, er...

287
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,010
It's fine. Thank you for the offer.

288
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,165
I feel like we have met before.

289
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,120
Is that possible?

290
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,681
Erm...

291
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,808
I don't think so. Er, it's unlikely.

292
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,290
<i>Je suis un gagneur!</i>

293
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,241
I'm gonna play some roulette. Anyone else?

294
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,364
- Sure.
- Good idea.

295
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,645
See which of us is the lucky one.

296
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,090
This one over here.

297
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,841
<i>Madame.</i>

298
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,441
Yes.

299
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
- Good luck, darling.
- Thank you.

300
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,485
<i>Les jeux sont faits. Merci.</i>

301
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,800
Thank you. No more bets.

302
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,762
- Drink, Freddie?
- Yes. Whisky.

303
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,640
Can I get
a fresh whisky, please, sir?

304
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,166
He's got it. 2-4-7-6.

305
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,641
All right. Well, I'll go.

306
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,567
No. I'm a pregnant woman. Perfect cover.

307
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,401
Ange, that's not cover.
You are a pregnant woman.

308
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,525
All right.

309
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,801
Well, if you're gonna go, take this.

310
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,927
Bloody hell!

311
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,001
Don't be silly, Joel. I'm English.

312
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,081
If there's a problem, I'll call you.

313
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,360
Ange, I'm not letting you
walk out that door without it.

314
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,841
Thank you.

315
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
- You do know how to use that thing, right?
- Oh...

316
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,123
Right. Now. How do I look?

317
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,202
"You look great, Angela." OK.

318
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,600
Look, if there's a problem, I'll call you.

319
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,762
- You look great.
- Oh, give over.

320
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,521
<i>Merci. Rien ne va plus.</i>

321
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,211
- There you are, Freddie.
- Ah.

322
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,401
How're you getting on?

323
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,561
Yeah?

324
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,766
<i>Yeah, hi, I'm in reception.</i>

325
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,729
<i>I have an international package
for Mr Richard Roper.</i>

326
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,086
<i>I need a signature for that.</i>

327
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,560
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
I can't drop it in the lobby.</i>

328
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,524
I need a signature. Thank you.

329
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,760
You should stop, Freddie.

330
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,002
Losing streak never ends until you cut it.

331
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,851
I'll stop when I want.

332
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,768
Ah, I am in this.

333
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,689
Losing in Daddy's casino, Freddie.

334
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,762
That's got to be a metaphor for something.

335
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,002
Let me get you a glass of champagne?

336
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,127
Yes.

337
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,850
Everybody happy?

338
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,047
I never lose.

339
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,361
Up or down, Dickie?

340
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,570
Something's not right, Sandy.

341
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,806
She's trying too hard.

342
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,167
What did Caro say?

343
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,081
She hasn't seen anything.

344
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,121
He's watching me.

345
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,121
I can tell.

346
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,246
Just keep calm.

347
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,482
Could I have two glasses
of champagne, please?

348
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,121
Thank you.

349
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,851
I never lose. OK. No.

350
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,880
- I never lose.
- Freddie, you should stop.

351
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,400
- Whoa...
- You're having fun?

352
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,846
I think it is
time to go home now.

353
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,809
- I don't want to go home.
- I think it's time to go home.

354
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,211
- I think so. I think it's probably best.
- No.

355
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,281
We play over here.

356
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,761
Big day tomorrow.

357
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,561
Go to bed.

358
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,326
OK. It's all right.

359
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,800
All right.

360
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,485
He's just had a bit too much to drink.

361
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,050
- Don't you worry, he will be fine.
- I like you.

362
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,605
- Come with me. I like her.
- Come on now.

363
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,490
- Whoa... This way, this way.
- She can come with me.

364
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,691
- I drive.
- OK.

365
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,605
I think Sandy should go instead, no?

366
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,606
Watch your step now.

367
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,285
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

368
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,721
All right, I think I'll drive, eh?

369
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,481
In you get.

370
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,281
There we go.

371
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,445
Easy. Easy, Freddie.

372
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,889
Whoa, whoa, Freddie.

373
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,200
Now.

374
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,570
- What do you say we sit down, huh?
- Sit down.

375
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,081
- Sit down? Just here?
- Oh, OK.

376
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,921
A-ha.

377
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,360
Where is your family, Freddie?

378
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,246
This isn't the family house.
This one is for business

379
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,321
and pleasure.

380
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,967
No maid?

381
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,724
No, they come in the day.

382
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,720
They come in the day.

383
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,921
Good.

384
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,000
What do you say to a drink, Freddie?

385
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,127
Yes.

386
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,520
- Whisky?
- Yes.

387
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,447
Splash of water OK?

388
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,881
Yes.

389
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,521
There you go.

390
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,641
You know, Freddie, there's, er, something
I've been meaning to ask you.

391
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,960
Hmm?

392
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,883
It's been playing on my mind.

393
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,247
You had a girlfriend called Sophie Alekan

394
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,725
in the Nefertiti Hotel.

395
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,765
Do you remember her?

396
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,731
How do you know about her?

397
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,040
Do you remember her?

398
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,161
Did you kill her?

399
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,881
My God.

400
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,726
I know you.

401
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,487
The night manager.

402
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,641
Did you kill her?

403
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,411
Why do you care? She was a whore.

404
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,371
- Did you kill her?
- Argh.

405
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,646
No.

406
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,291
I was there, but I didn't do it. I swear.

407
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,527
Who did?

408
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,441
One of Roper's men.

409
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,286
Roper said he couldn't
trust her to stay quiet.

410
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,361
Was Roper there?

411
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,406
Was Roper there?

412
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,722
He wanted her to tell
us who had helped her.

413
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,325
But she wouldn't say.

414
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,925
She didn't say a word.

415
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,207
Should not have kept
her mouth closed. Whore!

416
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,926
Excuse me.

417
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,165
Andrew Birch.
I believe you have an envelope for me.

418
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,130
- Yes, sir. From the lady in Room 2104.
- Thank you.

419
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,480
Could you arrange
a car for me tonight, please?

420
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,441
Akhmed.

421
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,080
<i>- Assalam-alaikum.
- Walaikum-assalam.</i>

422
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,561
Let's go.

423
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,966
Go on ahead.

424
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,207
Go on.

425
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,011
But when I went down to the foyer,
there was no parcel.

426
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,885
Check the hotel lists.

427
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,645
Every guest. Get the names to me.

428
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,167
OK.

429
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,441
Andrew Birch.

430
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,846
TradePass Limited.

431
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,646
I'd like to check the shipment
that's leaving tomorrow, please.

432
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,241
<i>Shukraan.</i>

433
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,611
OK, now, guys. Go, quick.

434
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,646
Go, go, go!

435
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,481
OK. So you know what to do?

436
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,966
This is the number.

437
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,726
You must memorise it.

438
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,446
And you press connect
and it will start the party.

439
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
- Thank you, Akhmed.
- Any time. My pleasure.

440
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,849
This is because of Miss Alekan, right?

441
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,401
Yes.

442
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,681
And no.

443
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,930
I'll see you, brother.

444
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,961
You take care, brother.

445
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,406
Breakfast, madam.
Compliments of Mr Birch.

446
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,887
Thank you.

447
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,886
You're welcome.

448
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,206
Oh, dear.

449
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,007
It's hard keeping track of all those codes
and PIN numbers, isn't it?

450
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,811
Have you tried your birthday?

451
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,801
I just found this...

452
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,041
Oh, Jemima.

453
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,166
You let someone break in here
and steal from me.

454
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,206
The question is, who?

455
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,444
Please don't tell me it was Corky.

456
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,085
Because I might not believe you.

457
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,967
Morning, Frisky.

458
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,600
Would you mind stepping
in here for a moment?

459
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,889
Yes, this is Andrew Birch.

460
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,326
Of course, sir.

461
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,686
Come on, darling.

462
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,200
Be a good girl.

463
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,404
No point in thinking he's going to stop.

464
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,204
Frisky never stops.

465
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,727
You know,

466
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,360
I never really thought you had it in you.

467
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,966
You know what I think?

468
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,168
I think you must care very deeply
about the person you're protecting.

469
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,441
I saw you look at him. In the casino.

470
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,281
How close you are.

471
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,120
<i>Dromgoole speaking.</i>

472
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,560
Did you get what I sent you?

473
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,126
<i>You know what I think, Geoffrey?</i>

474
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,649
<i>When we open those crates tomorrow</i>

475
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,328
<i>I don't think we're going to find
farm machinery inside. Do you?</i>

476
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,809
It doesn't look good for you, Geoffrey.

477
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,881
What do you want?

478
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,322
Stay away from the Egyptian affairs.

479
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,766
If Roper tries to get in contact,
cut him off.

480
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,167
<i>No safety net.</i>

481
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,211
<i>You don't even take his call.</i>

482
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,841
What do I get?

483
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,768
You get to survive, Geoffrey.

484
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,807
Morning, Andrew.

485
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,720
My, you look spiffy.

486
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,241
Ready to go?

487
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,966
When you are, sir.

488
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,486
How was the casino?

489
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,370
Very successful night.

490
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,760
I am a winner.

491
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,571
I can't get hold of Freddie.
He should be here by now.

492
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,450
You put him to bed, didn't you?

493
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,250
Left him sleeping like a baby, sir.

494
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,880
Never mind. His loss.

495
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,848
Hello, Mr Roper.
The trucks are loaded.

496
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,331
Everything is waiting for you.

497
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,561
Thank you.

498
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,561
Dickie.

499
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,327
I've just been through the hotel list
of the medical delegation.

500
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,890
All names check except two.

501
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,044
They're in room 2104.

502
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,088
All right. Call Frisky,
get him to clean it up.

503
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,841
Andrew!

504
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,962
Let me show you the hospitality area.

505
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,767
It's me.

506
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,843
He's asked for room service in 2104.

507
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,169
Yeah. OK.

508
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,001
Understood.

509
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,161
Ah, well.

510
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,649
It seems that you and I
are going for a little walk.

511
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,767
When I tell you, you are going to get up,

512
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,966
we'll wash your face

513
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,800
and maybe get you dressed.

514
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,525
But you are gonna be very quiet.

515
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,086
Get up!

516
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,920
I'll take your phone if you don't mind.

517
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,401
Sure.

518
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,041
Ah!

519
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,081
Search him for weapons,
make sure he's not wearing a wire.

520
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,929
It's a very rare thing, Jonathan Pine,

521
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,806
for me to trust a person.

522
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,201
But you were special.

523
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,929
I knew it the first moment I saw you.

524
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,649
Saved my son. Risked your life.

525
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,440
Should have known something was wrong.

526
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

527
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,686
Corky knew it, of course.

528
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,130
Tried to make me see.

529
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,726
Poor old Corks.

530
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,526
You killed him, I suppose.

531
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,401
To save your own skin.

532
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,521
Yes?

533
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,011
He was a good man, Corks.

534
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,400
Loyal man.

535
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,090
Now he is lying in a ditch
on a Turkish mountain because of you.

536
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,928
Well, for his sake and for mine,

537
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,009
I can promise you that your death
is going to be a hundred times worse.

538
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,406
Who are you working with?

539
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,041
No one.

540
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,404
Well, that's not true. For starters,

541
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,086
I know you're working with Jed.

542
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,840
That's a mistake, by the way.

543
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,244
Not the sort of thing a man does.

544
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,360
You sick fuck.

545
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,361
Ah, ah, ah...

546
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,769
We need that pretty face for the buyers.

547
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,527
We can make sure
that nothing else happens to her,

548
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,051
if you cooperate.

549
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,047
Did you kill Freddie?

550
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,004
You would have killed me, obviously.

551
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,369
I got you so wrong.

552
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,121
Now, listen.

553
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,448
Jed is in a very bad way.

554
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,130
And I'm not feeling particularly
sentimental about her welfare.

555
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,521
Her life depends on the quality of your
performance in the next half-hour.

556
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,650
So smile.

557
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,601
Joel? Where are you?

558
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,525
I'm outside the loading area.

559
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,487
Oh, my God, Ange!

560
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,927
<i>Get out of there. Pine's blown.
So you're blown. Get out!</i>

561
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,001
Can you see him? Is he all right?

562
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,525
Ange, listen to me! Pine is blown!

563
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,726
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

564
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,761
Room service.

565
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,601
Room service.

566
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,401
Get out! Go on! Go!

567
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,561
Argh! You bitch...

568
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,080
Go. Get out. Get out.

569
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,927
You bloody bitch!

570
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,726
Mr Kouyami. Sorry to keep you.

571
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,369
- Are you well?
- How are you?

572
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,686
Good, thank you.

573
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,404
Today marks the beginning
of a new trade route, Mr Roper.

574
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,240
And the beginning of a
beautiful friendship,

575
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,441
to coin a phrase.

576
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,489
- Mr Birch.
- Mr Barghati.

577
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,404
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

578
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,210
As you can see, the trucks are loaded
with the spec as agreed.

579
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,684
The drivers are ready to take them
to the destination of your choosing.

580
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,007
Er, Jasper.

581
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,286
Yes, sir?

582
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,490
- Get them rolling, will you?
- Yes, sir. Let's go!

583
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,522
Where is Mr Hamid?

584
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,322
I'm afraid Freddie was a little bit
of a bad boy last night.

585
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,360
I think he might be
paying the price this morning.

586
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,887
We can make a start without him
if you are content.

587
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,486
I suggest we process
the second half of the payment.

588
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,281
I am entirely content.

589
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,046
Good.

590
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,691
Mr Barghati, after you.

591
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,321
Beautiful day for it.

592
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,081
The best.

593
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,121
Please check.

594
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,326
Thank you.

595
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,051
Yes, good morning.
It's Sandy Langbourne here.

596
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,690
TradePass. For authorisation.

597
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,162
Mr Birch will now complete the transaction.

598
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,641
Won't you, Mr Birch?

599
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,570
Don't mess it up, Andrew.

600
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,530
Lot of people depending
on that beautiful little iris of yours.

601
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,287
Come on, Andrew.

602
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,721
We haven't got all day.

603
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,960
What's going on, Jasper?
Why have they stopped?

604
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,001
I don't know, sir.

605
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,527
What?

606
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,721
Jesus.

607
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,084
I want my money back, Mr Roper.

608
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,680
Mr Roper.

609
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,366
You. Transfer my money right now.

610
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,887
Dickie.

611
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,881
Where's the first payment?

612
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,280
There should be $300
million already in here.

613
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,084
Oh, you beauty.

614
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,640
Did you hear me, Mr Roper?

615
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,370
I want my money. Now!

616
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,124
We better leave. We mustn't be seen...

617
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,521
I want the full amount returned to me.

618
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,006
Do you understand?

619
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,405
If you do not pay,

620
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,085
there will be consequences.

621
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,441
Don't you dare threaten me!

622
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,245
Who do you think did this?

623
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,283
Arab militia!
Little brown rats like the rest of you!

624
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,328
You'll get your money
when I'm good and ready!

625
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,881
Understand?

626
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,926
We better leave.

627
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,001
<i>Yalla.</i>

628
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,048
- Gentlemen.
- Let's go.

629
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,050
- Let us reconvene in the Nefertiti in one hour.
- Let's go.

630
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,529
Our organisation is used to dealing with
problems like this, we can deal with it.

631
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,647
Dickie, we need to go.

632
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,001
Pine!

633
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,448
Jed. You let Jed go, you get the money.

634
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,367
You'd buy that girl for $300 million?

635
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,809
Call the airfield. Tell them to
have the jet ready in one hour.

636
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,925
Boss, maybe the back entrance?

637
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,287
Yes.

638
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,480
They come to the room.

639
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,921
You transfer the money.

640
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,845
I let Jed go.

641
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,281
Clear?

642
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,326
We've not been introduced.

643
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,686
My name's Angela Burr.

644
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,526
Dickie Roper.

645
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,883
Where's Jed, if you don't mind me asking?

646
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,246
She's downstairs, Jonathan.

647
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,722
All yours. Dickie.

648
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,320
This is pathetic.

649
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,486
Who the hell are you?

650
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,567
- I'm Angela...
- I know your name.

651
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,121
I mean, who are you really,
in the grand scheme of things?

652
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,482
Oh, in the grand scheme of things?

653
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,880
Don't know. I live in Bermondsey.

654
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,249
<i>- This is London...</i>
- This is Dickie Roper.

655
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,321
Get me Halo.

656
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,442
There is no Halo at this number, sir.

657
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,086
Don't be a tit.

658
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,607
Geoffrey Dromgoole
gave me this number personally.

659
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,808
I'm afraid I'm unable to help you.

660
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,685
Aw. No joy?

661
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,289
Must be a peculiar feeling, is it?

662
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,451
All those VIP rooms, five-star hotels.

663
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,568
You're now on the wrong side
of the velvet rope.

664
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,930
Do you feel quite discombobulated?

665
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,640
I suppose you've been
preparing this for a while.

666
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,920
Practising in front of the mirror, have we?

667
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,321
Yeah.

668
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,927
Since the sports day in Kurdistan.

669
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,684
I always thought those kids
could do with more protection.

670
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,125
So that's what's happening now.

671
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,770
Me and Jonathan. We're protecting them.

672
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,170
Not the ones you've already killed,

673
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,084
obviously, but the next ones.

674
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,447
Protecting from what? From me?

675
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,686
I never killed anyone.

676
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,564
I never stole, never fiddled my taxes.
All I did was work for a company.

677
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,002
Owned and operated by
your little Pinocchio.

678
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,610
I might get a 50 quid fine.

679
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,806
With a bit of luck,
they'll let me pay in instalments.

680
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,491
Yeah. You're probably right.

681
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,969
Government lawyers, useless, aren't they?

682
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,686
I was one once.

683
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,526
Right. So...

684
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,725
Mr Roper.

685
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,127
The same.

686
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,885
Not a painting. How can I help you?

687
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,247
These gentlemen are here
to place you under arrest.

688
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,491
Really. For what?

689
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,369
Uh, contravention of Egyptian import rules,
conspiracy to murder.

690
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,090
And do these clowns have names?

691
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,244
Because I'm sure Mr Hamid, Sr
would love to know what they are.

692
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,602
Mr Hamid is a very good chum of mine.

693
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,481
Chum?

694
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,961
By this time tomorrow,

695
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,088
I'm going to be back
in my humble croft in Majorca,

696
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,810
sipping a 30-year-old Scotch.

697
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,771
It's a possibility.

698
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,487
I hope not.

699
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,607
By the way.

700
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,566
Good luck with the baby.

701
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,491
It's a wonderful thing,
to bring a child into this world.

702
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,006
Why did you do it, Jonathan?

703
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,366
You have to commit.

704
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,165
You have to make a decision.

705
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,768
Couldn't just scratch my nose, could you?

706
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,761
See you in a few days.

707
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,366
What the hell's going on here?

708
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,601
I've got no idea.

709
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,449
Hey, wait a minute!

710
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,280
Wait a minute!

711
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,681
Wait a second.

712
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,161
He deserves it.

713
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,685
No! No! No!

714
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,367
No!

715
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,081
No!

716
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,166
What time do you land?

717
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,246
6:00 a.m.

718
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,290
Bright and early.

719
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,960
There be someone there to meet you?

720
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,480
I think they'll all be there.

721
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,525
I keep thinking,

722
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,170
what if he doesn't recognise me?

723
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,730
A son always recognises his mother.

724
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,801
And if he doesn't, I'll tell him.

725
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,480
Okay?

726
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,160
You can come visit soon, though.

727
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,645
I promise.

728
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,051
Be good.

729
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,249
You're a funny fish, Jonathan.

730
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,887
- I know.
- Good.

731
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,369
Is there anything I can do for you, sir?

732
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,886
No, thank you.

733
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,526
Nothing at all.
