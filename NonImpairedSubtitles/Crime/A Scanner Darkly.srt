1
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,838
I looked them up.

2
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,312
They're aphids.

3
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,836
They're in my hair, on my skin,
in my lungs.

4
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,197
And the pain, Barris, it's unreasonable.

5
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,952
They're all over the place.

6
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,757
-They've completely gotten Millie too.
-<i>Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.</i>

7
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,230
Listen, you gotta get out of there.
I'll meet you over at Joe's Cafe at 3.

8
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,072
Calm down, everything's gonna be fine.

9
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,834
Put a couple of them in a jar
so I can get them examined.

10
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,951
I'm sure they're aphids,
but you never know.

11
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,556
Just in case, okay? Just do it.
Relax, relax.

12
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,598
Gentlemen of the Anaheim 709th chapter
of the Brown Bear Lodge...

13
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,069
...we have a wonderful opportunity
this afternoon.

14
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,595
The county of Orange has provided us
with a chance...

15
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,433
...to hear from and put questions to...

16
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,149
...an undercover narcotics agent
who is out there on our behalf...

17
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,595
...fighting this awful
Substance D epidemic.

18
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,479
It's no secret we're living
in a culture of addiction.

19
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,349
Nearly 20 percent of the population
can now be classified as addicts.

20
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,080
And as far as anyone can tell,
there is but one company...

21
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,038
...that is working and helping
this situation.

22
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,272
That company is our sponsor, New Path.

23
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,516
You will notice
you can barely see this man...

24
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,717
...because he is wearing
what is called a “scramble suit. “

25
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,553
The exact same suit he wears
and, in fact, must wear...

26
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,870
...during certain parts,
in fact, most parts...

27
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,235
...of his daily activities
of law enforcement.

28
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,672
This man, whom we will call Fred
because that is the code name...

29
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,115
...under which he reports
information he gathers...

30
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,834
...once within the scramble suit,
cannot be detected...

31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,072
...by even the latest in
voice- and facial-recognition technology.

32
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,595
The scramble suit itself
is purportedly made up...

33
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,548
...of approximately a million and a half
fraction-representations...

34
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,599
...of men, women, and children
in every variant...

35
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,753
...making the wearer of a scramble suit
the ultimate Everyman.

36
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,717
This is terrible.

37
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,112
He looks, does he not,
like a constantly shifting, vague blur...

38
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,157
...and nothing more, am I right?

39
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,390
Let's hear it for the vague blur.

40
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,439
If you saw me on the street
without this suit on, you'd say:

41
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,194
“There goes a total dope fiend. “

42
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,874
You'd feel aversion and walk away.

43
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,920
I don't look like you. I can't afford to.

44
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,630
My life depends on it.

45
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,872
I'm not going to tell you first
what I do as an undercover officer...

46
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,237
...tracking down dealers and the source
of their illegal drugs...

47
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,312
...in the streets of our cities
and corridors of our schools...

48
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,471
...here in Orange County.

49
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,354
I'm going to tell you what I'm afraid of.

50
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,355
What I fear, night and day,
is that our children...

51
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,398
...your children and my children--

52
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,599
I have two little ones, very little...

53
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,194
...but not too little to be addicted.

54
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,275
Calculatedly addicted to Substance D
for profit by drug terrorists.

55
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,628
As many of you know,
our military and their associates...

56
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,711
...are actively engaged in countries...

57
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,838
...where it is believed
the organic component of Substance D...

58
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,749
...a small, highly toxic flower, originates.

59
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,514
And while our troops are down there
fighting for us...

60
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,956
...it is up to each and every
one of us here...

61
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,557
...to do our part in eliminating
the demand for this drug.

62
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,280
It's important you as citizens
continue to report...

63
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,149
...all suspicious activity and individuals...

64
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,359
...for, simply put, if there were
no demand in our society...

65
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,751
...there would be no market
for these leeches to exploit.

66
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,593
Each day, this disease
takes its toll on us.

67
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,594
And each day, the flow of profits
and where they go... .

68
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,868
Well, it isn't about the profits anyhow,
it's something else.

69
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,358
What'd you see happen?

70
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,678
lf you were a diabetic
and you didn't have money for insulin...

71
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,229
...would you steal to get the money
or just die?

72
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,551
<i>I think you better go back to the,</i>
<i>you know, prepared text there, Fred.</i>

73
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,195
I forgot it.
I think I have a block against this shit.

74
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,635
<i>Repeat after me,</i>
<i>but make it sound casual.</i>

75
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,358
<i>“Where the profits flow,</i>
<i>we will s--</i>

76
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,717
<i>--and then</i>
<i>retribution will swiftly follow.</i>

77
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,236
<i>At that moment, I would not</i>
<i>want to be in their shoes. “ Got it?</i>

78
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,517
You know why I've got a block
against this bullshit?

79
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,399
Because this is what gets people
on drugs.

80
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,030
It's all so disgusting you want to
lurch off and become a user.

81
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,919
<i>Come on, Fred, just say this shit</i>
<i>and get it over with.</i>

82
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,192
Anyway... .

83
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,036
Substance D.

84
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,633
D.

85
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,598
D is for dumbness and despair
and desertion.

86
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,639
The desertion of your friends from you,
you from your friends.

87
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,677
Everyone from everyone.

88
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,552
Isolation and loneliness...

89
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,279
...and hating and suspecting each other.

90
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,671
D is, finally, death.

91
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,352
Slow death.

92
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,470
From the head down.

93
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,755
Well, that's it.

94
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,275
Okay, let's eat.

95
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,839
All right, what's your name?

96
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,512
My name... .

97
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,515
You don't know your name?
Well, that's interesting.

98
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,670
Probable cause. Out of the car, sir.

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,389
Now, you have the right
to remain silent until... .

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,870
And... . And anything you say can and
will be used against you when you... .

101
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,998
When what?

102
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,116
You know, fuck this shit.

103
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,476
-Hello?
-Hey, how you doing?

104
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,790
Oh, I'm all right.

105
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,752
<i>Anything wrong?</i>

106
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,753
Just this fucker stole 50 bucks' worth
of shit from us today.

107
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,115
<i>My boss said it was somehow my fault,</i>
<i>and it's coming out of my paycheck...</i>

108
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,638
<i>... which I don 't even think is legal.</i>
<i>I mean, can he legally do that?</i>

109
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,949
<i>Yeah, they can 't do that.</i>

110
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,999
<i>At least, they used to not</i>
<i>be able to do that. I'll check.</i>

111
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,154
<i>Hey, Donna,</i>
<i>can I get anything from you?</i>

112
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,912
<i>Yeah, how much?</i>

113
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,957
-<i>Ten.</i>
-<i>Ten?</i>

114
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,157
<i>Yeah, I'm hurting really bad.</i>
<i>I'll pay you back later.</i>

115
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,394
<i>-Yeah, okay. Say, day after tomorrow?</i>
<i>-Any sooner?</i>

116
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,313
<i>I'll come by later, like around 8?</i>

117
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,913
<i>Yeah. I'll see you later.</i>

118
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,554
<i>-Okay. All right, bye.</i>
<i>-Okay, bye.</i>

119
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,675
You see, all symptoms are purposeful,
be they positive or negative.

120
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,870
You see?
I wouldn't feel strangely about it.

121
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,838
Just the idea of turning yourself
over for rehabilitation...

122
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,560
...is only naturally gonna make you
a little apprehensive.

123
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,280
But that's just a manifestation
of the fear.

124
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,000
It's just the:
That's the D talking.

125
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,755
You know, the first thing I hear,
that when you go into the New Path...

126
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,309
...what they do to you,
they cut your pecker off.

127
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,358
They could never get away with that.
You kidding? That's a myth.

128
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,239
It's actually the spleen
that's remanded to their custody.

129
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,470
-The what?
-Hey, how is everything?

130
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,914
Everything is super good.

131
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,277
Not with me.
I got a lot of problems nobody else has.

132
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,556
No, no, come on.
More people than you'd think.

133
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,871
And more people each day. This is
a world getting progressively worse.

134
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,189
Can we not agree on that?

135
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,597
-What's on the dessert menu?
-Would you like to order some dessert?

136
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,159
Like what?

137
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,554
Well, we have fresh strawberry pie...

138
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,076
...and fresh peach pie
that we make here ourselves.

139
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,789
-No, we don't want any dessert.
-All right.

140
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,758
Fucking fruit pies are for old ladies.

141
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,039
-What do you think about New Path?
-While it doesn't matter...

142
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,919
...what I think, I kind of
have to tip my hat to any entity...

143
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,275
...that can bring
so much integrity to evil.

144
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,750
I mean, imagine this:
A seemingly voluntary, privatized gulag...

145
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,879
...managed to eliminate the middlemen
of public accountability and free will.

146
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,076
Wrapped it up in a bow
and gave it like a gift.

147
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,992
I mean, come on, this is:

148
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,158
This is awe-inspiring stuff.

149
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,836
I heard you have to go cold turkey.

150
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,436
Cold turkey doesn't even apply
to Substance D.

151
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,749
Unlike the legacy
of inherited predisposition...

152
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,876
...to addictive behavior
or substances...

153
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,474
...this needs no genetic assistance.

154
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,832
There's no weekend warriors on the D.
You're either on it...

155
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,399
...or you haven't tried it.

156
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,953
-Well, I like it.
-Yeah.

157
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,278
How many caps do you take per day?

158
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,238
Very difficult to determine.

159
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,792
But not that many.

160
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,635
Well, like the old-school pharmacopoeia,
a tolerance develops, you know.

161
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,156
These visions of bugs,
they're just garden-variety psychosis...

162
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,436
...but a clear indication
that you've hurdled...

163
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,956
...over the initial fun and euphoric phase
and passed on...

164
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,750
...to the next phase.

165
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,476
News from the guinea-pig grapevine
suggests that whatever it is...

166
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,950
...we won't know
until it's way too late, you see?

167
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,873
You see that we're all canaries
in the coalmine on this one?

168
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,634
I do think I have another source.

169
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,677
That Donna chick.

170
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,592
-Bob's girl?
-Yeah.

171
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,389
Yeah, his girl. Although I know
for a fact he never gets in her pants.

172
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,278
Really?

173
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,200
-But he talks like he does.
-Oh, yeah.

174
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,920
That's Bob Arctor.
He talks like he does many things.

175
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,753
That's not the same, my friend.
That's not the same thing.

176
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,718
Donna has an aversion to bodily contact.

177
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,713
I mean, junkies lose their interest in sex,
you realize...

178
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,077
...due to organs swelling up
from vasoconstriction.

179
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,916
And I have observed in her
an inordinate failure of sexual arousal...

180
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,275
...not just toward Bob Arctor...

181
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,798
...but other males as well.

182
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,679
I can't believe she doesn't put out.

183
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,958
Well, she would
if she were handled right.

184
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,598
For instance, I could show you
how to sleep with her...

185
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,637
...for less than 3 dollars.

186
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,832
I don't wanna sleep with her.
I wanna buy from her.

187
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,113
Donna does coke, all right?

188
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,271
Three dollars doesn't get you
a line of coke.

189
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,793
That's where you're wrong, pal.

190
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,239
What they've deliberately done...

191
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,073
...is mix the cocaine with the oil
so it cannot be extracted.

192
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,710
But my knowledge of chemistry
is such...

193
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,079
...that I know precisely how to
separate the oil from the cocaine.

194
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,913
Now, now I will freeze it.

195
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,438
Cause cocaine crystals to rise to the top
because they are lighter than the oil.

196
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,876
The terminal step, of course,
I keep to myself, but suffice to say...

197
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,591
...it involves an intricate and
methodological process of filtering.

198
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,110
How long is it gonna be in there?

199
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,111
Just about a half an hour.

200
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,555
You know, I've been thinking, Barris.

201
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,599
Even if we do get a pure gram of cocaine
out of this deal...

202
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,433
...I don't wanna use it on Donna
to get in her pants.

203
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,034
-That'd be like buying her.
-No, it'd be an exchange.

204
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,509
You give her a gift,
and she gives you one.

205
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,949
Besides, we're talking about
Bob's girl here.

206
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,358
And this is his house. He's my friend.

207
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,954
He lets you and Luckman live here.

208
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,034
There's a great deal about Bob Arctor
you're not aware of.

209
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,515
How did New Path rig it?

210
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,717
They're the one place in our entire
country that can't be scanned.

211
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,110
All the rest of us can be tracked
24 hours a day...

212
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,191
...but no, not at New Path.

213
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,794
Hey, that's their contract
with the government.

214
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,558
But I think you're right, it would be
a good place for a dealer to hide.

215
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,513
What about Donna Hawthorne?

216
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,194
I'm systematically working up
to her supplier.

217
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,750
The quantities I'm buying now
are basically beyond her capacity.

218
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,150
She doesn't have
enough front money to handle it.

219
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,790
Matter of time before she's hooking me
up with the next person up the ladder.

220
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,349
I think soon we'll have somebody
who knows something...

221
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,999
...and they'll be worth busting.

222
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,874
What about Jim Barris
and Ernie Luckman?

223
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,238
Same shit. Nothing new.

224
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,109
Well, what about Charles Freck
and Robert Arctor?

225
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,398
-Up to pretty much the same old thing.
-Even Arctor?

226
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,958
Arctor?

227
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,073
Yeah, he doesn't seem
to be doing much.

228
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,630
Still working his nowhere,
Handy Brake and Tire job.

229
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,951
Drops a few caps of Death
cut with meth during the day.

230
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,473
I'm not so sure.

231
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,551
We just got a tip in from an informant...

232
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,915
...that Arctor has funds
above and beyond...

233
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,674
...what he gets from his little job.

234
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,432
And when we checked into it...

235
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,797
...we found he wasn't even
working there full-time.

236
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,874
Yeah.

237
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,398
Who's this informant?

238
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,709
We don't know.

239
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,236
Undoubtedly it's a vengeance burn.
That's how these druggies are.

240
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,756
I mean, phoning in on each other
every time they get pissed off.

241
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,592
Anyhow, as of now...

242
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,593
...I'm officially assigning you
to observe Arctor.

243
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,315
lf we're ever gonna get to the bottom
of this, it'll be through this guy.

244
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,837
So will that mean
full-time viewer recording?

245
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,797
We got no choice.

246
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,155
We'll install a new
holographic scanning system.

247
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,515
You'll let us know
when they're out of the house.

248
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,433
We'll want storage and printout
on everything.

249
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,437
Total, total, total, totally,
total, total, total providence.

250
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,717
I am walking home,
I find myself on a street I am rarely on...

251
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,917
...and look what I obtain for a mere $50.

252
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,913
-What is it?
-Oh, this would be an 18-speed bike...

253
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,559
...of the all-terrain variety.

254
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,269
I noticed it in a neighbor's yard,
and I inquired as to its availability.

255
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,670
They had four of them.
So I made a cash offer.

256
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,196
-Don't. Drugs.
-Fifty dollars. They acquiesced.

257
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,351
They threw in these
lemon-yellow racing pants.

258
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,830
Even hoisted it over the fence for me,
which I found to be very neighborly.

259
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,391
That's weird. I didn't know you could
get a 18-speed bike nearly new for $50.

260
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,676
It's amazing what you can get for $50.

261
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,195
I'll give you 60 right now,
no questions asked.

262
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,635
You know,
this bike looks a lot like the bike...

263
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,588
...that this girl lives across the street
had that got ripped off a month ago.

264
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,079
This bike could be hot.

265
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,800
They probably jacked it,
these hoister friends of yours.

266
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,394
Sure did, if they've got four
and selling it that cheap.

267
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,314
Right? You should at least show it to her
so she could see if it's hers.

268
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,754
Yeah. Okay, I can do that...

269
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,753
...but this is a boy's bike, okay?
So it can't be.

270
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,196
Not to invalidate your intuition,
but it's not possible. Thank you.

271
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,716
Why do you say it's an 18-speed
when it only has nine gears?

272
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,599
Huh, what?

273
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,309
Yeah. Yeah. Six right here,
three at the other end of the chain.

274
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,040
Six plus three equals nine.

275
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,878
-It's a nine-speed bike.
-Yeah, but even a nine-speed bike...

276
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,429
...for 50 bucks. He still got a good deal.

277
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,517
Okay, those guys told me
it was 18 speeds.

278
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,591
I just got Greeked. I just got... .

279
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,478
Wait. Wait.

280
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,671
Now I count eight.

281
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,035
Six here and then two in the front.

282
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,430
-That makes eight.
-What do you think happened...

283
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,477
-...to the missing gears?
-Think? I know.

284
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,756
They were working
on it, these gypsy grifters...

285
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,956
...with improper tools,
no technical knowledge.

286
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,917
No understanding of reverse engineering.

287
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,640
When they attempted to reassemble it,
they panicked.

288
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,916
They left nine orphan gears there
on the floor.

289
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,798
They're still there
on the garage floor.

290
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,190
Let's just go rescue
the orphan gears, dude!

291
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,033
Don't you see
that that's part of the plan?

292
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,794
They're going to try to sell them to me,
not give them...

293
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,999
...as they rightfully should have as
included in part of the original sale price.

294
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,357
Oh, my God, there's no telling
what else they've bait-and-switched.

295
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,637
Yeah, but if all of us go together,
oh, they'll give them back.

296
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,030
Oh, you bet they will.
Oh, you bet they will.

297
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,919
-Let's just go as a team, okay.
-Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

298
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,073
Are you sure there are only nine gears
on this bike?

299
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,995
-Eight.
-Okay, eight, nine, whatever.

300
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,597
Don't you think that before we go over
and accuse, and start some shit...

301
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,113
...we should find out for sure?

302
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,635
Right, Donna.
Who do we know who's an authority...

303
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,438
...on this type of bi--?

304
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,433
Get off me!

305
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,192
Let me--

306
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,193
We are all way too close to this.

307
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,558
There's only one thing we can do...

308
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,518
...to thwart these albino,
shape-shifting lizard bitches.

309
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,353
We are gonna take this outside,
ask the first person we see.

310
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,557
Introduce some novelty.
That way we get an objective viewpoint.

311
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,869
Yeah.

312
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,395
By the way, I might take you up
on that $60 offer.

313
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,993
No, that was for an 18-speed.

314
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,549
You know, for this, 18 minus 10,
I'll give you 23.75.

315
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,638
Are you certain
that's the right math on that?

316
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,273
Come in.

317
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,909
You are Officer Fred?

318
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,388
-Yes.
-Have a seat, please.

319
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,751
All right, Fred.

320
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,797
We're going to administer
several tests...

321
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,674
...and there will be no
physical discomfort involved.

322
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,636
lf this is about the speech I gave to the--

323
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,997
What this is about stems from
a recent departmental survey...

324
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,628
...showing that undercover agents
have been admitted...

325
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,872
...to neural-aphasia clinics
during the last month.

326
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,157
You're conscious of the high factor
of addictiveness of Substance D?

327
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,389
Of course I am.

328
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,234
Of course,
these tests in no way pertain...

329
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,631
...to the addictive properties
of Substance D, but to... .

330
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,110
Well, let's start
with the set-ground test first.

331
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,548
Within the apparently meaningless lines
is an object that we would all recognize.

332
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,872
You are to tell me what that object is
and point to it in the total field.

333
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,758
In many of those taking Substance D...

334
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,276
...a split between the right and the left
hemisphere of the brain occurs...

335
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,194
...which results in a defect within both
the percept and cognitive systems.

336
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,352
Although apparently the cognitive
continues to function normally.

337
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,795
You located the familiar object
in this drawing?

338
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,714
It should just jump right out at you.

339
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,840
I see a Coke bottle.

340
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,833
A soda-pop bottle is correct.

341
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,508
Was it in the speech I gave?

342
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,990
Maybe it seemed I showed
a little bilateral dysfunction there.

343
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,631
I mean, might have seemed
a little slushed.

344
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,234
Are you getting any cross-chatter?

345
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,032
-What?
-Cross-chatter between hemispheres.

346
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,077
lf there's damage to
the left hemisphere...

347
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,196
...where the linguistic skills
are located...

348
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,114
...then sometimes the right hemisphere
will fill in to the best of its ability.

349
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,069
I don't know.
I mean, not that I'm aware of.

350
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,028
What do you see in this second picture?

351
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,394
A sheep.

352
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,792
Show me the sheep.

353
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,790
An impairment of set-background
discrimination...

354
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,269
...can get you into a heap of trouble.

355
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,036
Instead of perceiving no forms,
you perceive faulty forms.

356
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,590
So there is no sheep here, is there?

357
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,469
Was I close?

358
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,200
This is not a Rorschach test,
where some abstract blot...

359
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,715
...can be interpreted many ways
by many subjects.

360
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,791
This has one specific object.

361
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,669
In this case, a dog.

362
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,072
A dog.

363
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,075
What's that mean,
that I saw a sheep instead?

364
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,708
Who knows.
Only after the entire set has been run...

365
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,678
-...can we determine--
-Why this is superior to the Rorschach...

366
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,114
...is it's not interpretive.

367
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,192
There are many wrongs,
but there is only one right.

368
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,793
You either get it or you don't.

369
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,030
And if you show a run of not getting it...

370
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,555
...then we have a fix on
a functional impairment...

371
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,917
...and we dry you out for a while,
until you test better later on.

372
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,114
At New Path?

373
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,032
-Undoubtedly.
-Undoubtedly.

374
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,078
Now, what do you see in this drawing...

375
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,630
...among these particular
black-and-white lines?

376
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,312
Plastic dog shit.

377
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,755
The little kind you can buy
and put in someone's bed.

378
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,192
Can I go now?

379
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,237
You know, Fred, if you keep
your sense of humor like you do...

380
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,675
...you just might make it after all.

381
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,434
Make it. Make what?

382
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,272
The team? The girl?

383
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,919
Make good? Make do?

384
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,548
Make out? Make sense?
Make money? Make time?

385
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,233
Define your terms.

386
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,311
The Latin for “make” is <i>facere</i>...

387
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,516
...which always reminds me of <i>fuckere</i>...

388
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,433
...which is Latin for “to fuck. “

389
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,876
And I haven't been getting shit
in that department lately.

390
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,591
lf you guys are psychologist-types...

391
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,992
...and you've been monitoring my
endless debriefings with Hank, tell me:

392
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,391
What the hell is Donna's deal?

393
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,437
What do I do? I mean...

394
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,593
...how do you make it with that kind of
sweet, unique, stubborn little chick?

395
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,037
You could buy her flowers.

396
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,919
Really?

397
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,436
This time of year, you can get
little blue flowers at any nursery.

398
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,477
Give them to her.

399
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,358
Yeah.

400
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,357
Hey, Fred, glad you could make it.

401
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,034
This is the informant who phoned in
about Bob Arctor, and I mentioned him.

402
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,713
-Yes.
-Anyway, he phoned in again...

403
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,793
...and we challenged him to step forth
and identify himself.

404
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,871
Do you know this man?

405
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,398
Sure do.

406
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,514
You're James Barris, aren't you?

407
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,318
So, Mr. Barris, what's your information?

408
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,112
I have evidence that Mr. Arctor is part of
a covert terrorist drug organization.

409
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,909
They are well-funded and they have
arsenals of weapons at their disposal.

410
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,559
And what is this organization?

411
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,791
I believe it to be political in nature
and very much against this country.

412
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,757
An enemy of the U.S.

413
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,869
Can you give us any specific names of
anyone else in this organization...

414
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,598
...persons Arctor meets with?

415
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,398
Yes. Miss Donna Hawthorne.

416
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,235
On a variety of pretexts, he will
go over to her place of residence...

417
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,710
...and colludes with her regularly,
I've noticed.

418
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,279
Colludes.

419
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,558
-Colludes.
-What do you mean?

420
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,757
Well, I've followed him in my own car
without his knowledge.

421
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,990
-He goes there often.
-Yes, as often as--

422
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,390
-She is his girl.
-Right.

423
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,233
-Mr. Arctor also seemingly--
-Hold up, hold up.

424
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,397
You think there's anything to this, Fred?

425
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,112
I think we should definitely
look at his evidence.

426
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,157
All right. Bring in your evidence.

427
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,914
All of it. We want names most of all.

428
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,550
Now, have you seen
Mr. Arctor involved...

429
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,757
...in any large quantities of drugs?

430
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,195
To be certain.
And I have carefully taken samples--

431
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,074
Again, without his knowledge.

432
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,277
--when the opportunity presented itself,
strictly for you to analyze.

433
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,396
-I can bring those in as well.
-Great.

434
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,198
Is there anything else
you wish to state at this time?

435
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,036
There is. Mr. Arctor is an addict.
He is addicted to Substance D.

436
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,873
And I fear that his mind has become
deranged over time...

437
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,478
...and he is now officially
to be considered dangerous.

438
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,757
-Dangerous.
-Yes. He is having episodes...

439
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,753
...that would occur with
brain damage from Substance D.

440
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,595
I'm quite certain, also, that the optic
chiasm has deteriorated somewhat...

441
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,990
...due to a weak ipsilateral component.

442
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,914
This sort of unsupported speculation,
as I've already warned you, Mr. Barris...

443
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,230
...is completely worthless.

444
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,712
Now, we'll be sending an officer
with you to gather your evidence.

445
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,791
-All right?
-May I--?

446
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,996
An officer out of uniform, of course.

447
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,153
No, see, I could be murdered.

448
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,472
As I've already said,
Mr. Arctor has this cache of weapons.

449
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,236
Mr. Barris, we appreciate this
and the extreme risk you are taking.

450
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,634
And if it works out, and your information
is valuable in obtaining a conviction...

451
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,360
-...then naturally--
-But that is not the reason I'm here.

452
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,750
You see, this man is--
He just has a soul sickness.

453
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,311
His brain is damaged from the use of
this toxic and most terrible substance.

454
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,190
Nonetheless, the reason I am here is
I feel that I may have certain qualities...

455
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,670
...that would qualify me
to perhaps come over to your side.

456
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,274
To surrender and come to
the side of law enforcement.

457
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,989
-I would like an employment application.
-We don't care why you're here.

458
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,756
We only care whether your evidence and
material amount to anything.

459
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,036
The rest is your problem.

460
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,353
Perhaps at the desk
I can get an employment... .

461
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,875
You are about to witness...

462
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,471
...for approximately 61 cents of
ordinary household materials...

463
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,359
...the perfect homemade silencer.

464
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,432
Barris, the neighbors are gonna hear.

465
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,875
No, they only call in murders
in this neighborhood.

466
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,669
Plus, Freckledeck, it's a silencer.
They're not gonna hear anything.

467
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,355
Well, I'm pretty fucking sure
they're illegal.

468
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,834
In this day and age, the type of society
we find ourselves living in...

469
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,194
...every person of worth...

470
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,193
...needs to have a gun at all times,
to protect themselves.

471
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,713
And we're off.

472
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,359
That sure is some silencer.

473
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,196
Yes. What it did was augment
the sound, rather than dampen it.

474
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,113
But I almost have it.
I believe I have it in principle, anyway.

475
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,272
Oh, well, the good news is,
regardless of what you do next time...

476
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,069
...it'll be a silencer to us,
because we're now deaf!

477
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,317
<i>What happened?</i>

478
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,431
<i>How'd I get here?</i>

479
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,879
Okay, it's your move now.

480
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,238
Anyone want some popcorn?

481
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,719
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

482
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,118
Fuck!

483
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,272
<i>The pain...</i>

484
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,313
<i>...so unexpected and undeserved...</i>

485
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,517
<i>...had, for some reason,</i>
<i>cleared away the cobwebs.</i>

486
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,679
<i>I realized I didn't hate the cabinet door.</i>

487
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,470
<i>I hated my life, my house, my family...</i>

488
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,835
-Are you okay, Daddy?
-What happened?

489
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,036
<i>...my backyard...</i>

490
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,228
<i>...my power mower.</i>

491
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,356
<i>Nothing would ever change.</i>

492
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,796
<i>Nothing new could ever be expected.</i>

493
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,193
<i>It had to end, and it did.</i>

494
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,113
<i>Now in the dark world where I dwell...</i>

495
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,752
<i>...ugly things and surprising things</i>
<i>and sometimes little wondrous things...</i>

496
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,718
<i>...spill out at me constantly...</i>

497
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,115
<i>...and I can count on nothing.</i>

498
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,475
Medfly, got it.

499
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,159
-That would be a Thelma Kornford.
-Oh, yeah, Miss Big-Tits.

500
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,799
lf I had known it was harmless...

501
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,872
-...I would have killed it myself.
-I would have killed it myself.

502
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,031
Thanks for the mammaries.

503
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,832
She had such beautiful... .

504
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,469
Daddy slowpoke.

505
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,673
-Oh, get around him, will you?
-You know what to do. Your move.

506
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,751
That's a big ten-four.

507
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,399
Got nothing on us.

508
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,708
-There we go.
-Get a life!

509
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,233
Okay, Bob, no rush.

510
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,879
-Not so fast.
-You are flying.

511
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,712
Decelerate.

512
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,909
Steady.

513
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,513
-Decelerate.
-Slow down.

514
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,518
-Jesus.
-Son of a bitch.

515
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,355
Come on. Decelerate!

516
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,069
Let us over.

517
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,998
It's an emergency.

518
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,754
We're getting over. Emergency.

519
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,910
-What the hell was that?
-Jesus fucking Christ.

520
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,036
What the hell in the hootenanny
was that?

521
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,513
The return spring
on the throttle cable, or... .

522
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,908
Look, the gas.

523
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,679
Was it cut or broken?

524
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,319
Let's give her a look.

525
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,353
Oh, my... .

526
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,838
It's not the spring. It's the linkage
from the pedal to the carb. See?

527
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,676
It fell apart, so the gas pedal didn't push
back out when you took your foot off...

528
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,116
-...but doesn't explain why--
-There is a safety override on the carb.

529
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,748
-When the linkage parts, it's--
-Why'd it part?

530
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,716
Shouldn't this ring
hold the cable in place?

531
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,110
I mean, how could it
just come off like that?

532
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,157
Let's have a look. Let's probe a little.

533
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,713
All right. This screw has been turned
all the way out, the idle screw.

534
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,390
So when the linkage parted, it went
the other way. Up instead of down.

535
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,634
Wait. Now, how could that happen?

536
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,797
There is no way that that screw...

537
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,872
...could turn itself all the way out
like that accidentally.

538
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,155
No way.

539
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,912
Motherfucker! They did it deliberately!

540
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,073
We almost died!
They almost fucking got us, man!

541
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,117
To loosen the lock ring
and nut assembly...

542
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,157
...that holds the linkage rods together...

543
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,834
...a special tool would be needed.
Several, in fact.

544
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,195
It'll take half an hour
to get this back together.

545
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,555
-I have the tools, though.
-Back at the house.

546
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,198
Correct. We can always go to
a repair center and borrow theirs...

547
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,635
...or get a tow truck out here.

548
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,959
Here.

549
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,870
You know, maybe that's what's
fucking us up, fucking up our brains.

550
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,870
-We're gonna wind up like Freck soon.
-No.

551
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,470
Okay, these are for us.

552
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,355
And I'm going to suggest that you take
several, with the implicit acceptance...

553
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,353
...of the fact that Substance D
cannot screw up an accelerator...

554
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,195
-...or a carb-idle adjustment.
-Yeah, dude. Don't blame the drugs.

555
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,839
-Come on.
-Well, so much for...

556
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,514
...our great road trip to San Diego, Bob.

557
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,194
I told you we should have gone
to San Francisco.

558
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,998
What, like going to San Francisco...

559
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,594
...would not have caused
this problem with the engine?

560
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,433
Yeah, because when you're going north,
it screws this way.

561
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,511
When you're going south,
it screws that way.

562
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,999
lf we were in Australia.

563
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,757
This proves you got somebody
out to get you real bad, Bob.

564
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,434
I just hope the house is still there
when we get back.

565
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,953
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

566
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,793
-I wouldn't worry about it too much.
-You wouldn't?

567
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,270
Christ, they may have broken in
and ripped off all we got.

568
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,954
All Bob's got, anyhow.

569
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,429
What if they stomped the animals?

570
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,229
Don't worry about it.
I left a little surprise for them.

571
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,074
What?

572
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,518
Yes, anyone entering the house while we
were gone will receive a little surprise.

573
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,875
Little something I perfected
early this morning.

574
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,837
What kind of surprise?
It's my house, Jim.

575
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,436
You should ask me before
you start wiring up my house.

576
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,160
Why so uptight about
protecting your house from intruders?

577
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,594
Why would you care?

578
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,671
I'm just saying,
it's my house, that's all.

579
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,912
You can't start going around
booby-trapping my house.

580
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,277
Okay, okay. I mean, jeez.
Or as the Germans say, <i>leise</i>...

581
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,000
...which translates to “be cool. “
Just be cool.

582
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,868
So, what did you do?

583
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,112
lf the front door is opened
while we are in absentia...

584
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,238
...thumbnail-sized, auxiliary,
motion-detector...

585
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,550
...digital-memory cameras
start recording.

586
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,677
You should have told me.

587
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,117
What if they come in through
the back door or the bathroom window...

588
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,918
...like that infamous Beatles' song?

589
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,799
To increase their chances of entering
via the front door...

590
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,633
...rather than in other less usual places...

591
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,155
...I, fortuitously,
left the front door unlocked.

592
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,074
-Suppose they don't know it's unlocked.
-That's why I left a note on the door.

593
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,310
-You're kidding me.
-No, no. No.

594
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,472
Yes. But no. But yes.

595
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,517
Are you bullshitting us or not?

596
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,830
I just simply never know with you.

597
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,992
-Is he fucking with us, Bob?
-We'll see when we get back.

598
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,119
lf there's a note on the door and it's
unlocked, we'll know he isn't lying.

599
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,032
They'd probably take the note down...

600
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,475
...after ripping off
and vandalizing the house...

601
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,074
...and locking the door behind them,
so we don't know.

602
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,118
We will never know.
It's still that gray area.

603
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,748
Of course I'm kidding.
Only a psychotic would do that.

604
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,036
Leave the front door
unlocked with a note on it.

605
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,679
What'd you write
on the note, Jim?

606
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,832
I wrote, “Come on in,
the door's unlocked. “

607
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,350
He did it. He really did it.

608
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,313
This is the only way we'll know
for sure who's been doing this.

609
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,835
And is that not what is
of primary importance?

610
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,834
Okay, I'm still gray here.
Now, did you do it or not?

611
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,877
Is it really that suspenseful?

612
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,951
-Did you?
-He did it.

613
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,758
Doesn't matter.
We'll be home shortly.

614
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,916
-Did you?
-We'll be home presently.

615
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,791
Well, Barris, I can see you're right.

616
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,351
This scrupulous covering-over of all
the signs they would've otherwise left...

617
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,557
...testifies to their thoroughness.

618
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,153
You're an idiot.

619
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,109
Oh, wait, wait. This-- What's that?

620
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,434
Come here, come here.
Look at this, look at this.

621
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,076
A still-hot cigarette butt. It sure is.
Wait a second.

622
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,510
They lit a joint
while they were here, Bob.

623
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,240
Fuck it. Barris is right,
there was somebody here.

624
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,992
This roach is still hot, smell it.

625
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,675
Yes. And that roach may not have
been left here by accident.

626
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,558
This evidence may not be a slip-up.

627
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,749
-So, what now?
-Maybe they were here specifically...

628
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,638
...to plant drugs in the house.

629
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,075
Setting us up,
then “phoning in a tip” later.

630
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,276
It could be in the phone,
the wall outlets.

631
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,238
We have to go through this house
and get it absolutely clean...

632
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,755
...before they phone us in,
unless they already have.

633
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,474
We might only have minutes.

634
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,354
You check the wall sockets.
I'll tear this phone apart.

635
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,431
Wait, hold on.
lf they see us scrambling...

636
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,079
-...before the raid--
-What raid?

637
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,435
lf we're frantically trying to
flush their drugs...

638
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,398
...we can't allege, though true,
we didn't know they were here.

639
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,918
They're going to find us holding them,
or maybe that's part of the plan.

640
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,273
Shit, shit, shit.

641
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,433
We can't do anything.
We're fucked, man. Fuck.

642
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,994
-Fucked, man!
-Barris...

643
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,435
...what about the super-secret
surveillance cameras?

644
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,478
-The what?
-The doodads, man.

645
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,030
Oh, yes, of course. Right, of course.
How could I have forgotten?

646
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,108
This should be extremely informational
at this point.

647
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,831
I believe this will tell us a great deal.

648
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,270
Although it probably wouldn't have
proven to be that important.

649
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,473
Let me guess: didn't record.

650
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,590
Allow me to suggest that it's highly
likely that the tow truck was bugged...

651
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,959
...thus affording them ample time and
opportunity to deploy an operative...

652
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,430
...to diffuse and otherwise erase
the evidence obtained.

653
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,118
But we have no other recourse,
in view of their evasive tactics.

654
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,068
There is, of course, one thing you could
do, Bob, although it would take time.

655
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,109
Sell the house and move out?

656
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,313
But hell, this is our home.

657
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,674
You could make a profit.

658
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,071
On the other hand, you might have to
take a loss on a quick sale.

659
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,039
I know a good realtor.

660
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,353
What reason should I give for selling?
They always ask.

661
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,075
Can't tell the truth.
You shouldn't tell the truth--

662
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,037
Why can't we tell the truth?

663
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,668
We put an ad in the <i>L.A. Times</i>.

664
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,671
Modern, three-bedroom tract house...

665
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,308
...with two bathrooms
for easy and fast flushing...

666
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,314
...high-grade drugs stashed throughout
all rooms, included in sale price.

667
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,914
It could actually increase the value.

668
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,799
But they might call and ask
what kind of drugs are stashed...

669
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,916
...and we don't know,
it could be anything.

670
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,389
Prospective buyers might inquire
as to the quantity.

671
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,073
And we don't know at this point.

672
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,392
It could be ounces of weed or pounds of
heroin, or hits of E or killer caps of D.

673
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,596
Hey, you guys.

674
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,149
Fuck! Jesus.

675
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,350
What the fuck is wrong with you?

676
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,994
I came in, like the note said.

677
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,357
It didn't say when
you were gonna get back, so I just... .

678
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,310
I just sat around for a while
and ended up crashing.

679
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,153
-Love your sweater.
-Just-- Don't touch me.

680
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,069
Man, you guys were
making so much noise.

681
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,629
-Sorry.
-It woke me up.

682
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,034
Did you smoke a joint
before you crashed?

683
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,108
Yeah.

684
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,480
Otherwise, I can't ever sleep.

685
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,190
You know,
you guys should seriously think about...

686
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,079
...maybe locking the doors
when you leave.

687
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,989
Otherwise you could get ripped off
and it'd be your own fault.

688
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,196
This is all your fault.

689
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,194
Did I hear you say
you were gonna sell the house?

690
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,631
Or was that, you know, me dreaming?

691
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,995
Because what I heard sounded weird.

692
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,274
Yeah, we're all dreaming.

693
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,476
Quiet. Steady. Steady.

694
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,955
Kidney. Kidney. Kidney.

695
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,035
So the information from the holo
scanners installed in Arctor's house...

696
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,711
...are transmitted back here,
to station 12-879.

697
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,956
This'll be your new
home away from home, pal.

698
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,834
It's pretty intuitive.

699
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,915
You'll just be watching and
scanning through recorded information.

700
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,278
You can go live, of course, but that
tends to be excruciatingly boring.

701
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,432
And then, you see
where these holos are placed?

702
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,718
What would be great is if they ever
need servicing or changing out...

703
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,474
...you could do that yourself
while no one else is around.

704
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,393
But wouldn't you then see me
on the tapes doing that?

705
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,949
No. For that, you just edit yourself out.

706
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,271
But be sure to include yourself
in the tapes from time to time...

707
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,874
...because if you systematically
edit yourself out...

708
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,918
...we can deduce who you are through
the process of elimination...

709
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,718
...whether we want to or not.

710
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,073
I'm not sure I exactly--

711
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,913
We take it for granted that you are
one of the individuals...

712
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,231
...that are in Arctor's circle
of roommates and friends...

713
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,913
...that frequent the house.

714
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,914
I mean, undoubtedly, you're either
Jim Barris or Ernie Luckman...

715
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,993
...Charles Freck...

716
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,158
...even Arctor himself.

717
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,717
Hell, you could be Donna,
for all I know.

718
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,077
As my superior,
I figure you'd know all this stuff.

719
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,389
How the hell would I know?

720
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,915
I'm just a little guy behind a big desk.

721
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,312
You'd have to go way up the food chain
to access that kind of info.

722
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,153
You know, instead of me
doing any maintenance...

723
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,880
...send someone to the house
once a month, in uniform...

724
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,270
...and have him say, “Good morning.

725
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,510
I'm here to service
the monitoring devices...

726
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,877
...covertly installed on your premises. “

727
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,395
Maybe that sucker Arctor
would even pick up the bill.

728
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,157
Actually, I think Arctor would probably
kill the guy and then disappear.

729
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,993
lf it's proven that Arctor is,
in fact, hiding that much.

730
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,712
Believe me, Arctor is hiding a great deal.

731
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,269
We've got more recent
information on him analyzed...

732
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,558
...and there's no doubt about it,
he's a ringer.

733
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,871
A three-dollar bill. The guy is a phony.

734
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,838
So keep on him until he drops...

735
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,878
...until we have enough to arrest him
and make it stick.

736
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,558
You think he's high up in the,
you know, Substance D network?

737
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,518
What we think is of
no importance to your work.

738
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,037
You report your limited conclusions,
and we evaluate.

739
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,589
-You got it?
-Okay, okay.

740
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,352
I got it.

741
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,356
I'd say Arctor is doomed
if he's up to something.

742
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,870
And I have a hunch,
from what you're saying, that he is.

743
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,476
The idling jets could be replaced with
smaller jets that would compensate.

744
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,269
And with a tach, he could just watch
his rpms so it didn't over-rev.

745
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,715
Usually just backing off
on the gas pedal...

746
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,519
...causes it to upshift
if the automatic linkage doesn't.

747
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,636
What are you grease monkeys up to?

748
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,394
Bob's got a bent choke shaft.

749
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,873
-How much does this Impala weigh?
-Weighs about 1000 pounds.

750
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,271
Thousand pounds traveling at
80 miles per hour builds up a force of--

751
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,318
That's 1000 pounds with passengers
in it and a full tank of gas.

752
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,869
-For a fact? Okay.
-How many passengers?

753
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,429
-Twelve.
-Six in the front, six in the back.

754
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,672
No, that's 11 in the back
and the driver sitting alone in the front.

755
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,513
Extra weight on the rear wheels
is to keep from fishtailing.

756
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,511
We talking about
12 50-pound passengers?

757
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,638
-Kids' soccer team.
-Now, is that metal or plastic cleats?

758
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,837
-Metal cleats for safety.
-Okay, my computations are complete.

759
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,709
You are just heckle tweak,
but you are bug-bite squared.

760
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,599
-What kind of bug?
-About-to-get-fucked-up-bitch beetle.

761
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,911
-Hey, come on. Cool it, you guys.
-Tell me--

762
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,959
Step back. Freck-and-frack,
Ernie's on the attack.

763
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,678
-What is this?
-Come on.

764
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,434
-I'm desperately afraid.
-I'm gonna knock your nads...

765
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,398
...up into your nostrils
for talking to your betters that way.

766
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,755
All right.
I'm a technician, you're an interloper.

767
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,071
You are constitutionally incapable
of not shutting the fuck up.

768
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,674
-Bring it!
-Shut the fuck up!

769
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,910
No, no, proctology boy,
I'm coming after you.

770
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,832
Shut it. Hey. Hey.

771
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,878
I have the perfect tool for this job.

772
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,470
-I was only kidding him.
-Fuck.

773
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,319
Fuck!

774
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,918
What if he goes in there
and he gets his gun and his silencer?

775
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,753
I'm leaving.
This place has become unsafe.

776
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,195
No, hey, hey, Freck. No, come on.
You're a bro, man. Stick around.

777
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,990
What's the hammer for, Barris?

778
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,869
No, I just saw it inside and thought I,
you know, should bring it along with me.

779
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,275
-Same with this.
-You ready?

780
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,873
Yeah, what do you want?

781
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,439
-Come on, hammerhead.
-Shut up.

782
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,033
-Make a move.
-Don't like it.

783
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,670
Okay. lf you guys are gonna
kill each other, I'm splitting.

784
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,434
-It's getting very fucked up over here.
-Hey, Freck.

785
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,956
The most dangerous kind of person is
the one who's afraid of his own shadow.

786
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,675
-What is that supposed to mean?
-I'll tell you.

787
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,115
It means that if you take
too much of that stuff...

788
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,191
...you not only start seeing
bugs all over...

789
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,079
...but you start talking like...and
no one can understand you.

790
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,435
What'd you say, Barris?
I didn't understand.

791
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,353
See, you guys are fucked up.

792
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,398
No, no, it is y-uck-uck-ou
that are fuck-ucked-ed up.

793
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,630
Hey, go Freck yourself.

794
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,870
Don't take the car, you'll kill yourself.

795
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,356
So this guy's been going around claiming
to be a world-famous impostor, right?

796
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,911
Says he's posed, at one time or another,
as a surgeon at John Hopkins...

797
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,514
...as a theoretical,
submolecular, high-velocity...

798
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,911
...particle-research physicist
on a federal grant at Harvard...

799
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,074
...as a Finnish novelist
who won the Nobel Prize for literature...

800
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,356
...as a deposed Argentinean president...

801
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,159
...who was married to a go-go dancer
from Chicago--

802
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,197
He got away with all that?

803
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,234
-He never got caught?
-Okay, you broke my flow...

804
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,994
...so now I guess I'll just have
to segue down to the near.

805
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,594
That's just it.
You see, he didn't pose as any of those.

806
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,514
He just posed as
a world-famous impostor. Yeah.

807
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,318
It came out later in the <i>L.A. Times</i>.

808
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,029
They checked up, and he was pushing
a broom at Disneyland or something.

809
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,792
He saw that old DiCaprio movie.

810
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,270
You know, the one where
he plays a world-famous impostor...

811
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,317
...before Leonardo hit his Elvis stage.

812
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,629
And his first thought was:

813
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,349
“Hey, I could pose as all those
exotic guys and get away with it. “

814
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,875
But then, his next thought was,
“Hell, why bother?

815
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,318
I could just pose as an impostor,
and it'd be a lot easier. “

816
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,711
They say that he made more money
than the actual impostor...

817
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,670
<i>...although I'm not sure</i>
<i>if they'd adjust for inflation.</i>

818
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,029
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>we all see impostors now and then...</i>

819
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,873
<i>...but not posing</i>
<i>as subatomic physicists.</i>

820
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,637
<i>Oh, as a narc, you mean.</i>

821
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,392
<i>What's a narc look like?</i>

822
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,597
<i>That's like asking,</i>
<i>“What's an impostor look like?”</i>

823
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,717
<i>I talked to this dealer</i>
<i>who 'd been busted.</i>

824
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,519
<i>I asked him what the narc</i>
<i>who busted him looked like.</i>

825
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,830
<i>What did he say, he looked just like us?</i>

826
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,592
<i>More so.</i>

827
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,069
<i>So I guess the moral of that is...</i>

828
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,913
<i>...stay away from guys</i>
<i>looking the same as us.</i>

829
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,037
<i>Well, there are female narcs.</i>

830
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,156
<i>Oh, hey, I'd like to meet one of those.</i>

831
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,075
<i>No, I don 't mean a female. I mean</i>
<i>just the narc, knowingly, like, positive.</i>

832
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,949
<i>Sure. So you could positively know.</i>
<i>And you will.</i>

833
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,317
<i>When he slaps the cuffs on, you'll know</i>
<i>for sure, when that day comes.</i>

834
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,232
<i>How could a guy do that?</i>

835
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,833
<i>Pose as a narc?</i>

836
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,674
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

837
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,232
<i>Pose as a narc?</i>

838
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,278
<i>-No, you said it. So yeah.</i>
<i>-Pose as a narc.</i>

839
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,278
<i>Oh, sh-- Shit, I'm spaced.</i>

840
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,192
<i>Pose as a narc, wow.</i>

841
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,269
<i>Pose as a narc.</i>

842
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,430
<i>My brains are scrambled today.</i>

843
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,758
Christ, Barris, what the fuck?

844
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,318
<i>Yes, hi. How are you?</i>

845
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,914
<i>I have something</i>
<i>somewhat emergent to report.</i>

846
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,119
<i>I don 't know if I should be summoning</i>
<i>the inhalator squad...</i>

847
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,350
<i>...or the resuscitation squad.</i>

848
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,354
<i>Yes, ma 'am?</i>

849
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,159
<i>I don 't know. I don 't want to say</i>
<i>it's not cardiac arrest...</i>

850
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,677
<i>...but it's either that or an involuntary</i>
<i>asphyxiation of a bolus within the--</i>

851
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,919
<i>The address, yes.</i>
<i>The address is simple...</i>

852
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,514
<i>...although I've never sent myself</i>
<i>a piece of mail here.</i>

853
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,468
<i>Seven-- Seven-- Seven-zero-niner.</i>
<i>Street? Is the street relevant?</i>

854
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,995
-Come on.
<i>-Tell you this much, it is a cul-de-sac.</i>

855
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,397
<i>Does that technically qualify as a street?</i>

856
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,632
<i>I'm pleased to report we won 't</i>
<i>be needing your assistance after all.</i>

857
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,791
<i>Thank you. Have a nice day.</i>

858
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,958
<i>There you go. Took care of itself.</i>

859
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,828
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Oh, Jesus.</i>

860
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,195
<i>You all right? There you go.</i>

861
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,918
<i>I must've passed out.</i>

862
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,436
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Well, you-- I was dreaming.</i>

863
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,150
<i>-Must have almost died.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

864
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,753
<i>Shit.</i>

865
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,039
<i>And what were you doing while</i>
<i>I was being escorted by dead relatives...</i>

866
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,236
<i>... to the bright light? Jacking off?</i>

867
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,277
<i>No, no, no. You saw me.</i>
<i>I was on the phone.</i>

868
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,839
<i>I summoned the paramedics.</i>

869
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,390
<i>-I sprung into action without delay.</i>
<i>-Bullshit. You were cleaning your pipe.</i>

870
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,516
<i>I was wrapping my pipe.</i>
<i>You were unconscious.</i>

871
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,070
<i>You the only person in the universe who</i>
<i>never heard of the Heimlich maneuver?</i>

872
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,590
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I'm gonna give you a little feedback...</i>

873
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,548
<i>...since you seem to be proceeding</i>
<i>through life like a cat without whiskers...</i>

874
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,234
<i>...perpetually caught</i>
<i>behind the refrigerator.</i>

875
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,150
<i>Your life and watching you live it...</i>

876
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,959
<i>...is like a gag reel</i>
<i>of ineffective bodily functions.</i>

877
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,999
<i>I swear to God that a toddler</i>
<i>has a better understanding...</i>

878
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,515
<i>...of the intricacies of</i>
<i>chew, swallow, digest...</i>

879
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,035
<i>...don 't kill yourself on your TV dinner.</i>

880
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,272
<i>And yet, you've managed to</i>
<i>turn this near-death fuck-up of yours...</i>

881
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,078
<i>...into a moral referendum on me.</i>

882
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,674
<i>-You are a monster!</i>
-Oh, fuck.

883
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,553
-<i>You are a billy goat.</i>
-<i>A sick, depraved un--</i>

884
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,473
<i>Charles Freck, becoming progressively</i>
<i>more and more depressed...</i>

885
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,315
<i>...by what was happening around him,</i>
<i>decided finally to off himself.</i>

886
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,869
<i>There was no problem</i>
<i>in the circles where he hung out...</i>

887
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,473
<i>...in putting an end to yourself.</i>

888
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,596
<i>You just bought a large quantity</i>
<i>of downers...</i>

889
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,591
<i>...and took them with cheap wine.</i>

890
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,876
<i>The planning part had to do</i>
<i>with the artifacts...</i>

<i>...he wanted found on him</i>
<i>by later archeologists.</i>

892
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,152
<i>He had spent several days deciding...</i>

893
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,869
<i>...much longer than he had spent</i>
<i>deciding to kill himself.</i>

894
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,235
<i>He would be found lying on his back</i>

895

<i>... with a copy of Ayn Rand's</i>

896
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,717
<i>...and an unfinished letter to Exxon...</i>

897
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,952
<i>...protesting the cancellation</i>
<i>of his gas credit card.</i>

898
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,430
<i>That way, he would indict the system</i>
<i>and achieve something by his death...</i>

899
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,478
<i>...over and above</i>

900
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,753
<i>At the last moment, he changed his mind</i>
<i>on a decisive issue...</i>

901
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,718
<i>...and decided to drink the pills</i>
<i>with a connoisseur wine...</i>

902
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,836
<i>...instead of Ripple or Thunderbird.</i>

903
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,958
<i>So he set off on one last drive,</i>
<i>over to Tiny's Liquors...</i>

904
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,758
<i>... which specialized in fine wines...</i>

905
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,753
<i>...and bought a bottle</i>
<i>of 2001 Azalea Springs Merlot...</i>

906
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,717
<i>... which set him back almost $ 7 0.</i>

907
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,593
<i>Back home again, he uncorked the wine,</i>
<i>let it breathe, drank a few glasses of it...</i>

908
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,479
<i>...and tried to think</i>
<i>of something meaningful, but could not.</i>

909
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,315
<i>And then, with a glass of merlot,</i>
<i>gulped down all the pills at once.</i>

910
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,630
<i>However, he had been burned.</i>

911
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,954
<i>Instead of quietly suffocating,</i>
<i>Charles Freck began to hallucinate.</i>

912
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,793
<i>The next thing he knew,</i>
<i>a creature from between dimensions...</i>

913
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,714
<i>... was standing beside his bed,</i>
<i>looking down at him disapprovingly.</i>

914
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,719
You're gonna read me my sins?

915
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,271
It's gonna take 100,000 hours?

916
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:59,515
Your sins will be read to you ceaselessly,
in shifts, throughout eternity.

917
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,595
The list will never end.

918
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,636
“The Sins of Freck. “

919
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,310
<i>Charles Freck wished he could take back</i>
<i>the last half-hour of his life.</i>

920
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,677
“Age 6, in the first grade:
theft of fingernail clippers.

921
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,558
3:08 p.m. Theft.

922
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,792
You did knowingly and with malice
punch your baby sister, Evelyn.

923
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,029
Kicking the dog.

924
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,794
December: theft of Christmas presents.

925
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,235
One million lies. Destruction of... . “

926
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,073
<i>One thousand years later,</i>
<i>they had reached the sixth grade...</i>

927
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,117
<i>... the year he had discovered</i>
<i>masturbation.</i>

928
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,238
“November 14th: Percodan.

929
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,152
Vicodin. Cocaine. “

930
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,756
<i>Charles Freck thought,</i>
<i>“At least I got a good wine. “</i>

931
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,036
Where did Substance D come from?

932
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,513
Why can't we stop it?

933
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,592
The bigger this war gets,
the more freedoms we lose...

934
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,354
...the more Substance D
is on our streets.

935
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,078
Can't you figure this out?

936
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,674
Look around you.
Look how far we've come.

937
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,195
Humanity wasn't meant to live like this.

938
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,194
Our every waking moment
tracked and traced and scanned.

939
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,316
It's time to stop
submitting to this tyranny.

940
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,233
It's time to realize
that we're being enslaved.

941
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,039
It's our tax dollars at work.
Protect us from ourselves.

942
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,918
Hey, guys, I used to be one of you.

943
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,196
Stop selling out your own species.

944
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,189
Hey. Get in.

945
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,712
You scared me.

946
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,996
Got something for you.

947
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,030
I'm seeing some crazy shit tonight.

948
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,994
What do you mean?

949
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,231
That fucking Barris.

950
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,231
You know how he works?

951
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,993
He doesn't kill anybody...

952
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,755
...but he hangs around until
the situation arises where they die.

953
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,950
And then he just sits there.

954
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,035
And he sort of sets them up
in the first place while he stays out of it.

955
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,590
But I'm not sure how.

956
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,309
Hey, do you have that money
for the stuff? I need it tonight.

957
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,631
-Yeah. I have it.
-Okay.

958
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,110
You know, I don't like Barris.

959
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,872
And I don't trust him.

960
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,678
Guy's fucking crazy.

961
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,070
And when you're around him,
you start acting crazy.

962
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,754
And then when you're not around him,
you're fine.

963
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,753
You're acting crazy now.

964
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,798
-I am?
-Yes.

965
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:31,154
Hey, will you take me to a concert
next weekend at Anaheim Stadium?

966
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,435
Sure.

967
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,431
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

968
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,951
Yeah. Which night?

969
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,395
It's Sunday afternoon.

970
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,836
Whatever you want.

971
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,477
Well, I'll just drive over to my place.

972
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,029
You have the money,
you'll give it to me.

973
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,589
We'll kick back, drop some Death...

974
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,228
...maybe get some tequila.

975
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,678
All right.

976
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,676
All right.

977
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,240
Hey, Donna, do you like cats?

978
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,955
Drippy little things.

979
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,238
Moving along
about a foot above the ground.

980
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,992
Above?

981
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,510
You mean, on the ground?

982
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,114
Just dripping...

983
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,633
...behind furniture.

984
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,588
Little spring flowers with blue in them
that come up first.

985
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,713
Yeah.

986
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,950
-Before the--
-Before someone stomps on them...

987
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,348
...and they're all gone.

988
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,358
It's like you know me.

989
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,150
You can read me.

990
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,280
Can I put my arms around you?

991
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,391
-I wanna hug you, okay?
-No.

992
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,030
-What?
-Look, I do a lot of coke, okay?

993
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,873
I just have to be really careful
because I do a lot of coke.

994
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,474
So just leave my body alone, okay?

995
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,919
Okay.

996
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,794
Sure.

997
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,473
Yeah.

998
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,190
You know, fuck it.

999
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,518
Hey, I-- I'm sorry.

1000
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,830
I just don't like it
when people grope my body...

1001
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,151
...and I have to watch out for that
because I snort so much coke.

1002
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,551
That's fucking lame. I gotta go.

1003
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,994
Your car's not fixed.

1004
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,555
I drove you here, I'll drive you back.

1005
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,835
Bob.

1006
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,958
Bob.

1007
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,594
Bob, wait.

1008
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,273
Please.

1009
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,953
Please wait.

1010
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,556
I didn't mean-- I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

1011
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,154
I'm just-- I'm so out of it right now.

1012
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,790
I-- Sometimes after I've worked
really hard all day, I--

1013
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,279
Please, come back.

1014
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,635
Come on. With the tequila.

1015
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,191
How much do you do?

1016
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,956
Not that much.
And I don't shoot up.

1017
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,190
I never have and I never will. I--

1018
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,114
Once you start shooting,
you got like six months, maybe.

1019
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,713
And even tap water.

1020
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,552
You get a habit.

1021
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,517
You have a habit.

1022
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,552
We all do.

1023
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,951
I mean, so what? What's the difference?

1024
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,156
I'm happy.

1025
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,073
-Aren't you happy?
-Listen to me.

1026
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,037
I think it's starting to get bad.

1027
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,473
You know what
I wanna do someday, Bob?

1028
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,315
I wanna move north, live on a farm...

1029
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,632
...near the mountains, in a cabin.

1030
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,392
Can I go with you?

1031
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,836
I hope so.

1032
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,511
I hope so.

1033
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,153
All right. You weren't kidding.

1034
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,675
Do you have a toothbrush?

1035
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,319
What?

1036
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,072
Well, screw it. Screw it.

1037
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,832
Teeth are teeth.

1038
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,796
I'll-- I'll brush them.

1039
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,356
Know where the bathroom is?

1040
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,272
What bathroom?

1041
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,033
In the house.

1042
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,870
Who are those guys out there?

1043
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,508
Rolling joints and rattling on and on?

1044
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,713
They live here with you?

1045
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,632
Two of them do.

1046
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,916
So you're gay?

1047
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,074
Try not to be.
That's why I called you tonight.

1048
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,198
So you're putting up
a pretty good battle against it.

1049
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,791
You better believe it.

1050
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,759
Guess I'm about to find out.

1051
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,789
lf you're a latent gay, then
you'll want me to take the initiative.

1052
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,110
You want me to undress you?

1053
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,793
Sure.

1054
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,072
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

1055
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,989
Hello?

1056
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,119
<i>Fred, we've processed</i>
<i>some more recent material on you.</i>

1057
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,350
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

1058
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,432
Okay.

1059
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,678
<i>Any problems?</i>

1060
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,876
Well, I had a fight with my girl.

1061
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,234
<i>Any confusion?</i>

1062
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,394
<i>Are you experiencing any difficulty</i>
<i>identifying persons or objects?</i>

1063
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:18,755
<i>Any language disorientation?</i>

1064
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,353
No.

1065
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,790
<i>Can you come back over to room 203?</i>

1066
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,236
What did you find to be a problem?

1067
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,311
<i>We'll take that up when you get here.</i>

1068
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,679
Connie.

1069
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,158
Donna.

1070
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:05,753
All right, Fred. Very good.

1071
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,151
And this next test,
with your eyes covered...

1072
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,869
...reach out and feel an object
with each hand.

1073
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,033
You are to tell us if the object
presented to your left hand...

1074
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,794
...is identical to the object
presented to your right.

1075
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,792
One more thing, Fred.

1076
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,598
We need an updated blood test.

1077
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,911
So go down the hall to the
pathology lab, and they'll fix you up.

1078
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,516
And by the time you get back, we should
almost be through with our evaluation.

1079
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,272
I'll be upstairs with Hank.

1080
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,476
You certainly seem
much more depressed today...

1081
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,596
...than you did when we first saw you.

1082
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,313
Pardon?

1083
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,916
Last week, when we first saw you,
you were kidding and laughing.

1084
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,116
Did you ever get her the flowers?

1085
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,308
<i>Crazy job they gave me.</i>

1086
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,358
<i>But if I wasn't doing it,</i>
<i>someone else would be.</i>

1087
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,431
<i>And they might get it wrong.</i>

1088
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,832
<i>They might set Arctor up,</i>
<i>plant drugs on him and collect a reward.</i>

1089
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,595
<i>Better it be me,</i>
<i>despite the disadvantages.</i>

1090
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,390
<i>Just protecting everyone from Barris</i>
<i>is justification in itself.</i>

1091
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,437
<i>What the hell am I talking about?</i>

1092
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,033
<i>I must be nuts.</i>

1093
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,351
<i>I know Bob Arctor. He's a good person.</i>

1094
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:52,798
<i>He's up to nothing.</i>
<i>At least, nothing too bad.</i>

1095
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,309
<i>In fact, he works for the Orange County</i>
<i>Sheriff's Office covertly...</i>

1096
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,790
<i>... which is probably why</i>
<i>Barris is after him.</i>

1097
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,308
<i>But that wouldn't explain...</i>

1098
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,233
<i>... why the Orange County</i>
<i>Sheriff's Office is after him.</i>

1099
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,588
<i>Something big is definitely</i>
<i>going down in this house.</i>

1100
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,639
<i>This rundown, rubble-filled house...</i>

1101
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,597
<i>... with its weed-patch yard...</i>

1102
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,274
<i>...and cat box that never gets emptied.</i>

1103
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,273
<i>What a waste of a truly good house.</i>

1104
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,034
<i>So much could be done with it.</i>

1105
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,193
<i>A family and children could live here.</i>

1106
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,431
<i>It was designed for that.</i>

1107
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,079
<i>Such a waste.</i>

1108
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,069
<i>They ought to confiscate it</i>
<i>and put it to better use.</i>

1109
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,437
<i>I'm supposed to act like they aren't here.</i>

1110
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,558
<i>Assuming there's a “they” at all.</i>

1111
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,918
<i>It may just be my imagination.</i>

1112
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,760
<i>Whatever it is that's watching...</i>

1113
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,956
<i>...it's not human...</i>

1114
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,680
<i>...unlike little dark-eyed Donna.</i>

1115
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,230
<i>It doesn't ever blink.</i>

1116
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,434
<i>What does a scanner see?</i>

1117
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,556
<i>Into the head?</i>

1118
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,190
<i>Down into the heart?</i>

1119
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,950
<i>Does it see into me, into us?</i>

1120
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,190
<i>Clearly or darkly?</i>

1121
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:32,031
<i>I hope it sees clearly, because</i>
<i>I can 't any longer see into myself.</i>

1122
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,431
<i>I see only murk.</i>

1123
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,596
<i>I hope for everyone's sake</i>
<i>the scanners do better.</i>

1124
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,828
<i>Because if the scanner sees only darkly,</i>
<i>the way I do...</i>

1125
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,993
<i>... then I'm cursed and cursed again.</i>

1126
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,958
<i>And we'll only wind up dead this way...</i>

1127
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,911
<i>...knowing very little and getting</i>
<i>that little fragment wrong too.</i>

1128
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,911
You show what we regard...

1129
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:07,278
...more as competition phenomenon
than impairment.

1130
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,829
Yeah?

1131
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:12,790
Competition between the left and
the right hemispheres of your brain.

1132
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,758
It's like you have two signals
that interfere with each other...

1133
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,309
...by carrying conflicting information.

1134
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,074
It's as if you have two fuel gauges
on your car.

1135
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,117
They're studying
the same amount of fuel...

1136
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,431
...but one says your tank is full,
the other registers empty.

1137
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,828
They can't both be right.

1138
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,470
And you as the driver have only
an indirect relationship to the fuel tank...

1139
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,959
...via the gauges.

1140
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,877
So, what does all this mean?

1141
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,470
Well, I'm sure you know already.

1142
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,428
You've been experiencing it
without knowing why or what it is.

1143
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,119
Two hemispheres of my brain...

1144
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,039
...are competing?

1145
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,958
-Yes.
-Yes.

1146
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,832
But why?

1147
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,399
Substance D.

1148
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,394
It often causes that, functionally,
and this is what the tests confirm.

1149
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,518
Damage has taken place to the
normally dominant left hemisphere...

1150
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,114
...and the right hemisphere
is attempting to compensate.

1151
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,633
Crosscutting, we call it...

1152
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,836
...related to split-brain phenomenon.

1153
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,959
We could perform
a right hemispherectomy...

1154
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,554
...but I'd--

1155
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,155
Will this ever go away?

1156
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,269
Probably. It's a functional impairment.

1157
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,477
It may be organic damage.

1158
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,119
It may be permanent.

1159
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,239
Time will tell, and only after you've
been off Substance D for a long while.

1160
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,359
I'll never take Substance D again
for the rest of my life.

1161
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,956
How much are you taking now?

1162
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,314
Not much.

1163
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,873
More, recently, because of job stress.

1164
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,077
<i>Death is swallowed up in victory.</i>

1165
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,437
<i>Behold, I tell you the sacred secret now:</i>

1166
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,637
<i>You shall not all sleep in death.</i>

1167
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,633
<i>We'll do the other half</i>
<i>of Southern California tomorrow night.</i>

1168
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,077
<i>The Air Force arsenal at Vandenberg</i>
<i>will be hit for automatic weapons--</i>

1169
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,118
<i>What about that anthrax</i>
<i>Anwar ripped off for us?</i>

1170
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,750
<i>When do we--? Aren't we supposed to</i>
<i>carry the stuff to the watershed area--?</i>

1171
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,239
<i>We need the weapons first.</i>

1172
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,789
<i>Drugs in the water supply is step B.</i>

1173
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,394
<i>Okay, but I gotta go. I got a customer.</i>

1174
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,028
I can also identify
the aforementioned terrorist cell.

1175
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,794
It's indicated throughout the course
of my observations.

1176
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,555
Do you have any more material of this
sort, or is this tape substantially it?

1177
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,312
No, I have a veritable cornucopia...

1178
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,995
...and much of it is directly referencing
the organization and its directives.

1179
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,720
Who are these people?
What organization?

1180
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,758
It is primarily Arctor and Hawthorne.

1181
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,071
I have coded notes here, which may be
of some interest to you.

1182
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,791
I-- My own cryptology
is very difficult to--

1183
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,713
As of now I'm impounding all of this.

1184
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,236
It is our property temporarily,
and we will sort through it ourselves.

1185
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,473
You will be on hand
to explain anything to us...

1186
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,713
...if and when we get to the point where
we feel we need anything explained.

1187
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,079
Mr. Barris, you will not be released
pending our study of this material.

1188
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:17,915
You will be charged, as a formality,
to keep you available...

1189
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,436
...with knowingly giving the authorities
false information.

1190
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,593
This, of course, is just a pretext
for your own safety.

1191
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,638
I always wanted to go
to the Galapagos--

1192
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,394
-Is that satisfactory, Mr. Barris?
-Not entirely.

1193
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,312
Though I wonder,
when I'm locked down...

1194
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,995
...may I be provided with some lotion,
and perhaps some...?

1195
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,509
So, what do you think
of Barris' evidence?

1196
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,029
Seems like what he played--
The little we heard anyway.

1197
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,509
--sounded pretty genuine to me.

1198
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:00,275
It's fake. Worthless.

1199
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,032
Made on a home computer.

1200
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,397
Maybe you're right.

1201
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,839
Is that my medical report
you have there?

1202
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,399
Yep.

1203
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,679
What does it say?

1204
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,350
That you're completely bonkers.

1205
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,873
Completely?

1206
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,673
There's maybe two brain cells
that still light up.

1207
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,592
Rest is just...

1208
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:29,149
...short circuits and sparks.

1209
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,992
Two?

1210
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,991
Listen, when you go to pick up
your next paycheck...

1211
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,630
...there will be a substantial difference
this time.

1212
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,758
I get some sort of bonus for this--?

1213
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:49,550
For this having happened to me on duty?

1214
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,632
No. Read your penal code.

1215
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,237
“An officer who willingly becomes an
addict and doesn't report it promptly...

1216
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,436
...is subject to a misdemeanor charge...

1217
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:02,439
...a fine, and/or six months. “

1218
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,594
You'll probably just be fined.

1219
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,193
Willingly?

1220
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,392
No one held a gun to your head
and shot you up.

1221
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,471
No one dropped something in your soup.

1222
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,552
You knowingly and willingly
took an addictive drug...

1223
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,029
...brain-destructive and disorienting.

1224
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,679
I had to.

1225
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,475
You could have pretended to.

1226
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,154
Most officers manage to cope with it.

1227
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:32,350
And from the quantities
you were taking... .

1228
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,876
My God, Fred, I... .

1229
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,715
Hey, you know what I would do
if I were you?

1230
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,072
Once you get out of New Path and,
you know, it's all over--

1231
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,117
But it may never be over.

1232
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,515
Cigarette?

1233
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,117
I'm getting off that too. Everything.

1234
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,070
Including chocolate. Yeah.

1235
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,473
And... .

1236
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,512
Like I tell my kids... .

1237
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,198
I've got two kids. Two girls.

1238
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,188
Little ones.

1239
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,269
I don't believe you do.

1240
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,196
You're not supposed to.

1241
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,634
Maybe not.

1242
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,115
Listen, is there anywhere specific
you'd like to go?

1243
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,517
Maybe over to
Donna Hawthorne's place?

1244
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:51,037
From the information you brought in,
sounds like you guys are pretty close.

1245
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,277
Yes, we are.

1246
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,668
How'd you know that?

1247
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,799
Process of elimination.

1248
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,279
I know who you aren't...

1249
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,280
...and we're talking about
a very small group of people...

1250
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,635
...that we hoped would lead us higher.

1251
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,472
And maybe Barris will.

1252
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:14,435
I pieced it together a long time ago
that you're Arctor.

1253
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,597
I'm who?

1254
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,516
I'm Bob Arctor?

1255
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,554
Yeah, get me
Donna Hawthorne's number...

1256
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,995
...or just patch me through
when you locate her.

1257
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,074
Thanks.

1258
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,676
Bud, you are in a very bad way,
my friend.

1259
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,751
Maybe Jim Barris poisoned you.

1260
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,434
We're really interested in Barris,
not you.

1261
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,070
The whole scanning of the house
was to keep an eye on him.

1262
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:52,394
We hoped to draw him here, and we did.

1263
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:57,192
He is deep into it
with some very dangerous people.

1264
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,956
Then I'm a what?

1265
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,475
Well, we had to get to Barris
to set him up.

1266
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,676
So how we arranged it was...

1267
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,673
...he grew progressively
more and more suspicious...

1268
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,558
...that you were an undercover cop...

1269
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,109
...trying to nail him
or use him to get high or--

1270
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:17,511
So he did what you or anyone
would have done.

1271
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:18,869
Hey, Donna.

1272
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,949
Yeah, hi, this is a buddy of Bob's.
Arctor.

1273
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,154
Yeah.

1274
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:29,359
Listen, he's in a-- He's in a bad way.

1275
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,830
Yeah, way bad.

1276
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,834
I was wondering if I could
ask a favor of you.

1277
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,074
You're a sweetheart.

1278
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:43,110
Yeah, I'm sure he'll
appreciate it very much.

1279
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,669
Great, thanks. Good news.

1280
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,753
Donna Hawthorne said she'd pick you up
out front in about five minutes.

1281
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,794
You fuckers.

1282
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,754
You're a good man, Bob.

1283
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,595
You've been dealt a bad deal.

1284
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,514
This is not fair, but it has to be this way.

1285
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,908
You just--

1286
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:06,993
You gotta-- You gotta just wait it out,
just get through it.

1287
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,196
And someday...

1288
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,148
...a long time from now...

1289
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,398
...you'll see the way you saw before.

1290
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,273
There'll be a recognition...

1291
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:23,560
...and some spark in a disguised form...

1292
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:25,676
...will reveal itself to you...

1293
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,755
...and guide you.

1294
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,514
-Substance D?
-Yeah.

1295
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,957
Ate his head.

1296
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,838
Another loser.

1297
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,318
It's easy to win.

1298
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,952
Anybody can win.

1299
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,992
Goodbye.

1300
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,959
Living and unliving things
are exchanging properties.

1301
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:34,033
The drive of unliving things is stronger
than the drive of living things.

1302
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:41,155
The living should never be used
to serve the purposes of the dead.

1303
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:46,479
But the dead should, if possible...

1304
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,950
...serve the purposes of the living.

1305
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,793
Hey, good news.

1306
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,269
I think I got you transferred
to one of our farms.

1307
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,552
-Can I work with animals?
-I think you'll be working with plants...

1308
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,393
...for a while. In the open,
where you can touch the ground.

1309
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:18,472
-I wanna be with something living.
-The ground is living.

1310
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,676
The earth is still alive.

1311
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,354
Do you have
any agricultural background?

1312
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,953
I worked in an office.

1313
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,030
Well, you'll be outside from now on.

1314
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,958
Your name is Bruce.

1315
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,190
My name is Bruce.

1316
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,433
We're gonna try you on farming
for a period, Bruce.

1317
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,229
-Okay.
-Staff thought you'd be better off.

1318
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,550
I think you'll like it here.

1319
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,915
I think I'll like it here.

1320
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,599
Come on, I'll show you
where you're gonna be sleeping.

1321
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,670
You like mountains, Bruce?

1322
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,034
Look up.

1323
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,758
Mountains.

1324
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,673
No snow, but mountains.

1325
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,432
I like mountains.

1326
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,830
The air is good here.

1327
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,117
I like air.

1328
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,114
Yeah.

1329
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,431
We all like air, Bruce. We really do.

1330
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,830
That we have in common.

1331
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,552
4G.

1332
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,472
Yours is 4G. Can you remember that?

1333
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,232
4G.

1334
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,078
Will I be seeing my friends?

1335
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,949
What, you mean
from back where you were?

1336
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:51,758
The Santa Ana facility?

1337
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,433
Mike and Laura...

1338
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,990
...and Mike and Eddie. And--

1339
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,355
The people from
the residence facilities...

1340
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,795
...they don't come out
to the farms, Bruce.

1341
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,270
-See, these are closed operations.
-Closed operations.

1342
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,398
But, you know,
you might get back up there...

1343
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,073
...couple times a year.

1344
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,708
You know,
there are gatherings at Christmas...

1345
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,518
...and the next one is Thanksgiving.

1346
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,829
Thanksgiving.

1347
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,072
So you might see them in three months.

1348
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,837
Hey, Audrey.

1349
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,996
Glad you could meet.

1350
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:40,792
So tell me, are they
getting paranoid about him?

1351
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,428
No, not at all. The guy's so burnt-out.

1352
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,720
And we're still convinced
they're growing the stuff?

1353
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,713
They have to be. Who else?

1354
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,918
I just wonder
if it even matters at this--

1355
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,231
It matters, Audrey.

1356
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,312
It matters when we can prove
that New Path is the one growing...

1357
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,232
...manufacturing and distributing.

1358
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,591
How does he look?

1359
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,432
I mean, do you think he's gonna
be able to pull through for us?

1360
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,194
All we can do is hope
that when he finally gets in there...

1361
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:17,956
...a few charred brain cells will flicker on
and some distant instinct will kick in.

1362
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,553
It's just... .

1363
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:23,675
-It's just such a cost to pay.
-Yeah.

1364
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,110
But there's no other way to get in there.

1365
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:29,158
I couldn't, and think how long I tried.

1366
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,112
They got that place locked up tight.

1367
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,397
They're only gonna let a burnt-out husk
like Bruce in.

1368
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,916
Harmless. You have to be,
or they won't take the risk.

1369
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,799
Yeah, but to sacrifice someone...

1370
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,997
...a living person,
without them ever knowing it.

1371
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,277
I mean, if he'd understood,
if he had volunteered...

1372
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,271
...but he doesn't know and he never did.

1373
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,510
He didn't volunteer for this.

1374
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,114
Sure he did. It was his job.

1375
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:56,555
It wasn't his job to get addicted.

1376
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,112
We took care of that.

1377
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,316
Look, Mike, I gotta get out.

1378
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,675
I can't do this again.

1379
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,638
I want it to end. I--

1380
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,394
I lay in bed at night, and I can't sleep,
and I just think:

1381
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:13,155
-”Shit, we are colder than they are. “
-I don't think so.

1382
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,118
I mean, I believe God's m.o.
is to transmute evil into good...

1383
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,919
...and if he's active here,
he's doing that now...

1384
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,310
...although our eyes can't perceive it.

1385
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:24,552
The whole process is hidden
beneath the surface of our reality...

1386
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:27,188
...will only be revealed later.

1387
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,478
And even then...

1388
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,756
...the people of the future...

1389
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,356
...our children's children
will never truly know...

1390
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,115
...this awful time that we have
gone through and the losses we took.

1391
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,837
Well, maybe some footnote
in a minor history book.

1392
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,548
A brief mention
with no list of the fallen.

1393
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,270
You're seeing the flower of the future.

1394
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,031
-But not for you, Bruce.
-Not for me.

1395
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,709
No, you've had too much
of a good thing already.

1396
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,798
Get up, get up. Stop worshipping.

1397
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,633
This isn't your god anymore,
although it once was.

1398
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,159
Gone.

1399
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,877
Flowers gone.

1400
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,917
No, you just can't see them.

1401
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,752
Back to work.

1402
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,153
I saw.

1403
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,508
Back to work, Bruce.

1404
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,631
I saw death rising from the earth...

1405
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,595
...from the ground itself...

1406
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:21,597
...in one blue field.

1407
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,118
A present for my friends...

1408
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,676
...at Thanksgiving.

1409
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,751
