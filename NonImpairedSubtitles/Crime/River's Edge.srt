- I have to see ID.

4
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:12,550
- I left it at home. How much?
- Not unless you show me ID.

5

- Stop being a shit. Keep the change, man.
- I'm not keeping it. I have to see ID.

6
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:21,391
I don't have any. I been coming here
three months, Frank never carded me.

7

Frank lost his job because
he didn't get proper ID when he sold beer.

We'll find her.
Where is that brother of yours?

Where's my Missy?

- Where were you last night, anyhow?

John was getting all out of control.

- I'll bet. Who else was there?
- Jamie.

Oh, Jamie. I didn't miss anything.

Feck.

Feck.

- Cheque's in the mail.
- It's me, Feck, Layne. Don't shoot, OK?

74
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,239
I could blow your brains out.

75

- I know, Feck.
- I shot a girl once.

76
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:27,703
I know. You keep telling me that.
You want to lower that barrel some?

But we're kind of, we're late for school...

- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:12:58,574 --> 00:13:02,903
Well? How much you want, then?

87
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:06,488
Aw, come on. No, I came by to see
how you're doing, good old Feck.

88
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,616
Yeah, good old Feck.

89
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,957
Yeah. How much you want?

90
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,459
Just a couple of joints.

91
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:17,422
Wait here.

92
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,685
- You're my friend.
- Of course.

93
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,769
She had it coming, man.

94
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:41,822
Yeah, I know, Feck. You know,
women are evil. You had to kill her.

95
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:44,823
- Yeah. They're still after me, you know.
- Yeah.

96
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:47,411
- All right. See you.
- All right, see you.

97
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,459
Thanks for the weed.

98
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:56,171
Friends.

99
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,220
You're my friend.

100
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:08,764
Ellie, huh? The gun - did he have the gun?

101
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:10,604
Right.

102
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,107
You're my friend.

103
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:24,318
- Gimme a cigarette, man.
- You fucking gave up cigarettes.

104
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:27,289
- I gave up yesterday, not today.
- I gave up lending.

105
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:30,369
Learn some self-control,
you're interrupting. Go on.

106
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,713
I don't know. I just figured
we could dump this place, you know?

107
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,291
Go up there, and if we like it,
we stay, don't come back.

108
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:42,045
- Where did you get Portland?
- Well, nobody knows us up there.

109
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,885
- People know us here?
- I know you, babe.

110
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,843
That's really annoying.

111
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:50,097
So, what, man?
We could be lumberjacks or something?

112
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,646
- There's other things to do.
- Like what?

113
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:57,725
- Like get stoned.
- It almost sounds like a plan.

114
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,066
Except we're all broke,
and I'm the only one with a car.

115
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,494
We could just take all our parents' money,
take off, discover America,

116
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:09,120
and make like we're <i>Easy Rider</i> plus five.

117
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:13,618
I gotta go. Burkewaite's gonna
have a spaz attack if I'm late.

118
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:16,921
She's in love with his middle-aged ass.

119
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,670
He's not middle-aged, asshole. Hi, John.

126
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:47,446

She was talking shit.

136

Yeah.

138
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:49,180

John.

142

It's like some fucking movie, you know?

143
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:30,008
Friends since second grade,
fucking like this.

144
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:34,604
And then one of us gets himself
in potentially big trouble,

145
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:40,153
and now we've gotta deal with it. We've
gotta test our loyalty against all odds.

146

I mean, that's the normal question.

All the hippies are executives now,
and everybody's sold out.

Well, let me tell you something, Tom.
Save it, Kevin.

152
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,597
Fundamental changes were made,

153
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:13,309
changes so basic
that we now take 'em for granted.

154
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:16,559
The civil rights movement,
later the Women's Movement.

155
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:20,524
I mean, like it or not, ladies,
you're now expected to have careers,

156
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:24,273
then maybe later
the husbands and the babies.

157
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,235
And Vietnam.

158
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:30,032
We stopped a war, man.

159
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:32,655
We took to the streets
and made a difference.

160
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:36,077
We turned public sentiment around,

161
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:40,755
and we made people see the truth. Not
that we always thought good thoughts.

162
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:44,667
Cops around you cracking skulls,
you got a picket sign in your hand,

163
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:47,556
you're not thinking about
stopping the war now,

164
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:52,391
you're thinking about
knocking a few pigs on their asses.

165
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,889
But as crazy as it all seemed, though,

166
00:18:56,024 --> 00:19:00,271
there was a meaning in the madness,
a clear and a real purpose.

167
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:05,777
- But don't you think violence is wrong?
- Fuck off, Kevin. Wasting pigs is radical.

168
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:07,948
<i>(bell)</i>

169
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:13,449
You missed my point.

170
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:18,420
- Come on, let's go grab a smoke.
- You go on, I'll be there in a minute.

171
00:19:18,547 --> 00:19:20,586
You're hooked.

172
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:35,856
- Yes.
- Bullshit.

173
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:38,602
Would I lie?

174
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:41,651
- You really...
- <i>(girl)</i> Really what?

175
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,020
- No way.
- Look, dude.

176
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:47,655
I saw it right there in front of me.
I poked at it with a stick.

177
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:50,073
- No chance.
- Poked at what?

178
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:53,573
- <i>(boy)</i> By the river, huh?
- <i>(Layne)</i> Tony.

179
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:57,327
We'll take you there,
and we'll show you. Right, Matt?

180
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,834
- Count me out, OK?
- Count you out of what?

181
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,085
What's by the river,
and what are you guys talking about?

182
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:07,595
- Layne's saying Samson killed Jamie.
- No way.

183
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,549
And you believe them?

184
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:12,221
A bunch of us are going
out there to check it out.

185
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,428
I don't know. It's probably some joke.

186
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:18,264
Yeah, they're just trying to lure
you up there so they can rape you.

187
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,187
- You think so?
- <i>(laughter)</i>

188
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:39,999
- No free food, Layne.
- Come on, Mike. I just came by to say hi.

189
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:41,673
- Hi.
- Hi.

190
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,838
Oh, no.

191
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:53,968
- You can't use my truck, Layne.
- Come on, Mike. It's important.

192
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,355
What's all this?

193
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:09,864
We're the newly appointed truant patrol.

194
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:15,071
Looking to capture and kill ten-year-old
runaway homeboys. Like you.

195
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:19,419
- Hear you're all gonna go see a dead girl.
- What do you know about a dead girl?

196
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,119
Me and John are close. Huh, John?

197
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,461
Yeah.

198
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:30,259
- Thinking of coming with you guys.
- No room. Both you guys, outta here.

199
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,881
John wants us to stay.

200
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:35,224
Don't you, John?

201
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:40,024
Nice try, Layne. Nice try, but forget it.

202
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,151
I won't let you do this to me again.
I promised myself.

203
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:45,947
- N-o spells nuh-uh.
- Mike.

204
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:49,691
No. No one drives that truck but me.

205
00:21:49,826 --> 00:21:53,871
- Well, then, you drive it, then.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

206
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:57,117
My supervisor's gonna kill me
if he sees me talking to you.

207
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:00,335
Now you want me to just walk out,
leave work, lose my job?

208
00:22:10,724 --> 00:22:13,559
- I ain't got all day, you know.
- I know, Mike.

209
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:16,093
Some of us have to work, Layne.

210
00:22:16,229 --> 00:22:21,354
- <i>(girl)</i> Is that it over there?
- <i>(girl #2)</i> That's just a log, man.

211
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:24,900
What, that?

212
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,066
<i>(Tony)</i> It's a dummy. This is a joke.

213
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,699
We all came out here
for some stupid joke.

214
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:35,328
Oh, my God.

215
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:40,667
Oh, my God.

216
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:32,297
You're in trouble, dude.

217
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,223
No, man.

218
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,055
Nobody has to find out.

219
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:39,305
OK, listen up.

220
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:43,644
We've got a lot of people here.

221
00:23:43,777 --> 00:23:48,355
We could bury her so she's never found.

222
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:56,329
Is anybody gonna help me?

223
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,577
Where are you going, Mike?
Get back here.

224
00:24:03,714 --> 00:24:09,088
- I gotta get back to work, Layne.
- I said get back here, goddammit.

225
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:14,845
Layne, leave me alone.

226
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:18,594
- Let me go.
- We're dealing with a friend's future.

227
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,766
- He killed somebody.
- You're gonna bring her back?

228
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,651
He brings us out here
like it's some fucking show.

229
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:27,066
We're here to deal with it.
Give me your keys.

230
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:29,486
No, dammit!

231
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:32,072
- You son of a bitch.
- Layne.

232
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:38,957
- Leave him alone, Layne.
- What the fuck are you doing?

233
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:42,868
He doesn't have to stay
if he doesn't want to.

234
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:56,057
So me and John are gonna have
to do this all by ourselves, huh?

235
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,895
What the fuck are you doing?

236
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:05,350
She's heavy. Come on.

237
00:25:06,445 --> 00:25:08,485
Are you coming?

238
00:25:11,116 --> 00:25:15,031
You people are a fucking test, I swear.

239
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:31,008
You nailed it.

240
00:25:36,684 --> 00:25:40,349
- Sure you don't wanna come?
- Yeah, I'm tired.

241
00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:44,481
- Hey, you, stubdick. Come here.
- Suck me.

242
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,732
I'm serious, Tim.

243
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:55,568
Keep your fucking mouth shut, you hear?

244
00:25:55,703 --> 00:26:00,200
- About what?
- You know. Tony told me you know.

245
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,540
Oh, the death.

246
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:05,540
Don't worry, I'm with you.

247
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,213
I'll trust you.

248
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:21,644
Why are you two such delinquents?

249
00:26:21,773 --> 00:26:24,939
Because of our fucked-up childhood.

250
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,902
- What are you doing?
- Taking my gun.

251
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:32,569
You gave it to me two months ago.

252
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,654
<i>(mimics voice)</i>
I gave it to you two months ago.

253
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,871
You pothead fuckbrain!

254
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:44,875
- <i>(mother)</i> I have to work tonight, honey.
- <i>(Kim)</i> Miss work.

255
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:48,006
<i>(mother)</i> Don't smoke in the house.
Jim is sensitive to smoke.

256
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,331
Jim, Jim, Jim.

257
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:53,512
He pays the rent, Matt. He has
a right to his comfort. Where's Tim?

258
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:57,339
Outside being worthless. Why do you
let him play with that hoodlum?

259
00:26:57,476 --> 00:27:00,346
Why do I let him? What am I gonna do?

260
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:03,812
Why do I let you
smoke dope in the house?

261
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:08,852
- Where did you get that, anyway?
- Don't worry, it's not yours.

262
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:17,151
- Will you come to Missy's funeral?
- I'll come.

263
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,208
- Hole.
- <i>(Tony)</i> You're losing your touch.

264
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:24,583
It's the circuits inside.
The owners have 'em reconnected,

265
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:29,421
cos they know if I ever learn this machine,
I'll take control of the fucking universe.

266
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,589
So what's gonna happen?

267
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,340
I'll put a quarter in this machine
and murder it.

268
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:36,797
No, no, with John and all that.

269
00:27:36,932 --> 00:27:40,882
Nothing's gonna happen. I'll tie up
a few loose ends tonight and...

270
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,558
- nothing's gonna happen.
- That's it?

271
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:47,473
He murders Jamie and we just ignore it?

272
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,362
He had his reasons.

273
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:53,489
She was shooting her mouth off
about his mom.

274
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:57,661
- His mother's dead.
- Yeah. See?

275
00:27:57,787 --> 00:28:01,488
He's got a couple loose springs
when it comes to his dead mother.

276
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:04,459
But he's bragging.
It's like he wants to get caught.

277
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:09,129
He's not gonna get caught, because
no one's gonna tell. Isn't that right, Tony?

278
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:11,297
- I wouldn't nark.
- Don't you think...

279
00:28:11,426 --> 00:28:16,467
I think we should just quit talking about it,
cos some potential fink could be listening.

280
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:19,634
- That's what I think, right, Tony?
- Sure thing, man.

281
00:28:19,768 --> 00:28:22,093
OK. Clarissa.

282
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:27,567
Wouldn't want John hearing you
shoot your mouth off about it, right?

283
00:28:31,155 --> 00:28:35,367
- Bullshit. Layne's full of bullshit.
- There's the phone there.

284
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:39,906
He thinks he controls us. Thinks because
he says something, we have to do it.

285
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,411
- We usually do.
- Well, this isn't right.

286
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:45,115
I don't care if it was John, or who it was.

287
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:46,877
There's the phone.

288
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:50,872
What makes John more important than
Jamie? Wasn't Jamie our friend too?

289
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:54,544
- I've known her since kindergarten.
- Here, here's a quarter.

290
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:00,219
He's dangerous. It could have been you or
me dead now. He probably raped her, too.

291
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,677
Here.

292
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:06,387
- Who do I call, anyway?
- The police, I guess.

293
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:09,229
- I don't know the number.
- Call the operator.

294
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:12,148
- You do it.
- I don't know what to say.

I can't get the damn thing

- Tell him I'm not here, OK?
- OK.

308
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,195
- He's not here.
- Yeah? Where'd he go?

309
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:41,862
- To buy an egg. Goodbye.
- Hold on there, little lady.

310
00:30:41,998 --> 00:30:45,082
- I said he's not here.
- I believe you. Can I use your phone?

311
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,700
- No.
- Your mommy and daddy home?

312

Mommy's at work, Jim's at a bar.
I don't have a daddy.

Thank you, Samson.
Will you read to me later?

315
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:07,481
What tonight?

Yeah?

319
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,405
Fixing Aunto's dinner.

320
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,618
Yeah.

No.

No, no. I have to read to her later.

Jesus, Layne, don't worry about it.
It ain't that important.

Ain't important?

They're gonna nail you, dude.

326

I've known you for too fucking long
to let something like that happen to you.

327
00:31:51,527 --> 00:31:57,731
Fuck you, then. I'll do it myself.
And I'll be expecting a sixer for this.

Hello?

Just a sec. It's Clarissa.

334
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:33,481
- Do I tell her you're buying an egg?
- No.

335
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:37,194
- Is it your girlfriend?
- Get out.

336
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:38,901
Hello? Clarissa?

337
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:41,785
That's right. Just called to see what's up.

338
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:45,861
Nothing much.
I was just helping my sister with, uh...

339
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:48,870
- <i>With what?</i>
- Nothing.

340
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:53,297
I didn't see you at the arcade today.
Figured you had something going on.

341
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,424
Yeah.

342
00:32:57,762 --> 00:33:01,261
You probably want to get back
to whatever it is you're doing.

figured I'd call you.

You know how it is. Nothing important.

346
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:21,322
- I'll see you tomorrow, Matt.
- <i>Yeah, I'll see you, Clarissa.</i>

347

You go in now, all right?

You'd think I'd at least rate a Michelob.

- Don't be an ingrate.
- You're calling me an ingrate?

351

I never asked you to do it, Layne.

352

How do you expect other
people to care about you?

357
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:58,779
It's people like you that are sending
this country down the tubes.

No sense of pride, no sense of loyalty,
no sense of nothing, man.

359
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,200
Why do you think there are so many
fucking welfare cases in this country?

360
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:13,745
Why do you think it is that Russia's
gearing up to kick our asses, man?

361

- Drink your beer.
- I won't drink my beer. I'm talking here.

These things are important to me. And,
believe it or not, you're important to me.

363
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,511
Look at that.

Duck down, goddammit!
You want to get caught?

366
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,653
Somebody fucking narked.

367
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:48,320
- Yeah.
- OK. Now, we can't panic.

368
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,622
I'll bet you it was Mike.
I'll bet you anything it was Mike.

369
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,543
We're just gonna drive around a little
while, see if we can't figure this thing out.

370
00:36:56,672 --> 00:37:01,334
We have to get you out of town somehow.
You have any money? We'll need money.

We have to put you up somewhere
until we get money.

372
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,931
We can't panic, though.
We're dead if we panic, OK?

373
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,595
Whatever you say, Layne.

374
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,059
OK.

375
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,958
Sure this is the right place?

376
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,927
- I can't understand it.
- You said she was buried.

377
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:46,466
No, she was just lying down here,
in the grass.

378
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,090
If this is some joke that you're playing...

379

<i>(man)</i> Captain Bennett! Over here.

380
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:57,936
<i>(Bennett)</i> Did the sight of this dead girl
move you in any particular way?

381
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:02,731
- <i>(Matt)</i> I don't know.
- Were you shocked, angered, saddened?

382
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:06,815
- Did the sight please you?
- I don't know how I felt.

383
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,744
- You knew this girl.
- Yeah.

384
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,363
- How did you feel about her?
- I don't know.

385
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:15,877
OK, I'm getting sick of "I don't know",
do you hear me?

386
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:20,298
Did you love her? Did you hate her?
Did you fuck her when you got bored?

387
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:24,090
- She was a friend, I guess.
- You guess? She was or she wasn't?

388
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,631
She was.

389
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,681
So you're standing there,
staring at your dead friend

390
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:32,142
like it's all some kind of a big joke, right?

391
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:36,809
Some adventure. What the hell
was going on in your head, Matt? Huh?

392
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:39,859
Exactly what?
What were you thinking about?

393
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:44,732
Or were you even thinking at the time?
Answer me, goddammit!

394
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:48,236
I don't know, OK?
You want me to make something up?

395
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,995
No.

396
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:02,465
I want you to tell me the truth.

397
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:06,887
The body, Matt.
How do you figure it got in the river?

398
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:10,101
- I don't know.
- Well, take a stab, huh?

399
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:13,975
What do you think? You think
maybe it rolled, or a big gust of wind

400
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:16,478
peeled off the river and scooped it up?

401
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:18,850
- Maybe.
- Or maybe somebody pushed it.

402
00:39:18,986 --> 00:39:20,314
- Maybe.
- Maybe you.

403
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:23,400
- I didn't push it.
- You're the only one we know was there.

404
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:25,441
- I told you about John.
- John?

405
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:29,823
Samson. We call him John
because of his last name, Toulette.

406
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:33,040
You know. Toulette, toilet, john.

407
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,826
That's very clever.

408
00:39:35,961 --> 00:39:40,707
So you... you helped Samson,
John, push the body off.

409
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:42,668
- After I helped kill her.
- Yeah?

410
00:39:42,802 --> 00:39:45,719
Yeah, and fuck you, too!
I reported the thing, man.

411
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:49,630
- You act like I'm guilty of a crime.
- You think you're going somewhere?

412
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:53,218
I've got rights. You can't keep me here.
I didn't do anything.

413
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:56,271
That was exactly your mistake, buddy.

414
00:39:56,399 --> 00:40:01,191
You saw this and didn't act immediately.
Makes you an accessory after the fact.

415
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,659
I could arrest you right now if I wanted to,
so why don't you sit down?

416
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:09,240
We'll talk some more.

417
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,745

He knows, Feck, he knows.
Look, Feck, John's in trouble.

- He needs your help.
- Trouble? What did you do?

<i>(Layne)</i> Nothing, Feck.

429
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:27,407
He didn't exactly kill her,
it was an accident.

430
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:30,321
I killed a girl once. It was no accident.

431
00:41:30,912 --> 00:41:35,242
Put the gun right to the back of her head,
blew her brains right out the front.

432
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,285
I was in love.

433
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:41,626
- I strangled mine.
- Did you love her?

434
00:41:41,757 --> 00:41:44,164
- She was OK.
- OK, OK, Feck.

435
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:48,718
We've got to get John out of state.
Need your car.

436
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:51,765
You're not using my car.
You've got a car of your own.

437
00:41:51,892 --> 00:41:55,807
- Mine won't make it that far.
- No, I might need mine.

438
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:59,852
Feck, you haven't been
out of this house in over five years.

439
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,689
What if somebody sees it, then?

440
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,860
They're still after me.

441
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,651
You know that.

442
00:42:08,784 --> 00:42:11,454
They've been after me for 20 years.

443
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,455
I mean, you kill a person,
they don't let you forget.

444
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,960
They stick after you like ghosts.

445
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:25,212
I mean, they don't believe you
when you say you're sorry.

446
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:29,257
They want you to pay somehow.

447
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:31,428
OK, OK, OK. Uh, Feck.

448
00:42:31,557 --> 00:42:33,846
Forget the car.

449
00:42:33,977 --> 00:42:40,691
How about if John just stays here
while I go figure this thing out?

450
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:43,818
- Sure.
- OK, I'll be back.

451
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:49,188
John. I don't want you showing
your face outside this house.

452
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,740
Company.

453
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:00,501
Yeah. I...

454
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:02,538
I love company.

455
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:26,231
- <i>(Matt)</i> What are you staring at?
- You're involved in this murder.

456
00:43:26,363 --> 00:43:29,483
I didn't kill anybody, dammit.

457
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:33,318
- John did it. John wasted Jamie.
- You don't seem too concerned.

458
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:36,290
Well, what the hell do you know?

459
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,456
You don't know anything.

460
00:43:38,585 --> 00:43:43,128
Tim hasn't come home tonight. He's only
12 years old, Matt. It's past midnight.

461
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:46,008
Where do my children go at night?

462
00:43:49,638 --> 00:43:53,221
Put the car into gear, Mom. He's OK.

463
00:43:55,811 --> 00:44:00,224
Hey. I saw your friend on TV tonight.
I thought maybe I might catch you, too.

464
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:02,979
- Fuck off.
- Don't you two start.

465
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,360
Why? His best friend killed a girl.
That's big news.

466
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:11,150
I mean, he dumped her body and he
bragged about it all round school. Whoo!

467
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:14,986
- I'll bet you know where he's hiding.
- They haven't caught him?

468
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:19,914
Don't give me that phoney surprise shit.
Your punk friend's been calling all night.

469
00:44:20,044 --> 00:44:25,038
- What? He help you kill the poor girl?
- Maybe he did. Maybe I am a killer.

470
00:44:25,174 --> 00:44:29,503
Why should you care? You're just here
to fuck my mother and eat her food.

471
00:44:29,637 --> 00:44:31,795
- <i>(mother)</i> Matt!
- Oh, he moves.

472
00:44:31,931 --> 00:44:34,303
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Try something.

473
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:36,722
Motherfucker! Food-eater!

474
00:44:36,853 --> 00:44:39,640
- <i>(Jim)</i> I'm gonna shove that up your ass.
- Come on.

475
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:41,053
<i>(Jim)</i> Come on, hit me.

476
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,524
- Hit me.
- Come on. Come on.

477
00:44:44,652 --> 00:44:47,737
- Tough guy, huh? Show me how tough.
- You're not worth it.

478
00:44:47,864 --> 00:44:49,903
<i>(Matt)</i> Shit.

479
00:44:50,867 --> 00:44:52,906
Great.

480
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:03,832
He's still killing her.

481
00:45:18,562 --> 00:45:22,180
Come here. Come here!

482
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:28,773
- Why do you pull shit like that?
- Leave me alone.

483
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:31,741
Answer me. Answer me.

484
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:33,990
I didn't do anything.

485
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,987
- Fuck you!
- Answer me. Why? Why?

486
00:45:39,124 --> 00:45:41,996
Hey. Get off of him. Come on.

487
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:45,289
You dirty traitor.

488
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:48,093
- What do you mean by that?
- You know what I mean.

489
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:50,923
I saw you on that phone tonight.

490
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,627
<i>(Matt)</i> You keep your little mouth shut.

491
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:57,217
You're gonna pay for what you did.

492
00:45:57,352 --> 00:45:59,724
You're gonna die for what you did.

493
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:02,559
- You little shit.
- Hey.

494
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:05,937
- You're a dead man, Matt.
- <i>(Jim)</i> Hey!

495
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:10,488
Hey!

496
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:16,907
Hey, Timmy. Timmy.

497
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:23,076
Hey, where you going? Come on.

498
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:26,082
You let them both get away?

499
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:30,509
Madeleine, I got troubles of my own.
I don't want to fight your delinquent sons.

500
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:32,842
- You don't care.
- You're the mother.

501
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:36,056
I didn't give birth to the monsters.

502
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:03,414
My fucking brother. Go get your
nun-chucks and your dad's car.

503
00:47:03,544 --> 00:47:06,035
I know where we can get a gun.

504
00:47:18,852 --> 00:47:20,595
Matt.

505
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:25,816
Where the hell have you been?
I've been looking for you all night.

506
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:30,355
- We should have never let Mike in on it.
- It could have been anybody, Layne.

507
00:47:30,488 --> 00:47:35,067
Bullshit. I happen to know my friends,
fucking know them.

508
00:47:35,202 --> 00:47:37,871
I know who's cool and who's not.

509
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,743
Maybe John finked on himself.

510
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:46,454
And maybe you finked on him.
Be realistic. This is us we're talking about.

511
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:49,674
We're a fucking team.
We're like Starsky and Hutch.

512
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:53,336
- None of us would fuck it up on purpose.
- Where's John now?

513
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:57,765
Safely hidden away,
where he can't get in any trouble.

514
00:48:02,772 --> 00:48:06,640
No finer weed have you ever tasted.

515
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:12,313
My sister, she drives
this down from Humboldt,

516
00:48:13,408 --> 00:48:16,279
along with the regular Feck weed.

517
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,625
She comes to visit about once a year.

518
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:28,544
She's real fat.

519
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:32,623
You ought to see her,
she's like a goddamn hippopotamus.

520
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:34,588
John?

521
00:48:39,143 --> 00:48:41,182
Where are you?

522
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:43,681
John?

523
00:48:45,107 --> 00:48:46,934
Shit.

524
00:48:56,494 --> 00:48:59,163
Who's that?

525
00:48:59,288 --> 00:49:01,613
- Who's there?
- <i>(Layne)</i> The mad rapist.

526
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:03,576
Layne?

527
00:49:06,629 --> 00:49:09,713
John? Look, this isn't funny.

528
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,755
I'm getting scared here,
I'm about to scream.

529
00:49:21,936 --> 00:49:23,976
Have a heart attack.

530
00:49:24,105 --> 00:49:27,723
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Just came by to say hi.

531
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:31,442
- Some way of saying it.
- Hope I didn't wake you up.

532
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:34,738
Get dressed, come out here.
Bring all your money.

533
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:37,322
- What?
- Just do it.

534
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,285
- <i>(woman)</i> Clarissa? Is that you?
- Yes.

535
00:49:48,171 --> 00:49:50,211
Let's have it.

536
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,051
- Quarters?
- What do you expect?

537
00:49:55,178 --> 00:49:59,094
Waking me up in the middle of the night
and not telling me what's going on.

538
00:49:59,225 --> 00:50:01,681
What's going on?

539
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:05,310
2 dollars and money for gas.

540
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,891
One of us should get a job or something.

541
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:13,070
Are you coming, or what?
We've got to get Tony.

542
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:16,448
You're letting yourself
get jerked around again, girl.

543
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,579
It's Tony's dad.

544
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:33,919
Tony.

545
00:50:34,177 --> 00:50:36,336
Tony.

546
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:46,473
Shit!

547
00:50:55,073 --> 00:50:57,611
You should have stayed in bed.

548
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:07,665
<i>(engine splutters)</i>

549
00:51:15,845 --> 00:51:17,884
What a crazy fucking guy.

550
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:20,551
Tony's always broke anyhow.

551
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:27,436
Clarissa! Hey!

552
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:30,982
Bitchin'.

553
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:35,568
Go up here.

554
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:40,486
That's Feck's.

555
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:47,915
Park over there.

556
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,457
John.

557
00:51:57,721 --> 00:52:00,093
Oh, there you are.

558
00:52:00,223 --> 00:52:03,094
- I was getting worried.
- Look what I found.

559
00:52:03,226 --> 00:52:05,599
We could get it stoned.

560
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:10,972
- You got that special dope you promised?
- Yeah. Yeah, sit down.

561
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:16,907
You know, Layne said you weren't
supposed to leave till he come back.

562
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:20,616
Layne can be a little annoying sometimes.

563
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:23,117
He means well. Hey, look.

564
00:52:23,247 --> 00:52:25,205
- Hey!
- <i>(cat yowls)</i>

565
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,539
Don't do that, man.

566
00:52:27,669 --> 00:52:30,242
What's the matter? Is she allergic to cats?

567
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,419
Cats have claws.

568
00:52:33,925 --> 00:52:36,760
Come on. Go get that cat
and get it out of here, man.

569
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,546
No.

570
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,349
Let it explore.

571
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:47,723
You're really attached to this thing,
aren't you? I saw you two dancing.

572
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:49,599
Hey, Feck.

573
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:53,184
Are you... You know,
are you a psycho or something?

574
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,941
No, I'm normal.

575
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:59,572
She's a doll. I know that. Right, Ellie?

576
00:53:02,537 --> 00:53:07,199
But you, you killed a girl, right?
Are you a psycho?

577
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:10,418
Yeah, probably.

578
00:53:10,546 --> 00:53:13,215
What other excuse do I have?

579
00:53:19,346 --> 00:53:21,635
You were a biker.

580
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,805
Yeah, years ago.

581
00:53:26,061 --> 00:53:28,303
Man.

582
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:34,643
I ate so much pussy in those days,
my beard looked like a glazed doughnut.

583
00:53:35,696 --> 00:53:39,314
- Is that when you lost your leg?
- Motorcycle accident.

584
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,941
Whole gang ditched me...

585
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:44,284
kept on riding.

586
00:53:44,413 --> 00:53:48,625
My leg was right out
in the middle of the street.

587
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:53,497
I remember lying in the gutter,
all bleeding and shaking,

588
00:53:53,631 --> 00:53:57,214
staring at my leg, right next to a beer can.

589
00:53:57,343 --> 00:54:04,556
And I remember thinking, "That's my leg.
I wonder if there's any beer in that can."

590
00:54:05,977 --> 00:54:10,769
I also remember thinking,
"Maybe they can sew that leg back on."

591
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:14,767
And then there comes the ambulance
and runs right over all of it.

592
00:54:14,904 --> 00:54:20,776
- Wasted that leg.
- What'd I need it for? I got another one.

593
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:26,699
I figure once you start fighting,
you're always defending yourself.

594
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:31,789
Me, I get in a fight,
I go fucking crazy, you know?

595
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:35,420
Everything goes black.
And then I fucking explode, you know?

596
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:40,793
Like it's the end of the world. Who cares
if this guy wastes me? I'll waste him first.

597
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:45,888
The whole world's gonna blow up
anyway. I might as well keep my pride.

598
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:48,475
I got this philosophy.

599
00:54:49,522 --> 00:54:53,187
You do shit, and it's done...

600
00:54:54,277 --> 00:54:56,317
and then you die.

601
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:03,198
You got any more beer?

602
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:07,286
Shit. What time is it? Is it two yet?

603
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:10,416
- It's creeping up.
- Fuck, man. Time for a beer run.

604
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:13,082
Does that car of yours work?

605
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:18,671
You're not supposed to go anywhere.
Layne said...

606
00:55:18,802 --> 00:55:20,344
Layne, Layne, Layne.

607
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,926
You go. I'll stay here.

608
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:26,223
I'll be a good boy. Come on, Feck.

609
00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:32,305
There are people out there who would
like to see me dead, and I've told you that.

610
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:35,644
So who buys your groceries for you?
Ellie?

611
00:55:35,778 --> 00:55:36,976
<i>(rattle)</i>

612
00:55:37,112 --> 00:55:40,695
That. Did you hear that? Huh?

613
00:55:40,824 --> 00:55:43,660
Get paranoid, why don't you?

614
00:55:43,786 --> 00:55:45,695
No. No. Out front.

615
00:55:53,003 --> 00:55:56,704
- You didn't have to call me a stupid bitch.
- You would have driven past us.

616
00:55:56,841 --> 00:56:00,007
- We had to yell something.
- You yelled it.

617
00:56:00,136 --> 00:56:03,172
I've got a name.
You're lucky I didn't just drive home.

618
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:06,509
OK, OK, OK, I'm sorry, <i>Clarissa.</i>

619
00:56:06,642 --> 00:56:11,388
But you've got to understand that at a time
like this, where every second counts,

620
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:14,440
a man can't waste his time
choosing words.

621
00:56:14,567 --> 00:56:18,102
- What is this, <i>Mission: Lmpossible?</i>
- <i>(Matt hums theme)</i>

622
00:56:18,237 --> 00:56:22,735
- I don't even see why you need us here.
- OK, it's not like I need you here,

623
00:56:22,868 --> 00:56:25,276
like, physically need you here.

624
00:56:25,412 --> 00:56:28,781
I mean, I can drive, I can collect money,

625
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:32,202
but we're a gang,
and I need you here, you know?

626
00:56:32,336 --> 00:56:35,788
Shut up. Would you shut up back there?

627
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:41,050
I feel real twisted now. Like I should go
to the cops and tell them where John is.

628
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:44,547
I wouldn't even joke about that, Clarissa.

629
00:56:44,682 --> 00:56:48,265
What would you do? Kill me?
You'd love that, I bet.

630
00:56:48,394 --> 00:56:51,099
You and John could run off
and be outlaws together.

631
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:57,185
But first, to show off, strap my body to
the top of this car and drive all over town.

632
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,695
Get... out.

633
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:04,195
What?

634
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:08,277
You don't understand
a goddamn thing, do you?

635
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:13,332
Jamie is dead, dammit.

636
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:17,874
And there's nothing that we can do to
save her. Now, I happened to like Jamie.

637
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:21,044
But John is still alive.

638
00:57:21,177 --> 00:57:23,300
Don't you see that?

639
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:25,719
And who's next on his list?

640
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:33,730
You're just gonna leave me here?

641
00:57:33,857 --> 00:57:36,146
What if John's around?

642
00:57:36,276 --> 00:57:38,684
Ask him to forgive you.

643
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:43,032
Here. Here's your money.
We don't need this shit.

644
00:57:46,203 --> 00:57:50,070
- We can't just leave her alone like this.
- OK.

645
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:51,998
Fuck.

646
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:56,123
You stay here, and you protect her.

647
00:57:57,131 --> 00:58:01,211
I should have known that I was
the only one who could handle a crisis.

648
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:04,214
You want your money back, too?

649
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:06,386
Keep my money, Layne.

650
00:58:24,575 --> 00:58:28,359
- What's with you?
- I don't know. I figured I'd walk you home.

651
00:58:28,496 --> 00:58:30,535
I can make it on my own.

652
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,081
Well, come, if you're gonna come.

653
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:42,753
You want my coat or something?
You look kinda cold.

654
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:44,879
No, I'm OK.

655
00:58:45,014 --> 00:58:48,714
- You agree with him, don't you?
- Layne? Not really.

656
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:53,596
You probably do. Everybody goes along
with him, like he has some special power.

657
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:56,187
I think he's totally wrong.

658
00:58:56,317 --> 00:59:00,646
- Layne brags about me, doesn't he?
- What do you mean?

659
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:06,023
About getting me. I know he does,
so don't even say he doesn't.

660
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:09,956
- Doesn't he?
- Not to me.

661
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,741
You look kinda cute
when you lie, you know?

662
00:59:13,876 --> 00:59:16,284
What?

663
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:19,955
You should see him when no one's
around and he's alone with me,

664
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:22,582
and he thinks he might get lucky.

665
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:27,262
Shakes like a leaf.
Always has to be drunk, too.

666
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:32,930
He's like <i>Layne - Portrait of a Teenage</i>
<i>Alcoholic.</i> They could make a movie.

667
00:59:35,732 --> 00:59:39,860
Do you have to be drunk
before you can kiss a girl?

668
00:59:41,613 --> 00:59:43,652
Wait here.

669
00:59:50,622 --> 00:59:53,706
- <i>(woman)</i> Clarissa, is that you?
- Yes.

670
01:00:07,097 --> 01:00:13,301
I'm too hyped up to sleep. Let's go to the
park and look at the stars or something.

671
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:23,314
We'll pick up a sixer on the way.

672
01:00:29,745 --> 01:00:31,785
<i>(car approaches)</i>

673
01:00:55,606 --> 01:00:58,690
<i>(Layne)</i> Come on, goddammit.

674
01:00:58,817 --> 01:01:01,273
I know you're in there.

675
01:01:17,712 --> 01:01:19,835
Those assholes!

676
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:24,673
- Evening.
- Sorry, the bar's closed.

677
01:01:24,802 --> 01:01:28,503
- Why?
- It's five after two, man.

678
01:01:32,352 --> 01:01:35,139
- Hi, John.
- Hey, Matt.

679
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:39,020
Is this guy giving you any trouble?
You giving my friend trouble?

680
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,982
I cannot sell you guys beer
after two o'clock in the morning.

681
01:01:43,112 --> 01:01:46,861
I'm here to turn back the time.
Matt, take your beer and leave.

682
01:01:46,991 --> 01:01:49,992
- Look, John, it's not that...
- Do it.

683
01:01:51,663 --> 01:01:53,869
Thanks.

684
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:57,831
Hey, you got any Bud in bottles?

685
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:02,211
- I told you he's crazy.
- Just keep moving.

686
01:02:07,888 --> 01:02:10,379
Fuck you, then.

687
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:12,971
You want to get caught,
want to fucking fry,

688
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:15,427
go ahead, treat your friends this way.

689
01:02:15,562 --> 01:02:18,100
Talk about speeding out.

690
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:29,026
Yeah.

691
01:02:32,496 --> 01:02:34,536
Find the gun.

692
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,026
Fucking shit!

693
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:09,529
Moko. Come here.

694
01:03:13,872 --> 01:03:17,407
- <i>(breaking glass)</i>
- <i>(alarm)</i>

695
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:48,359
Now we'll see if that gun
of yours still works.

696
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:53,568
You know, you're a crazy motherfucker,
you know that?

697
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:59,459
- You want a beer?
- You trying to get me drunk, Matt?

698
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:07,464
- I wish it was me who narked.
- What?

699
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:14,131
Who narked on John. And I don't even
care if you tell anybody what I just said.

700
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,636
But don't tell anybody what I just said.

701
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:26,768
I mean, I respect the person who narked.
You know, even if it was Mike.

702
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:29,574
Especially if it was Mike.

703
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:34,740
- It wasn't Mike.
- How do you know? Was it you?

704
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:40,783
It <i>was</i> you.

705
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:45,712
I didn't think I'd be the only one.
Don't tell Layne.

706
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:49,506
Of course I won't. God, weren't
you scared of people finding out?

707
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,795
Yeah.

708
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:57,174
But I kept seeing her face, Clarissa.
Didn't you keep seeing her face?

709
01:04:57,312 --> 01:05:00,811
I mean, it affected me. Didn't it affect you?

710
01:05:00,941 --> 01:05:02,483
It did.

711
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:05,100
I mean, we knew Jamie, right?

712
01:05:05,237 --> 01:05:08,736
And there she is, dead,
right there in front of us.

713
01:05:08,865 --> 01:05:13,942
And even that close, we don't
even feel like we've lost anything.

714
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:18,124
At least, I didn't. That got me the most.

715
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,622
I couldn't even cry for her, Matt.

716
01:05:21,128 --> 01:05:24,828
I mean, I cried when that guy
in <i>Brian's Song</i> died.

717
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:29,544
You'd at least figure I'd be able to cry
for someone we hung around with.

718
01:05:29,678 --> 01:05:32,798
It'll hit us. I know it will.

719
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:35,601
Probably at her funeral.

720
01:05:35,726 --> 01:05:40,471
Sometimes I think
it'd be a lot easier being dead.

721
01:05:41,899 --> 01:05:46,526
Ah, that's bullshit.
You couldn't get stoned any more.

722
01:05:47,488 --> 01:05:50,157
I hear it's the same sensation.

723
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:55,992
I like you.

724
01:06:21,564 --> 01:06:23,142
OK.

725
01:06:23,274 --> 01:06:26,145
OK, OK, OK, OK.

726
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:29,860
I'm gonna take care of you, Toulette.
I'm gonna find you.

727
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:33,822
Someone's gotta take care of you.
I'm gonna take care of you, OK?

728
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:41,281
Dammit, John, where the fuck are you?

729
01:06:53,555 --> 01:06:56,011
Hey, Ellie don't drink.

730
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:00,510
- She does something with this mouth.
- Ellie's a nice girl.

731
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:02,685
I'm sure she is.

732
01:07:02,815 --> 01:07:05,306
Like, real nice.

733
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:09,311
Let's see what kind of tricks
she knows here, huh?

734
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:12,816
Oh, yeah, baby. That's nice.
Oh, that is real nice.

735
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:16,699
Would you please not do that, John?

736
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,535
Oh, baby, not so quick,
you're making me hot.

737
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:23,117
Please, John. Stop that.

738
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:27,666
Oh, oh... Oh, baby, baby, baby,
baby, baby, baby...

739
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:30,634
Please! <i>(echoes)</i>

01:07:33,931 --> 01:07:35,508

You hear that?

- No, you eat me, asshole.

You shut up.

01:08:10,926 --> 01:08:13,418
Yeah?

01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:15,179
Call 'em.

751
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:18,549
You better settle down, John.

752
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:20,558
You try it.

753
01:08:20,686 --> 01:08:24,815
I better not. You come here,

754
01:08:24,941 --> 01:08:27,514
We don't want to attract attention, man.

755
01:08:27,652 --> 01:08:30,819
Come on, Feck. Fire your gun.

756
01:08:30,947 --> 01:08:34,565
Bet you haven't fired it in years.

757
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:39,363
It's not something that
I just shoot off, without reason.

758
01:08:39,497 --> 01:08:41,490
Why not?

759
01:08:45,086 --> 01:08:48,253
It's got a sentimental value.

760
01:08:55,096 --> 01:08:58,762
Is this the gun you wasted the chick with?

761
01:08:58,892 --> 01:09:00,635
Huh?

762
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:04,303
It is.

763
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:06,977
I bet you look back with pride, huh?

764
01:09:09,277 --> 01:09:11,519
It's something I did.

765
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:16,197
You wanted to show her who was boss.

766
01:09:16,703 --> 01:09:19,657
I don't know if you can understand.

767
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:24,240
I loved her.

768
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:27,627
So why'd you kill her?
Did she tell you to eat shit?

769
01:09:27,756 --> 01:09:31,456
No. No.

770
01:09:31,593 --> 01:09:35,293
Come on, Feck, I'm with you.
Man, I killed a girl, too.

771
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,965
I wanted to show the world who's boss.

772
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:41,725
What's that?

773
01:09:41,853 --> 01:09:44,391
It's nothing. Close your ears.

774
01:09:46,233 --> 01:09:48,902
<i>(Feck) You better give me the gun, John.</i>

775
01:09:52,781 --> 01:09:55,568
I didn't need no gun.

776
01:09:56,243 --> 01:09:58,615
I did mine with my hands.

777
01:09:58,745 --> 01:10:03,123
I was right there, I was right on top of her,
I was face to face.

778
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:07,705
<i>I wasn't even mad, really.</i>

779
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:10,543
<i>She didn't look too surprised.</i>

780
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:12,714
<i>Just a little stoned.</i>

781
01:10:14,261 --> 01:10:16,384
<i>After a few minutes,</i>

782
01:10:16,514 --> 01:10:22,469
<i>her face puffed out and it turned</i>
<i>dark purple and she just stared at me.</i>

783
01:10:23,938 --> 01:10:26,643
<i>She couldn't move.</i>

784
01:10:26,774 --> 01:10:29,561
<i>She couldn't scream.</i>

785
01:10:29,694 --> 01:10:33,691
<i>I had total control of her.</i>

786
01:10:39,495 --> 01:10:42,911
<i>I had total control of her.</i>

787
01:10:47,045 --> 01:10:49,500
<i>It all felt so real.</i>

788
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:53,213
It felt so... real.

789
01:10:54,219 --> 01:11:00,553
She was dead, there, in front of me,
and I felt so fucking alive!

790
01:11:06,481 --> 01:11:09,482
Is that how you felt, Feck?

791
01:11:10,694 --> 01:11:12,817
Not quite, man.

792
01:11:21,288 --> 01:11:23,328
Funny thing is...

793
01:11:25,376 --> 01:11:27,416
I'm dead now.

794
01:11:29,589 --> 01:11:33,373
- They're gonna fry me for sure.
- Ah, don't say that.

795
01:11:33,509 --> 01:11:35,632
Layne's gonna help you out.

796
01:11:35,762 --> 01:11:37,801
Layne?

797
01:11:39,307 --> 01:11:42,178
What the fuck...
Layne's gonna send me to Portland,

798
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:45,560
and hide me out in some
dark room for 20 years.

799
01:11:45,689 --> 01:11:48,180
So I end up like you, Feck.

800
01:11:50,694 --> 01:11:53,564
You think I want that?

801
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:57,942
No.

802
01:11:58,076 --> 01:12:00,152
You don't.

803
01:12:02,372 --> 01:12:06,073
Layne was never really a friend, anyway.

804
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:09,208
He doesn't even know me.

805
01:12:24,561 --> 01:12:26,969
I'll be your friend.

806
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,280
I like you.

807
01:12:41,787 --> 01:12:44,907
- I'm glad we decided to go against Layne.
- Mm-hm.

808
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:49,501
Sometimes I feel like
I don't even know him any more.

809
01:12:56,969 --> 01:13:00,220
He's lost. Let's get some sleep.

810
01:14:16,468 --> 01:14:19,220
You weren't supposed to get old.

811
01:14:25,435 --> 01:14:27,594
Oh, God.

812
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:18,569
<i>(gunshot)</i>

813
01:15:31,586 --> 01:15:33,625
<i>(door opens)</i>

814
01:16:19,803 --> 01:16:21,546
Hit him again.

815
01:17:19,572 --> 01:17:21,611
I'm awake, I'm awake.

816
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:24,279
Oh, fuck.

817
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,035
Hi.

818
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,706
Can you tell us anything
about the murder?

819
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:36,038
- Are you the killer?
- What?

820
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:41,418
Don't I even get a fucking phone call?

821
01:17:59,363 --> 01:18:04,109
- So now we get married, right?
- No. Let's get stoned instead.

822
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:06,283
Ah, that'd be great.

823
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:10,741
I could just lie here all day,
cut school and soak up the rays.

824
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:13,580
Shit, school.

825
01:18:13,711 --> 01:18:17,626
I really shouldn't miss Burkewaite's class.

826
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,048
You really have the hots
for that guy, don't you?

827
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:26,054
No.

828
01:18:26,182 --> 01:18:27,807
I just...

829
01:18:27,934 --> 01:18:32,014
- I don't know, respect him.
- You respect an adult?

830
01:18:32,147 --> 01:18:34,186
I really do need to get stoned.

831
01:18:34,315 --> 01:18:38,977
We'll stop at my house on the way to
school. I think I have some Feck weed left.

832
01:18:39,112 --> 01:18:42,979
I feel like someone
dipped me in used cooking oil.

833
01:18:43,116 --> 01:18:45,322
We could take a shower.

834
01:18:45,452 --> 01:18:48,951
I mean, you could, you know. By yourself.

835
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,660
No.

836
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:57,040
<i>(mother)</i> What am I supposed to do, then?
What am I supposed to do with him?

837
01:18:57,172 --> 01:19:02,249
- Look, if it's gonna be a hassle...
- No, no hassle. OK? No hassle.

838
01:19:02,386 --> 01:19:04,509
Be right back, OK?

839
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:11,135
<i>(Jim)</i> You're supposed to raise him right.
The both of them. Control them.

840
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:15,979
<i>(mother)</i> That easy? Just tell 'em what
to do, tell 'em what not to do. Perfect kids.

841
01:19:16,108 --> 01:19:19,062
<i>(Jim)</i> It's not impossible.
My father raised me right.

842
01:19:19,194 --> 01:19:24,569
- Your father beat the shit outta you.
- So what? Huh? It'd make 'em listen.

843
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,906
Big fucking talk.

844
01:19:28,078 --> 01:19:29,905
Matt.

845
01:19:34,668 --> 01:19:36,495
Matt?

846
01:19:40,466 --> 01:19:41,960
<i>(knocks at door)</i>

847
01:19:42,093 --> 01:19:46,589
- I'm upset, Matt.
- Kick that idiot outta the house, then.

848
01:19:46,722 --> 01:19:50,091
Suppose I just kick you outta the house?

849
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,604
Tim didn't come home last night.

850
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,269
- Did you hear me?
- You got any spare dope?

851
01:20:01,405 --> 01:20:05,818
Oh, shit, I don't believe this.
Your little brother.

852
01:20:05,951 --> 01:20:11,028
He's 12 years old. He hasn't come home,
hasn't called. God knows what he's doing.

853
01:20:11,165 --> 01:20:14,664
What am I supposed to do?
I'm not his mother.

854
01:20:14,794 --> 01:20:18,661
Then I'm not his mother either.
I am nobody's mother.

855
01:20:18,798 --> 01:20:24,172
I give up this mother bullshit, it's not
worth it. You were all mistakes anyway.

856
01:20:24,303 --> 01:20:26,011
Don't give up, Mommy.

857
01:20:26,138 --> 01:20:29,092
I'm gonna leave you all,
just like your father did.

858
01:20:29,225 --> 01:20:31,798
Jesus, Ma, settle down, OK?

859
01:20:31,936 --> 01:20:33,478
Tim's all right.

860
01:20:33,688 --> 01:20:37,816
Look, everything's just a little crazy now,
a little outta control, OK?

861
01:20:37,942 --> 01:20:42,604
Look, I got somebody waiting outside
for me, I'm in a rush. We'll talk later.

862
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:49,157
I'm gonna take this joint. And don't
worry about Tim, OK? I'll get him home.

863
01:21:11,435 --> 01:21:14,886
Yeah, it really shocked me.
I think killing is wrong.

864
01:21:15,021 --> 01:21:18,355
<i>(woman)</i> What about all those people
going to see the body?

865
01:21:18,483 --> 01:21:22,018
That shocked me too.
I think they should have arrested John.

866
01:21:22,154 --> 01:21:24,859
- John?
- Well, he killed Jamie.

867
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:27,066
- You knew the killer?
- Yeah.

868
01:21:27,201 --> 01:21:29,905
You know, we both kinda knew the killer.

869
01:21:30,037 --> 01:21:34,200
As well as, um, in addition to,
you know, who he killed, too.

870
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:38,378
I mean, because of that,
it's pretty hard for us to be, um...

871
01:21:38,504 --> 01:21:41,707
- Objective?
- Yeah, that's it, objective.

872
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,838
You know, since we knew the two
alleged people involved and everything.

873
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:49,173
And whereas we might be upset
this morning or something,

874
01:21:49,306 --> 01:21:53,304
you know, we're not, because of
the fact that we're not objective at all.

875
01:21:53,436 --> 01:21:55,927
I also play guitar, by the way.

876
01:21:56,063 --> 01:21:58,815
- You don't even know what a friend is.
- I'm tired.

877
01:21:58,941 --> 01:22:01,812
- You call Samson a friend?
- Don't I get a phone call?

878
01:22:01,944 --> 01:22:04,696
Enough of a friend to cover up for?

879
01:22:04,822 --> 01:22:09,319
Help him hide the body. Maybe...
maybe even help him kill the poor girl.

880
01:22:09,453 --> 01:22:12,323
I didn't kill nobody.

881
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:17,704
Did he tell you why he did it?

882
01:22:18,837 --> 01:22:21,589
Weren't you even curious?

883
01:22:21,715 --> 01:22:23,922
Did you even give a flying fuck?

884
01:22:24,051 --> 01:22:29,390
These are stupid questions. I know
my rights. I know I get a phone call.

885
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:34,391
You don't have any rights just yet, Layne.
We haven't arrested you.

886
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,272
Great. See you.

887
01:22:37,398 --> 01:22:39,521
OK.

888
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:42,106
OK. OK.

889
01:22:42,945 --> 01:22:45,271
Go. Make your phone call.

890
01:22:46,365 --> 01:22:49,532
Go call one of your precious friends.

891
01:23:14,102 --> 01:23:18,515
- I asked you a question.
- I didn't know her, OK?

892
01:23:18,648 --> 01:23:21,768
I just want to say,
it was horrible what those kids did.

893
01:23:21,902 --> 01:23:26,979
And the incident points up a fundamental
moral breakdown in our society.

894
01:23:27,115 --> 01:23:32,489
Thank you, Kevin, for your
insightful self-righteous indignation.

895
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:38,624
- I'd still like to hear from Tom.
- Just quit staring at me like that, man.

896
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:45,790
- Clarissa.
- Sorry I'm late.

897
01:23:45,926 --> 01:23:49,924
You knew Jamie, right?
You were one of her friends.

898
01:23:50,055 --> 01:23:52,842
Describe to us how you remember her.

899
01:23:53,392 --> 01:23:55,183
Remember her?

900
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:59,558
Yeah, what she looked like.
What she meant to you.

901
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:04,233
You're bullshit. What gives you the right
to put Clarissa on the spot like that?

902
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:07,398
I mean, she's upset, man.
Her friend is dead.

903
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:10,283
Are you upset, Clarissa?

904
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:14,905
Are you? I mean, if you are,
come on, let's get it off your chest.

905
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:17,613
Fuck you.
Why don't you just leave her alone?

906
01:24:17,751 --> 01:24:20,324
No, fuck you, man.

907
01:24:20,462 --> 01:24:22,704
Because I don't buy it.

908
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,999
You don't give a damn.

909
01:24:26,134 --> 01:24:30,843
I don't give a damn. Nobody in this
classroom gives a damn that she is dead.

910
01:24:30,973 --> 01:24:33,642
It gives us a chance to feel superior,

911
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:37,635
and to point up a fundamental
moral breakdown in society,

912
01:24:37,771 --> 01:24:41,390
but it doesn't really affect us, does it?

913
01:24:41,525 --> 01:24:46,318
Because if it did, none of us would
be in this classroom right now.

914
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:50,943
We'd be out on the street,
half-crazy from lack of sleep,

915
01:24:51,077 --> 01:24:53,615
hunting down Samson Toulette
with a gun.

916
01:24:53,746 --> 01:24:57,613
- That's a reprehensible attitude.
- Just shut up, Kevin.

917
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:01,333
Are we gonna be tested on this shit?

918
01:25:28,531 --> 01:25:31,022
<i>(bell)</i>

919
01:25:51,722 --> 01:25:56,633
It's gonna be like this all day. Teachers
lecturing us about what monsters we are.

920
01:25:56,768 --> 01:26:02,225
- I can't handle much more.
- I say we split. Got just the place, too.

921
01:26:03,275 --> 01:26:06,395
Come on, Clarissa.
We're taking the day off.

922
01:26:10,616 --> 01:26:12,655
<i>(phone rings)</i>

923
01:26:26,842 --> 01:26:30,376
- Cheque... cheque's in the mail.
- Feck.

924
01:26:30,512 --> 01:26:35,008
Where the hell have you been?
Where's John?

925
01:26:35,142 --> 01:26:36,933
John.

926
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,302
He's gone.

927
01:26:39,438 --> 01:26:41,893
He's gone to the river.

928
01:26:43,692 --> 01:26:46,978
- I'm dying.
- Put your hands up!

929
01:26:47,112 --> 01:26:49,152
Company.

930
01:26:51,575 --> 01:26:54,742
<i>(policeman) Hello? Hello, who is this?</i>

931
01:27:28,905 --> 01:27:32,440
<i>(Tony)</i> This just blows my mind, man.
We're celebrities.

932
01:27:32,575 --> 01:27:35,991
- Just what you always wanted, huh?
- Well, it's a start.

933
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,790
They're having an open casket
funeral for Jamie.

934
01:27:38,915 --> 01:27:42,865
- <i>(girl)</i> That's gross.
- I know. I think it's in bad taste.

935
01:27:43,002 --> 01:27:45,244
<i>(Tony)</i> This entire episode is in bad taste.

936
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,045
Young people are a disgrace
to the human race. To all living things.

937
01:27:49,175 --> 01:27:53,884
To plants, even. You shouldn't even
be seen in the same room as a cactus.

938
01:27:54,014 --> 01:27:56,090
What's that?

939
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:02,478
- Shit.
- Oh, my God. Not again.

940
01:28:02,606 --> 01:28:04,847
- Is it dead?
- It's a dummy.

941
01:28:05,358 --> 01:28:08,276
I'm getting outta here.
I told you this was stupid.

942
01:28:08,403 --> 01:28:10,443
No, no, no, hold it.

943
01:28:12,115 --> 01:28:16,409
What are you doing? Don't throw rocks,
it's a person. Maybe it's still alive.

944
01:28:16,536 --> 01:28:18,328
- No, it's Ellie.
- Ellie?

945
01:28:18,455 --> 01:28:21,029
- It's a sex doll.
- Who's Ellie?

946
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:26,161
That's Ellie. Feck's girlfriend.
I wonder what she's doing here?

947
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:52,778
<i>(Tony)</i> It's just, like, you gotta make
the best of it while we're still alive,

948
01:28:52,908 --> 01:28:55,233
because any day now, boom!
And we're dead.

949
01:28:55,369 --> 01:28:58,488
- You want to know what I think?
- No, Mike.

950
01:28:58,622 --> 01:29:04,043
Somebody could murder you, you know.
Or Russia could send over nuclear bombs.

951
01:29:04,169 --> 01:29:09,543
I say we just get the Russians stoned.
It might mellow 'em out a touch.

952
01:29:10,551 --> 01:29:13,386
- Where's John?
- What?

953
01:29:13,512 --> 01:29:16,679
Forget about John. God.
Would you just forget about him?

954
01:29:16,807 --> 01:29:21,019
- I should kick your ass right here.
- What did I do?

955
01:29:24,774 --> 01:29:27,099
Leave me alone.

956
01:29:27,651 --> 01:29:32,148
You don't know what's going on.
None of you know what's going on.

957
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:34,570
I'll find him myself.

958
01:29:40,206 --> 01:29:42,412
- Layne?
- John!

959
01:29:42,542 --> 01:29:45,459
You've been awake all night
searching for the asshole.

960
01:29:45,586 --> 01:29:47,959
He's not an asshole.

961
01:29:48,089 --> 01:29:52,217
He's an asshole. He doesn't give a shit
about anything. His friends, himself.

962
01:29:52,343 --> 01:29:57,052
He doesn't care if he dies.
Can't you see? Would you listen to me?

963
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:59,507
I know you don't care
about him that much.

964
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:03,806
- You know that?
- I fucking know you, Layne.

965
01:30:03,938 --> 01:30:07,438
You get these ideas in your head
and you don't think.

966
01:30:07,567 --> 01:30:11,399
And this idea of helping John out,
it's not a good idea.

967
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:14,067
You have a better idea?

968
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:16,322
Yeah.

969
01:30:16,451 --> 01:30:19,369
Turn him in.

970
01:30:19,496 --> 01:30:22,248
You <i>would</i> do that, wouldn't you?

971
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:24,415
I did.

972
01:30:26,044 --> 01:30:28,831
You should finish the job, Layne.

973
01:30:28,964 --> 01:30:33,425
- I should kill you for even saying that.
- You're talking shit and you know it.

974
01:30:33,552 --> 01:30:36,837
You turn on us so easily.

975
01:30:36,972 --> 01:30:40,756
I thought you were a fucking friend.

976
01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:44,594
I knew that me and John
were alone all along.

977
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:46,770
- Layne.
- Let him go.

978
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,902
What's with him?

979
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,238
He's upset.

980
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,906
John.

981
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:07,124
John.

982
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:09,415
John.

983
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,377
John.

986
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,875
You shouldn't have hit me.

987
01:31:56,637 --> 01:32:00,717
- Don't be stupid, Tim.
- You finked on John.

988
01:32:01,476 --> 01:32:04,049
I'm your brother. Give me the gun.

989
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:12,349
Look. I'm sorry I hurt you, OK?
I was upset.

990
01:32:12,487 --> 01:32:14,610
Now give me the gun, OK?

991
01:32:18,117 --> 01:32:20,157
Goddammit, Tim.

992
01:32:21,621 --> 01:32:23,661
I'm your brother.

993
01:32:40,807 --> 01:32:42,847
Come on.

994
01:32:56,491 --> 01:32:59,029
They fucking killed him.

995
01:33:16,511 --> 01:33:18,551
They killed him.

996
01:33:21,016 --> 01:33:24,136
Because there was no hope for him.

997
01:33:24,269 --> 01:33:26,974
There was no hope at all.

998
01:33:28,523 --> 01:33:30,563
He didn't love her.

999
01:33:31,568 --> 01:33:34,273
He didn't feel a thing.

1000
01:33:37,825 --> 01:33:39,864
I, uh...

1001
01:33:41,495 --> 01:33:44,330
at least loved her.

1002
01:33:44,456 --> 01:33:46,496
I cared for her.

1003
01:33:47,835 --> 01:33:51,500
I mean... You understand, don't you?

1004
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,339
Sure you do.

1005
01:33:58,804 --> 01:34:02,339
I don't, uh, like killing people.

1006
01:34:04,977 --> 01:34:07,646
But sometimes it's necessary.

1007
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:15,402
That's enough for now.

1008
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:17,403
I...

1009
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:21,326
I'd like you all to leave now.

1010
01:34:23,913 --> 01:34:27,199
I'm very tired, and sort of depressed.

1011
01:34:31,588 --> 01:34:34,672
I lost a good friend today, you know?
