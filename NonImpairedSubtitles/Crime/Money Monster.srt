Good. Because it's about
to get complicated,

you could walk into your bank,
and they'd open a vault

We did it to make it go faster.

Okay, so Ibis took a beating yesterday,

763
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,197
First, we save the hostages.
Second, we take out the psycho.

764
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,912
Okay, we're here.
Just, uh, give us a minute to get set up.

765
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,275
PATTY: (OVER PA)
We've got Ron. I'm putting him up.

766
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,390
Okay, here we go.

767
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,392
We've got Ron Sprecher
reporting from outside...

768
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,073
YAO: As if this month
couldn't get any worse.

769
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,674
Ron, Ron, can you hear us?

770
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,559
I'm here outside Ibis Clear Capital,
where their CEO...

771
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,235
Security, there's a man down there
with a camera crew.

772
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,596
Make sure he doesn't get in the building
under any circumstances.

773
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,194
What did Teterboro say, Marta?

774
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,160
MARTA: I gave them the tail numbers
of both of these planes,

775
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,674
no communication with either.

776
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,279
Okay, I'm gonna down there
and try and buy us some time.

777
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,317
I mean, obviously,
this guy just wants some answers.

778
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,356
GOODLOE: So do we.

779
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,751
If we knew how we lost $800 million,
we wouldn't have lost $800 million.

780
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,230
I get that, Avery,
but we still have to say something.

781
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,160
Come on. You know Walt. He's an open book.
I know if he was here...

782
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,311
But he's not here, Diane. He's not here.

783
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,837
Okay, we can't just lock ourselves away
here and do nothing and hope it disappears.

784
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,115
We are a publicly-traded company.

785
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,157
We've got shareholders.
We've got a board of directors

786
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,631
and we've got a CEO, even though
we don't know where he is right now.

787
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,558
So, look,
I'm happy to have this conversation again

788
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,712
when Walt lands,
but until then, it's not our call to make.

789
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,309
(RON CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV)

790
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,715
A-TEAM LEADER: So, he's got
the stage all locked up.

791
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,076
These are the exits, front and rear.

792
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,310
Now, the problem is,

793
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,154
this guy's got complete range of vision
throughout the entire studio.

794
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,915
So our only chance for a clean shot

795
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,719
is from these catwalks above the stage.

796
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,757
We're putting a man in position there
as we speak.

797
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,910
What about the bomb?

798
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,231
This is definitely a dead man's switch
here in his hand,

799
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,757
which means, if you take him out
without disarming the bomb first... Kaboom.

800
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,071
Got the warrant, got an address.
Sending a patrol there now.

801
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,150
Great.

802
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,431
You see this bulge right here?
That's the wireless receiver.

803
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,920
Now, Captain, if we can destroy that,

804
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,356
then the dead man's switch
is just another fucking switch.

805
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,434
Except, in order to destroy it,
we got to what, shoot Gates?

806
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,194
That's where this guy slipped up.

807
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,589
If he wanted to ensure a kill shot,

808
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,673
he should've put the receiver here,
right over the poor bastard's heart.

809
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,270
But instead, he put it down here
next to his left kidney.

810
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,276
If the bullet's on target, we get to him
quick enough to avoid too much blood loss,

811
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,113
there's a good chance, Captain,
he could survive it.

812
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,316
I'm sorry.

813
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,710
Are you proposing
we shoot the star of a TV show

814
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,269

of millions of people?

815

Yeah.

RON: I need you to talk to somebody
from Ibis Clear Capital.

817
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,679

- (GUARD PROTESTING)

- Andre? It's okay.

819
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,791
- That's, that's, uh...
- Diane Lester. I'll be happy to talk to you.

820
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,473
DIANE: Do you have an earpiece
so I can hear everyone?

821
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,630

- LEE: Okay, good.

822
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,836
- Come on.
- All right.

823
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,516
Uh, we're gonna talk to Diane Lester.
She's the PR lady. She's the, uh...

...Chief Communications Officer at Ibis.
Diane?

826
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,830
Okay, get ready to put her on screen two.
We're gonna put her on screen two.

827
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,030
LEE: We're ready when you are.

828
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,440
PATTY: And go, Jim.

829
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,354
- Here she comes.
- All right.

830
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,875
First, let me start off by saying

831
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,520
on behalf of everyone here at Ibis,

832
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,634
we are prepared to do whatever we can to
get you to put down that gun, Mr. Budwell.

833
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,393
Now, I understand that
you've offered to compensate him

834
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,233
for his losses personally, Lee.

835
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,076
Well, we are absolutely willing to do the
same if it helps put an end to all this.

836
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,717
All right, you walk away now,
double your money.

837
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,314
She knows my last name.

838
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,475
Everybody in the five boroughs
knows your last name by now, Kyle.

839
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,430
Uh...

840
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,398
No, it's too late for your money, lady.

841
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,314
All I want from you is an answer.
I just wanna know what really happened?

842
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,631
Oh, goddamn it!

843
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,639
DIANE: Well, the truth is

844
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,039
- we don't know.
- (CELLPHONE VIBRATING)

845
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,840
We don't know why the algo
suddenly went haywire.

846
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,032
And we don't know why the fail-safes
built to prevent...

847
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,715
PATTY: God, I really hope she has
more to say than "We don't know."

848
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,679
We just don't know.

849
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,594
PATTY: Are you kidding?
This is all she's got? Are you kidding me?

Sacajawea.

851
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,035
Fine.

852
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,033
Are you watching this?
This is getting out of control.

853
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,635
The amount of scrutiny we're gonna get
after this idiot blows himself up

854
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,552
is going to be unbelievable.

855
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,474
You thought it was bad before?
It's about to get 100 times more intense.

856
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,076
Look, don't worry, okay? We can handle it.
Gates is an idiot.

857
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,039
Just stay the course, okay?
I'm working Mambo night and day.

858

that this affected all of us.

All our board, our managers,
including myself.

860

- Diane.
- Our savings gutted just like yours.

862
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,555
Wait. Wait. I'm sorry.

863
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,080
Are you trying to make
me feel sorry for you?

864
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,231
Is that really what's happening right now?

865
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,118
- DIANE: No, I just...
- That's exactly what's happening.

866
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,600
DIANE: I understand you want specifics.

867
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,351
Yeah. So why doesn't
she give him some specifics?

868
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,949
DIANE: We know this was
a completely isolated incident.

869

It's what we call a black swan.

but it's impossible to replicate.

She's reading from her memo.

874
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,597
Diane. Diane.
We both read your talking points.

875
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,435
He doesn't want some PR spin about
what's gonna go right next year.

876
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,274
He wants an explanation
for what went wrong last week.

877

And we believe in complete transparency.

That's why we disclosed...

880
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,672
Where are your quants, Diane?
Where are your quants?

881
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,958

- DIANE: I'm sorry?

882
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,110
- Yeah.
- The quants you used.

883
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,840
The guy who actually designed
the algorithm that crashed.

884
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,913
Where is he? Is he in that
building right there behind you?

885
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,559
'Cause I think
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

886
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,474
No, um, these are our administrative
offices. Our quants aren't...

887
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,711
Okay, then where is he? Is he in Mumbai?

888
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,792
Russia? Yeah, he's in Russia.
They're all in Russia.

DIANE: I'm not sure.

890
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,310
But if you'd like to talk to someone,
then I can make that happen.

891
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,393
No, I don't want to talk to
some low-level schlub, God damn it.

892
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,153
I want an explanation from you!

And if you can't give me one,
then I want to talk to Walt Camby.

894
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,994
No, I'm sorry,

895

He just shot out your monitor on the stage

So if every single one of you

of this sucker up in no time.

If we do it and everybody invests
just a little bit of money,

986
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,676
the price starts to go up.

And then the algorithms... They start to
take notice, and they start to buy it.

and take stock of our lives, Kyle?

How about we compare scores, hmm?

How about we do that?

But then there's family.

You got a girlfriend? That's nice.
The magic of young love.

I think we can both agree
that's a point for you,

is an escort service.

get larger and larger.

Hey, Kyle, you see her?

00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,430
That's Patty, my director,
and she wants me to shut up.

Well, now, she's sick of me, too.

1100
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,919
And that's why she took a job
across the street and didn't tell me.

1101

People talk.

Yeah? She's expecting. It's a blessing.

So let me ask you something, Kyle.

What about your life is so much shittier
than the rest of ours

throw in the towel early, hmm?

So before you blow me to kingdom come,
I want you to answer one question.

1125
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,473
What makes you such a giant fucking failure
compared to everybody else?

1126
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,233
You really gonna stand there
in your $1,000 suit

1127
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,720
and compare scores with me?

Huh?

My honest job pays me $14 an hour,
you cocksucker.

So let's start there.

1131
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,834
You know how far $14 an hour
gets you here in New York? Huh?

I pay my rent and all my fucking bills?

just to stay above water.

1135
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,714
And that's before the kid gets here.

1136
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,314
How the hell am I gonna supposed to
support him, huh?

1137
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,516
How am I gonna take care of him?

1138
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,590
You'll take great care of him.

Listen, lady,
I'm not getting mixed up in all this.

1245
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,751
I was hired to design a program.
My job was about data.

1246
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,036
It was about math.
It was about theoreticals. That's it.

1247

Yes, but this glitch was still a result
of a program you designed.

00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,674
Wrong. It's user error.

1249
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,356
They're only calling it a glitch because
nobody understands how the algo works.

1250
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,399
And if nobody can understand the math,

1251
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,631
then nobody has to explain the money.

1252
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,191
Well, that's why I'm calling you.
I want to understand.

Fine.

1254
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,391
Algorithms make patterns,
they don't break them.

1255
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,393
And this algo was designed
to move in and out

1256
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,711
of hundreds of positions
in fractions of seconds.

Right.

1258
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:51,756
What it wasn't designed to do
is consume large amounts of capital,

It means

1263
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,316
there is no way that this algorithm

Lee?

1675
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,353
You can hear me now.

1676
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,158
Which is good.

1677
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,113
I have a lot to explain,

1678
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,432
and I need you to listen
very carefully for once.

1679
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,480
We're approaching Federal Hall.

1680
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,556
Jesus. Is that live?

1681
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,800
Mmm-hmm. It is now.

1682
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,874
PATTY: Did you get all that?
And that's before we start digging.

1683
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,998
- Ibis is a pig in a prom dress, Lee.
- Got it.

1684
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,673
We are trying to find the proof right now.

1685
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,559
See if you can get those hacker guys.
Find out what they've come up with.

1686
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,950
Now, Lee,
we're making a pretty big leap here.

1687
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,551
So if Walt's gonna hang himself,
you're gonna have to hand him that rope.

1688
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,196
I'll just point the camera in your
direction, and we'll figure it out together.

1689
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,597
Hey. Get ready for a show.

1690
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,752
NEWSCASTER:
Well, these guys are certainly behaving

1691
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,231
like they've got an appointment
with the Ibis Clear Capital CEO.

1692
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,630
Which begs the question
on everyone's mind,

1693
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,473
- where is Walt Camby?
- (DOOR OPENS)

1694
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,639
MALE REPORTER: As a curious crowd
assembles outside Federal Hall,

1695
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,120
the missing piece of the puzzle...

1696
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,395
I trusted you.

1697
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,472
Yeah, well, I trusted you, too.

1698
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,997
So I guess that means we're both wrong.

1699
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,314
What did you do, Diane?
I mean, you know me.

1700
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,391
You know me better than my wife.

1701
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,551
- You know me better than anybody.
- I'm not so sure that's true.

1702
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,116
I have no idea what you think I did.

1703
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,714
Save it for the cameras, Walt.

1704
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,474
REPORTER: An eyewitness in the crowd
may just have the answer.

1705
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,676
AMY LEE: (ON TV) Walt Camby?

1706
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,037
He's inside. He just went up those stairs
and through those doors.

1707
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,110
- REPORTER: You saw him?
- AMY LEE: That's right.

1708
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,157
Guess there's nowhere to run now, huh?

1709
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,199
This story does seem to be coming
to some sort of head down here.

1710
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,640
- Hey there, big shot.
- Hey.

1711
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,154
- LEE: Ready for that interview now?
- Hey.

1712
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,350
LEE: Hey.

1713
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,477
LEE: You're just in time for the show.

1714
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,840
How was Geneva?

1715
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,515
- It was fine.
- Yeah, I hear it's lovely this time of year.

1716
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,910
Can we get him a chair?

1717
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,919
- Sam, give him a chair.
- (LAPTOP CHIMES)

1718
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,230
Whoa.

1719
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,353
The Iceland guys just came through
with all the facial recognition data.

1720
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,318
This footage goes back months.

1721
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,959
Everywhere he's traveled.
There's way too much stuff.

1722
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,158
Okay, well, just focus on the last 48
hours. And cue up the video package.

1723
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,674
CAPTAIN POWELL:
Can we get everybody outta here?

1724
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,433
Young lady, please, exit the building.

1725
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,920
WALT: Wait a second,
why does she get to leave?

1726
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,673
This might be able to help
with your investigation.

1727
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,399
This is all her fault.

1728
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,834
Go ahead, Diane, walk away.

1729
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,513
You're the only reason we're
stuck here with this psycho.

1730
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,115
You wanted transparency, Walt?
Well, here's your chance.

1731
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,190
Let's go.

1732
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,397
- (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
- Everybody hates you.

1733
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,033
CAPTAIN POWELL:
Okay, now look, everything is fine.

1734
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,154
So why don't we just put the weapons down,
and let's just talk about it.

1735
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,312
No, I... I think we can talk
with the weapons up. Right, guys?

1736
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,510
- This is Money Monster, coming to you live.
- KYLE: Back off.

1737
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,956
We're here with Ibis CEO Walt Camby.

1738
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,555
So, Walt,
now that we have you here in person,

1739
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,235
we can finally ask the
$800 million question.

1740
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,754
What happened at Ibis, Walt?

1741
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:30,470
As we've been saying since day one,
this was an isolated computer glitch.

1742
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,557
Goddamn it!

1743
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,393
- Glitch!
- He doesn't really like that word.

1744
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,119
I fuckin' hate that word!

1745
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,435
Oh, not the glitch.

1746
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,239
- Cue up video one.
- KYLE: I fucking hate that word.

1747
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,357
And then line the rest
of 'em up on my mark.

1748
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,151
You tried to convince us it's all too
complicated for us to understand.

1749
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,837
But it's not that
complicated at all, is it?

1750
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,040
It's actually the oldest story
in the book. Fraud.

1751
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,911
You took money out of your fund
and you invested it here.

1752
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,150
Go.

1753
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,311
Right here in platinum mines in South
Africa. Does that sound familiar?

1754
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,635
I don't have our portfolio in front of me.
I can't exactly...

1755
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,316
You really need your portfolio
to know where you put $800 million?

1756
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,352
I don't put that much money anywhere.

1757
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,715
The algorithms control our day-to-day...

1758
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,918
But that's not how high-frequency trading
is supposed to work, is it?

1759
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,071
They don't just put that much money
in one place

1760
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,032
and just leave it there, do they?

1761
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,755
It wasn't the algos pullin' the strings,
it was you.

1762
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,959
The miners' union strike here
outside Johannesburg is on its second week.

1763
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,238
You. You bought and paid
for a two-week strike.

1764
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,913
Oh, come on. This is ridiculous.

1765
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,350
Go.

1766
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,598
The strike had caused
the mining company's stock to drop.

1767
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,713
You buy low, you get the strike to stop,
you sell high.

1768
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,030
That's the plan.

1769
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,279
You make one big bribe to the right guy,
line your own pockets,

1770
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,510
and no one'll be the wiser.

1771
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,997
You're making accusations
that have no basis in reality.

1772
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,116
Video three on my mark.

1773
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,839
- All right, all right, all right. One...
- Get it together.

1774
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,513
- Okay, it's there. Got it.
- WALT: It's defamation, okay?

1775
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,590
And there are laws about that.

1776
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,478
Go on, Walt.
Tell me about all the laws I'm breaking.

1777
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,119
PATTY: Ready when you are, Lee.
On your mark.

1778
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,310
Look, I'll give you this.

1779
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,871
There really was a glitch in your system.
It just wasn't the computer.

1780
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,633
It was this guy. Moshe Mambo.

1781
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,870
We must say no!

1782
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,510
We must say no to their businesses!
We must say no to their bribes!

1783
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,513
You tried to bribe the one guy
that couldn't be bought.

1784
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,240
MAMBO: All they care about is money!

1785
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,073
If it takes two years,
if it takes 20 years,

1786
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:26,078
we will stay here and strike
until our voices are heard.

1787
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,310
Pause.

1788
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,277
There. Right there. That's your glitch.

1789
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,513
Because that's what sent
the mining company's stock plummeting,

1790
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,069
which sent
your secret $800 million investment

1791
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,560
right into the toilet.

1792
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,512
Want me to keep goin'?

1793
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,355
- Patty. You gotta see this.
- LEE: You made people a lot of money, Walt.

1794
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,638
You just needed to wreck industries and destroy
economies all over the world to do it.

1795
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,952
Okay. Get that ready right now. Lee?

1796
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,960
You're gonna say everything I say.

1797
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,030
WALT: This is insane.

1798
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,512
I don't know the first thing
about some South African workers' strike.

1799
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,876
I've never even heard of this Mambo.

1800
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,152
- Really? Never?
- Really? Never?

1801
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,959
Well, what were you two arguing about
this morning?

1802
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,794
Then what were you two arguing about
this morning

1803
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,833
- at 8:02 a.m., local time?
- (INAUDIBLE)

1804
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,196
Or maybe they're speaking Swahili
in Geneva these days.

1805
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,239
They don't speak Swahili
in South Africa, either.

1806
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,396
(SIGHS)

1807
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,153
And this wasn't the first time
you did it, either.

1808
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,875
This was just the first
time it didn't work out.

1809
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,959
You feel that, Walt?

1810
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,196
That sticky heat
risin' up the back of your neck?

1811
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,153
That flop sweat?

1812
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,834
That's fear.

1813
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,471
Greed you're already acquainted with.

1814
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,320
That's all a great story, Lee. I'm
actually sorry the real one's so boring.

1815
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,836
But the truth is,
our computational systems are far too...

1816
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:46,320
You know, forget it. Just shoot him.

1817
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,393
Actually, I got a better idea.

1818
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,273
Up. Up, up, up.

1819
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,390
Take the vest off. Put it on him.

1820
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:54,716
- Yeah?
- Go ahead.

1821
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,120
Hold on.
That's just gonna make things worse.

1822
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,032

01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,430
Traffic and bills, freeway of exchange

1973
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,637
One-way ticket, y'all lose, we gain

1974
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,951
USA, wave the flag like gang colors

1975
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,191
Bang on, but you'll be glad I came, brother

1976
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,357
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1977
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,636
I welcome the money and the cash

1978
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,956
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1979
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,997
I welcome the money and the cash

1980
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,312
At the welcome mat swollen fat

1981
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,631
In stupid stacks, the cash

1982
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:12,030
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1983
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,316
I welcome the money and the cash

1984
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,750
Wall Street is rigged like a 14-wheeler

1985
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,991
No one gets the plot,
and we're not revealing

1986
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,595
We got to live like emperors,
we ain't going down

1987
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,911
We stay in the 1%, you under it

1988
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,639
It's like they sent the hellhounds

1989
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,110
On an ice cream cone
how the global meltdown

1990
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,237
Financially, they ain't catching me

1991
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,556
They can't capture a phantom
they haven't seen

1992
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,916
Fuss with your folks all day for crumbs

1993
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,912
You work, we play, hooray for us

1994
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,469
We're the master puppeteers
with the leverage

1995
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,995
Sneak up behind and get a wedgie in

1996
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,117
With technology people are obsolete

1997
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,476
Fossil fuels is all you are to me

1998
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,631
Hugs go out to the world, I love you, fam

1999
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:51,076
Backslide your cash,
I call that sleight of hand

2000
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,231
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2001
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,471
I welcome the money and the cash

2002
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,711
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2003
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,951
I welcome the money and the cash

2004
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,396
At the welcome mat swollen fat

2005
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,392
In stupid stacks, the cash

2006
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,711
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2007
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,792
I welcome the money and the cash

2008
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,520
Call us super rich, we're hero to y'all

2009
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,831
We hedge bets, scalp
You give your half off

2010
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,156
Trust us, of course we'll give y'all a job

2011
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,880
One day you too can live high on the hog

2012
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,156
Wrong, you get left in the hole starving

2013
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,311
Hit the margin, so what?
That's your problem

2014
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,676
Hoard that bread just like the nasty hooker

2015
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,956
Heels crack the concrete,
she walkin' crooked

2016
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,316
Lookit, all the assholes you see as stars

2017
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,676
All gonna be broke, yep, the world is ours

2018
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,877
Put a twist on it too, like a Hefty bag

2019
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,156
In the end, it's fittin',
what's left is trash

2020
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,357
Whistleblowers hiss like cobras

2021
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,636
If we sense resistance, it's over

2022
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,831
Bull market, bear market

2023
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,832
Wild kingdom, yes, you the target

2024
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,071
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2025
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,431
I welcome the money and the cash

2026
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,512
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2027
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,035
I welcome the money and the cash

2028
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,157
At the welcome mat, swollen fat

2029
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:59,357
In stupid stacks, the cash

2030
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,591
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2031
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,275
I welcome the money and the cash
