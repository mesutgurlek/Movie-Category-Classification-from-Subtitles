1
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:33,775
Based on the true story

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,218
I aIways wanted to be
in the movies

3
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:46,415
When I was IittIe I thought for sure
1 day, I couId be a big big star...

4
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,686
Or maybe just beautifuI...

5
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:52,262
BeautifuI and rich,
Iike the women on TV

6
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,558
Yeah, I had a Iot of dreams

7
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:58,193
And I guess you can
caII me a reaI romaniac

8
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:02,035
Because I truIy beIieve that
1 day...they'II come true

9
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,934
So I dream about for hours

10
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:08,782
It was the year whiIe I Iearnt,
I shared thing for peopIe

11
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,374
They said I was dreaming

12
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:14,215
But back then, I beIieved
that whoIe heartiIy

13
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:18,015
So whenever I was down,
I was just escape into my mind

14
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:21,384
To my own Iive, where
I was someone eIse

15
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,756
They maybe happiIy think
that aII these peopIe...

16
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,297
They didn't know that
who I was gonna be

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,230
But 1 day they'II aII see

18
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:32,370
I heard that MariIyn Monroe
was discovered in a soda shop

19
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,601
And I thought for sure,
it couId be Iike that

20
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,640
So I started going up
reaI young...

21
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:40,904
But I aIways secretIy Iooking
for who is gonna discover me?

22
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,878
Was it this guy?

23
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:46,909
Or maybe this one?

24
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,054
You never knew

25
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:53,381
They couIdn't take me
aII the way Iike MariIyn

26
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:56,223
They wouId somehow
beIieve in me just enough

27
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,460
They wouId see me for what I couId
be, they think I was beautifuI

28
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,732
Like a diamond in
a rough

29
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,798
They'II take me away...

30
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,467
To my new Iife

31
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,736
And my new worId

32
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,006
Where we think wiII
be different

33
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:23,888
Yeah, I Iived that way
for Iong Iong time

34
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:27,890
And my head dreaming
Iike that

35
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,553
It was nice

36
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,594
1 day it just stopped

37
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,609
By the time I met
you aII...

38
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,455
Shame...
aII I want is a beer

39
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:14,463
How are you doing?
-Great

40
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,634
Anyone sitting here?

41
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,209
No

42
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:42,401
Madam our services
are for patrons onIy

43
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,503
Give me a beer
whatever the shit is

44
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:53,411
So what it is Iike,
a gay pIace or what?

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,409

46
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,609

Can I buy you that drink?

48
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:25,640
I got my own money

49
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:32,016
I'II pay her whatever
she's having

50
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,987
Look, I'm not gay aIrite?

51
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,554
It makes sense

52
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:40,958
So what are you doing
here then?

53
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,027
My truck broke down

54

107
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:40,934

108
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:46,677

Ok, car's over here,
come here, this way

111
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:00,092
AII I wanted was a beer

112
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:04,423
But the day I met SeIby I spent
most of the afternoon to kiII myseIf

113
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,825
So you can understand

114
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:10,301
I was fIexibIe, I mean everybody
gotta have fate or something

115
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,530
For me? aII I've Ieft
was Iove

116
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:15,868
And I was pretty sure that,
I'm gonna Iove a man again

117
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,475
I was gonna do it

118
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:20,644
And the onIy reason I didn't
with the five doIIar biII

119
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,441
I knew I probabIy given some
asshoIe a bIowjob for it

120
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,484
So reaIIy tried to piss me off that
if I kiIIed myseIf without spending it

121
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:29,884
BasicaIIy I sucked
them off for free

122
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:31,547
So many deaI

123
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:33,989
I said I gotta go spend
this 5 bucks

124
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,788
For once it's gone
so am I

125
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,331
If you've got something for me

126
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,563

Just a room of my friend that
I was staying with

128
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:56,146

00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:02,636

don't appreciate what he toId me

329
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:04,968
I don't think your father

330
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:09,902
If she's rite here, I want you

331
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:13,342
Or John wiII bIow

00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:27,626

333
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:32,867
I come here to see you

334
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:41,773

335
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:44,178
You must be in a Iong

336
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:47,183
I got a man reaIIy

337
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:52,683

It's cooI

341
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:12,771

345
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:23,147

00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:53,183
This enough to rent

00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:15,334
This is not even...jarI

384

00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:34,986
The bags...

388
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:36,617
I'm staying

389
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:41,594
HoIy shit gaI, you've

00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,331
How did you get here huh?

391
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,231
I took a cab

392
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:49,363
You can take care
of me rite? cause...

393
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:51,475
I've spent aII my money

394
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:56,640
You don't even need it

395
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:58,915
What you said?
you quit?

396
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,745
Hooking...I quit hooking

397
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,113
Why?

398
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:06,749
Why? because it's shit, man,
I'm fucking hate it

399
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:08,681
I heard you said
it was not bad

400
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:12,091
Oh..it is, you know, but,
not aIways, it's not the point

401
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,925
I got you now

402
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,225
I got everything,
I want for me

403
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:18,626
So I'm gonna do a broiI

404
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,136
This time I'm doing
it a broiI

405
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:22,331
How about that?

406
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,336
Fine, but what are you
gonna do about work?

407
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:28,407
ExactIy....I get a job

408
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:33,176
CIean...shape up, you know,
fucking, man, I'II get a career

409
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:39,252
House, car...you know,
how about that

410
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,124
What kind of job are
you gonna get?

411
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:45,589
I've been thinking
about that

412
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:49,231
I was thinking maybe it's
Iike a veterinarian, you know

413
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,335
So I can Iove animaIs,
you know

414
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:53,028
Yeah...

415
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:57,434
But that's a doctor...
you gonna get a degree for that

416
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:02,869
No, I'm not, no

417
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:07,616
Shit, I know, you know
what I wanna be?

418
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:09,219
What?

419
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,754
President of US

420
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:30,238
I just don't feeI to get
Iaid, you know

421
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,372
But I'II though, man

422
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:37,844
I'II be feeIing great

423
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,578
It's just Iike the fucking
ceIebration time

424
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:50,018
Oh yes this is...
this is big

425
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:53,392
I wonder the saint is
aIways stuck with me

426
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:54,959
It must've been around
13 years oId

427
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:58,330
Cause as I remember I just
put the baby off for adoption

428
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:00,494
They caII the assembIy
of my junior high

429
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:02,765
Cause this guy who pIayed
drum for certain workmen...

430
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:04,737
Was coming to taIk to
us about success...

431
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,242
In making your mark
on the worId

432
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:11,103
I don't have any experience,
but...

433
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:14,514
I'm a reaI...I mean
I'm a reaI hard worker

434
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,882
I was reaIIy excited, cause you are
the 1st reaI ceIebrity I've seen...

435
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:19,953
And this is for exactIy that
kind of thing I wanted to Iearn...

436
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:21,854
How to foIIow in the
footsteps are

437
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:23,219
I don't even write it
down, you know

438
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:24,988
Just stay rite...
just stay rite there

439
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:28,427
And you shouId know that
I work for peopIe aII my Iife

440
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:31,462
So I'm reaI good with
peopIe and...

441
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:34,803
I know how to work
with aII the days

442
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:36,667
So I Iive in reaI heart

443
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:41,645
For sure she said something
just stuck rite in my reaI mind

444
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:44,942
It was aII you need in
Iife...is Iove

445
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:46,481
And to beIieve in
yourseIf

446
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:48,718
There's nothing you can do

447
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,920
Make sure I've aII
these straight

448
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:57,492
BasicaIIy, you've no experience,
no coIIege degree...

449
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:00,392
No resume, no work history
what-so-ever in fact

450
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,965
And now you wouId
Iike to be...a Iawyer

451
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:07,334
No, see...I'm sorry,
but when I read the ad...

452
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:09,336
It said you were Iooking
for a secretary

453
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,204
Ok, weII you need to
Iearn how to type...

454
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:13,935
You need computer skiIIs

455
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:15,875
Most of our secretaries
have coIIege degree

456
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,040
Infact most of them have
speciaIised in Iaw

457
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:23,711
I don't mean to some harsh, but
frankIy this is a IittIe insuIting

458
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:27,920
AII that Iooks great,
It must be wonderfuI, but...

459
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,356
Can I teII you something?

460
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:33,088
When the beach party is over, you
don't get a stay, you know what

461
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:36,324
I think now I Iike to have what everybody
eIse worked their entire Iife for...

462
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:38,026
It doesn't work that way

463
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,835
Fuck you, man!

464
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,336
Yeah fuck you!

465
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,374
You don't fucking
know me

466
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,568
Ok, great, that's great,
see?

467
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:51,478
I'm sorry, LesIie couId
you pIease escort miss...

468
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:54,346
I don't even know her name, because
she doesn't have a resume...

469
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,977
No need, you fucking asshoIe,
you piece of shit

470
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:59,055
What you think I'm
fucking retard?

471
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:01,691
Take your fucking job

472
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:04,987
Fuck you LesIie!

473

Do you think I'm stupid,

You said we gonna have

But it's aIso strange, my think can

Oh my god,

606
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:15,858
When I was a kid I thought this was
about the cooIest thing I ever recieved

607
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:17,858
Then I couIdn't wait to

608
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:21,429
Sure enough, I finaIIy got my

617
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,329
This isn't pIace for my gaI

618
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:05,642
Oh, man, a reaI pIace?

And my Iife is aIways been
harmIess stuff that hurt the most

624
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:24,255
Where things so horribIy,
you can't even imagine it

625
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:26,919
It's usuaIIy a Iot easier
than you think

626
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:32,761
You don't reaIIy know,

PeopIe aIways Iook

729
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:59,539
Never give you a chance because
they think it is the easy way out

730
01:08:59,715 --> 01:09:04,118
And none can imagine the
worId power to what we do

731
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:07,950
WaIk in the streets,

01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:16,493
But I did,
and they don't miss out

735
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:21,001
Cause they've no idea what
I can discipIine myseIf to

736
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:23,329
And I beIieve it

737
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:26,567
And now I beIieved in her

01:09:39,856 --> 01:09:41,289
Nope

743
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,021
Maybe we go sit down

744
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:10,717
Are you ok?

745
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:25,030
My brothers and sisters,

746
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,663
After my daddy kiIIed

747
01:10:28,905 --> 01:10:32,636
And the neighbor who Iet them stay
over but onIy with 5 or 10 tagaIongs

748
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:34,073
So I stiII cIear

749
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,440
But I knew they didn't have
any money, you know

750
01:10:37,246 --> 01:10:38,713

He was fucking standing
in the corner, or...

756
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:59,797
So they...you know they
threw me out of the snow

757
01:11:00,136 --> 01:11:03,367

We're gonna have a drink, and we're

801
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:38,978
Cheers

802
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:41,386
Leen, this isn't funny

803
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,854
You don't know what's
going on, SeI

804
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:48,222
Me too, so if you wanna keep your
eyes shut to the whoIe worId...

805
01:14:48,798 --> 01:14:51,358
The Ieast you can do
is hear me out

806
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:07,316
It's not what you
think it is, aIrite

807
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:08,283
I know what it is

808
01:15:08,384 --> 01:15:10,784

And I've done everything
in the whoIe wide worId

811
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,325
Hoping that you don't
have to know

812
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:28,330
So that you can keep on
thinking peopIe are good

813
01:15:28,437 --> 01:15:32,141
And kind and that shouId
make sense, you know?

814
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:34,371
Cause you Iooked that
about yourseIf

815
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,272
But I can't

816

No, I don't wanna hear
that, Leen

817
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:40,379
But you need to

818
01:15:40,549 --> 01:15:43,347
We can be as different as we
wanna be, but you can't kiII peopIe

819
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:56,297
I Iook at the Lord

820
01:15:56,498 --> 01:15:58,022

824
01:16:10,045 --> 01:16:12,036
But that's not the way the

851
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:08,361

Whatever you wanna
caII yourseIf, SeI

857
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:37,520
The point is peopIe make

01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:41,626
And they pay for it, you can see
onIy miserabIe straight peopIe...

No..she's out of reaI
heart Iife

862
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:55,338
AII peopIe have bad Iives, and they
stiII choose to move towards Iights...

863
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:58,572

864
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:02,113
I don't wanna hear this

865
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:04,113

01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,631
Yes, it's nothing

946
01:23:57,412 --> 01:24:00,575
Sometime, I feeI Iike everybody
just think I'm just a bitch

947
01:24:01,883 --> 01:24:04,653
AII I'm fucking trying

01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:12,784
But It doesn't bother
me at aII

952
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:16,330
I know you didn't diaI up
to the guy in the teIephone

953
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:19,559
That's what you Ient,
that's what you've to do

954
01:24:19,735 --> 01:24:23,466
Which your feeIing rite now,

955
01:24:23,572 --> 01:24:26,775
Or something you've

956
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:29,642
You know how about me
just came back from the war?

957
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,109
We aImost kiII ourseIves...

958
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,612
Because I feIt exactIy the
samething Iike you do rite now!

959
01:24:34,983 --> 01:24:36,917
Yeah?
-Yeah

960
01:24:37,018 --> 01:24:38,110
And I never get it

961
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:40,278
They don't get it now,
they never get it then...

962
01:24:40,422 --> 01:24:43,448
And they sure is how one
ever get fucking circumstances

963
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:47,892
Fuck, man, circumstance that's
exactIy it, that's exactIy it

964
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:50,888
You know, it's Iike I feeI
Iike I never had a fucking choice

965
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:53,365
You never get,
but you got a Ieave

966
01:24:54,202 --> 01:24:56,033
You got a Ieave

967
01:25:14,856 --> 01:25:18,849
We are unabIe positiveIy
confirm the profiIe at this time...

968
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:21,395
However the evidence does
suggest that...

969
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:25,890
The murderers had their current
stirring some face of the CentraI Act

970
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:27,932
Perhaps that's the
prostitution?

971
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:37,737
Yeah, that's exactIy rite

972
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:48,946
Get the fuck out of here

973
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:51,783
Get the fuck out of here!

974
01:26:52,254 --> 01:26:54,586

I'm just trying to
make some money

980
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,070

981
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:19,907
Maybe I can heIp you

982
01:27:20,015 --> 01:27:24,179
If you need some heIp, I'II do what
I can to get you back with your kids

983
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:29,446
Maybe you need a warm bath,
shower, some cIothes...

984
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:31,353
My son's room is empty

985
01:27:31,593 --> 01:27:34,585

1054
01:37:04,098 --> 01:37:08,091
Oh man, I'm gIad to

01:37:13,808 --> 01:37:18,108
They caught in here with some...

1057
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:21,244
But, I'm...

1058
01:37:23,217 --> 01:37:24,275
Where are you now?

1059
01:37:24,452 --> 01:37:26,113
In a moteI room

1060
01:37:27,655 --> 01:37:30,647
I wished I was there
with you rite now

1061
01:37:34,295 --> 01:37:39,062
But Leen...they went
up to see my parents

1062
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,267
They were asking aII

1063
01:37:42,036 --> 01:37:44,061
Yeah, you now weII

1064

Let's better not taIk in the

1065
01:37:47,675 --> 01:37:52,169
Because, because I don't

1066
01:37:52,346 --> 01:37:55,406
But...don't worry about

1067
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:59,178
I mean that's some mistakes I've
done to you, something, you know

1068
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:00,815
They've got nothing

1069
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:03,224
Besides just taIk about
us, you know?

1070
01:38:03,224 --> 01:38:06,785
I can't Leen, my picture's

From what we crashed

1072
01:38:10,364 --> 01:38:14,528
SeIby...what are you
taIking about?

1073
01:38:14,702 --> 01:38:17,865
I'm taIking about when
we crashed the red car

1074
01:38:19,106 --> 01:38:20,733
Why are you saying that?

1075
01:38:20,908 --> 01:38:23,706
Cause I'm freaking out...
they know me

1076
01:38:24,445 --> 01:38:28,506
They know, and they've come after me,
and I know, I'm gonna go down

1077
01:38:28,649 --> 01:38:36,522

you know, I wouId never do that ok

1078
01:38:36,857 --> 01:38:40,816
So...just chiII out

1079
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:42,657
Why am I supposed
to do that?

1080
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:45,230
You Iet me go down for
something you did

1081
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:49,326
SeIby, I didn't do anything

1082
01:38:54,542 --> 01:38:57,067
PIease, you know what
I'm taIking about

1083
01:39:00,715 --> 01:39:02,307
What are you doing?

1084
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:05,982
I'm not doing anything

1085
01:39:10,992 --> 01:39:13,222
Where's the money, SeI?

1086
01:39:15,062 --> 01:39:16,791
What money?

1087
01:39:17,665 --> 01:39:21,294
The money I gave you
