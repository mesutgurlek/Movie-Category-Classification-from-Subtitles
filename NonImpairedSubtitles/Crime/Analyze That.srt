BEN: My pleasure.
- So, what have we got?

198
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,451
BEN:
Okay...

199
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,207
Based on his symptoms and test results,
I would call it brief psychotic disorder...

200
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,668
...and if it persists,
schizophreniform disorder.

201
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,672
And, Dr. Kassam, the psychiatrist
at Sing Sing, concurs with the diagnosis.

202
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,051
- So he's crazy.
- Not crazy. No. At least not permanently.

203
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,224
In certain people, prolonged exposure
to extremely stressful situations...

204
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:58,313
...like soldiers in combat, for instance,
or disaster victims or hostages...

205
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,149
...can produce a temporary
psychotic state.

206
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,486
- Uh-huh. How temporary?
- A day, a week, a month...

207
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,072
...if the precipitating stresses
are removed.

208
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,951
Which means he's not gonna get better
as long as he's in the can.

209
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,370
BEN:
He could conceivably get worse.

210
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,915
Right now he thinks
somebody is trying to kill him.

211
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,835
And he could deteriorate to the point
where he's permanently schizophrenic.

212
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,839
Then he's got a real problem. He goes
before the parole board in four weeks.

213
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,383
Would they actually release him?

214
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,511
Yeah. I'm sure they'll want
to release a major Mafia figure...

215
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,181
...who's now certifiably deranged
on top of it.

216
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,683
Why don't they release him
to a halfway house...

217
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,144
...or a center where he can get
the care he needs?

218
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,356
Based on my earlier work with him,
I don't think he's dangerous...

219
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,193
...and I think he's making
a strong effort to reform himself.

450
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,568
- A cowboy, really?
- Would you believe that?

451
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,320
Well, that's interesting.

452
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,530
How did that start?

453
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,617
I was watching television
with my mother, father.

454
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,537
You know, we watched
those cowboy shows.

455
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,414
BEN: Uh-huh.
- And my...

456
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,628
- My father got me the whole outfit.
- Uh-huh.

457
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,797
He got me a 10-gallon white hat...

458
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,967
...the boots, the spurs, the cap guns...

459
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,511
...the whole bit.

460
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,724
He took me upstate to my uncle's farm
and led me around on this little pony.

461
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,894
And there was cows and all that stuff.
It was like, to me, the Wild West.

462
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,982
And it was all "yippee kai-ay"
and all that stuff. You happy now?

463
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,317
So, what happened?

464
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,822
- I don't know. What happened?
- Why didn't you try to be a cowboy?

465
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,534
I was in East Harlem. I joined
a street gang when I was 12 years old.

466
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,327
"Why didn't I become a cowboy?"

467
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:11,165
Something else happened when you
were 12 that was very difficult for you.

468
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,041
Yeah.

469
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,919
That's when your father was murdered.

470
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,714
- Yeah, I think about it every day.
- Uh-huh.

471
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,345
- What's that got to do with anything?
- It has a lot to do with things.

472
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:29,892
It's very interesting because your father
was the one who got you the white hat.

473
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,688
He was in the Mob,
but yet he wanted you to be a hero.

474
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,567
Yeah, he did.

475
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,403
Your father wanted you to have
a better life than he did.

476
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,738
He did, yeah.

477
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,867
He wanted me to go to college.
I didn't even go to high school, hardly.

478
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,995
That's because he had died
and he wasn't around to guide you.

479
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,792
See, Paul, before, you said,
"I'm Paul Vitti, the boss"...

I see Paul Vitti the 12-year-old kid...

...who's scared and confused
with a lot of hard choices to make.

- No, Paul...

- You're good. You're better than good.
- It's just the beginning.

485

You're real good. You made me
realize I'm a little fucking kid.

486
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:22,402
That's all I wanted. I never could
figure it out with my father. That's great.

- Hey, doc. It's been a while.

00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,855
- I thought you were in prison.
- It would appear not.

497
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,440
- Well, how did you get out?
- I had a new trial.

498
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,069
It turns out the evidence
in my first trial was, you know, tainted.

Oh, I see.

Anyway, two of the witnesses decided
not to testify, and the third guy...

You're not a customer.

He grew up in Bensonhurst, next door
to my cousin's friend's husband.

I hate to bust your bubble, but there's
no way he's from Bensonhurst.

from Connecticut or someplace.

Listen, Paul, I have to ask, would you be
interested in working on Little Caesar...

...because he was a therapist.
I mean, it was that easy.

Come on. Who would you...?
Who are we kidding?

1499
01:32:22,745 --> 01:32:24,454
- You hated your father.
- I didn't.

1500
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,248
- Yes, you did.
- No, I loved him.

You hated him. You fucking hated him.
What the fuck we talking about?

- All right. I got it. I'll stop.

- I will.

Preliminary meeting. Preliminary meeting.

1510
01:32:57,655 --> 01:33:01,366
You have a preliminary meeting
with your parole officer.

Fuck you. Fuck you. It's "preliminary."

You know who was always
a favorite of mine?

The late, great Groucho Marx.

1523
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:32,439
Because he would put stuff on his,
on his...

1524
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,191
He would draw them in
on his eyebrows and then...

1525
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:39,321
"That's the most ridiculous thing
I've heard." He would do stuff like that.

Hey, look.
I'm the sheriff of the undersea club.

Salute me, I'm Captain Midnight.
