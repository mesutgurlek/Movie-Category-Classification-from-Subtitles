1
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:18,824
END OF WATCH

2
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,279
Once upon a time in South Central...

3
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:25,665
I am the police.

4
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:27,291
And I'm here to arrest you.

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,669
You've broken the law.

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,337
I did not write the  law.

7
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,714
I may even disagree with the law.

8
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:34,882
But I will enforce it.

9
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:39,054
No matter how you plead, cajole, beg or attempt to stir my sympathies...

10
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:43,316
...nothing you do will stop me from placing  you in a steel cage with grey bars.

11
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:46,435
If you run away, I will chase you.

12
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:48,646
If you fight me, I will fight back.

13
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:51,274
If you shoot at me, I will shoot back.

14
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,694
By law, I am unable to walk away.

15
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:56,279
I'm a consequence.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,864
I am the unpaid bill.

17
00:00:57,905 --> 00:00:59,561
I am fate with a badge and a gun.

18
00:01:00,216 --> 00:01:03,303
Behind my badge is a heart like yours.

19
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,180
I bleed.

20
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,264
I think.

21
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:07,765
I love.

22
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:10,059
And yes I can be killed.

23
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:17,525
And although I am but one man...  ...I have thousands of brothers and sisters who are the same as me.

24
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,986
They will lay down their lives for me.

25
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,738
And I them.

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,073
We stand watch together.

27
00:01:24,115 --> 00:01:26,117
A thin blue line.

28
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,411
Protecting the prey from the predators.

29
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:30,246
The good from the bad.

30
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:33,249
We are the police.

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,009
Thirteen X-ray nine is in pursuit of a Code  vehicle west on two seven.

32
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:41,469
Go ahead, motherfucker.

33
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,221
Try to run, you son of a bitch.

34
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:45,848
Hold on, hold on!

35
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,268
Eastbound through the alley at twenty hundred block from Hooper.

36
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:52,112
Now eastbound through the alley at twenty hundred block from Hooper.

37
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,155
Oh shit!

38
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:54,982
Come around, come around!

39
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:56,776
Move!

40
00:01:56,818 --> 00:01:57,401
Get the fuck around!

41
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:00,197
Pull to the right!

42
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,448
Pull to the right!

43
00:02:01,448 --> 00:02:03,200
He's not going to pull to the right.

44
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,453
You stupid motherfucker!

45
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:09,248
He almost lost it!

46
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:12,668
Pit him!

47
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,377
Pit him!

48
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:15,546
Got him!

49
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:24,001
Fuck you!

50
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:34,524
You good?

51
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:35,400
Good.

52
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:37,735
This fucker's down.

53
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:38,862
I'm going to hook him.

54
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:47,620
You're all good.

55
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,541
Thirteen x-ray nine, you can show a Code Four.

56
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:54,879
Thirteen x nine is requesting additional supervisors to the four thousand block at Naomi.

57
00:02:56,172 --> 00:02:57,006
Walk it off.

58
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:58,507
You good?

59
00:02:58,507 --> 00:02:58,883
I'm good.

60
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,593
Holy shit.

61
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:01,438
Yeah, motherfucker.

62
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:03,847
All right.

63
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:05,140
This is my day job.

64
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,851
Some of you... Sorry, bro, I'm recording.

65
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:08,810
This is my day job.

66
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:10,520
Some of you might know me as Brian.

67
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:12,230
Or Taylor.

68
00:03:12,272 --> 00:03:16,234
But here I am Police Officer Two Brian Taylor.

69
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:21,406
This is where the forces of good......prepare to fight to forces of evil.

70
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:24,222
This is my partner, Officer Zavala.

71
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:24,983
I'm in my chones.

72
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:25,506
I know, come on.

73
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,297
- No no, I'm in my chones.

74
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:30,540
We work basic patrol here at Newton.

75
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:32,258
One of the toughest divisions in the LAPD.

76
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:33,995
Shootin' Newton, that's right.

77
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,729
Lucky Thirteen.

78
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,940
This is a department issue sidearm.

79
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,024
Glock nineteen.

80
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,026
Spyderco tactical knife.

81
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:43,738
This little thing can break windows.

82
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:48,451
Two Smith and Wesson handcuffs.

83
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,162
Can of OC spray.

84
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:52,497
Pepper spray.

85
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,873
Two extra mags.

86
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,542
What else?

87
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:55,959
That's my nametag.

88
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,753
You can see my partner's dirty locker.

89
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:00,171
Yours is like a woman.

90
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:00,755
Look at this.

91
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:02,090
What is this, Pottery Barn?

92
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,467
Are you going to shut the fuck up and get ready for roll call?

93
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,302
Don't swear.

94
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:08,221
I have to edit that out, when you swear.

95
00:04:08,263 --> 00:04:09,013
Oh fuck.

96
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:10,181
Oh shit.

97
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:11,307
Fuck.

98
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:17,147
You kids having fun?

99
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:18,732
Look, it's Officer Van Houser.

100
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,025
Officer Three.

101
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,109
Van Houser.

102
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,820
Considered unpromotable by the department.

103
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:26,782
And the angriest fucking cop in the world.

104
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:28,372
I'm going to tell Sarge that you're taping in here.

105
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,711
What'd you say?

106
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:32,380
I'm going to tell Sarge that you're taping in here.

107
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,134
It's not really called taping anymore.

108
00:04:36,134 --> 00:04:39,929
It uses flash cards, but it's not really a-... - Don't worry about it.

109
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:40,388
- God damn it!

110
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,056
Like that?

111
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:44,642
Turn it on.

112
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,612
Am I recording you?

113
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,405
Yes, and I'm recording you.

114
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,240
That's so cool.

115
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:51,241
That thing there?

116
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:53,035
That's the lens right there.

117
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:55,245
Just like this right here.

118
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:56,705
Hey guys, quiet down.

119
00:04:56,747 --> 00:05:00,167
All right, let's settle down.

120
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:00,834
Let's settle down.

121
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,021
Captain's here, he'd like to say a few words.

122
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,059
Let's quiet down.

123
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:03,563
Thank you, Sergeant.

124
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:04,231
Good afternoon.

125
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:05,440
Good afternoon.

126
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:06,733
- Put it down.

127
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,026
I'd like to welcome back Zavala and Taylor.

128
00:05:08,694 --> 00:05:10,696
D.A.cleared these guys in last month's shooting.

129
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:11,947
Turned out to be a good shooting.

130
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:14,575
I know firsthand what you guys went through.

131
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,702
It's a unpleasant experience being under that much scrutiny.

132
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:19,246
But you need to remember something.

133
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:21,832
An on the job shooting is still considered a homicide.

134
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:24,251
It's never an easy ride.

135
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,713
If you do the right thing, I will always have your back.

136
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:32,676
Do the wrong thing and cross me, I will personally throw you under the bus.

137
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:34,219
Am I clear?

138
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,970
Yes sir!

139
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:35,546
Taylor, am I clear?

140
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:35,930
- Yes sir.

141
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,307
Sergeant, am I clear?

142
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:37,807
- Yes sir.

143
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:38,933
Have a nice day.

144
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,685
Thank you, Captain.

145
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,399
Quiet down!

146
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:48,192
See this?

147
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,319
It's a ticket book.

148
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,613
Inside are things called tickets.

149
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:52,697
Son of a bitch.

150
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:57,827
You can do things like stop motorists and cut citations for speeding or going through a light.

151
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:58,571
You all need to write.

152
00:05:58,537 --> 00:05:59,997
Sarge, we cut citations every watch.

153
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:02,249
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to these two idiots.

154
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,751
My partner has a question.

155
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:06,128
I don't really know how to write.

156
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:10,299
But I do sign and draw pictures.

157
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,928
Seriously, you don't start writing, Captain's going to shit on my head...

158
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:15,930
and in turn, I'm gonna shit on yours.

159
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,551
And I promise you, you guys are going to be separated.

160
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:19,386
Do it, Sarge.

161
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:21,467
Orozco and Davis, X Twenty-five.

162
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:23,730
Peterson and Washington, X Forty One.

163
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,524
Zavala and Taylor, you got X Thirteen.

164
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,902
Williams and Cho, X Eight.

165
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:30,779
Alameda and Green, X Twenty-one.

166
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,948
Van Houser and Sook, X Four.

167
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:33,782
Yeah, Sarge?

168
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:35,242
That's not our area.

169
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:36,057
That's not your area?

170
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:36,993
No, we work Nine.

171
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:37,738
I'm sorry.

172
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:38,454
Oh no, you're right.

173
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,498
You're on X Thirteen.

174
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,541
Sorry fellas, this isn't Monopoly.

175
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,876
You don't get to choose your real estate.

176
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:44,585
Now go.

177
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:45,044
Get out.

178
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:50,132
Zavala, try not to kill anybody before the end of the watch.

179
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:50,883
Really, Sarge?

180
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:54,220
Sir, if we kill someone in X Thirteen, can we go back to X Nine?

181
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,722
Today is a brand new day.

182
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:59,642
Get the shop, gas the shop, wash the shop.

183
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:02,311
Make sure day watch didn't leave behind any surprises for us.

184
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:03,409
Look for guns, drugs, puke.

185
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:04,452
Pay attention, Boot.

186
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:04,875
Goodbye.

187
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,015
Hurry up- Yes sir.

188
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:06,830
How you doing, Van Houser?

189
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,402
I warned you about that shit.

190
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:10,070
Where you running with that piece, Boot?

191
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,988
What?

192
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,613
Why you so scared?

193
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:12,573
Go, go!

194
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:13,991
Jesus Christ!

195
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:14,908
- Go on, shit.

196
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,534
It's like it's day one.

197
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,202
Boot, slow down with that piece.

198
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:17,995
Slow down!

199
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:18,779
Orozco, have you been working out?

200
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:19,597
Yeah, with your mom.

201
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:21,765
Why are you shooting everything?

202
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,142
It's for his class.

203
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:24,852
I thought you were studying law.

204
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:25,936
Pre-law.

205
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:26,937
I need an art elective.

206
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:27,813
I'm taking filmmaking.

207
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:29,565
Well, get my good side.

208
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,108
You don't have a good side.

209
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,952
Listen, you know they can subpoena that shit if something goes sideways, right?

210
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:36,590
Think twice.

211
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,115
Two words.

212
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,533
Erase button.

213
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:42,913
Two words: Just because you guys think you're these big ghetto gunfighters now, don't mean you can be dropping your calls.

214
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:44,956
That was at least two dozen words.

215
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:48,460
Well, I barely got a G.E.D. so what do you expect, white boy?

216
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,832
Saddle up, ladies, we're sick of holding up your end.

217
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,121
Admit it, you'd hit that shit.

218
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:53,804
Orozco.

219
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,008
Yeah.

220
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,259
With a cinderblock.

221
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,053
Check the roof, Boot.

222
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,721
Where's your shop?

223
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,058
I got Red Bull, Monster, and-

224
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:03,476
They all say thirteen, check the roof.

225
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:05,019
Thank you, ma'am.

226
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,271
Faster, Boot, let's go - Get in the car!

227
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:07,522
- Yes sir!

228
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,106
And then I got you some kombucha because I know you like that stuff.

229
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:09,815
Fuck that shit!

230
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,526
What is that?

231
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:39,679
$1,000,000,000,000 to pay for a failed  year drug war how many millions are in a trillionprop  54% voted to imprison the other 46

232
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:00,243
It's good to be back, man.

233
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:04,581
Old lady was driving me crazy at the casa, like making me do shit.

234
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:06,082
Oh no!

235
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,084
She dared ask for your help around the house.

236
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,419
That's incredible.

237
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,670
Outrageous.

238
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:14,767
Just because I look like the dudes from Home Depot, doesn't mean I do the shit the dudes from Home Depot do.

239
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:17,782
I would never profile you as a man who helps his wife with chores.

240
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:18,016
Shut up.

241
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:18,783
Dude, I'm your homie.

242
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:20,783
I would never do that.

243
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:26,229
Her brother was always coming over during the day to swim.

244
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:27,772
Every day.

245
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:29,482
I hate everything about him.

246
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:31,151
He smells like weed sometimes.

247
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,986
Like he's got a prescription.

248
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:36,781
The guy was like ‘no, it's all good' and I was like whatever, get him the hell out of here.

249
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:39,117
I swear to God I'm filling in that pool with cement.

250
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:41,912
Not personally, ‘cause you'll hire a Home Depot dude for that task.

251
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:42,954
Fuck you.

252
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:46,082
Thirteen X thirteen.

253
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:48,460
Four fifteen man at nine seven four two Maple.

254
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,377
Code Two.

255
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:50,879
Incident four five six two.

256
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:52,297
Thirteen X thirteen.

257
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:54,216
Roger, show us enroute.

258
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:55,634
X thirteen roger.

259
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:56,801
First customer of the day.

260
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:58,166
I hope they enjoy our police service.

261
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,814
Suck my dick!

262
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:10,566
That motherfucker's a lying ass nigger.

263
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:12,098
Fuck him and fuck you too!

264
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:13,820
Shut your fucking – if you touch me, I will kill you.

265
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:14,655
Stay where you are.

266
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,782
I don't give a fuck about both you motherfuckers.

267
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:17,491
I'm ready to die today.

268
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,325
Fuck y'all.

269
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:19,785
This can go several ways right now.

270
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,912
It is all about your attitude.

271
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,955
Fuck you!

272
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:23,789
I got my mail!

273
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,540
I helped him!

274
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,583
I helped him give me my mail!

275
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,876
I'm getting tired of this shit!

276
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,627
All right.

277
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,712
- I'm not playing with you all.

278
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,674
Sir, if you've been drinking, you need to stay the fuck inside and not intimidate the mailman.

279
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,216
That's it.

280
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:33,842
Fuck you!

281
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,093
You need to shut the fuck up!

282
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,262
- Because without that badge and gun, you ain't shit.

283
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:37,595
- Yeah?

284
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,430
You're less than motherfucking nothing.

285
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,517
You motherfucking border hopping, donkey riding, Mexican motherfucker.

286
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:42,851
- Oh yeah?

287
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,726
Is that so?

288
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,103
You want to find out what I'm about?

289
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,020
Show me!

290
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:46,437
Yeah, I wanna see!

291
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,063
Fuck.

292
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,399
Let's settle this right here like grown men, motherfucker!

293
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,608
Not again, man.

294
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:50,984
What'd you say?

295
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:51,651
You wanna take a fade?

296
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,777
You want to fight me?

297
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,403
Yeah, I want to fight you.

298
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,112
Let's go, bro.

299
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,781
I whip your punk ass you going to get the fuck out of my crib?

300
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,365
Hell no.

301
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,575
But you called me out.

302
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,451
Now I'm calling you out.

303
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:00,952
What's up?

304
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,657
You whip my ass I'll put those motherfucking handcuffs on my motherfucking self.

305
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,457
And that's on the set.

306
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:06,167
Door.

307
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,251
It's going to be a pleasure beating your bitch ass.

308
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,169
My fucking fantasy.

309
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,338
I don't know who the fuck you think you're fucking with, but I love this shit.

310
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,966
To beat a motherfucking punk-ass police ass like yours.

311
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,008
Keep talking.

312
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,634
- Let's get this shit popping, motherfucker.

313
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,565
Oh shit.

314
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,112
This shit's crazy!

315
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:42,913
Fucking kick his ass!

316
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:43,288
Come on!

317
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,092
Now get the fuck up.

318
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:57,302
You like that?

319
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:58,283
This ain't no wrassling match.

320
00:11:58,054 --> 00:11:58,971
You all right?

321
00:11:59,013 --> 00:11:59,388
You all right?

322
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,890
Come on!

323
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:05,520
Oh shit!

324
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:07,980
Come on!

325
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,947
That's what happens when you fuck with the police.

326
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:18,200
Yeah, come on.

327
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:18,617
Take him!

328
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:23,121
Fuck you, border hopping motherfucker!

329
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:36,385
You all right?

330
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:37,678
Gimme the hooks.

331
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:57,450
What's up, putos?

332
00:12:57,492 --> 00:13:00,579
It's big bad Wicked from Curbside Gang Locotes.

333
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,496
You ready for this shit?

334
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:03,455
Fuck yeah.

335
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:05,374
I was born to fucking do this shit.

336
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,794
Show these motherfuckers whose barrio this is.

337
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,129
You almost ran the light, stupid.

338
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:11,589
You're going to get us pulled over, La.

339
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:12,381
Fuck that shit.

340
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,008
I gotta fucking be at work.

341
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:18,512
You better not bust out wasting my motherfucking time, I'm gonna tell you that shit right now.

342
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:21,056
La La, when are you going to fuck the homeboy?

343
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:23,726
I am not fucking the homeboy, dog.

344
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,769
Shit, what do I look like?

345
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:28,647
The little fucking paisa hoochies you guys fucking kick it with?

346
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:29,982
What you packing?

347
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:33,161
I'm packing a motherfucking thirty round clip for these swamp ass niggers.

348
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:33,987
This is it right here.

349
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,739
Slow down, this is the street.

350
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,281
This is it.

351
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:36,823
All right.

352
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,034
Wicked, you're going to jump and get the party started, got it?

353
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:39,576
- I got it.

354
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,661
Listen to the homie.

355
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:43,121
All right, put your fucking face on, let's go!

356
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:43,872
Get your shit ready.

357
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:45,499
Put that fucking shit away!

358
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,626
Your fucking shit is good to go.

359
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,169
What the fuck do I have to fucking tell you?

360
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,214
I don't want to fucking have to baby you!

361
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:52,590
OK, ready homies.

362
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,299
Get ready.

363
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,008
Get your fucking face on!

364
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,342
- All right.

365
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:55,301
Fuck.

366
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:55,676
You guys ready?

367
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:56,177
- Ready.

368
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:57,136
All right.

369
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,766
But on some real shit, though,  I wanted to holler at you.

370
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:04,895
All my niggers keep on talking about how you got your ass whipped by a motherfucking little punk-ass wonton.

371
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:06,188
No, these niggers is hating.

372
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:07,564
Let me tell you something.

373
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,274
Me and the cop got  down, right?

374
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:12,986
Motherfucker took off his badge, dropped his  gun.

375
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,321
I mean, he kept it gangster.

376
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,656
We straight up squabbled.

377
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:16,323
Head up.

378
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,534
But they still took you to the County though?

379
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:20,118
Yeah, but for disorderly conduct.

380
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:22,454
Not for squabbling with the police, you feel me?

381
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:25,249
You fought a cop and they didn't put no assaulting a peace officer on you?

382
00:14:24,748 --> 00:14:26,291
Listen to me, my nigga.

383
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm trying to tell you all.

384
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,169
They really showed me love to keep it G.

385
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,629
I'm a two time felon, right?

386
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:31,463
Y'all know that, right?

387
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:34,258
Could have struck me out and gave me life for fighting that cop, you feel me?

388
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,021
I got right out, it wasn't shit.

389
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:37,604
All right, but we heard you got your ass beat.

390
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:39,481
You better shut the fuck up, CK.

391
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:41,816
I'll run this fucking fork up in your ass, I swear to god.

392
00:14:41,816 --> 00:14:43,360
Let me tell you something...

393
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:45,945
win, lose or draw...

394
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:49,991
...as long as you squabble and get down, that's gangster, you understand what I'm saying?

395
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:50,450
Yup.

396
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,203
I mean, that Mexican cop might be acting bull with you, Tre...

397
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:55,372
But he's still out there out there killing niggers.

398
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:56,081
Straight out.

399
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:57,040
No no no.

400
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,500
Listen to me, all y'all.

401
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,252
This whole fucking thing is like changing of the guard.

402
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:05,465
Back in the day, all these neighborhoods used to be black, and what are they now?

403
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:06,591
Mexicans.

404
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,342
Exactly.

405
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:11,346
There used to be chicken stands on the corner, and now there's fucking taco stands on every corner.

406
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:15,475
We're in some real shit and if we don't come together, we're going to be some extinct niggers pretty soon.

407
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:16,768
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

408
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:18,269
Go go go!

409
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,713
Fuck!

410
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:44,840
Fuck yeah!

411
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:46,008
We got those putos!

412
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:46,842
We got them!

413
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:49,678
Eat shit, motherfuckers!

414
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,429
Fuck!

415
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:53,766
Show those putos whose neighborhood this fucker is!

416
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:54,517
Shit.

417
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,893
Fucking proud of you.

418
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,645
And that's what I'm fucking telling you.

419
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:58,229
Good.

420
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:00,064
That was fucking good.

421
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,357
That's what I'm fucking telling you.

422
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:03,276
I'm proud of you.

423
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:04,360
Fucking did it.

424
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:07,113
That's what I'm fucking talking about when I'm fucking proud of you.

425
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:09,824
Fucking proud of you man now you're a fucking man.

426
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:10,700
Right?

427
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,576
Right, homie.

428
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:12,035
- Right?

429
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:12,785
Right.

430
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:13,202
- All right then.

431
00:16:13,202 --> 00:16:15,121
No fucking fear.

432
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:16,497
No fucking fear.

433
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:18,041
That's how we fucking do it.

434
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,293
That's how we fucking do it.

435
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,172
Call the motherfucking ambulance!

436
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:24,381
They got CK!

437
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,508
Somebody call a fucking ambulance!

438
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,720
Bitch ass sewer rats was from Curbside.

439
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:30,804
I seen them.

440
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:31,847
Fucking Ese's are serving us.

441
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:33,015
Curbside's serving us.

442
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,100
Curbside's banging all over us on Bloods.

443
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,101
You got that chopper?

444
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:38,047
Let's go hit these little punk ass fools.

445
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:38,934
Cut that fucking camera off!

446
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:54,746
So this is what we believe to be the Code thirty-seven vehicle used in the drive-by last night.

447
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:55,914
Curbside Gang's at it again.

448
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:57,040
It fits the description.

449
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,041
It comes back as stolen.

450
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:02,713
Curbside likes these vehicles because they blend in, you can put a lot of people in them.

451
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:06,383
This door slides back, and the gang members open fire.

452
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:11,457
The victim was a male black from a Blood set that has basically been at war with this Hispanic gang over control of narcotic sales.

453
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:11,639
Partner.

454
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:12,474
Yeah.

455
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:13,600
What's up?

456
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:14,184
- Check this out.

457
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:15,018
Oh shit.

458
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:17,353
Those are shell casings.

459
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:23,109
Detectives told us that three different weapons were used and we're seeing at least two kinds of shells, so... Shit.

460
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:24,152
What's up?

461
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:27,405
Those are the Homicide Detectives working the case.

462
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:29,407
The hell's this?

463
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,074
What?

464
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:30,992
Candid Camera?

465
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,780
No sir, it's just a project I'm working on.

466
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,228
Yeah?

467
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:33,770
Yeah.

468
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:34,622
I don't want to see that.

469
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:38,209
There are forty-five and nine millimeter shell casings inside.

470
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,168
How do you know that?

471
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,669
Did you touch them?

472
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:41,337
No sir.

473
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:42,713
Did you fuck up my vehicle?

474
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:43,380
No sir.

475
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,591
- Sir, we found it, we called you.

476
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:50,346
The big dogs are here now, so set up some yellow tape and stand on the other side of it.

477
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:56,489
It's been two hours, we're still waiting for the detectives to release the scene so we can go back on patrol.

478
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:57,020
Comfortable footwear.

479
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:59,397
Policing is all about comfortable footwear.

480
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:09,074
Officer Van Houser.

481
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:10,659
Good evening.

482
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,788
Sarge said I should relieve you guys so you can go back to being the street gods that you are.

483
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,831
I'm down with that.

484
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:19,994
On the street.

485
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:22,488
Watch the street.

486
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:25,035
Make sure no assholes come up here and kill us.

487
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:25,677
Yes sir.

488
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:28,845
Fucking Christ.

489
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:32,223
Officer Van Houser, have you made a difference today?

490
00:18:35,726 --> 00:18:38,604
You know I see you guys out here, you're being good little company men, aren't you?

491
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:39,981
Are you doing the Lord's work?

492
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:42,024
And you're making a difference, as you call it.

493
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:46,362
It's all fun and games to you, you get to run and jump and fight and shoot.

494
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:53,099
One day the LAPD is going to bend you over your black and white... and they are going to fuck you up the ass.

495
00:18:53,996 --> 00:19:02,146
They are going to fuck you so long and so hard... you're going to want to eat your gun just to make it stop.

496
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:10,305
And if you don't eat your gun and the fucking somehow magically stops...they're going to give you freeway therapy.

497
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:13,308
You're going to end up doing West End Valley daywatch.

498
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:19,949
Spending two hours every day on the fucking freeway... just thinking about the fucking that they gave you.

499
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:23,155
Bad guys attack from up front.

500
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:24,467
The department comes in from the rear.

501
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,739
Watch your six.

502
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:28,699
I'm ready.

503
00:19:29,992 --> 00:19:32,369
This may say Purell but It's really K-Y.

504
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,039
Officer Zavala.

505
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:36,582
That's funny.

506
00:19:36,624 --> 00:19:38,709
You kids have fun out there.

507
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,378
The LAPD's got a big fucking cock.

508
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:42,713
You've got a big heart.

509
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:44,799
Thank you for sharing that.

510
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:47,009
Can't wait to get it up the ass.

511
00:19:53,683 --> 00:19:55,352
Are you going to hook up with a Mexican girl?

512
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,395
Quit trying to hook me up with one of them.

513
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,231
It'd be great if you did but--

514
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,065
I get it, man.

515
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:00,732
Shit.

516
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,028
Sweet brown sugar.

517
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:08,323
You should marry one of my cousins.

518
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:11,493
If they're anything like you I wouldn't be able to stand a fucking hour with them.

519
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,201
Waking up in the morning, they'd be like...

520
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:16,125
"Hey, can I tell you a story?"

521
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,263
I know.

522
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:20,586
‘Here's a story about this and a story about that and a story about this and a story about that –

523
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:24,038
But all you gotta do is this...

524
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:26,978
‘You want to come to my cousin's quinceanera?

525
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:28,265
‘My daughter's quinceanera?

526
00:20:28,418 --> 00:20:29,488
My brother's quinceanera?

527
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:30,090
Yeah.

528
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,514
My sister's quinceanera?

529
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:33,724
There's always something happening, though, bro.

530
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:37,436
It's better than like ‘Hey, do you know the new kind of flavored coffee I have?

531
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:39,355
‘Do you like this kind of coffee?

532
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:39,147
Oh really?

533
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,398
Shut the fuck up.

534
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,649
The baristas are excellent.

535
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:43,607
You like fucking coffee, don't give me that shit.

536
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:44,928
I like fucking good Starbucks coffee.

537
00:20:44,653 --> 00:20:45,279
Whatever.

538
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,196
I'll let you lay into me.

539
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:46,738
Lay into me.

540
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,073
Fine.

541
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:50,868
Thirteen x-ray thirteen.

542
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:51,952
Missing juvenile.

543
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:53,537
Two seven one seven Jefferson.

544
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:56,790
Code Incident five seven five five and thirteen twenty-seven.

545
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,551
Thirteen x-ray thirteen, we're going to be Code Six on the missing juvenile.

546
00:21:02,338 --> 00:21:03,047
I can't see dick.

547
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:06,301
Hi.

548
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,763
We got a call about some missing children.

549
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,432
Yes, my babies are gone.

550
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:14,184
All right.

551
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:15,059
My babies are gone.

552
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:15,768
You want to let us in?

553
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:16,144
We can talk.

554
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:16,895
We can have that conversation.

555
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:18,146
OK.

556
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:19,939
My babies are gone.

557
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,149
They've been missing all night.

558
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,066
And I've been here.

559
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:23,318
Why don't you just step over here for a second, ok?

560
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,903
Officer, we're wasting time.

561
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:25,695
Let me see your hands.

562
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:26,970
How many children are missing?

563
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:27,906
Two.

564
00:21:27,947 --> 00:21:30,241
A boy and a girl.

565
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:32,151
What are the ages of the children that are missing?

566
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:32,707
One is...

567
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:35,051
one and the other be three.

568
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,664
Sir!

569
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:36,791
Somebody took them.

570
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:37,833
Let me see your hands, please.

571
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,876
Maybe it was when I went to the bathroom.

572
00:21:38,918 --> 00:21:39,543
Let me see your hands.

573
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:40,169
Someone quick quick quick.

574
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:40,586
OK ma'm

575
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:41,212
In and out

576
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:41,587
- All right.

577
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:41,921
Ok.

578
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:42,379
All right.

579
00:21:42,421 --> 00:21:42,671
All right.

580
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:44,298
Hands behind your head.

581
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:45,716
I've been here all night.

582
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:46,842
Officer, we're good here.

583
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:48,844
Don't say anything to them.

584
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:50,262
I know, but they're not here.

585
00:21:50,262 --> 00:21:50,930
They're gone.

586
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,514
The babies are gone.

587
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:52,348
What did you say?

588
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:53,557
I'm going to check the house, ok?

589
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:54,475
Listen to me, officer.

590
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:55,893
I'm trying to tell you.

591
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:56,644
I've looked-

592
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:57,075
The kids are with their grandma.

593
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:57,270
Is this your husband?

594
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,939
No, that's not my husband.

595
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,815
Sit the fuck down!Sit the fuck down!

596
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,857
I've been looking.

597
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:01,817
I understand.

598
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:02,442
I'm going to check the house.

599
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:05,111
Sometimes children can hide under a bed or in a closet.

600
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:06,947
You can talk to my partner.

601
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:08,114
You're wasting time!

602
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:08,031
The kids are at grandma's!

603
00:22:08,073 --> 00:22:09,241
The kids are not here!

604
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:11,952
If you can please go outside and get my kids.

605
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:12,953
Talk to my partner.

606
00:22:12,994 --> 00:22:14,412
Stop, don't push me!

607
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:15,914
My babies are missing!

608
00:22:15,914 --> 00:22:16,873
Let me see some type of warrant.

609
00:22:16,873 --> 00:22:17,582
You got a warrant?

610
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:18,875
Let me see some type of warrant.

611
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,252
We don't need a warrant, she let us in.

612
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:21,503
Why the fuck did you say anything?

613
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:23,630
You stupid – why the fuck did you say anything?

614
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,132
Sit down-

615
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:27,050
I was going to get a cigarette.

616
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:27,717
Not right now.

617
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,691
I'm trying to tell you, the kids are with their grandma, ok?

618
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:31,514
I heard you.

619
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:32,265
They're with the grandma.

620
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:37,186
Would you please listen to me, Officer?

621
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:38,396
Let me see some type of warrant.

622
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:42,275
You shut the fuck up!

623
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:43,818
Why the hell did you let them in here?

624
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,902
Press charges on this motherfucker!

625
00:22:44,902 --> 00:22:46,320
You fucking bitch, I'm going to kill you!

626
00:22:46,362 --> 00:22:48,698
I'm going to kill you, motherfucker!

627
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:49,574
Get the fuck off me!

628
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:51,492
What the fuck's happening?

629
00:22:51,534 --> 00:22:52,285
Wait a minute!

630
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:52,910
- All right, all right!

631
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,245
Did you head what I said to you?

632
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:54,745
Did you hear what I said to you?

633
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:56,894
You just let me know how clear I have to make myself to you.

634
00:22:57,124 --> 00:23:00,377
Why don't you open your fucking mouth and tell me how clear I have to make myself to you.

635
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:00,752
Partner!

636
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:01,128
Partner!

637
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,296
Get off him.

638
00:23:03,797 --> 00:23:04,571
Brian, what's up?

639
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:05,953
You ok, partner?

640
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,427
What's happening, Brian?

641
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,345
Fuck you, you dumb-ass smoker bitch!

642
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:10,972
I'm going to kick you in the fucking face!

643
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:11,514
I found the kids.

644
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,183
Fucking crackhead.

645
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:21,733
It's ok, it's ok.

646
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:22,400
You're ok now.

647
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,365
I'm just gonna – oh shit.

648
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,160
It's ok.

649
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,286
It's ok, sweetie.

650
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:33,745
All right.

651
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:36,789
Hey buddy, stay still.

652
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,211
All right, you're ok now.

653
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:42,545
You're ok.

654
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:47,785
Come here, come here.

655
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:48,461
You ok?

656
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,280
You gonna take care of your sister?

657
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,530
Fucking kids.

658
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:35,565
It's so funny.

659
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,485
It's so funny to text.

660
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:39,121
Who are you texting?

661
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:39,641
That same bitch?

662
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:40,987
Dude, yeah.

663
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,655
She's smart.

664
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,240
She's like the first girl I can have a conversation with.

665
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:47,619
You know she has a Master of Science in Fluid Hydraulics.

666
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:49,663
Fluid Hydraulics?

667
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:50,246
Yes.

668
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:52,707
I wouldn't brag about that.

669
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,919
That she has a master's degree in Fluid Hydraulics.

670
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:56,790
I date all these girls, man.

671
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,765
They're smoking hot.

672
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,496
Your little fucking badge bunnies

673
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,008
I get laid without a badge, thank you very much.

674
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:02,176
Because you were in the Marines.

675
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:04,512
Don't ask don't tell.

676
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:05,304
There's a pattern.

677
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:06,764
An M.O. here.

678
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:09,141
First date is dinner and a respectful kiss.

679
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,994
Second date is dinner, full carnal knowledge.

680
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,184
And then third date is dinner and uncomfortable silences when I try to discuss anything of merit.

681
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:21,654
Then it's two or three booty calls and it's on to the next.

682
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:27,452
Ok, I went to prom and I got married a week later.

683
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:30,705
And I ain't tapped anybody but Old Faithful for like eight years.

684
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:33,477
So I don't know what you're tripping about.

685
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,168
Ok.

686
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,085
Wait, look at me real quick.

687
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:35,795
aha

688
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:36,879
Ok, ready?

689
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:37,296
Yeah.

690
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,048
I want somebody to talk to.

691
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:40,132
Not just sleep with.

692
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:42,176
Do you fucking understand what I'm saying?

693
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:43,219
Oh.

694
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:44,720
Yeah.

695
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:45,846
Jesus, dude.

696
00:25:46,722 --> 00:25:49,642
White people get hung up on this fucking soul mate bullshit.

697
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:53,270
Just hook up with a chick that can cook and wants kids.

698
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:55,861
Some bitch that's down for you, that won't fuck your friends, and you're straight.

699
00:25:56,024 --> 00:26:01,530
You're the smartest motherfucker I know, you're not going to find some chick that's as smart as you.

700
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:05,116
Really?

701
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:06,284
Yeah, what?

702
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:06,952
Really?

703
00:26:06,993 --> 00:26:10,914
I'm sorry the perfect girl wasn't dumped in front of me when I was eighteen years old.

704
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,749
Do you talk to Gabby?

705
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,709
Do you even have discussions with the girl?

706
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:17,504
Do you want me to translate that into fucking His- Spanish?

707
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:18,672
Into Hispanic?

708
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:19,798
Whatever the fuck it is.

709
00:26:20,258 --> 00:26:22,718
Yeah, what do you think, we're mutes?

710
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,055
And we just .... like sign to each other?

711
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:27,682
Yeah we talk, stupid.

712
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:28,683
Gabby's a trip.

713
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:29,642
You know she's a trip.

714
00:26:29,684 --> 00:26:32,186
You should hear the shit that comes out of her mouth.

715
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:32,687
You know what?

716
00:26:32,728 --> 00:26:33,776
She would be great on Jeopardy.

717
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,398
She's way smarter than I am.

718
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,316
All right, so you see what I'm talking about.

719
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:37,192
That's all I want

720
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:40,279
I know you want a chick like my girl, but I'll kill you if you touch her.

721
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,904
Fuck!

722
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:41,738
I'm going to kill you!

723
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,990
Shut up!

724
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:48,412
What's this chick's name?

725
00:26:48,412 --> 00:26:50,706
You don't deserve to fucking know her name.

726
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:53,500
Dude, fuck that!

727
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:55,836
Jannet.

728
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:56,795
Did you run her?

729
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,755
Yes, she's clean.

730
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,133
She's kind of the complete package.

731
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:05,262
We're going out again.

732
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:08,766
Saturday's my little sister's quinceanera.

733
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:10,601
You should roll through with Jannet from another planet.

734
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:13,479
The shit's going to be hardcore Mexican, though.

735
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:15,606
You know how my familia rolls.

736
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:50,810
Hey, mija.

737
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:52,728
What's up?

738
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:57,107
Come here, baby girl. Drink the Jim Jones, baby, come on.

739
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:00,529
Hey baby?

740
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,780
Tell me something.

741
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:03,448
You ever fucked on heroin?

742
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,950
Yeah right.

743
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:07,285
I could fuck forever on that shit.

744
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,580
I'll eat your pussy for hours, girl.

745
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,090
Get the fuck over here.

746
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,418
Fuck that fool, he's crazy, he's tripping.

747
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,671
You're my fucking lady.

748
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:18,422
I'll buy you shit.

749
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,716
You see this shit right here?

750
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,051
It's fucking money.

751
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:24,137
Real shit.

752
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:25,388
What you like?

753
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:28,266
Come here.

754
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:28,891
Ok.

755
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:32,270
Any Newton unit.

756
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,187
Five oh seven party.

757
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:34,605
Three six four five Trinity Street.

758
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:37,483
Incident thirty eight ninety and RD thirteen seventy-six.

759
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:39,318
X nine, send me the call

760
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,403
X Nine roger.

761
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:43,281
X twenty five shows code six of x nine.

762
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,866
Twenty-five roger.

763
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:46,389
X thirteen, we're going to be code six on the party call.

764
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:47,181
X thirteen, roger.

765
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:57,380
Cops!

766
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,255
Cops!

767
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:06,931
OFFICER Keep your eyes wide, this place is assholed up.

768
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:08,557
Clear the car.

769
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:21,363
Put that shit away.

770
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:24,199
Put that down

771
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:32,416
What's the occasion?

772
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:41,091
Can you turn down the music?

773
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,309
Have some respect, La La.

774
00:29:49,351 --> 00:29:50,936
Don't light up in front of us.

775
00:29:50,977 --> 00:29:52,938
Why don't you take a hit, mija.

776
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:54,147
It'll chill you out.

777
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:55,941
It'll be like back in the days.

778
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:57,150
Remember?

779
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:58,276
No, I don't remember shit.

780
00:29:58,318 --> 00:29:59,694
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

781
00:29:59,694 --> 00:30:00,362
I said put it out.

782
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,616
You know you want this, pig.

783
00:30:05,242 --> 00:30:08,370
I wouldn't fucking touch that if you were the last bitch on earth.

784
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:09,579
Fuck you.

785
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:10,622
No, fuck you.

786
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:11,623
Why don't you take a seat.

787
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:13,418
You look in the mirror, you're just a common fucking gangster bitch (on) like all the rest.

788
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:13,875
Lock it up, Orozco.

789
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,711
Why don't you sit your ass down.

790
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:18,463
Why don't you do what the fuck they tell you, puppet?

791
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:19,214
Want me to make you?

792
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:19,881
Lock it up, partner.

793
00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:21,884
You know what?

794
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,846
I'll fucking sit down now.

795
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:25,888
Thank you.

796
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,181
Thank you very much.

797
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:41,446
So Mr. Big Evil... why do they call you Big Evil?

798
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:47,119
Because ... my evil is big.

799
00:31:06,973 --> 00:31:09,559
Can you turn down the music, because we got a noise complaint or some shit.

800
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,640
Then you go faster.

801
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:47,831
I am nailing this.

802
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,400
Hey bro.

803
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07,680
Hey.

804
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,280
Hi baby.

805
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,760
Cindy, what's up?

806
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,320
I wanted to introduce you to Janet.

807
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,960
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

808
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,640
Happy birthday.

809
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,040
You look beautiful.

810
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,800
Thank you.

811
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,280
Pick up your dress so you don't step on it.

812
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,760
Yeah.

813
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,280
You look beautiful.

814
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:19,880
I gotta go.

815
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,320
Bye!

816
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,760
Bye

817
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,400
All grown up.

818
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
He spoils her.

819
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,440
But I want to give you the lowdown.

820
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,680
I'm listening.

821
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,640
Everybody here is pretty much family.

822
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,800
Like somehow.

823
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,200
They're all Mexican family.

824
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,760
You got cousins and you got aunts and uncles just like everything else and then you got cousins' cousins. And then you have Brian.

825
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,920
You stick around, you're going to see someone throw up.

826
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,840
Couple fights.

827
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,720
It's fun.

828
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,280
It's fun.

829
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,200
Enough, enough.

830
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,600
I'm sorry.

831
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,320
Well, I'm Irish, so it's the same thing..

832
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,720
Big families, and no one gets divorced.

833
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,080
And they all wear purple.

834
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,480
Well, less purple... but just as much beer.

835
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,360
They get way too drunk and get in fistfights.

836
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah, same here.

837
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,200
But you mess with one person you have the whole family after you.

838
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
That's the way to do it.

839
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
There you go.

840
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,400
You just described Mexican people.

841
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,520
Can I feel it?

842
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,480
Is that ok?

843
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,720
Yeah, he's actually kicking a lot right now.

844
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,200
And I think his feet are right there.

845
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,680
Do you feel it?

846
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,080
Wow.

847
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,160
Oh my god.

848
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,640
I like her, Brian.

849
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:12,960
Buddy.

850
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,080
How long have you know Brian?.

851
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,000
Three years.

852
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,880
He and Mike went to the Academy together.

853
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,840
Right.

854
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,360
Brian, it's you.

855
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,000
Hi.

856
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,920
I'm going to try not to wake you up.

857
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,560
I can't believe that I stayed over.

858
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,560
This is interesting.

859
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,240
I have never shot one before.

860
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,160
Maybe that could be our next date.

861
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,440
I did go through your wallet.

862
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,120
I'm sorry.

863
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,520
I am naturally curious.

864
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,720
I hope that's ok.

865
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,640
Gotta love a guys who has a picture of his mom in his wallet.

866
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,120
This?

867
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,680
Kristin, Mia, Raquel, etcetera, etcetera... You won't be needing this anymore.

868
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,000
You were drooling.

869
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
What are we looking for again?

870
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,800
All the food groups: dope, money and guns.

871
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,080
The ghetto will provide.

872
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,360
Fucking Sarge.

873
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,000
Serge, We're staking out Curbside.

874
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,280
They're going to spot your unit.

875
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,600
You think they don't know you're here?

876
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,200
Van Hauser wants to file a complaint on you, Taylor.

877
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,880
The USS Van Hauser?

878
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,189
LAPD's stealthiest submarine, only surfaces at the end of watch?

879
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:16,240
He said you were videotaping him.

880
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,760
What did I tell you about that shit?

881
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,240
Why is he such a bitter dude?

882
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,160
If he hates pushing the black and white so much, why doesn't he just leave his badge

883
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,680
on the watch commander's desk and go home and eat a bowl of dicks?

884
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,440
Have some empathy for this man.

885
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,960
Taylor, I gotta put in m log that I verbally counseled you about this fucking camera.

886
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,680
What?

887
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,200
I was documenting a crime scene.

888
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,520
Have a good day, ladies.

889
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,760
Take it easy.

890
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,560
Is that Big Evil's mom right there?

891
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,320
His mom?

892
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah, that's Mrs.Evil.

893
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,800
Who's the cowboy?

894
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,080
I don't know.

895
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,040
He's got money, look at his truck.

896
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,160
I'm going to run him.

897
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,320
You want to jam this fool?

898
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,280
Yes I do.

899
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,400
Plate's clean.

900
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,000
Shit.

901
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,520
What's our PC?

902
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,480
That stupid CD hanging from his rearview mirror, obstructing his vision.

903
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,600
Let's do this.

904
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,600
All right-.

905
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,120
Come on, fucker.

906
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,200
Wait wait wait.

907
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,760
Light them up.

908
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,960
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen, we're code six on three nine street east of Wall.

909
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,040
License plate four boy one seven three two.

910
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,000
Grey Dodge pickup.

911
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,960
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

912
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,320
Let's get this fucker.

913
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,600
We stopped you because a CD is hanging from your mirror. Get out of the truck.

914
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,880
Gun!

915
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,200
Get the fuck out of the car... Get the fuck out of the car.

916
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,400
You good, partner?

917
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,400
I'm good.

918
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,920
X twenty five shows code six with x thirteen.

919
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Thirteen x two five, roger.

920
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,200
You ok?

921
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,120
***

922
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,280
Transport this son of a bitch.

923
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,920
No problem.

924
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,440
Check out this motherfucker's burner.

925
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,080
Holy shit.

926
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,040
He's got more bling than the old lady's wedding ring.

927
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,440
A cell.

928
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
You don't have any holes in you?

929
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm good.

930
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,320
Let's toss the truck.

931
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,480
Who was he shooting at?

932
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,560
What?

933
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,680
Who was he shooting at?

934
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,440
Me.

935
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,120
That's fucked up.

936
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,840
Air eleven, show us responding.

937
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,960
Fucking ... soup.

938
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,360
What's up?

939
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,560
That's big money right there.

940
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,520
Shit.

941
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,360
Oh shit.

942
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,680
What the fuck is it?

943
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,880
Homeboy's a player.

944
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,400
We got a surprise for you.

945
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,840
Liberace's AK.

946
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,800
Holy shit.

947
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,320
Here we have two of the major food groups: money and guns.

948
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,640
This is the lifeblood of our organization.

949
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,520
Paperwork.

950
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:22,080
The way red corpuscles carry oxygen through the body... paperwork carries information through the department.

951
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,440
What are corpuscles?

952
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,080
Evening, guys.

953
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,640
How you doing, captain?

954
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Sir.

955
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,000
So this is it?

956
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,680
These are the guns you took off the Cowboy?

957
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,600
Yes sir.

958
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,360
Mind if I pick them up?

959
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,240
Fancy.

960
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,440
That's some nice hardware.

961
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,920
I heard he took a shot at you.

962
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,560
Are you ok?

963
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,240
Yeah, I'm fine.

964
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm good.

965
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,640
Liberace's AK.

966
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,000
Looks like Liberace's AK.

967
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,240
Keep up the good work, guys.

968
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,960
I really appreciate it.

969
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,720
Carry on.

970
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,640
Thank you.

971
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,360
Good evening, sir.

972
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,080
Good night, Van Hauser.

973
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,040
Evening, sir.

974
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,840
Why do you get nervous?

975
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,320
Women want him, men want to be him, man.

976
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,320
He's just…

977
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:57,760
Yeah, I know.

978
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,440
But you want him.

979
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,960
I'm not gay, but I'd go down on him if he asked.

980
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,560
Sometimes I don't know when you're kidding.

981
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,560
And I have to know when you're kidding.

982
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,920
I'm not kidding.

983
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,080
I gotta know when you're kidding.

984
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,640
I'm not kidding.

985
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,600
I gotta go.

986
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,600
I'm taking Janet to the Philharmonic.

987
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,760
Enjoy your white people shit.

988
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,280
Thanks, I'll bring you back a burrito.

989
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,360
No problem.

990
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,800
Hey ma, what's up, let's slide, all right, all  right…  And we gonna get it on tonight.

993
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:53,699
So ma, what's up, let's slide, all right, all  right… And we gonna get it on tonight .

994
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,987
You're the best...

995
00:42:00,702 --> 00:42:01,594
One more time.

996
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,640
Stop.

997
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,000
Stop, man, fuck.

998
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,760
What are you going to say to the taxpayers when you crash the fucking car?

999
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,000
Drink more coffee.

1000
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,480
I'm on my ninth fucking Red Bull.

1001
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,480
We got a fire.

1002
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,120
Where?

1003
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,720
Go left.

1004
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,160
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, we're code six on a structure fire.

1005
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,880
What's that address?

1006
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,720
One zero zero two.

1007
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,360
One zero zero two Sixth Street.

1008
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,520
Go ahead and send RA and fire.

1009
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,160
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

1010
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,560
My babies- my babies are in there!

1011
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,040
Where?

1012
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,360
They're upstairs in the bedroom.

1013
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,600
Z, no!

1014
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,000
Wait for fire!

1015
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,080
Fuck!

1016
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,960
Over there, kids room.

1017
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,720
Shit.

1018
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,640
It's the kids' room, come on!

1019
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:19,800
Come here.

1020
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,698
Come here, come here.

1021
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:24,539
Go with him!

1022
00:43:24,574 --> 00:43:25,137
- Come on!

1023
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:25,789
Come here.

1024
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:26,969
Wrap your arms around me.

1025
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wrap your legs around me.

1026
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got it.

1027
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:27,729
There you go.

1028
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
I'm going down!

1029
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,200
Come on, come on, come on.

1030
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,880
Come on.

1031
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,200
Yup.

1032
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,280
You all right?

1033
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,840
I'm good.

1034
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,240
I'm good.

1035
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,200
Come on.

1036
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,080
Go go go!

1037
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,160
I'm going.

1038
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,040
Fuck!

1039
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,040
Come on, put your head right here.

1040
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,920
Come down!

1041
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,720
Let's go!

1042
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,000
Let's go!

1043
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,600
Come on!

1044
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,840
Where's my baby girl?

1045
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,160
Where is she?

1046
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,800
Wait, lady, you got more kids?

1047
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,680
My girl.

1048
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
She's two.

1049
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,200
Oh shit.

1050
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,480
No! Z, no!

1051
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,880
Come on!

1052
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,400
Go, go go, get up!

1053
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,200
Fuck it's hot.

1054
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,360
God damn it!

1055
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,680
Come here, babe.

1056
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,400
Come here.

1057
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,000
Cover her face.

1058
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,440
Put that blanket around her face.

1059
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:28,920
I got her.

1060
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,840
I can't breathe.

1061
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Come on, go go go.

1062
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,120
I can't see.

1063
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,520
Where you at?

1064
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,440
I'm right here.

1065
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,160
Follow the light.

1066
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,960
I can't see you.

1067
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,480
I'm right here.

1068
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,880
Come on.

1069
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,800
I got it.

1070
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,840
I got her.

1071
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,840
Shit.

1072
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,480
I'm going down.

1073
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,280
Come on.

1074
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,520
All right.

1075
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,960
Stay still.

1076
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,360
Fuck, I got it.

1077
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,240
I fucking can't see out of my...

1078
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,760
Where's Z?

1079
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,200
I'm right here.

1080
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,240
I'm going to check you out, sit down right here.

1081
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,320
Can you open your eyes?

1082
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,080
You all right?

1083
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,240
Give me a bottle of water.

1084
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,720
Get the fuck away!

1085
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
I'm right here.

1086
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,520
I'm right here.

1087
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,880
Get away, get away.

1088
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm right here.

1089
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,840
Fuck.

1090
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,520
Get away.

1091
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,280
I'm right here.

1092
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,200
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1093
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,160
Don't fucking freak out.

1094
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,800
Shut up, shut up We're good, we're good.

1095
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,400
Shut up.

1096
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:20,520
For their selfless actions and their exemplary service to the citizens of this city... the Medal of Valor is presented to Officer Brian Taylor….

1097
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,240
and Officer Miguel Zavala.

1098
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,400
What's up, Sandra?

1099
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,480
Hi Brian.

1100
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,200
You feel like a hero?

1101
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,520
What?

1102
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,320
You feel like a hero?

1103
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,440
No.

1104
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,560
Yeah, me neither.

1105
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,440
What's a hero feel like?

1106
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,160
I don't know.

1107
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,760
Did I tell you that me and Gabby got into a huge fight over the fire?

1108
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,320
Nope, you didn't tell me that.

1109
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:29,200
She's like ‘you could have died for someone else's kid when ours hasn't even been born yet.

1110
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,240
She's like ‘you're not a fireman.

1111
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,600
Janet said the same thing.

1112
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,400
Yeah?

1113
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,960
I don't think I can go into another burning building.

1114
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,240
I only went in because you did.

1115
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,040
Now you know.

1116
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,080
All right, dickhead, what is it?

1117
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,520
You remember that cowboy with the blinged out AK?

1118
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,160
Yeah, he's probably my cousin.

1119
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,760
I crisscrossed some numbers on his cell.

1120
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,480
Couple addresses come up in our basic area.

1121
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,720
You're not a detective.

1122
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,840
That guy is something.

1123
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,440
He's into something.

1124
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,600
Oh really, you think?

1125
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,360
DA didn't buy the ADW and only filed on the weapons beef.

1126
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,200
Gang Unit says they'll get it him but they're too busy or some shit.

1127
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,520
And Narco's not interested because we didn't find dope.

1128
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,520
Yeah, but you're not a detective.

1129
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,600
You're not a fireman.

1130
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,280
Fuck you.

1131
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,320
Follow me into the house, dude.

1132
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,040
I said you're not a detective.

1133
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,920
I want to be a detective.

1134
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,600
You wanna be?

1135
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,840
Follow me into the house, dude.

1136
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,240
Follow me into the house.

1137
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,440
Follow me into the house.

1138
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,400
Thirteen-x-thirteen with a code six at ninethree one eight five three street.

1139
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,680
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

1140
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,560
The fuck?

1141
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,280
What the fuck?

1142
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,640
This is weird.

1143
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,960
Thirteen x-ray thirteen, you need to send us additional unit.

1144
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,960
Thirteen-x-thirteen is requesting two additional units for a building search at one zero zero two six street.

1145
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,480
It's ok, it's ok.

1146
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,520
it's ok.

1147
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,840
Open the door.

1148
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,440
It's ok. Goodbye.

1149
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,760
Fuck this guy.

1150
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,640
Get that shit out of here.

1151
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,760
I know what that means.

1152
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,640
Shut the fuck up.

1153
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,680
Spread your legs.

1154
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,160
Spread your fucking legs.

1155
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,440
Put your fucking head back.

1156
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,480
Gun, partner.

1157
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,440
Oh yeah?

1158
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,160
Get your fucking head back.

1159
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,600
Another gun, partner.

1160
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,600
Two?

1161
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,320
Wads of cash.

1162
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,720
Tell him to get on his knees.

1163
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,200
Get the fuck over here.

1164
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,000
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen.

1165
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,720
We've got one in custody.

1166
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,320
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

1167
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,400
All right, we're good.

1168
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,400
All right.

1169
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,600
What do we got?

1170
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,800
Check it out, partner.

1171
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,120
I got this motherfucker.

1172
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,040
Oh my god.

1173
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,080
Take my buddy.

1174
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,720
What the fuck, Zavala, you catch them, I clean them?

1175
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,640
Take him.

1176
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,760
I don't know, we got like-

1177
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,120
I'm going to go outside.

1178
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:05,880
Z, you good?

1179
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,400
I'm good.

1180
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:06,800
Z!

1181
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,440
I'm good.

1182
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,720
What are you doing with all these people?

1183
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,760
You're a fucking asshole.

1184
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,800
Asshole.

1185
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,760
What the fuck?

1186
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:17,720
Federal agents.

1187
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,000
Who's in charge here?

1188
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Are you in charge?

1189
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,080
What the fuck.

1190
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,160
I need to know who's in charge here.

1191
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,680
Is this man under arrest?

1192
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,240
Yes sir.

1193
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,680
What are the charges against this man?

1194
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,160
Turn that fucking camera off.

1195
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,600
It's off.

1196
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,400
Get that fucking camera off me.

1197
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,600
You guys fucked up.

1198
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,640
Just lost a POI because of you guys.

1199
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,040
Are we clear in there?

1200
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:34,760
Clear.

1201
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,800
What the fuck?

1202
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,280
What did we fuck up?

1203
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,200
I don't fucking know, dude.

1204
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,680
Who the fuck is this guy?

1205
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,680
I don't fucking know.

1206
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,760
We have one POI.

1207
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,280
I just want to fucking talk to this guy.

1208
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,080
Let's just get out of here.

1209
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,560
I just want to fucking talk to him just for a second.

1210
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,400
Go ahead.

1211
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,560
I don't want to cause any trouble here, but we just fucking – we rolled up here, I don't know what's going on.

1212
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,040
This is the second cowboy like this we've run into in a week.

1213
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,680
Watch out for these guys.

1214
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,280
They operate by a different set of rules.

1215
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,920
I know I'm just a ghetto street cop but you've got to give me something here.

1216
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,600
We've got indicators he's a runner for the Sinaloa Cartel.

1217
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,640
We ran him, he came up clean.

1218
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,400
You guys don't have the proper clearance for any of this information, but I'm going to throw you a bone.

1219
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,400
Cartels are operating here.

1220
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,480
We're on it.

1221
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,400
Be careful.

1222
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,920
What does that mean though?

1223
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,160
It means you and your homeboy need to power down.

1224
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,280
Because you just tugged on the tail of the snake and it's going to turn around and bite you back.

1225
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,400
I'm throwing you a bone here.

1226
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,840
Be grateful for what I'm giving you.

1227
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,520
I'm giving you a warning.

1228
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,120
Lay low.

1229
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,680
Can I get your name for my log.?

1230
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,960
Negative, move along.

1231
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,080
Yeah, all right.

1232
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,320
You know there's five year old kids in there?

1233
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,680
For six months?

1234
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,600
Good bye.

1235
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,840
Get off the crime scene.

1236
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,720
Go home.

1237
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,120
Bye.

1238
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,880
Have a nice night.

1239
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,880
Yeah. Fucking feds.

1240
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,200
Z, what the fuck?

1241
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,160
Fuck them.

1242
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,920
I didn't think that shit came over here.

1243
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,360
Kids, women.

1244
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,480
Did you see that fucking toilet?

1245
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,440
Filled up with shit.

1246
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,660
We had no fucking business being there.

1247
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,780
We didn't even have a call there.

1248
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,580
I didn't know what we were fucking rolling up on.

1249
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,020
You think I knew what we were rolling up on?

1250
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,780
It's human trafficking.

1251
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,500
He's so cute.

1252
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,100
You did so good.

1253
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,660
I love this smell.

1254
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,020
Just hold his head a little bit.

1255
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,340
I am.

1256
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,020
He's fine.

1257
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,020
You gotta hold him like this, like a football.

1258
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,660
I know how to hold a baby.

1259
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,740
Babe, please.

1260
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,420
Like that.

1261
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,460
Hey.

1262
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,100
Hi!

1263
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,980
Hey partner, what's up?

1264
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,420
Come here.

1265
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,020
Look who's here.

1266
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,900
How's mama doing?

1267
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,420
Mama's tired and cranky.

1268
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,340
Just like baby.

1269
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,180
Mama wants to choke Daddy.

1270
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,380
Come on, babe.

1271
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,100
Did you name him Brian?

1272
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,500
Sorry.

1273
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,420
He's a junior.

1274
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,700
Named him after his daddy.

1275
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,060
So what's his name?

1276
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,740
Fuck you.

1277
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,020
Can I hold him?

1278
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:17,900
Yeah.

1279
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,540
So sweet.

1280
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,420
You're so done.

1281
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,220
Hey baby.

1282
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,780
What are you wearing?

1283
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,220
I can say it.

1284
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:52,900
What are you wearing?

1285
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:55,900
I don't care.

1286
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,580
You still look good.

1287
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,220
Yeah, Brian's right here.

1288
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,420
OK.

1289
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,580
All right, sorry.

1290
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,060
OK, I love you.

1291
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:04,540
Bye.

1292
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,460
You didn't even say hi.

1293
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,980
She was pissed.

1294
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,500
How'd you know you were going to marry Gabby?

1295
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,220
She told me.

1296
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,512
I was just some stoner working at my uncle's muffler shop and one day she grabbed me by the shoulders...

1297
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:21,542
and said ‘we're getting married and you're joining the department'

1298
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:24,740
because you can make a lot of money without a college degree and I was like ‘fuck yeah'.

1299
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,780
I mean, you love her.

1300
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,060
You guys, you never fight.

1301
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,300
You're happy together.

1302
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,620
She's my bitch for sure.

1303
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,540
I'm just telling you the way it went down.

1304
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,820
I popped her cherry in high school.

1305
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,180
She's never been with anybody else.

1306
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,660
I've never wanted to be with anybody else.

1307
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,180
You know, it's easy.

1308
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,740
Things are getting super serious with Janet and me.

1309
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,100
What, you just found that out?

1310
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,900
Did you read that in the paper or something?

1311
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,500
Homegirl owns your ass.

1312
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,540
She wants to move in.

1313
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:54,340
She's always over.

1314
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,780
Why spend the money on two apartments.

1315
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:57,620
It's not about the money.

1316
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,580
No, her parents are so traditional.

1317
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,620
Oh yeah?

1318
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,420
They will go ballistic.

1319
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,020
But at least we can tell them we're engaged.

1320
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:06,740
Hold up.

1321
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,180
Don't play with that shit.

1322
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:12,500
You don't ask a broad to marry you because her folks are old school.

1323
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,580
No, you don't understand.

1324
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,380
No, you don't do that shit.

1325
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,820
Think about it.

1326
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,700
After you think about it, think about it again.

1327
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,180
Jesus.

1328
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,020
Marriage is forever.

1329
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,220
Just realize that.

1330
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,700
It's a promise before god.

1331
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,060
My grandma was really deep.

1332
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,420
She's seen it all.

1333
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,820
You know what I'm saying?

1334
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,660
When me and Gabby got engaged, she asked me one thing.

1335
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,540
Do you want to hear it?

1336
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,860
Fine, let's hear it.

1337
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,140
She said can you live without her?

1338
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,420
And if the answer's yes, man up and forget her.

1339
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,700
Don't string her along.

1340
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,140
Think about it.

1341
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,420
I did.

1342
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,180
Thirteen-x-ray- forty-three.

1343
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,060
Officer needs help.

1344
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:12,740
Where?

1345
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,180
Newton units, stand by.

1346
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,420
X forty-three officer needs help.

1347
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,020
Thirteen x forty-three, what's your location?

1348
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,140
I don't know.

1349
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:18,820
What?

1350
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,180
That's Van Hauser's car.

1351
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:20,980
Come on, Boot!

1352
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,820
Just book it south.

1353
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:22,380
Go.

1354
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,980
Find a street sign, put it out.

1355
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,500
I don't see any!

1356
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,500
***

1357
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,540
Is there a number on a house?

1358
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:30,140
A building number?

1359
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,140
The house is three one seven seven.

1360
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,260
Sir, back up!

1361
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,620
Holy shit.

1362
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,820
Hook a left on Maple.

1363
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,740
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen show us responding code three from three zero and Maple.

1364
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,180
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger.

1365
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,940
Responding code three Maple and three zero.

1366
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:45,820
Right there!

1367
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,540
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen show us code six at Compton and three one street.

1368
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,340
Who is that?

1369
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,580
Taylor and Zavala.

1370
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,540
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, send me an airship to set up a perimeter.

1371
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,540
Oh shit.

1372
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:58,860
Would you call for a rescue?

1373
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,900
Do not move.

1374
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,580
What did he look like?

1375
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,020
Where'd he go?

1376
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,420
Northbound through the houses.

1377
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,740
Hispanic male, blue checkered shirt.

1378
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,380
Zerohead, he's a parolee, he's fucking huge.

1379
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:13,180
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, suspect headed northbound, heavyset male Hispanic, shaved head.

1380
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,860
Weapon used was a knife.

1381
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,580
Let's do this shit.

1382
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,460
Careful, men.

1383
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:17,900
On your left.

1384
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,620
He's fucking huge.

1385
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,060
It's clear over here.

1386
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:22,660
Crossing.

1387
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:23,860
The windows?

1388
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,540
You got left?

1389
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,620
I got right.

1390
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,580
Push push push.

1391
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,620
You're on my elbow.

1392
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,420
You call it out.

1393
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,140
You call it out if you see it.

1394
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:33,740
I see him.

1395
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,300
On the left.

1396
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:34,740
On the left.

1397
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,740
Ready, go go, split.

1398
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,020
Take it, you bitch.

1399
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:37,580
Fuck you!

1400
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,180
On the left.

1401
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:38,740
I've got him, you ready?

1402
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:39,660
Fucking bitch.

1403
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:40,180
Fucking whore.

1404
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,420
Try to fuck with me?

1405
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:41,860
Fuck you!

1406
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,060
Get the fuck off her or I will blow your fucking head off.

1407
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:44,820
I'm done.

1408
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:45,540
I ain't resisting, officer.

1409
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,700
Don't fucking look at me!

1410
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,860
I ain't resisting, sir.

1411
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,620
Shut the fuck up!

1412
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,300
Get up.

1413
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,620
Put your hands over your head.

1414
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,140
Get up.

1415
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,580
Put your hands over your head.

1416
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,140
Back up towards me til I tell you to stop.

1417
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,340
Move.

1418
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,220
Move.

1419
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:58,980
Move.

1420
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,140
Move.

1421
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:00,660
Stop.

1422
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,740
Now get on your fucking knees.

1423
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,780
And cross your goddamn feet together, you hear me?

1424
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,700
Cross your legs.

1425
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,420
If I hear a fucking word out of you, I will blowyou out of your fucking socks.

1426
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,180
Hook him, Z.

1427
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,460
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen, show a code four.

1428
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,140
Suspect's in custody.

1429
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,780
You good, Z?

1430
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:22,260
I'm good.

1431
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:22,660
Are you good?

1432
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,140
God damn it.

1433
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,260
All right, you're going to be all right.

1434
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,180
You're going to be all right.

1435
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,940
Fuck man, her face is all fucking broken.

1436
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,260
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen requesting an additional RA.

1437
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,220
Thirteen-x-thirteen, roger on the RA.

1438
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,980
We're here for you, all right?

1439
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,340
We got the cavalry coming.

1440
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,860
That motherfucker's going to pay for what he did, you hear me?

1441
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,580
Boot, you hear me?

1442
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:44,780
Boot?

1443
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,340
Don't call her Boot.

1444
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,540
Well I don't know what her fucking name is.

1445
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,740
Is there a tag anywhere?

1446
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,420
Do you see a tag?

1447
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:48,820
No.

1448
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,100
You hearing me?

1449
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,580
She's nodding, she's nodding, she hears me.

1450
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,260
You're going to be all right.

1451
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,020
Do you hear me?

1452
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:56,700
It's all good.

1453
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,260
It's all good.

1454
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:04,740
You're going to be OK, brother.

1455
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,100
Fucking cut my vest off.

1456
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,180
God damn it.

1457
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:08,100
I tell you one fucking thing.

1458
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:11,740
Fucking cut my vest off.

1459
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:12,740
All right, we got your back.

1460
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,180
Jesus Christ.

1461
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:15,580
God damn it.

1462
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,220
Get back, all right.

1463
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:16,860
You're good.

1464
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,180
We got your back.

1465
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,620
They cut my fucking vest.

1466
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,020
They cut my fucking vest.

1467
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,420
What's up?

1468
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:23,820
You OK?

1469
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,460
I'm really tired.

1470
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,580
Why didn't you shoot that son of a bitch?

1471
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,580
You had him dead to rights.

1472
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,220
I just didn't feel like killing anyone tonight, Sarge.

1473
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,580
You feel like writing this up?

1474
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,620
Brass is going to want clean paper, make sure all the logs match.

1475
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,460
Sarge, did you see that?

1476
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,020
Van H had a fucking Ginsu sticking out of his eye.

1477
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:42,660
His eye was cut in half.

1478
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,140
The lens was hanging out.

1479
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,540
He's not coming back.

1480
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,180
Rookie too.

1481
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,380
What?

1482
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:48,820
She ain't coming back.

1483
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,980
She gave me this to give to the Watch commander.

1484
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:51,900
On the spot?

1485
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,660
Yeah.

1486
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,540
Oh well, she wouldn't have made probation anyway.

1487
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,260
Hell no.

1488
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,700
What, because her daddy's not a captain?

1489
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,340
You know she wasn't cut out for this shit.

1490
01:02:59,380 --> 01:02:59,980
Why is that?

1491
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,220
The evidence.

1492
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,780
She almost got Van Hauser killed.

1493
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,860
You guys are cold.

1494
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,540
You got cold, dead eyes, you know that?

1495
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:06,820
Yeah, both of us.

1496
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,260
Yeah, both of you.

1497
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:08,700
You have a soul?

1498
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,540
Yes, we just leave it at home.

1499
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,980
We going to sit around yapping or we going to get this done?

1500
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,460
You guys saved that rookie's life.

1501
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
That was one big fucking fat ese.

1502
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,180
Can we clear the scene?

1503
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,700
Division's fucking falling apart over here.

1504
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:21,500
We good?

1505
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:21,980
You good?

1506
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:22,940
Good good good?

1507
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:23,980
We're all good.

1508
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:24,260
Yes?

1509
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:24,820
Go back to work.

1510
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:25,940
Good night, ladies.

1511
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:33,300
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Officer and Mrs.

1512
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:34,258
Taylor.

1513
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:48,116
What's up, guys.

1514
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,140
All right.

1515
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:26,420
Janet, you got a lot of heart hooking up with a cop.

1516
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:32,940
Because it takes a strong person... and I see like a lot of cops' wives in here, they're all nodding their heads.

1517
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,660
You gotta take care of her.

1518
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:43,380
Cause I'm her big brother now. And every cop in here... we're all her family now too.

1519
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,980
I'm going to cry, baby, shut up.

1520
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:55,500
And Janet, we're all hoping you can make a man out of Brian.

1521
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,620
Because we've all given up.

1522
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,580
So here we go.

1523
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,180
To Brian and Janet.

1524
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,220
Cheers!

1525
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,020
Can I ask you something?

1526
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,300
Why the fuck did you get married in your dress blues?

1527
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:21,180
If you worked at Best Buy would you wear that fucking stupid polo shirt?

1528
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,180
I like that polo shirt.

1529
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:24,620
I'm representing.

1530
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,260
You know I love you, man

1531
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:30,300
Jesus.

1532
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,300
Here they go again.

1533
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,340
I love you too, bro.

1534
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,500
I would lay down my life for you.

1535
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,420
I love you, man.

1536
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,740
I would take a fucking bullet for you.

1537
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,260
I love you, man.

1538
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,060
Why don't you guys get married to each other?

1539
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:42,380
All right, shut up.

1540
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,340
Everybody take a shot.

1541
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,220
Salud!

1542
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,220
Cheers!

1543
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,020
My boy Garcia?

1544
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,700
He's a fucking beast.

1545
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:10,100
I've seen this motherfucker knock an asshole out with one punch.

1546
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,740
Yoked assholes, man.

1547
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:14,380
Yoked assholes from the joint when they had weight piles.

1548
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:15,700
You know what I'm talking about?

1549
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:17,580
You don't know what I'm talking about, you're fucking twelve years old.

1550
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:22,540
Cops like him... Like soldiers.

1551
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:25,980
He took a bullet for me.

1552
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,260
My bullet.

1553
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,820
He took my bullet.

1554
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:36,940
He took my bullet.

1555
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,140
That's what he was.

1556
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,100
That's what he was to me.

1557
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:41,900
It should have been me.

1558
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,380
Cause he was a good guy.

1559
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,140
I was shit.

1560
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,380
Fuck it.

1561
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:01,740
Gimme a kiss.

1562
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:03,940
You'll learn this.

1563
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:04,540
You'll learn.

1564
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,100
Marriage is really basic.

1565
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,780
There's just a couple guidelines.

1566
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,340
One: you've got to give it up all the time.

1567
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:15,700
All the time.

1568
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,500
You love that.

1569
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,900
I don't hate that idea.

1570
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,500
It's not a bad idea.

1571
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,100
It's not a bad thing.

1572
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,260
No, seriously, girls throw it at cops.

1573
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,620
Throw what exactly?

1574
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:26,540
Their pussy.

1575
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,100
Girls throw it.

1576
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,460
So you can't give him an excuse, girlfriend.

1577
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,980
You can not give him an excuse.

1578
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,060
I've actually seen that before.

1579
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,620
It's called assault on a peace officer.

1580
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:36,980
You ready?

1581
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,340
Hell yeah.

1582
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,180
Try new things.

1583
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:39,500
Baby...

1584
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,380
Like the gooch.

1585
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,740
The what?

1586
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,340
The gooch?

1587
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,300
Texas twister.

1588
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:47,780
No, that's something that's made up.

1589
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,220
The internet made that up.

1590
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,540
You want to know what Mike likes?

1591
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,180
No!

1592
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,220
No!

1593
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,180
Babe, I love you so much.

1594
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,860
The western, you know?

1595
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,740
Open to explore, right?

1596
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,380
Gabby!

1597
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:03,660
It's our wedding!

1598
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,620
Cup him.

1599
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:05,380
Suck him.

1600
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:05,940
No no no!

1601
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,260
You just rub it a bit and then….

1602
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:07,700
What the fuck?

1603
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,100
Gabby!

1604
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,220
Venture off a little more.

1605
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:10,420
Venture off?

1606
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,100
They swear they don't like it but...

1607
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:12,020
Shit!

1608
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,700
Really?

1609
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,740
I'm happy.

1610
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:22,900
Janet's dope.

1611
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,580
You're my brother and everything, but you're a piece of shit.

1612
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:36,940
Does she know that?

1613
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:41,340
Yeah, she knows who I am.

1614
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:50,820
I mean, you can't get into something with somebody without ... She knows who I am.

1615
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:52,860
Yeah.

1616
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:53,460
I know who you are.

1617
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:55,700
You're a piece of shit.

1618
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,260
If you break her heart, I'm going to fuck you up.

1619
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,660
Good to know.

1620
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,620
If anything happened to you, I would take care of your kids.

1621
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:18,380
If you had any.

1622
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:20,780
And I would take care of her.

1623
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,260
I would take care of Janet.

1624
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,100
What's in the stack?

1625
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:47,620
Anything good?

1626
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,420
Let's see here... Business dispute.

1627
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:52,500
Request police mediation.

1628
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,580
One neighbor threw a cup of water on the other neighbor's window.

1629
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,740
We're not buying that.

1630
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:57,460
Three ninety male.

1631
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,980
Intoxicated person outside a liquor store.

1632
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,380
Get the fuck out of here.

1633
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,740
There's a drunk man outside the liquor store?

1634
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:05,740
Welfare check.

1635
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,180
Woman requests PD contact her elderly mother.

1636
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,060
Yeah, buy that one.

1637
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:10,020
You serious?

1638
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,700
Yeah, if we buy a couple of these, maybe they'll send us a code three call.

1639
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:13,940
Cool.

1640
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,980
I'll hit her up for the next hotshots.

1641
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,980
On this episode, we're rolling to a call.

1642
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:21,340
A woman called the station to check on her elderly mother.

1643
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:22,380
So we're going to go.

1644
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,100
These are the calls most agencies deal with, you know?

1645
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,580
Not every call's a foot pursuit or a car chase.

1646
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:31,140
Some guys at other agencies have never even drawn their weapon or been in a gunfight.

1647
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,860
Yeah, but here that's just half your shift.

1648
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:33,820
In the south end...

1649
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:38,500
we'll get involved in more capers in one deployment period than most cops see their entire career.

1650
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:39,500
Hell yeah.

1651
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,540
Mrs. Williams!

1652
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,700
Mrs.Williams!

1653
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:52,060
Police Officers!

1654
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,220
Go around back, check it out.

1655
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:54,940
All right.

1656
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:55,540
Here we go.

1657
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,420
I'm going to wait for my partner.

1658
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,540
He's going to check the back to see if she's around the back over there.

1659
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,660
Often times, a lot of these people, they're very old people.

1660
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,020
They can't hear us.

1661
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:10,300
You know, they can't hear – the hearing aids, you know.

1662
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,460
Nothing.

1663
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,420
So the owner of this house is actually the daughter of the woman who lives in it.

1664
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:20,860
She gave us permission for the welfare check, so we're going to... We're going to boot the door.

1665
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,420
Officer Zavala specializes in booting doors.

1666
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,660
I kick doors down.

1667
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,660
There you go.

1668
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,900
I kick doors down.

1669
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,660
Say it in English now.

1670
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,060
I kick doors down.

1671
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,580
Wait, did you check if it was unlocked?

1672
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:40,820
Ladies and gentlemen, always a good idea to make sure a door is locked ... before you boot it.

1673
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:41,940
Are you going to cut that out?

1674
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:42,900
Yeah, sorry.

1675
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:44,300
It was always locked.

1676
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,500
Clearly my partner always knew that.

1677
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:48,020
You know what's going to happen, right?

1678
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,460
What?

1679
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:52,100
She's going to roll through, come from the church or the store or whatever.

1680
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,100
And then she's going to see property damage and what's going to happen?

1681
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:55,500
What's going to happen?

1682
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,060
We're going to be the bad guys.

1683
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,300
Shit.

1684
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:03,940
We got a dead body.

1685
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,500
What have we got?

1686
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:20,060
Squatters?

1687
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,740
Yeah, I'd say someone's been kicking it back here for sure.

1688
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:24,980
LAPD

1689
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,340
Let's roll through.

1690
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:42,820
You good?

1691
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:43,340
Clear.

1692
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,100
That is wrong.

1693
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:52,900
I said it was clear.

1694
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:53,340
All right.

1695
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,620
I'm just filming it.

1696
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:09,660
I found her.

1697
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:10,460
What's up?

1698
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:26,740
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, I'm going to need a supervisor and two additional units at our location.

1699
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:30,980
And RA for the elderly female approximately seventy years old.

1700
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,140
Not conscious, not breathing.

1701
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:38,180
Thirteen x thirteen's requesting two additional units and a supervisor.

1702
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,620
Five one seven one Maple.

1703
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:42,500
Incident one four six seven, RA thirteen fifty-   one.

1704
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:45,380
What is she, grandma praying to the dope gods or some shit?

1705
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,100
That's not fucking grandma.

1706
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,620
Don't fucking play on them.

1707
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:55,300
No, look.

1708
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:56,660
Hollow.

1709
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,820
Somebody's opened it before.

1710
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,060
That's what that means.

1711
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,100
Take that shit out.

1712
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,860
You can't pull it out yourself?

1713
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,900
Just fucking pull it out.

1714
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:18,380
Party time.

1715
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:27,620
Z... No, wait wait wait.

1716
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:28,940
What?

1717
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:29,660
Do you see that pot?

1718
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:30,820
Yeah.

1719
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:33,860
That shit's still steaming.

1720
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:34,580
Oh shit.

1721
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:35,300
I'm going in.

1722
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:35,980
Ready?

1723
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:36,340
Go ahead.

1724
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,260
What is that?

1725
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:55,740
Is that a body?

1726
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:58,300
Yeah, there's bodies in there.

1727
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,820
Thanks for the fucking update.

1728
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,620
Fuck.

1729
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,580
Is it clear?

1730
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,460
Clear.

1731
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:09,700
What does it say?

1732
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:11,420
What's that shit say?

1733
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,660
Keep bringing them.

1734
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,180
Ha ha ha.

1735
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:19,380
Fuck!

1736
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:19,820
Come on.

1737
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:22,100
Get your shit together.

1738
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,140
Pull your shit together.

1739
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:32,500
Fuck out of here.

1740
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:33,940
Let's get out of here.

1741
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:37,620
Fuck.

1742
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:39,980
Sick motherfuckers.

1743
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,220
Who would do shit like that?

1744
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,140
What is that shit?

1745
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:58,940
I don't fucking know.

1746
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:01,380
I've never seen that kind of shit.

1747
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,300
Do you have hand sanitizer?

1748
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,180
No, I don't.

1749
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:13,060
I'm Serene Branson on the scene in south Los Angeles at one of the largest narcotics seizures this year.

1750
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,420
In addition to the drugs, officials are telling us there was a very gruesome discovery.

1751
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:20,820
An unknown number of bodies showing evidence of torture.

1752
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:27,660
A police official familiar with the investigation denied rumors Mexican drug cartels are responsible for the murders.

1753
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,540
We're having a lot of problems.

1754
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:37,340
The Lord of the South wants something done.

1755
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:41,620
This is just two city cops, right?

1756
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,820
Yes, two city cops.

1757
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,260
Take care of these assholes or I'll take care of you.

1758
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:47,820
Got a problem with that?

1759
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:49,540
Consider it done.

1760
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,020
And don't leave a mess.

1761
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:56,580
People hate cops, people in gangs.

1762
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,940
Write down what you spend. I'll get it done.

1763
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:20,620
Gabby wants to know if you and Janet want to roll to the Dodgers game with us tonight.

1764
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,980
We're going to Santa Barbara.

1765
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:26,100
All right, fuck you then, I'll sell that shit online or something.

1766
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,340
Here's Tre right here.

1767
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,140
What's up, Tre?

1768
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:33,820
What's up back.

1769
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:36,740
What you doing?

1770
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,780
I'm doing what I do, you know what I'm saying?

1771
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,540
Same shit, different day.

1772
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:41,980
Ain't shit changed.

1773
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,020
What's up with you all?

1774
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:44,980
Just slow motion.

1775
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:46,740
And that little incident you and I had?

1776
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,340
You kept it G.

1777
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:50,340
You didn't snitch on me.

1778
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:51,460
And I respect that.

1779
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:55,700
So check this out, my people just got out of Folsom prison.

1780
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,380
From up north.

1781
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,020
Oh yeah?

1782
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,500
Word is you got a hit on you all.

1783
01:18:58,540 --> 01:18:59,660
You all been greenlit.

1784
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,940
We're cops, everybody wants to kill us.

1785
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,820
I'm just telling you what they're saying.

1786
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:09,500
No, you know what, we appreciate the info, but this don't mean you get a pass if we catch you slipping.

1787
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,020
I ain't looking for no fucking pass.

1788
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,660
I do what I do, you know what I'm saying?

1789
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,660
I had to say it, though, you know how it is.

1790
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,740
All right, what you doing this weekend?

1791
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:17,860
You like the Dodgers?

1792
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,420
You going to slide a nigger some tickets or something?

1793
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:20,620
You like the Dodgers?

1794
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:21,420
Have a good weekend.

1795
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,060
Slide me some tickets.

1796
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,220
Shut the fuck up!

1797
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:34,940
Did you fuck with my... come on, did you fuck with my shit?

1798
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,820
I don't fuck with your shit.

1799
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,540
Mike, come on.

1800
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,940
Don't be a little bitch about it.

1801
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:42,300
I didn't fuck with your shit.

1802
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,340
You fucked with my shit.

1803
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,620
It was in totally different order.

1804
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:46,500
Why do you have an investigation report on here?

1805
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,860
I don't have an investigation report on there.

1806
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,780
It's your handwriting.

1807
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,220
Don't be an idiot.

1808
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,340
All this is fucked up.

1809
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,780
Did you drop it or something?

1810
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,660
There's three types of pages.

1811
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,940
It's all out of order.

1812
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:58,460
It's all fucking out of order.

1813
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,300
No, it's a pain in the ass.

1814
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,100
I'm sorry, partner.

1815
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,580
Wait until they hit a small street.

1816
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,180
At a stop sign, you fucking tap the bumper, we're going to get out and blast.

1817
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:10,820
Fuck no.

1818
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,060
What do you mean, no?

1819
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,620
We should get them when they go to lunch at the Chinese place.

1820
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,420
That Chinese place is crawling with cops.

1821
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,100
We gotta get these fuckers when they're alone.

1822
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:20,500
We can fucking follow their asses home and hit them there.

1823
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:24,500
White boy's in fucking Simi Valley and the other fucking fool's in San Gabriel.

1824
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,900
We gotta get these fuckers at the same time.

1825
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,820
This is the one-time, homie.

1826
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,220
Not a bunch of fucking niggers.

1827
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:29,780
Motherfucker.

1828
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,460
This fucker is straight from the fucking SHU.

1829
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,820
You stop fucking around.

1830
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:33,620
You got in the fucking car.

1831
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:38,580
You want to fucking hang with the fucking carnales... now you fucking pay the fucking price of fucking admission, homeboy.

1832
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,660
I'll fucking kill this fucking bitch, all right?

1833
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:41,980
You shut the fuck up.

1834
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:45,100
You get that fucking shit out of my fucking face.

1835
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,260
I'll fucking kill you, motherfucker.

1836
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,380
Don't you fucking disrespect.

1837
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:43,180
Don't worry.

1838
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:44,140
I got this shit.

1839
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:44,780
Fuck.

1840
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:50,540
I don't know where the fucking rubber band is either.

1841
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,140
Don't blame me for the rubber band.

1842
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,540
You just took the rubber band off.

1843
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:58,380
If you hadn't fucking put everything out of order, then the rubber band wouldn't be out and the... Look, it's the butterfly effect, ok?

1844
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,340
Do you know what the butterfly effect is?

1845
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,260
Nope.

1846
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,380
It's the butterfly effect.

1847
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:03,660
Look it up.

1848
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:06,260
Just because you say it twice doesn't mean that I get it the second time.

1849
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:06,980
Look it up.

1850
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,220
This is fucking stupid.

1851
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,020
Those motherfuckers got bulletproof vests.

1852
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,620
We need to hit them with some AKs and shit.

1853
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,380
Don't fucking rank out.

1854
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:15,300
Fuck you!

1855
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,460
When the fuck have I ever backed out from shit?

1856
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,980
Get that fucking camera out of my face.

1857
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:24,660
I'm saying we just can't fuck this shit up.

1858
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,660
I don't give a fuck.

1859
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,020
You know me.

1860
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,700
I'll do the motherfucking time.

1861
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:32,500
I just don't want the big homies fucking whacking me.

1862
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,940
Fucking whacking me for fucking up.

1863
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,220
We need a fucking plan.

1864
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,660
And you fucking know it.

1865
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:41,340
Think about it.

1866
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,660
That's all I'm saying.

1867
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:49,980
Fucking head back.

1868
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,420
I'll get some fucking big guns from the Border Brothers.

1869
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,100
Never fall asleep in a room full of cops.

1870
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,220
That shit ain't even fucking funny.

1871
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:16,100
Just cause you won the fucking award doesn't give you license to be a fucking asshole.

1872
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,140
You got shit on your face.

1873
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,540
What is this?

1874
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,300
Are we in the third fucking grade?

1875
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:24,260
Keep it up, it's going to earn you a risk management case.

1876
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,340
Give me this fucking camera.

1877
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:26,380
He had something....

1878
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,260
I'm serious.

1879
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,860
This department built you up, they will fucking tear you down.

1880
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:31,220
You know it's fucking funny.

1881
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,620
Laugh, you fucking idiot.

1882
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,540
Who left their shaving cream on the table?

1883
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,340
How was Santa Barbara?

1884
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,180
Awesome.

1885
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,380
Janet's pregnant.

1886
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,020
What?

1887
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:55,820
Get out of here.

1888
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:56,940
Are you serious?

1889
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:58,100
Already?

1890
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,740
She's not even Mexican.

1891
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:04,532
Yeah, she's going for the ultrasound tomorrow, but three of those little piss stick things...

1892
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:06,748
Positive, positive, positive.

1893
01:23:06,783 --> 01:23:09,020
Whoa, congrats.

1894
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,700
That's when we fucking graduate.

1895
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,380
We fucking get the upgrade right now.

1896
01:23:16,505 --> 01:23:19,191
Not fucking going to be little fucking paisas no fucking more.

1897
01:23:19,191 --> 01:23:19,584
Right?

1898
01:23:19,584 --> 01:23:20,071
Yeah.

1899
01:23:20,071 --> 01:23:21,127
That’s what we’re going to fucking do.

1900
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:21,800
OK?

1901
01:23:22,475 --> 01:23:25,224
They want to come into our fucking hood and fucking talk shit to us?

1902
01:23:25,224 --> 01:23:26,044
You fucking do this shit right?

1903
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:28,914
They don’t fucking disrespect us. It’s our fucking hood.

1904
01:23:27,914 --> 01:23:29,507
You guys want to fucking collect?

1905
01:23:29,507 --> 01:23:30,776
You guys got to fucking put up.

1906
01:23:30,811 --> 01:23:31,881
This time we’re going to fucking do it right.

1907
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:32,645
Hell yeah, we’re doing this.

1908
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,096
Fucking guys have some fucking balls.

1909
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:42,093
After we get these motherfuckers... you know it’s gonna be a little hot in the hood.

1910
01:23:42,093 --> 01:23:45,218
We’re going to get the fuck out of here after that.

1911
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:47,522
I’m gonna fucking take you guys to fucking Vegas.

1912
01:23:47,557 --> 01:23:50,247
You guys fucking do this shit right, I’m gonna treat you right.

1913
01:23:50,282 --> 01:23:54,125
But if we don’t fucking do this, we can never fucking come back, that’s the fucking thing.

1914
01:23:57,552 --> 01:24:00,540
Wouldn’t it be crazy if our kids were pushing a black and white together one day?

1915
01:24:00,924 --> 01:24:01,483
Screw that.

1916
01:24:02,576 --> 01:24:03,965
I want my kid to have an honest job.

1917
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,661
Like a politician.

1918
01:24:11,433 --> 01:24:12,038
Whoa.

1919
01:24:12,073 --> 01:24:12,974
Idiot.

1920
01:24:13,009 --> 01:24:13,894
Light them up.

1921
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,069
He’s running.

1922
01:24:18,728 --> 01:24:23,292
Thirteen-x-ray-thirteen we’re going to be following a possible code thirty seven vehicle northbound Hooper from four two street.

1923
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:24,869
Gray Toyota minivan.

01:24:24,904 --> 01:24:28,140
License plate number six queen four nine nine seven three.

1925
01:24:28,175 --> 01:24:30,323
Requesting backup, airship, and a supervisor.

1926
01:24:31,302 --> 01:24:32,235
Yeah, you’re clear right, go.

1927
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:32,737
Go.

1928
01:24:34,996 --> 01:24:35,543
Fuck yeah.

1929
01:24:35,578 --> 01:24:36,511
You got this motherfucker.

1930
01:24:36,546 --> 01:24:37,398
You got this motherfucker.

1931
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:37,987
Come on Z.

1932
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:39,202
Come on Z.

1933
01:24:41,453 --> 01:24:42,165
Whoa!

1934
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,036
Fucking Christ.

1935
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,024
Fuck.

1936
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:45,463
Get the fuck out of the car.

1937
01:24:45,498 --> 01:24:46,261
Go!

1938
01:24:50,633 --> 01:24:51,304
Mike, come on!

1939
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,354
Let’s go!

1940
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:53,889
Let’s go!

1941
01:24:53,924 --> 01:24:55,658
X thirteen, what’s your location?

1942
01:24:55,693 --> 01:24:57,825
Thirteen-x-ray- thirteen, suspect running on foot.

1943
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,418
Male, Hispanic, dark clothing.

1944
01:25:00,147 --> 01:25:00,769
Shit!

1945
01:25:03,316 --> 01:25:03,852
Fuck!

1946
01:25:07,249 --> 01:25:07,860
Go, go!

1947
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:08,996
Move!

1948
01:25:09,031 --> 01:25:10,394
Fucking missed, stupid.

1949
01:25:10,429 --> 01:25:10,995
Fuck.

1950
01:25:10,995 --> 01:25:11,502
Go.

1951
01:25:15,504 --> 01:25:16,837
Go, go, go!

1952
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:17,784
Dude!

1953
01:25:19,684 --> 01:25:20,145

Move!

1955
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:24,403
Tell her to get down!

1956
01:25:29,049 --> 01:25:29,702
Fuck.

1957
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:32,401
Shit, no dice.

1958
01:25:32,436 --> 01:25:33,296
We’re fucking trapped.

1959
01:25:33,296 --> 01:25:34,329
Call dispatch.

1960
01:25:34,364 --> 01:25:35,521
My fucking hand.

1961
01:25:35,556 --> 01:25:36,847
What’s up?

1962
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:37,455
What, you got hit?

1963
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,286
Did you get hit?

1964
01:25:38,321 --> 01:25:38,942
NTQKJH
Shit.

1965
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:40,558
Fucking call dispatch.

1966
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:42,221
I got no signal!

1967
01:25:42,256 --> 01:25:42,806
Fuck!

1968
01:25:44,328 --> 01:25:45,404
Fuck, I don’t...

1969
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:47,926
Fuckers.

1970
01:25:49,336 --> 01:25:50,084
Shut up!

1971
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,549
This is thirteen x ray thirteen...

1972
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,398
Come through the fucking door.

1973
01:25:55,433 --> 01:25:56,854
Come on.

1974
01:25:56,889 --> 01:25:57,958
Officers need help!

1975
01:26:01,395 --> 01:26:01,998
Shut up!

1976
01:26:02,033 --> 01:26:05,822
We’re barricaded in an apartment building.

1977
01:26:09,602 --> 01:26:12,250
Shit! Tell that bitch to shut the fuck up!

1978
01:26:28,548 --> 01:26:31,567
Two five zero two two Hooper Place, apartment C.

1979
01:26:31,602 --> 01:26:32,950
Those motherfuckers are in there.

1980
01:26:32,985 --> 01:26:35,143
We’re good, we’re all good!

1981
01:26:35,178 --> 01:26:37,445
They’re sending the cavalry, they’re sending the whole fucking world.

1982
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:47,373
Fuck!

1983
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:50,248

1984
01:26:53,434 --> 01:26:53,878

Reload.

1986
01:27:07,478 --> 01:27:08,136
Partner?

1987
01:27:08,171 --> 01:27:09,516
Dude.

1988
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:09,959
Partner!

1989
01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:11,711
You all good?

1990
01:27:12,486 --> 01:27:13,630
Wasn’t Big Evil in the army?

1991
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:14,597
Yeah.

1992
01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:15,373
We can’t hold them off.

1993
01:27:15,373 --> 01:27:16,677
We’ve got to lay down a base of fire and pivot.

1994
01:27:16,712 --> 01:27:18,046
What the fuck does that mean?

1995
01:27:18,472 --> 01:27:19,700
We’re shooting our way out of here.

1996
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,982

Just don’t let her date cops.

2133
01:39:03,353 --> 01:39:04,237
She’s not dating anyone.

2134
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:04,804
OK.

2135
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:05,755

2137
01:39:09,145 --> 01:39:12,046
Did I ever tell you about the first time I spent the night with Gabby?

2138
01:39:12,081 --> 01:39:13,555
I don’t want to hear that.

2139
01:39:14,215 --> 01:39:15,805
I got a hella big family, right?

2140
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,094
Fuck, I don’t want to hear that.

2141
01:39:18,129 --> 01:39:18,851
I got a hella big family.

2142
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:21,051
Someone’s always at my house.

2143
01:39:21,086 --> 01:39:25,483
But one time, Gabby’s parents bounced to Ensenada and her brother crashed at his girlfriend’s so I spent the night at her house.

2144
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:27,794
And this was going to be the night.

2145
01:39:28,701 --> 01:39:31,158
It was going to be the night, you know what I’m saying?

2146
01:39:31,193 --> 01:39:32,991
No, what are you talking about?

2147
01:39:33,026 --> 01:39:33,690
Well I’ll tell you what I’m talking about.

2148
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:34,426
OK cool

2149
01:39:34,426 --> 01:39:37,482
So we’re in her parents’ bed, right?

2150
01:39:37,517 --> 01:39:38,025
And it’s on.

2151
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:38,974
It’s about to go down.

2152
01:39:39,429 --> 01:39:40,937
I’m taking off her chones, I’m taking off--

2153
01:39:40,938 --> 01:39:41,210
Chones?

2154
01:39:41,245 --> 01:39:43,239
Her skivvies, come on.

2155
01:39:43,239 --> 01:39:44,377
Right.

2156
01:39:44,412 --> 01:39:45,873
And I’m like finally, right?

2157
01:39:45,908 --> 01:39:46,739
Fucking finally.

2158
01:39:46,774 --> 01:39:48,536
But then we hear this noise.

2159
01:39:48,571 --> 01:39:49,936
Someone’s in the pad.

2160
01:39:50,369 --> 01:39:52,149
So I hide underneath the bed.

2161
01:39:52,184 --> 01:39:53,741
And then I hear people coming up.

2162
01:39:53,776 --> 01:39:54,963
And it’s her parents.

2163
01:39:56,428 --> 01:39:57,213
This is the second floor.

2164
01:39:57,248 --> 01:39:58,309
What?

2165
01:39:58,344 --> 01:39:59,229
I got nowhere to go.

2166
01:39:59,264 --> 01:40:01,805
Homegirl’s trying to distract them, but it ain’t happening.

2167
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,383
And the footsteps grow louder.

2168
01:40:03,959 --> 01:40:05,055
Louder and louder.

2169
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:09,054
Then the door opens – oh my god, I’m naked... underneath the bed.

2170
01:40:09,089 --> 01:40:11,527
And then all I can seeis little footsteps.

2171
01:40:11,562 --> 01:40:16,438
I see his hairy feet and I see her nails all painted and they’re yapping, they’re doing their thing.

2172
01:40:16,438 --> 01:40:17,413
And they crash.

2173
01:40:17,448 --> 01:40:24,213
And this is the part I never told Gabby... I hear a little smootchie smootch, and I hear some shit, and I’m praying, please no.

2174
01:40:25,154 --> 01:40:26,141
And they did it.

2175
01:40:26,176 --> 01:40:27,374
What? ... What?

2176
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:28,796
They got down!

2177
01:40:29,522 --> 01:40:32,084
I’m talking Gabby’s parents fucking!

2178
01:40:32,119 --> 01:40:33,536
All right, I got it.

2179
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:33,951
No!

2180
01:40:33,986 --> 01:40:36,334
The shit was so traumatic.

2181
01:40:37,203 --> 01:40:40,623
It must have been a little uncomfortable around the folks after that.

2182
01:40:41,780 --> 01:40:44,391
Yeah, because her father’s a freak.

2183
01:40:44,426 --> 01:40:48,263
I guess when you’ve been married that long, you gotta mix it up a little bit.

2184
01:40:48,298 --> 01:40:52,470
I tried rolling like that with Gabby and she was like hell no, you’re not touching me there.

2185
01:40:55,507 --> 01:40:56,999
It makes me fucking uncomfortable.

2186
01:40:57,034 --> 01:40:58,686
I know, you know why?

2187
01:40:58,721 --> 01:40:59,707
Because you’re a freak too.

2188
01:40:59,742 --> 01:41:02,076
Don’t go there, just don’t go there.

2189
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:04,572
I fucking can’t breathe.

2190
01:41:05,515 --> 01:41:06,548
Holy shit.

2191
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:11,134
Any Newton unit...

2192
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:18,918
Let’s go fight crime or something.

2193
01:41:18,953 --> 01:41:19,246
OK.

2194
01:41:19,247 --> 01:41:26,203
