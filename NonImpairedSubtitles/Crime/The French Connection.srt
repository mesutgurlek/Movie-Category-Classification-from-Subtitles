00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:56,445
They're all cousins, you know that. All right.
Yeah, say good-bye.

168
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,756
What's he got now?

169
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,085
Hudson Terraplane, that's what he got.

170
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,091
- No, no. Uh-uh. Easy.
- Okay.

171
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,328
Go to work.

172
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:17,470
Cloudy, lay odds he takes us to Dago Town.

173
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,677
I値l take him, Popeye. He's nothing.

174
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,035
[Sighs]

175
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,705
7:00 in the morning. I don't believe this.

176
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,841
Relax. You're having fun, aingtya?

177
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,031
[Popeye] lf that's not a drop,

178
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,891
I値l open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.

179
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,930
Make it Alexander's toy department.

180
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,320
He's coming back.

181
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,988
Pass him. Make a left.

182
00:22:47,666 --> 00:24:11,474
Alain.

183
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,261

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,934
Salvatore Boca. B-O-C-A.

185
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,466
They call him Sal. He's a sweetheart.

186
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:31,175
He was picked up on suspicion of armed robbery.

187
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,173
Now, get this. Three years ago,

188
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,973
he tries to hold up Tiffany's in broad daylight.

189
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,980
Could have got 21/2 to 5, but Tiffany's wouldn't
prosecute.

190
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,017
Downtown they're pretty sure he pulled off a
contract

191
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,688
on a guy named DeMarco.

192
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,686
[Doyle] What about his old lady?

193
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,689
Her name's Angie. She's a fast filly.

194
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,726
She drew a suspended for shoplifting a year ago.

195
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,058
She's only 19 according to the marriage license.

196
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,063
19 going on 50.

197
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:58,597
What else?

198
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,338
He's had the store a year and a half.

199
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,131
Takes in a fast 7 grand a year.

200
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,139
What's he doing with two cars and $100 tabs?

201
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,709
The LTD's in his wife's name.

202
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,515
The Comet belongs to his brother-- Lou.

203
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,413
The Comet belongs to his brother-- Lou.

204
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,078
He's a trainee at the garbage man school on
Ward's Island.

205
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,721
He did time a couple of years ago.

206
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,616
Assault and robbery.

207
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,190
The black Cadillac.

208
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,430
Uh, New Jersey plates.

209
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:29,133
RWN 264. I know that one cat.

210
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,459
We saw him outside the Pike Slip Inn.

girlfriend,

212
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,467
but I want you to model it.

213
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,503
Better not let my husband hear that.

214
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:42,179
I don't care if he hears it. Will you do it?

215
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:43,505
Okay. How much you going to pay?

216
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,546

217
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,549
- I値l do it-- 200.
- Nah. Can't afford it.

218
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,984
I値l call you later. Bye-bye.
It's 1:30. I didn't expect you till 2:00.

219
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,228

221
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,671
You got anything on this building?

222
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,200
The building's clean. l checked the tenant list.

223
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,910
Remember Don Ameche, the actor? He lives here.

224
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,236
Oh, yeah. And somebody else.

225
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,277
Does the name Joel Weinstock ring a bell?

226
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,282
- Oh, you're kidding.
- No, sir. He lives right here.

227
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:25,489
He was the bank on a shipment out of Mexico
three years ago.

228
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,757
Yeah, so I hear.

229
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,267
He's going to Ward's Island. We'll be spotted
there.

230
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,604
Maybe he's going to see his brother.

231
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,939
- Shit.
- Maybe it's another drop.

232
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,083
He gets a free ride.

233
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:15,303
Put your hands on your heads. Turn around.

234
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,335

Get over there. Hands on your head.

251
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,745

252
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,476
We'll keep coming back until you clean this
bar up.

253
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,020
lf your neighbor drops something of yours--

254
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:11,159
What is this, a fucking hospital here?

255

Huh?

262
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,282
Pay attention.

263
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,280
We're going to ask questions later.

264
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:36,485
Turn around.

265
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,227

Never heard of him.

306
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:56,193
What about his wife Angie?

307
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,898
Doesn't register. There's been some talk.

308
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,430

Detach us then, give us a shot.

325
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,418
At least till we learn if there's anything here.

326

This might be the lead we need to get Weinstock.

You couldn't burn a three-time loser with this

The first thing you know,

Put this candy store hustler together with
Weinstock,

Big score! At best he's selling nickel and dime

over him.

Then on our own, we tail him to Brooklyn
