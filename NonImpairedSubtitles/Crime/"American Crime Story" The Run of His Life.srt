FX Presents

2
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,104
The People v. O.J. Simpson.

3
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:30,347
<i>A friend loveth at all times,</i>

4
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:34,184
<i>and a brother
is born in adversity.</i>

5
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:38,720
Father, please, please,
please have mercy on him.

6
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:41,591
Look after him, protect him.

7
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:43,293
For he's in pain

8
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:45,694
and he knows not
what he's doing.

9
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,267
Just tell them
Robert Shapiro is calling.

10
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:52,635
He'll know what it's about.

11
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,170
- What do you want?
- Gil.

12
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,006
I wish I reach through
this goddamn phone

13
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:57,107
and strangle you.

14
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,176
I am so sorry
he did this to us.

15
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,512
I mean, you know
that I'm a fixer of things.

16
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:05,181
I-I-I don't tolerate
this kind of stuff.

17
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,316
How does a murder suspect

18
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,984
disappear from
a house full of people?

19
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:09,452
I didn't know
that he was gonna run.

20
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,121
I mean, you've got
to believe me, Gil.

21
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:13,223
I... I mean, this is...
I'm the good guy here.

22
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:15,959
Look, who brought Menendez
back from Israel, hmm?

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,194
Who-who-who backed
your campaign?

24
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,363
Look, you even came
to my 50th birthday.

25
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:21,865
You loved it,
it was a great party.

26
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,733
Bob, find your client

27
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,567
and deliver him.

28
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,884
Do you have a minute?

29
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,719
Of course. Drink?

30
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,120
No, thanks.

31
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,763
O.J. left a suicide note.

32
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:03,472
It's terrible.

33
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,111
I don't know what
we're supposed to do with it.

34
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,112
I mean, do we need
to give it to the police?

35
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:14,884
Jesus Christ.

36
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,920
Who the hell
signs a suicide note

37
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:19,456
with a happy face?

38
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:24,527
One of this country's best-known
personalities

39
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:26,796
is a suspect
in a double homicide,

40
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,598
a terribly gruesome crime,

41
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:30,366
and he is at large tonight.

42
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,969
There is now
a statewide manhunt underway

43
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,271
for O.J. Simpson in California.

44
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,607
If it were our absolute goal,

45
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,110
could we look more incompetent?

46
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:43,146
It's the worst day of my life.

47
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,549
It's worse than the day
I was diagnosed with cancer.

48
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,152
He failed to appear by 11:45.

49
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,153
- The Los Angeles Police Department...
- It's friggin' Shapiro.

50
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,788
He screwed
all of us.

51
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:54,224
God forbid a celebrity
should do a perp walk.

52
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:56,259
It's always the big cases
that melt down. McMartin.

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,928
Twilight Zone. Menendez.

54
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:02,098
Why is it always
the famous ones?

55
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,133
...that it would come to this,

56
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:04,968
with this man who was so beloved

57
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,670
in this country for so long.
But now...

58
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,172
He can't hide forever.

59
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,340
Everyone knows his face.

60
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,338
We received
110 tips so far.

61
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,174
"He's with Magic Johnson."

62
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:45,975
"He's in Atlanta."

63
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:48,645
"He's eating lunch
with Dionne Warwick at the Ivy."

64
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:50,180
- Christ.
- All right, look,

65
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:52,048
we have to weed out
the crackpots, all right?

66
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,017
So make sure you put out

67
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:55,285
the year and the plates
on the white Bronco.

68
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:56,885
All right?

69
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:48,705
The guy he's with.

70
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:50,673
Can anybody tell me
who A.C. Cowlings is?

71
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:52,275
He's a fourth-rate linebacker.

72
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,077
He's sort of a poor man's O.J.

73
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:55,712
O.J., A.C., get it?

74
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:57,280
Will you just
quiet down?

75
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,548
I feel like
I'm gonna vomit.

76
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:08,191
Pardon me.

77
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,094
I want to say something
to the entire community.

78
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,463
Mr. Simpson is a fugitive

79
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,565
of justice.

80
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,735
And if any of you assist him,

81
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:21,271
in any way,
you are committing a felony.

82
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,640
And I personally guarantee

83
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,576
you will be prosecuted.

84
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:28,878
- Today, my office...
- I hope they catch him.

85
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,213
You know he did it.

86
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,648
You don't know that.

87
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,549
They're just tearing down
another black man.

88
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,817
...Nicole Brown Simpson

89
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,619
and Ronald Lyle Goldman...

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,787
Want me to turn off the TVs?

91
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:39,289
Tell 'em to go back to work?

92
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,390
No, it's fine.
Let 'em watch.

93
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,592
Something big's happening here.

94
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:45,295
We are alleging
special circumstances.

95
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:47,630
We are also alleging
the murder weapon was the knife.

96
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:50,300
Mr. Simpson must face
these charges.

97
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:52,567
<i>We will find him.</i>

98
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:58,408
The TV on?

99
00:05:58,509 --> 00:05:59,742
Course I'm watching.

100
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,511
Picked a hell
of a day to leave town.

101
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,779
Well, how was
I supposed to know...?

102
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,147
...really good line...

103
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,416
- What is that?
- Arnold Palmer's last U.S. Open.

104
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:07,850
He's retiring today.

105
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,085
Pops, come on.

106
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,589
Now, you can tell I'm up... set.

107
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,025
- This is a...
- Oh, he looks horrible.

108
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,327
...it's a very serious case.

109
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:19,429
Oh, my God,
Marcia's dying up there.

110
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,364
- You know all those people?
- Shh.

111
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,999
And I think, perhaps,

112
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,701
that some of us might have
had empathy for him.

113
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,369
We saw the falling
of an American hero,

114
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,205
and to some extent I viewed
Mr. Simpson the same way.

115
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,207
But let's remember,
we have two innocent people

116
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,142
who were brutally murdered.

117
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:34,444
But how could this happen?

118
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,212
The entire world was focused
on this one man,

119
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,513
and he slipped away.

120
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,214
How can you answer that?

121
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,484
I can't.

122
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:44,620
You think
he's gonna get away?

123
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,621
No way.

124
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,124
O.J. humiliated them.

125
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:50,460
He's dead meat.

126
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,830
I don't like the
subtext of this one bit.

127
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,064
There's an unspoken
villain here.

128
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,401
- Who, A.C.?
- Hmm? No. Me.

129
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,137
Everyone's blaming
me for everything.

130
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:03,139
I have a very
clean reputation.

131
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,273
What we need is our
own press conference.

132
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:10,012
Are we good?

133
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:12,682
Sound good?
We're all...

134
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:16,418
Okay.

135
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,691
I must make one thing
perfectly clear:

136
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:26,195
I am as shocked as anybody is
at this turn of events.

137
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:30,500
Over the past 25 years, on
numerous occasions, I have made

138
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:33,603
similar arrangements
with the LAPD,

139
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,405
with the district attorney's
office,

140
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:37,940
and Mr. Garcetti.

141
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,410
They have always kept their word
to me,

142
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:45,214
and I have always kept my word
to them.

143
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:48,084
In fact,
I arranged the surrender

144
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:50,119
of Erik Menendez from Israel.

145
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,754
What a prick.

146
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:56,092
Robert Shapiro's focused
on his number one priority:

147
00:07:56,193 --> 00:07:57,460
Robert Shapiro.

148
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,128
What would you be saying?

149
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,030
I wouldn't be falling back
on the pronouns "me,"

150
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:04,033
"myself," and "I." People,

151
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:06,903
when you take these jobs,
you have only one role:

152
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,705
you are in service
to your client.

153
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:12,742
Never betray that individual.
Never.

154
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:15,745
No, he was always
under a doctor's care.

155
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:20,550
In fact, we were concerned
that he would take this avenue.

156
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:24,253
O.J., wherever you are,

157
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:27,223
for the sake of
your children,

158
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,592
for the sake of your family,

159
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:33,262
please surrender immediately

160
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:36,265
to any law enforcement official.

161
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,334
What were the last words
you heard from O.J.?

162
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,070
Oh. Well, they were
of a complimentary nature.

163
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:44,106
He thanked me for everything
I did for him.

164
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,242
So now I
would like

165
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:48,411
to introduce Robert Kardashian,

166
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:51,681
one of O.J.'s closest
and dearest friends.

167
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,685
He will now read a note
that O.J. handwrote today.

168
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,487
Robert?

169
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:01,657
Oh, my God, it's Daddy!

170
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,627
This letter was written
by O.J. today.

171
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:07,597
"To whom it may concern:

172
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:10,166
"first, everyone understand

173
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,435
"I had nothing to do

174
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:15,037
"with Nicole's murder.

175
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,039
"I loved her.

176
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,210
At times, I felt
like a battered husband..."

177
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,646
Did I hear
that correctly?

178
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:25,314
He feels
like a battered husband?

179
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:28,117
Well, you know, he cut his
hand while he was killing her.

180
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:30,319
"Please think of the real O.J.

181
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,723
"and not this lost person.

182
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,727
"Thank you for making
my life special.

183
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,730
"I hope I helped yours.

184
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,733
Peace and love, O.J."

185
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,134
Who are you?

186
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:48,471
Robert-Robert Kardashian.

187
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:49,472
Kazany?

188
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:50,740
Rakashian?

189
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,074
C-Can you please spell that?

- Please, be respectful. This is

193
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,053
a very close friend
of Mr. O.J. Simpson's.

We have sighted
a white Ford Bronco, north of

220
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,188
Irvine Center Drive.
License plate

221
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,990
Three Papa Charlie Tango
Four Zero Three.

222
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:52,093
I think we got him.

223
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:55,029
Stay in your
car, sir.

224
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,001
Sir, step out
of the vehicle.

225
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,270
No, no, no! Hell no!

226
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:02,538
Sir, you need
to turn your engine off

227
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,040
and step from the vehicle now!

228
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,042
Do you know
what's goin' on here?!

229
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:09,045
O.J.'s in the backseat
with a gun to his head!

230
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,781
- Can I speak with Mr. Simpson?
- No!

231
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:14,817
No, I ain't speaking to nobody!
I ain't speaking to nobody!

232
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:16,118
- Tell him the gun's loaded, A.C.!
- What? What?

233
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,220
- Tell him! Tell him!
- I-I know, O.J.!

234
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,556
- O.J., I will handle it, okay? I know!
- We don't want

235
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,525
a situation here! We don't want
anybody to get hurt! You both

236
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,326
- need to get out!
- O.J., O.J., O.J.
- Tell him!

237
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,162
- Tell him! Tell him!
- You need to get out!

238
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:27,129
That's not happening!

239
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,930
Back off!

240
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,869
- Do we shoot?
- I'm not shooting at O.J. Simpson

241
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,737
unless somebody authorizes it.

242
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,958
Today, my office

243
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:34,230
filed murder charges against
O.J. Simpson for the murder

244
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:37,366
of Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ronald Lyle Goldman.

245
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:40,102
Um, I have some bad news.

246
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:42,238
These are very serious crimes.

247
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,307
I was, um...

248
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,576
I was with O.J. this morning,

249
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:49,644
and he, uh...

250
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:54,216
...he was in pretty bad shape.

251
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:55,883
What do you mean?

252
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:01,689
He was in a lot of pain.

253
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:10,232
He left a note.

254
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,169
And we have reason to believe
that he's killed himself.

255
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,669
Oh, my God!

256
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,239
I'm so sorry.

257
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,941
I'm...

258
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,208
I'm so sorry.

259
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:25,581
He wanted you to know,

260
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,583
he wanted all of you to know
he loved you...

261
00:14:27,684 --> 00:14:29,652
he loved you very much.

262
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:31,587
He loved
everybody here.

263
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:35,090
O.J.'s in a better-better place.

264
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:38,292
He's in a better place.

265
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,799
No. Wait.

266
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,034
Look!

267
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,204
Look.

268
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:52,174
O.J. Simpson is sitting
in the backseat and he has

269
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,443
- a gun at his head and, uh,
- Oh, Dad. Oh.

270
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:57,446
presumably, the officers
in those four cars

271
00:14:57,547 --> 00:14:59,814
that are maintaining...

Bob, where have you been?

275
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,879
Do you have any idea
what is going on?

276
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,882
Yeah. I did a press conference,
then I filled the gas tank.

277
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,884
Bob, they found him.

278
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:37,920
O.J. is driving up and down the
freeways with a police escort.

279
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,188
He's still alive?

280
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:40,689
...in front of him.

281
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,691
However, there are a number
of Highway Patrol units

282
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,694
and sheriff's vehicles sitting
on the side of the road.

283
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:48,364
And that's called a code 100,
an intercept...

284
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,366
Wow.

285
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,368
Good for you, O.J.

286
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:55,371
Good for you.

287
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:58,806
We're still in the game.

288
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,885
Hello, everyone. I'm Bob Costas.
It is our professional

289
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:12,054
obligation to cover
the ball game tonight.

290
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:15,257
We will do that in what we hope
is an appropriate fashion.

291
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:19,061
We are, of course, mindful
of the O.J. Simpson situation,

292
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:21,463
and we will apprise you
of any new developments.

293
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,232
...with doctors
who've been treating Simpson...

294
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,567
Why don't we stop him?
Shoot out his tires.

295
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,636
We don't want a shootout
on live TV.

296
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,204
We're on every network
in the country.

297
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,406
What's the protocol?

298
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:32,141
The protocol?
I don't know, Bill.

299
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,611
What is the protocol for
an armed celebrity fugitive

300
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:39,248
being chased by 12 police
cars and seven helicopters?

301
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:42,251
Christ.

302
00:16:42,352 --> 00:16:44,954
I thought I was
gonna run for mayor.

303
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,455
<i>And we are told by
the California Highway Patrol</i>

304
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:49,325
<i>that O.J. Simpson
is in that car,</i>

305
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,327
<i>holding a gun to his head.</i>

306
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,296
<i>He has been in touch with
a police highway dispatcher,</i>

307
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:57,299
<i>saying he wants to be taken
to his mother.</i>

308
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,301
<i>He wants to see her.</i>

309
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,937
<i>Um, but we don't know
what the resolution</i>

310
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:04,972
<i>of all of this will be. There
are nine black-and-whites...</i>

311
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,356
<i>All right,</i>

312
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,857
what do you want
me to do, O.J.?

313
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,259
- I should die.
- No.

314
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,461
Put the gun down, Juice.

315
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,429
I'm tired of you drivin' me
around, A.C.!

316
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,964
Tell me what you need!

317
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,499
- Take me to the cemetery.
- No, man.

318
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,934
We did that already.

319
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:33,936
I don't know what is happening.

320
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,504
Why is this happening to me?

321
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:36,839
I don't understand.

322
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,640
I had such a beautiful family.

323
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:41,043
Nicole and Sydney and Justin...

324
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,311
You still got the kids,
Juice. All right?

325
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:43,645
Think about the kids.

326
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:45,647
J-Just take me home.

327
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,483
- I want to see Mama.
- Brother,

328
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,485
we got half the police
in California in pursuit.

329
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:51,220
They might
not let us.

330
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,920
I want this to end!

331
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,694
This is 911.
What is your emergency?

332
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:01,330
Hey, this is A.C. I have O.J.

333
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:02,865
- in the car.
- Who is this?

334
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,666
You know who this is,
goddamn it!

335
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:08,337
I have O.J. in the car! You
tell the police to back off!

336
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,506
- He's got a gun to his head!
- Hold on a moment.

337
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,674
- Where are you? Is everything else okay?
- What?

338
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,510
No! What kind
of stupid-ass question is that?!

339
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:16,678
Everything
is terrible!

340
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,513
You just clear the freeway!
We're going to Brentwood!

341
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,591
Ready on chyron.
Give me ten.

342
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,093
They're clearing the freeway!

343
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,095
There's nobody else
driving on it!

344
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,396
What?! You're kidding.

345
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:36,532
We've got to cut to O.J.

346
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:39,535
Well, I can't.
It's the NBA Finals.

347
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:42,136
You do realize how much
these spots are going for?

348
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,339
Put the game in the box.

349
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,208
What? No!

350
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:47,376
You have to. Think clearly!

351
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:49,578
O.J. is news,
entertainment and sports!

352
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,246
Jim, I can't. I...

353
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,115
In 24 years, I've never
done anything like this.

354
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,284
O.J. gets the big screen.

355
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,219
I'm calling upstairs.

356
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,121
Shit!

357
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,023
Asshole. Go.

358
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:03,658
Ready two. And take two.
Ready uplink.

359
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,537
- Dude, go!
- Nice!

360
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:17,206
<i>We bring you
this breaking update</i>

361
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:18,939
<i>on the O.J. Simpson...</i>

362
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,744
...a freeway in Los Angeles...

363
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:24,279
Put the game back on!

364
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,982
...of that area, and we are told

365
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,585
by the California Highway Patrol
that O.J. Simpson

366
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:32,387
is in that car,
holding a gun to his head.

367
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:35,224
He has been in touch with
a police highway dispatcher,

368
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:38,827
saying he wants
to be taken to his mother.

369
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,796
He wants to see her.

370
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:43,599
Now, what we, uh, figure now

371
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,669
is that O.J. Simpson is sitting
in the back seat,

372
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,805
and he has a gun at his head,

373
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:53,008
and, uh, presumably
the officers...

374
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,277
I can't believe this is

375
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:57,112
the 405 on a Friday night.

376
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:58,814
Where are all
the cars?

377
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:00,816
The backup on Sepulveda
must be unbelievable.

378
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,085
<i>...situation play out
and hopefully resolve it</i>

379
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:06,355
<i>without anyone getting hurt.</i>

380
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,625
<i>Uh, the car is, uh, again,
on the 91 freeway.</i>

381
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:12,828
<i>This is a white Ford Bronco.
This is the one...</i>

382
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,097
It's like the world's longest
Ford Bronco commercial.

383
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:17,099
Yeah, look at this.

384
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,801
<i>...that said that, uh, O.J.
Simpson was armed and dangerous.</i>

385
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:21,703
<i>He should be considered
dangerous.</i>

386
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:25,841
<i>And here, in the back seat of
the car with a gun to his head.</i>

387
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,277
<i>- Uh, this is heading in the...</i>
- Phil, question.

388
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:30,979
- How is O.J. back in his white Bronco?
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

389
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,182
I mean, the Bronco was full
of blood. We impounded it!

390
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,050
How can he be driving it again?

391
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,220
Hold on a second. Tom,
how is O.J. back in the Bronco?

392
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,622
Believe it or not, there
are two white Broncos.

393
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,191
A.C. Cowlings
worships O.J. so much,

394
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,059
he bought the identical car.

395
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,827
Unbelievable.

396
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:48,030
What's the situation
at Rockingham?

397
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:49,464
SWAT's taking over.

398
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:52,700
All right.

399
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:10,485
Sausage!

400
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:13,422
Aw, this is crazy, man!
We ran out of cheese.

401
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,891
- Come on, O.J.
<i>- We are witnessing tonight</i>

402
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,993
<i>- a modern tragedy and drama...</i>
- Come on.

403
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:20,095
<i>...of Shakespearian proportion being
played out live...</i>

404
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,364
<i>...on television
in Southern California.</i>

405
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:25,100
<i>We are told, as well,
that O.J. is sitting</i>

406
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,070
<i>in the back seat
with a gun to his head.</i>

407
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:29,871
<i>That comes from the California
Highway Patrol.</i>

408
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,240
Juice?

409
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:33,275
Bob.

410
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,277
Bob, I've been looking
for you.

411
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,447
I called the house in Encino,
and you weren't there.

412
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,016
I don't know if you heard
what's happening.

413
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:43,252
Uh, yeah, I heard, Juice.

414
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:45,052
It's on every channel.

415
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,689
I...

416
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,125
I just wanted to tell you
I love you, Bobby.

417
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,060
Bobby, you're the best.

418
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:54,328
You know I feel the same, Juice.

419
00:21:55,832 --> 00:21:59,067
Remember how much fun
we used to have?

420
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,570
Wow.

421
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:05,574
Remember the night the four
of us went to that steakhouse

422
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,943
used to be on La Cienega?

423
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:10,112
I forget the name.

424
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:13,782
You, me, Nicole, Kris--

425
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:19,988
we had some fun times together.

426
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,659
Want you to tell everybody
that I love 'em.

427
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,827
Say good-bye for me.

428
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,731
Say good-bye to Don Ohlmeyer,

O.J.?

442
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,106
We continue to watch
the white Bronco

443
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:13,809
that is driven, we believe,
by Allen Cowlings,

444
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,510
a long-time friend
of O.J. Simpson.

445
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,846
- O.J. Simpson is in the car.
- Jason?

446
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:20,215
At one point, he said
he had a gun to his head.

447
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,516
He's being pursued
by California law enforcement...

448
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,285
Where's your grandmother?

449
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:26,655
Oh. She was having
heart palpitations.

450
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,457
She's in the hospital.

451
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,125
...his home in Brentwood

452
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:32,060
where his mother is believed
to be staying...

453
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,197
Hey, Uncle Bobby,
is my dad gonna die?

454
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:37,699
...told an L.A. dispatcher
he wanted to see his mother.

455
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,733
He has also said
he could hurt himself.

456
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:54,516
Gentlemen, the last I heard,
the man was still alive.

457
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:57,386
We got to stay
ahead of the news.

458
00:23:57,487 --> 00:24:02,224
<i>Yes, it's a complex situation,
but we must remember that</i>

459
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:04,693
he is a person not used
to being arrested.

460
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:07,529
He's fragile, confused.

461
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,167
Whenever I see a black man
being chased by armed officers,

462
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,102
my guard goes up.

463
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,738
With all due respect,
this is a... a possible killer

464
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,407
who fled from the police.

465
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:20,108
Innocent until proven guilty!

466
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,378
If the LAPD is involved,

467
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,248
we should let history be
our guiding principle.

468
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:28,183
Time after time, the
police shoot first,

469
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:30,385
and offer sloppy
apologies afterwards.

470
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:33,221
30 years ago, a young man named
Leonard Deadwyler

471
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:35,757
was driving his pregnant wife
to the hospital.

472
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:38,226
She was about to give birth
to their child.

473
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:43,031
And that very same LAPD saw a
black man driving too fast,

474
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:44,800
and they did what they do.

475
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,734
They shot and killed him.

476
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:51,106
I represented Leonard's family.

477
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,909
It was one
of my very first cases.

478
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,478
Unfortunately,
the first of many.

479
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,550
It was a terrible thing.

480
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:07,055
Leonard's only crime...

481
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,323
the color of his skin.

482
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,646
What?!

483
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,615
- Who is this?!
- This is Detective Tom Lange

484
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,584
with the Los Angeles
Police Department.

485
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:37,919
- How'd you get this number?!
- You called 911.

486
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,355
Well, you tell the cops
to back off!

487
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,290
All right? Stay
away from us!

488
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:44,558
A.C., give me the phone.

489
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,697
Hey, this is O.J.

490
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,033
I just wanted to say
how sorry I am.

491
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,569
I didn't mean for you guys to
all have to come out like this.

492
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,641
I know it's late on a Friday.

493
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:02,110
You guys work hard.

494
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:05,046
Probably want to go home
and see your kids.

495
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,148
No, it's okay.

496
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:09,416
We're just doing our jobs.

497
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:12,454
So, uh...

498
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:14,823
I understand you have a gun.

499
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:16,791
Yeah, but it's not for you.

500
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:20,061
Don't worry. I would never hurt
any of you guys.

501
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,031
This gun's for me.

502
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:25,467
No, no, no, no,
you don't want to do that.

503
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,335
Things will get better.

504
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,471
You should just toss it
out the window.

505
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:30,906
No, no.

506
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,174
I can't do that.

507
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:35,810
I got to...
I got to be with Nicole.

508
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:37,245
Yeah.

509
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,548
That's all I'm trying to do.

510
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:42,217
I just can't do it
on the freeway.

511
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:44,853
I can't do it in a field.

512
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:47,322
I tried to do it at her grave.

513
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:50,892
Now, I... I'm just gonna do it
at home.

514
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:52,527
O.J., we want to keep you alive.

515
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:53,995
We're not gonna bother you.

516
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:55,263
We'll let you go home.

517
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,765
We know you want to go there.

518
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,099
We'll let you go there.

519
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,268
But the gun is...
is scaring everybody.

520
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,003
Please, can't you just
throw it away?

521
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:07,909
No.

522
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,444
I deserve to get hurt.

523
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,016
Go, O.J.!

524
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:16,685
Go where? Where's
he gonna go?

525
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:18,119
- Anywhere but jail, baby.
- Yeah.

526
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,221
Yo, Chris, get
over here, man.

527
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:22,891
I thought you was gonna give
us a little play-by-play.

528
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:25,126
- Please.
- Ooh! Look at O.J. go.

529
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,595
That boy can still run.

530
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:28,630
Them goddamn cops
ain't chasing him.

531
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,433
Remember his run
in '67 against UCLA?

532
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:34,102
Ooh! That was the best!

533
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:36,404
Nobody could catch the Juice.

534
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,640
I don't know what you guys
are cheering for.

535
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,142
- Jim Brown was a much better player.
- What?!

536
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,378
Chris, go in the house, boy.

537
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:46,448
O.J. is local!
He went to Galileo High!

538
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:50,151
So what? O.J. never gave back.

539
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,787
Well, you see any parks
around here named for him?

540
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,556
Any children's centers?

541
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:57,792
See, now Jim Brown cared
about black people.

542
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,828
He was an activist.
He spoke up.

543
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,764
Once O.J. made his money,
he split and never came back.

544
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:05,133
- He became white.
- Aah.

545
00:28:05,234 --> 00:28:08,803
Well, you got the cops
chasing him.

546
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,971
He's black now!

547
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:16,144
♪ One nation under a groove

548
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:20,515
♪ Gettin' down
just for the funk of it ♪

549
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:24,285

551
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,333
Orenthal James Simpson,

552
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:40,502
a grieving former husband,

553
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:42,437
comforting
his motherless children.

554
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:45,106
A celebrity running...

555
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:47,509
Why does that sound
like a eulogy?

556
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,046
A movie star, and a man wanted
for double murder.

557
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,115
I want him
to finish this day alive.

558
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:56,885
I want him
to pay for what he's done.

559
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,886
...images of O.J. Simpson.

560
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,158
O.J.! O.J.!

561
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:04,459
Go, O.J.! Go, O.J.!

562
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,227
Hey, why are you guys
rooting for him?

563
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,863
We're not cheering for O.J.
We're booing the LAPD!

564
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:10,331
It doesn't sound
like you guys are booing.

565
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,067
We're doing both. See,

566
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,334
O.J.'s running,
'cause he's innocent!

567
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:15,704
He's a black man
being hunted by the police.

568
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,138
They pick you up for anything!

569
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,673
I'd run!

570
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:20,374
Hey, look, it's O.J.

571
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:25,980
Go get 'em, Juice!
Go, Juice!

572
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,315
O.J.! O.J.! O.J.!

573
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,550
We love you, Juice.

574
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,152
O.J.! O.J.! O.J.!

575
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,922
O.J.! O.J.! O.J.! O.J.!

576
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,757
Go, O.J.! Go, O.J.!

577
00:29:42,597 --> 00:29:45,066
You hear that?

578
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,502
Those people
shouldn't be on the freeway.

579
00:29:47,603 --> 00:29:49,504
It's not safe.

580
00:29:49,605 --> 00:29:52,574
They're out
because they love you.

581
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:54,841
They still love you, Juice.

582
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:05,220
<i>34 yards...</i>

583
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:07,188
<i>O.J. Simpson.</i>

584
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,723
<i>Go, O.J.!</i>

585
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:13,928
Go, O.J.! Go, O.J.!

Go, O.J.!
Go, O.J.!

587
00:30:16,465 --> 00:30:18,266
Where is he?
We need to find him

588
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,401
- and get him down here right now.
- Arnelle.

589
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:23,204
Where are you going?
Don't leave, Arnelle.

590
00:30:23,305 --> 00:30:24,806
We need everyone
off the property.

591
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,040
- For your own safety.
- No.

592
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,976
I'm not leaving.
This is my home.

593
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,978
Yeah, I'm not leaving either.
I'm Mr. Simpson's attorney.

594
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,079
Hey, who are you?

595
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,947
Roger Sandler,
Time Life photography.

596
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,716
We have an arrangement
with the West L.A. division.

597
00:30:34,817 --> 00:30:36,984
Your funeral. Don't
get caught in the crossfire.

598
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,259
Hey, O.J.!

599
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,505
Come on, come on!

600
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,741
How do they expect us
to get through?

601
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:00,775
Honk.

602
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:03,977
Move. Move!

603
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,251
O.J.! O.J.!

604
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,927
<i>O.J. Simpson is almost
back home. He's in that car.</i>

605
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:20,695
<i>We're told that he has a gun.</i>

606
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,897
<i>His mother is at his Brentwood
estate, and apparently...</i>

607
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:31,439
Murderer!

608
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,675
A.C., you got to get me
to my house.

609
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:35,575
I'm trying, Juice.
Hey, let us in!

610
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:48,288
Get me home, A.C.

611
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:58,066
<i>What happens when he gets</i>

612
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,300
<i>to his home, we cannot say.</i>

613
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,636
<i>People are standing
in the street.</i>

614
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:03,504
Okay, Juice,
we're here, brother.

615
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,772
Here we are.

616
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:16,985
All right, we're home, O.J.

617
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:18,253
Dad, please!

618
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:20,054
- Dad...
- Jason, no, man, get back!

619
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:23,157
- Get back, get in the house!
- Dad... Dad, please!

620
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:25,193
- Dad, put down the gun!
- Get back!

621
00:32:25,294 --> 00:32:27,862
I am handling this, okay?
Get in the house!

622
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:30,531
- Dad, I'm gonna help!
- Get in the house! I am handling this!

623
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:32,533
- Get your ass in the house!
- Dad, please! Dad...

624
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:35,069
- Dad, I'm gonna help you.
- Back in the house.

625
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,671
O.J., O.J.,
put the gun down.

626
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:38,873
You're scaring
me, man.

627
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:41,541
Put the gun
down, Juice.

628
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:45,011
Aah!

629
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:54,188
O.J.? O.J., how can I help you?

630
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:55,290
Leave us alone!

631
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:58,893
I want to speak
with Mr. Simpson. O.J.?

632
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:00,528
There's a guy
in the tree

633
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:01,763
with-with a gun--
this is a trick.

634
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:03,064
No, no.

635
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:05,900
No tricks.
We want O.J. safe.

636
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:07,468
Man, there's guns in my face

637
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,336
- everywhere!
- Kill the lights.

638
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,140
I said tell the choppers,
kill all the lights now.

639
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,712
We are sorry for the dark
picture, but there is...

640
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:20,114
No light has been
allowed there. Uh,

641
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:23,217
- part of the early negotiations were that they...
- They don't want us to see.

642
00:33:23,318 --> 00:33:25,253
...get the helicopters up
and away and that they get the

643
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:28,456
lights on even the police cars
turned off, so it's been very...

644
00:33:28,557 --> 00:33:31,159
If O.J. attempted
to take his own life,

645
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,360
to be able to get in there
quickly enough...

646
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,467
O.J., we want to get you
out of the Bronco.

647
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:43,071
We want to get you
safely into your house.

648
00:33:43,172 --> 00:33:45,239
O.J.

649
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,308
O.J., will you open
the door so that we can talk?

650
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:50,443
He doesn't want to talk to you.
Go away!

651
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,614
All right, Juice.
What do you want me to do, man?

652
00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:58,852
I should've killed myself
this morning.

653
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:03,157
- No, I can't do it.
- Juice, no! Juice!

654
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:05,326
Juice, put the gun down!
Please, Juice!

655
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:07,594
Juice,
I'm begging you, man!

656
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:12,800
Hello?

657
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:15,036
O.J., it's Bobby.

658
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,805
Oh, Bobby, help me, man.

659
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:19,807
Please help me, Bobby.

660
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:21,609
We're all inside here.
We love you.

661
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,278
Your whole family's here, Juice.
Please, just...

662
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:25,879
just come on inside.

663
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,618
Is-is Mama here?

664
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,120
Ye... Uh, yes.

665
00:34:32,221 --> 00:34:33,721
She's on the phone.
She's waiting...

666
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,858
She's on the house phone
waiting to talk to you, Juice.

667
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,193
I just... just
want to come inside, man.

668
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,229
I just... just sit down
and come inside.

669
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,165
That's a great idea.
Just come on in

670
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:47,168
and we just sit down.
We just... we just...

671
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,637
We just sit down and relax.

672
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:52,306
I'm sorry, man.
All these people out here

673
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:55,143
like this. All the cops, man--
you got to tell 'em I'm sorry,

674
00:34:55,244 --> 00:34:57,545
that I didn't mean for them
to have to come out like this.

675
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:59,414
No, no, they just...
they just...

676
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,416
they just want you
to be safe, Juice.

677
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:04,018
They... they want to make sure
that nothing bad happens.

678
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,386
Nothing bad <i>is</i> gonna happen.

679
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:07,588
Just... just come inside.

680
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,825
I can't be on the TV again,
man, in the handcuffs.

681
00:35:10,926 --> 00:35:13,161
I can't do that, with all the...

682
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:15,263
Okay, what do you...
what do you need?

683
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:18,099
Uh... what do you...
what do you want?

684
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,734
May... Maybe come inside, maybe.

685
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:21,736
And do it...
You mean, do it in here?

686
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:25,606
- Yeah, maybe I...
- Okay. Okay. That's easy. That's easy, just

687
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,708
give me one second, okay?
Okay, Juice?

688
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:29,710
He doesn't want to be
arrested outside.

689
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:32,113
You got to do it inside the
house, away from the cameras.

690
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,514
Gun's got to stay
inside the vehicle.

691
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:35,216
Okay, Juice,
we're good to go.

692
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:36,717
They're gonna do it
inside the house, okay?

693
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:38,086
You just got to make sure
that the gun

694
00:35:38,187 --> 00:35:39,754
stays inside the car.

695
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:41,389
You can't bring the gun outside.

696
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,723
Do you understand me?

697
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,225
That's-that's real important.

698
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:46,326
- Okay?
- All right, man. All right.

699
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,097
Okay.

700
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:51,099
Good. Stay with me, yes?

701
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,901
Okay, come on in, come
on in. Stay with me.

702
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:55,069
Simpson's about to exit
the vehicle.

703
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,737
Subject will not be armed.

704
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:58,739
No hotheads.
We're on TV.

705
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,308
Don't fire unless
you're fired upon first.

706
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:53,526
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

707
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,131
I'm sorry, you guys.

708
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:09,210
He's got a gun!

709
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,878
No, no!
Those are pictures!

710
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,080
Those are framed
pictures of his kids!

711
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,389
I'm sorry, guys.

712
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:35,169
Sorry.

713
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,438
91 clear. 8814 clear.

714
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:49,217
It's okay.

715
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:51,018
Okay, okay.

716
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,486
Oh.
All right, all right.

717
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,754
I-I got you.

718
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,729
- I got you.
- I'm sorry, Bobby.

719
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,564
No, no. No,
you're home now.

720
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:06,267
You're home, Juice.

721
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,902
- I'm so...
- Here we go. Here we go.

722
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:15,243
Can I speak
to my mama?

723
00:38:15,344 --> 00:38:17,712
And can I get
some orange juice?

724
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:19,979
Of course, O.J.

725
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:27,188
Hello, Mama.

726
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,390
Yeah. Yeah.

727
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:31,658
I know, Mama.

728
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:35,361
Okay.

729
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:40,667
I know, Mama.

730
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:43,536
Okay.

731
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,244
I love you, too, Mama.

732
00:38:50,345 --> 00:38:53,047
Right now, to wrap up
this, uh, live coverage,

733
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:56,584
so you can tune in to your
late local news, which will have

734
00:38:56,685 --> 00:39:01,222
plenty about how all this
unfolded. So, for right now,

735
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:02,957
Dan Rather with Connie Chung,

736
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:04,892
John Blackstone
and our colleagues

737
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:06,894
at KCBS in Los Angeles,
that's it.

738
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:09,964
We're taking him to trial.

739
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:11,565
The confirmation now
that that arrest

740
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:13,234
has taken place,
and, in fact a convoy...

741
00:39:13,335 --> 00:39:15,436
Too bad you're not
working on this case.

742
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:19,340
What? He better not.
He got framed.

743
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,775
I was thinking
the same thing.

744
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:22,276
Oh, come on.

745
00:39:22,377 --> 00:39:24,679
I can guarantee you
O.J. was not framed.

746
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,114
Sure he was.

747
00:39:27,215 --> 00:39:28,482
I haven't identified
that location yet.

748
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,151
That could prove to be
a bit of a challenge...

749
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:32,520
You stay the hell away
from this.

750
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,156
...those narrow streets around
the residence, they're now

751
00:39:35,257 --> 00:39:37,625
crowded with people.
There are, uh, hundreds

752
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:40,461
of teenagers out there with,
uh, many, uh, now shouting,

753
00:39:40,562 --> 00:39:42,662
uh, shouting O.J.'s name.
