10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,760
l've been inside with the
air-conditioner blastin' all day long.

11
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,520
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

12
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,440
Didn't you break for lunch or nothin'?

13
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,800
l'm by myself today.
l ate my lunch out of the microwave.

14
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,560
Jesus H. Christ, Pete.

15
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,600
When are you gonna learn that microwave
food will kill you faster than a bullet?

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,600
l mean, them damn burritos ain't good
for nothin' but a hippie...

17
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,800
when he's high on weed.

18
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,160
Pull me out a bottle of that Jack,
will you?

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,520
Yep.

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,080
l think l'm gonna get tanked tonight.

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,760
What's the matter?

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,160
Ohh, hell.

23
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,720
Been one long goddam hot,
miserable, shit-ass fuckin' day...

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,280
every inch of the way.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,960
First off, Nadine over
at the Blue Chip got sort of sick...

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,920
since she got that goddam Mongoloid boy
of hers workin' the grill.

27
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,240
l mean, that fuckin' idiot doesn't know
rat shit from Rice Krispies.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,240
l eat breakfast about 9:00,
and l'm pukin' up pigs in a blanket...

29
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,960
like a sick fuckin' dog by 10:30.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,760
lsn't there a law or somethin' against
retards servin' food to the public?

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,120
Well, if there ain't, there ought to be.

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,680
l mean, who in the hell knows
what's goin' on in the mind
of a goddamned Mongoloid?

33
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Nadine should've hit that boy in
the head and sold the fuckin' milk.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,280
You could sue the shit
out of her, you know that?

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,240
That kid belongs under a circus tent,
not flippin' burgers.

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,160
- You could own that fuckin' place.
- Oh, shit, Pete.

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,680
What would l do with that grease pit?

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,440
Besides, Nadine's got a cross to bear.

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,880
l mean, taking care
of that potato head.

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,800
l guess you heard about that shit
up in Abilene. Bank robbery?

41
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,160
lt's all that's been on the box all day.

42
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,240
They killed some people, didn't they?

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Yeah. Killed four Rangers...

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,920
three cops...

45
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,760
one civilian.

46
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,560
Took a lady bank teller
hostage with them.

47
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,160
Supposed to be headed for the border,
which'd bring 'em right my way.

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,960
Get my hands on them crazy, sick
fuckin' bastards, it's payback time.

49
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,080
l mean--

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,520
Well, we'll get 'em.

51
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,240
- We'll get 'em.
- Well, l don't doubt it.

52
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,480
Well...

53
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
l gotta drain my lizard.

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,160
Mind if l use your commode?

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,200
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,520
You're welcome.

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,160
Do you think l'm fuckin' playing
with you, asshole?

58
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,640
Do you want this little girl to die,
or that little girl or yourself?

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,880
Or your bosom buddy with the badge?
Now, l don't want to do it...

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,080
but l will turn this place into
the fucking Wild Bunch if l think
that you are fucking with me.

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,120
- What do you want from me?
l did what you said.
- You let him use the bathroom.

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,000
- No store does that.
- He comes in here every day,
and we bullshit.

63
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
He's used my toilet a thousand times.
lf l told him ""no,"" he'd know something
was up.

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,240
All right. l want him out of here,
in his car and down the road...

65
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,480
or you can change the name of this place
to ""Benny's World of Blood.""

66
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,200
Were you giving that pig signals?

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,200
Are you kiddin'?
l didn't do anything!

68
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
- He says you were scratching.
- l wasn't scratchin'!

69
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,400
- Are you calling him a liar?
- l'm not callin' him a liar, okay?

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,200
l'm simply sayin' if l was scratchin',
l don't remember scratchin'.
And if l did scratch...

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,360
it's not because
l was signalling the cop,
it's 'cause l'm fuckin' scared shitless!

72
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,720
Wait a minute.
The guy's in the bathroom.
Why don't l just go back there...

73
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,480
- shoot him in the back of the head,
and we can get the hell out of here?
- Don't do that!

74
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,040
Look, you asked me to act natural,
and l acted natural.

75
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,120
ln fact, under the circumstances,
l think l oughta get a fuckin'
Academy Award for how natural l acted.

76
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,720
You asked me to get rid of him.
l'm doin' my best!

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,040
Well, your best better get
a hell of a lot fucking better,

78
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,120
or you are gonna feel
a hell of a lot fucking worse.

79
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,280
Everybody be cool.
You be cool.

80
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,160
Yep. Be back at it tomorrow.

81
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,480
Tonight l'm gonna sit in front of that
box and get higher than a Georgia pine.

82
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,000
- How much you want
for that hooch, Pete?
- Oh, 6.50.

83
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,240
Jesus Christ. You buckin'
for early retirement?

84
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,320
Shit, yeah.

85
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,440
Hey! Hey! What the fuck is that about?

86
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,440
- He signalled the Ranger.
- l didn't! Ya gotta believe me!

87
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,640
- l didn't!
- When they were talkin',
he mouthed the words, ""Help us.""

88
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,520
- You fuckin' liar! l didn't say shit!
- Why don't you shut the hell up?

89
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,760
Hey! Will you stop it! What the fuck
is your problem, goddam it?

90
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,080
Seth, he did it!

91
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,280
You were by the beer cooler
with your back turned.

92
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,680
l was by the magazines.
l could see his face!

93
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,880
And l saw him mouth the words,
""Help us.""

94
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,400
Start the car.

95
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,360
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yes. Shut up.

96
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
And start the car, all right?
You start the car.

97
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,040
- You believe me, don't you?
- Start the car. You know that?

98
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Shut the fuck up and start the car.

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,160
- Wait, wait.
- l believe you. Start the car!

100
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,520
You-You're not just sayin' that?
You do believe me?

101
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
- l believe you! Let's go!
- That means you believe me.

102
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,760
- Yes, l believe you!
- You should, 'cause l'm right.

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,440
- Oh, shit!
- Ohh!

104
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
- Richie?
- Yeah?

105
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,960
You okay?

106
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,040
He shot me in the fuckin' hand!

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,680
- Like l told you, he said, ""Help us.""
- l never said ""help us""!

108
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Well, that doesn't matter now,
'cause you got about
two fuckin' seconds to live!

109
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,520
- Richie?
- Yeah?

110
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,240
When l count to three, you shoot
the bottles out from behind him.

111
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, yeah!

112
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,120
- One.
- Fuck!

113
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,640
Two.

114
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,200
Three.

115
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,520
What did l tell you?
What did l say to you?

116
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,960
- l said, ""Buy the road map and leave.""
- What the fuck am l supposed
to do, Seth?

117
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,800
- He recognized us.
- He didn't recognize shit.

118
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,840
Seth, l'm telling you,
the way he looked at us--

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
you, especially-- l knew he knew.

120
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Low profile. Do you understand
the meaning of the words ""low profile""?

121
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,840
""Hey, Richie, how's your hand?"" ""lt
hurts like a fuckin' son of a bitch!

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,320
- Let me tell you
what ""low profile"" is not.
- Thanks for askin'!""

123
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,880
lt is not taking girls hostage.

124
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,480
lt is not shooting police.
lt is not setting fire to a building.

125
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,880
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

126
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,040
Hot air hangs like a dead man

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,840
From a white oak tree

128
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,040
There's people sittin' on porches

129
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,640
Thinkin' how things used to be

130
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,840
Dark night

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,160
lt's a dark night

132
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,920
Dark night

133
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,120
lt's a dark night

134
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,760
My wife left home about a week ago

135
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,760
She stole the kids
and she took all my dough

136
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,880
- Move it!
- Goddam you. Goddam you.

137
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,160
- What the hell do you want?
- What do you think l want,
you mean old bastard?

138
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,560
l want a fuckin' room.

139
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,680
Okay. All right.

140
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,960
She peed on the carpet
She shot my horse

141
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,440
And now things are goin'
from better to bad to worse

142
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
Do they have cable?

143
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
No.

144
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,280
- Do they have the X-rated channel?
- No.

145
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,280
- Do they have a water bed?
- Nope.

146
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,560
- What do they got?
- They have four walls and a roof...

147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,000
and that's all we need.

148
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,840
All right, pop the trunk.
Let's do this fast.

149
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,240
- Oh.
- Don't say a word.

150
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,920
You, plant yourself in that seat.

151
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,880
- What are you gonna do with me?
- l said ""plant yourself.""

152
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,080
Plants don't talk.
Now, you wanna get on my good side...

153
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,320
you sit still
and you don't make a peep.

154
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,760
- All right, how does this feel?
- How do you think?

155
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,880
lt hurts like a son of a bitch.

156
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,640
All right. lt's wrapped too tight.
Nice and easy now.

157
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,960
- Okay.
- All right. Okay, l'm gonna
go get the money.

158
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,960
lt's 6:00. What time does it get dark
around here?

159
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,840
- About 8:00.
- Good. l'm going to the border,
check things out.

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,800
l'm gonna call Carlos, try and arrange
some sort of a rendezvous.

161
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,720
- l don't know what yet.
- Could you see if he could arrange
a better deal than 30%?

162
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,040
lt's their standard deal.
They're not gonna change that for us.

163
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,040
Did you even try
to negotiate with them?

164
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,600
Richie, these guys are not spic
firecracker salesmen from Tijuana.

165
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,080
They don't even know the meaning
of the word ""barter.""

166
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,160
You wanna stay in El Rey,
you give them 30% of your loot.

167
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,200
lt's scripture.
So it is written, so shall it be done.

168
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,040
- Look--
- Yeah, l know, listen. Hey, you want
sanctuary, you gotta pay the price.

169
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,320
The price is 30%.

170
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,280
- All l'm sayin', man--
- This conversation's over.

171
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,080
Okay?

172
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,760
We need to have a talk.
What's your name?

173
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,360
- Gloria.
- Hello, Gloria. l'm Seth.
That's my brother, Richie.

174
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,800
Let's cut to the chase.
l'm gonna ask you one question...

175
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,320
and all l want is a yes or no answer.

176
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,280
Do you wanna live through this?

177
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,360
- Yes.
- Good. Rule number one: no noise.

178
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,840
No questions. lf you make a noise...

179
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,640
Mr .44 makes a noise.

180
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,440
lf you ask a question,
Mr .44 answers it.

181
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,160
Now, are you absolutely, positively
clear about rule number one?

182
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,120
- Yes.
- Rule number two.

183
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,800
You do what we say when we say it.
lf you don't, see rule number one.

184
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Rule number three: Don't you ever try
and fucking run on us...

185
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,080
'cause l got six little friends...

186
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,600
and they can all run faster
than you can.

187
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,400
Open your eyes.

188
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,520
Gloria, you hang in there,
you follow the rules...

189
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,480
and you don't fuck with us,
and you'll get out of this alive.

190
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,040
l give you my word. Okay?

191
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,800
l'll be back in a minute.

192
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,960
You wanna come over on the bed
and watch TV with me?

193
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,640
- Hail!
- Come on.

194
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,080
Have a seat.

195
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,360
Come on.

196
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,080
Take off your shoes.

197
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,520
Foolish heart

198
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,760
- Foolish heart
- You made me weep

199
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,200
We got about two more hours...

200
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,280
till we get in to El Paso...

201
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,920
which is right next to the border.

202
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,040
- Then we'll stop at a motel.
- Stop?

203
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,000
- We're not actually gonna stop
at a motel, are we?
- Yeah, what for?

204
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,520
We have a motorhome. We don't wanna
stay in those roach haven motels, do we?

205
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,760
- We're self-contained.
- Okay, okay.

206
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,200
Maybe l was a little overzealous.
But give me a break. l just bought it.

207
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,720
How come you wanna stop anyways, Dad?

208
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,520
- l'm exhausted.
- Exhausted? Just lie in the back, Dad.

209
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,360
- l can drive us into Mexico.
- l just bet you would.

210
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,800
Don't even think about it.
Besides, l-l wanna have...

211
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,320
just one night's sleep
in an honest to goodness bed.

212
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
The beds in the home are okay, but...

213
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
they're not like a real bed.

214
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,320
Excuse me.
l have to use the restroom.

215
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh! Guess what. When l called
the machine to check the messages, um...

216
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,040
one of them was from Bethel Baptist.

217
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
And Mr Franklin said that...

218
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,440
he wouldn't permanently replace you
until we came back.

219
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,640
- And he said that--
- That's very nice of Ted.

220
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,720
But l'll call him tomorrow
and tell him not to bother waiting.

221
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,640
Daddy, l didn't wanna talk
about this in front of Scott...

222
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,960
because he gets upset,
but l just wanna know.

223
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,960
Don't you believe in God any more?

224
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,680
Not enough to be a pastor.

225
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,880
Look, l know this is hard on you kids.

226
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,680
After Jenny's death, this is probably
the last thing you need, but...

227
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,320
my congregation needs
spiritual leadership.

228
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,320
Well, my faith is gone.

229
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,360
To answer your question, yes,
l do believe in Jesus.

230
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,200
Yes, l do believe in God.

231
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,480
But do l love Them? No.

232
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,880
Well, it's just that all our lives
you've been a pastor.

233
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,600
And then one day, you're just gonna
wake up and say, ""Fuck Him""?

234
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,160
l didn't say, ""Fuck Him.""

235
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,960
Every person who chooses...

236
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,200
the service of God
as his life's work...

237
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,320
has something in common.

238
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,200
l don't care if you're
a preacher, a priest...

239
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,040
a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk.

240
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,920
Many, many times during your life,
you'll look at your reflection...

241
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,640
in the mirror and ask yourself...

242
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,680
""Am l a fool?""

243
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,640
l'm not going through a lapse.

244
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,160
What l've experienced is closer
to awakening.

245
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,080
Daddy?

246
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
What do you think Mom would say?

247
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,560
Mama's got nothing to say.
She's dead.

248
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,640
This bloody crime spree started
just a week ago today.

249
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,360
The oldest of the two brothers,
Seth Gecko...

250
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,640
was serving time in Rollings, Kansas
State Penitentiary...

251
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,360
for his part in the 1988 Scott City
bank robbery...

252
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,400
in which two law enforcement officers
lost their lives.

253
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,440
lt was while at the court house
that this man, his younger brother...

254
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,040
Richard Gecko, a known armed robber
and sex offender...

255
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,080
pulled off a daring daylight escape...

256
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,240
resulting in the death of four
Wichita law enforcement officers...

257
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,960
and this woman,
Heidi Vogel, sixth grade teacher,
who was run over by the Geckos...

258
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,680
during a high-speed pursuit
through downtown Wichita.

259
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,960
And earlier today, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs...

260
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,920
the Gecko brothers killed
another Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw...

261
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,960
and liquor store clerk, Pete Bottoms.

262
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,960
That changes the death toll to 16:

263
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,040
five Texas Rangers, eight
police officers, three civilians...

264
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,440
and one hostage: bank teller
and mother of four, Gloria Hill.

265
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
For the time being, we're very confident
that we'll apprehend...

266
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,200
these fugitives
within the next 48 hours.

267
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,600
The bureau, local law enforcement
and the Texas Rangers have all joined...

268
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,520
in forming a dragnet
to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.

269
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,640
ls it safe to assume that because
of the death count involved...

270
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,720
and the loss of life
of law enforcement officers...

271
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,920
that the bureau, the Rangers
and the police force...

272
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,560
are taking this manhunt personally?

273
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,280
l would say that's
a very safe assumption.

274
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,200
Shit, l was really worried.
Where the fuck you been, man?

275
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,760
- Sightseeing.
- What'd you see?

276
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,280
- The cops.
- Did you see the border?

277
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes, l saw the border.
What'd the TV say?

278
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,080
They're gonna apprehend us
in about 48 hours.

279
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,800
l gotta figure out a way to get us
across this goddam border.

280
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,920
The longer we stay here, our lives
ain't worth shit. Here you go.

281
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,800
We gotta get our asses
into Mexico tonight.

282
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,680
Then Carlos is gonna meet us there
at the rendezvous tomorrow morning.

283
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,280
Well, now, he and his boys--
both of them-- all of them--

284
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,160
are gonna escort us
into El Rey, and--

285
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,560
- Where's the woman?
- What?

286
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,320
What do you mean, what? The woman--
th-the host-- the fucking hostage.

287
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,400
Richard, where is she?

288
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,840
- She's in there.
- What the fuck is she doing in there?

289
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Now, Seth, wait a minute. Seth.

290
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,240
Richard, what's wrong with you?

291
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,520
Before you flip out, okay,
let me just explain what happened.

292
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
Yeah, ex-explain to me.

293
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,840
l need an explanation.
What is the matter with you?

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,640
There's nothing wrong with me, brother.
That woman tried to escape, and l did
what l had to do.

295
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,640
No, that woman wouldn't have said shit
if she had a mouth full of it.

296
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,280
- Wrong, wrong, wrong.
- Yeah.

297
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,400
- After you left, she became
a completely different person.
- Yeah.

298
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,080
ls it me? My fault?

299
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,360
- lt's not your fault.
- ls this my fault?

300
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,480
- No, it's her fault.
lt's not your fault.
- ls this my fault?

301
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,960
Do you think that this is what l am?

302
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,680
- l don't--
- This is not me.
l am a professional fucking thief.

303
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,120
l don't kill people that l don't have
to, and l don't fucking rape women.

304
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,480
What you are doing--
What you are fucking doing--

305
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,680
What you are doing is not how it's done.
Do you understand that?

306
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,040
Do you? Just say fucking ""yes.""

307
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,160
Say, ""Yes, Seth, l understand.""

308
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,560
- Yes, Seth, l understand.
- Say, ""Yes, Seth,
l fucking understand.""

309
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,040
l understand, Seth.
l fucking understand.

310
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
We'll get to Mexico,
and it's gonna be sweet rosemary...

311
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,680
and 100 proof liquor...

312
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,160
and rice and beans,
and none of this shit's gonna matter.

313
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,400
l can't believe he's stopping here.
This place is totally cruddy.

314
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,880
Dad, why are we stoppin' here?

315
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,640
There's nothing wrong with this place.

316
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,360
lt's a flophouse.

317
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,520
lt's not a flophouse.

318
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,280
lt's basic and simple.

319
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,080
That doesn't make it a flophouse.

320
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,240
All right. Well, if it doesn't have
a pool, then we're going someplace else.

321
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,720
lt has a bed.

322
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,480
That's all l care about.

323
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,920
Well, other places have beds too...

324
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,920
and they also have a gym, tennis--

325
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,400
Jeez, what is this guy's problem?

326
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,720
No idea.

327
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,960
Creepy guy.

328
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,200
- What?
- Yes, l'm your neighbour
from, uh, room 11...

329
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,080
and l hate to disturb you,
but l'd like to ask a favour.

330
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,840
l hope none of this is disturbing you.

331
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,320
Hi. Uh, l'm from room 11, and, uh...

332
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,200
me and my lady friend need some ice,
and we don't seem to have an ice bucket.

333
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,440
lf it's not too much trouble,
could l possibly borrow yours?

334
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,040
l'll bring it right back.

335
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,600
- Sure.
- Thank you.

336
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,400
What is this?

337
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,480
lt's called a punch.

338
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,040
Lose the guitar.

339
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,720
- What's your name?
- Jacob.

340
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,720
Jacob, get up, get on the bed.
lf you make a wrong move,
l will shoot you in the face.

341
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,520
Open your mouth. Wide.

342
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,960
Let's go. Let's move the Jap
over here too. Let's go.

343
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,760
So what's the story with you two?
You a couple of fags?

344
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,760
- This is my son.
- How does that happen?

345
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,480
- You don't look Japanese.
- Neither does he. He looks Chinese.

346
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,840
Oh, ooh, well,
excuse me all to hell.

347
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
- What's this about? Money?
- lt's about money, all right,
but not yours.

348
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,000
My brother and l, we're in a little
hot water. Now, l need your assistance.

349
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,040
- Stop!
- Wh-What's, um, goin' on?

350
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,440
We're havin' a bikini contest,
and you just won.

351
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,840
lt's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

352
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,840
You listen to your daddy, sugar,
and you don't do anything stupid.

353
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,760
You two--
Simon says sit the fuck down.

354
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,040
Sit down.

355
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,320
Now, where are the keys
to the motorhome?

356
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,760
On the dresser.

357
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,880
All right.
Richie, you take these keys.

358
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,280
You start this big bastard up
and drive it up front.

359
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,480
Richie, would you do me a favour
and eat my pussy for me? Please?

360
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,280
- Uh, sure.
- Richie, hey!

361
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,280
Not when you get around to it. Now.

362
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,520
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom
and put on some clothes.

363
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,560
You got three minutes. One second
longer, l shoot your father in the face.

364
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,600
- Do you understand what l just said?
- Yes.

365
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,120
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

366
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,160
You damn well better. Go.

367
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,600
Look, if you want the motorhome,
just take it and get out.

368
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,160
lt's not gonna be that easy, Pops.

369
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,520
We're gonna go on a little ride.

370
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,000
Not a chance.

371
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,240
- Come again?
- lf you're taking people, take me.

372
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,240
But my kids aren't going
anywhere with you.

373
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,840
Sorry, Pops. l need everybody.

374
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,720
My children are not going
with you, and that's that.

375
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,720
That's not fucking that.
This is fucking this.

376
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,560
Dad.

377
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,680
You sit down. Sit down.

378
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,440
You, go sit over there.
Go sit over there now. Move it.

379
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,160
Sit down.

380
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,840
Now, l don't have time to fuck around,
so l'm gonna make this simple.

381
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,600
You take your kids and you get
in that motorhome...

382
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,720
or l will execute all three
of you right now.

383
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,120
So, what's it gonna be?

384
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,200
Yes or no answer.

385
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,640
- Yes.
- Hey, your old man's all right.

386
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,800
He just saved your life.

387
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,640
Time's up, princess. Here we go.

388
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,400
Okay, ramblers, let's get rambling.

389
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,000
Excuse me.

390
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,440
What?

391
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Where are you takin' us?

392
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,040
- Mexico.
- What's in Mexico?

393
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,440
Mexicans.

394
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
- Richie?
- Yeah?

395
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,040
Put in your bit.

396
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,040
- l grind my teeth.
- Dengue woman

397
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,320
- What are their names?
- Scott and Kate.

398
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,600
Scott and Kate. Who's this?

399
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,960
- My wife.
- Where is the little lady?

400
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,920
ln heaven.

401
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,960
She dead?

402
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,960
- Yes, she is.
- How'd she die?

403
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Auto wreck.

404
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,360
Come on, Jacob, give me some
more details. How did it happen?

405
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,560
Some fuckin' drunk kill her?

406
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,760
No. lt was a rainy night.

407
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,520
The brakes on the car weren't great.

408
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,280
She had to stop suddenly.

409
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,920
She slid on the road.
She crashed. She died.

410
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,040
- She died right away?
- Not quite.

411
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,080
She was trapped in the wreck
for about...

412
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,280
six hours before she passed on.

413
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,960
Yep. Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

414
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,840
Yes, they do.

415
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,120
ls that real?

416
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,120
Yes.

417
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,040
l've seen one of these things before.
A friend of mine had himself ordained...

418
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,280
a minister of his own religion.

419
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,520
Some way to fuck the lRS.

420
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,600
ls that what you're doing,
or are you the real McCoy?

421
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,720
Real McCoy.

422
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,800
You're a preacher?

423
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,640
l was a minister.

424
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
""Was,"" as in not any more?

425
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,040
- Yes.
- Why'd you quit?

426
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,640
l think l've gotten about as up close
and personal with you as l'm gonna get.

427
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,240
Let's just keep this friendly, okay,
Pops? Let's not get too sensitive.

428
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,160
Oh, you're right.

429
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,160
Enough with the gettin'-to-know-you
shit. All right.

430
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,000
l don't give a rat's ass
about you or your fuckin' family.

431
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,920
You can all live forever,
or you can die this second.

432
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,000
And l don't give a shit which.
The only things that l care about...

433
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,280
are me, that son of a bitch back there
in the back and our money.

434
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,240
So you help us get across the border
without incident, you stay with us...

435
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,360
through the night
without trying anything funny,
without trying to escape...

436
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,280
and in the morning,
l'm gonna let you guys go, all of you.

437
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,120
How do l know you'll keep your word?

438
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,080
You have to convince me
you're telling the truth.

439
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,920
Look, dick-head, the only thing
that you have to be convinced about...

440
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,280
is the fact that you are stuck
in a situation with a couple
of real mean motor scooters...

441
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,200
and l don't want to have to worry
about you all fuckin' night.

442
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,480
You know, and l don't think you wanna
be worrying about my brother's...

443
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,320
intentions towards your daughter
all night either.

444
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,320
Did you notice the way
that he was looking at her?

445
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,120
- Yes.
- You didn't like it, did you?

446
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,840
- No, l didn't.
- l didn't think so.

447
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,960
You get us into Mexico...

448
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,640
and you don't try to escape,
and your daughter will be safe.

449
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,200
And in the morning, l will let you go.
l give you my word, Jacob.

450
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,240
lf he touches her, l'll kill him.

451
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,800
Fair enough. You break your word,
l'll kill all of ya.

452
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,520
You got me all crazy

453
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,440
l can't get outta of bed

454
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,000
Bones are achin'

455
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,360
Backed up in my head

456
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,720
Dengue woman

457
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,360
Stay away from me

458
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,000
You got your aches and pains

459
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,440
All over me

460
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,680
Did you mean what you said
back there in the room?

461
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,920
What?

462
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,160
ln the room.

463
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,880
Did you mean what you said back there,
or were you just foolin' around?

464
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,760
Because if-if you really want me
to do that for you, l will.

465
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
l'd be happy to.

466
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Do what?

467
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,160
What you said back there in the room.

468
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,280
What did l say?

469
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,760
- You asked me if l would eat out--
- Richie.

470
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,560
- What?
- l told you to watch those kids,
not to talk to them.

471
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,880
You don't have nothin' to say to one
another, so let's just cut the chatter.

472
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,280
We'll talk later, okay?

473
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,000
- Just stand back there.
- Move it up. Move it up.

474
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,760
All right, everybody. lt's show time.
Richie, you take Kate into the bathroom.

475
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,000
Scott, get up here with your dad.
Let's go. Let's go!

476
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,400
Now, what are you gonna say?

477
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,480
l don't have the slightest idea.

478
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,600
Just keep thinking about that gun
next to Kate's head.

479
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
Get in.

480
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,440
- Another one up. Come on.
- Come on. Let's go.

481
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,120
- This isn't gonna work, Seth.
- Shut up. lt's gonna work just fine.

482
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,800
Dad, what are you gonna do?

483
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,280
l'm gonna try and get us
across the border.

484
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,240
Dad, you have to tell them
that they're back there.

485
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,560
- Have you forgotten about your sister?
- l want to go on record right now as
saying that this is a very bad idea.

486
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,600
Duly noted. Now shut up.

487
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,000
Step right over there.
That's okay.

488
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,720
They're gonna kill us, Dad. They're
gonna get us across the border...

489
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,000
take us out in the desert somewhere,
then they're gonna fuckin' shoot us.

490
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,520
lf they get over the border,
they're gonna let us go.

491
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,200
They won't. Dad, come on.
l watch those reality shows.

492
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,960
They never let anybody go.
Any cop will tell you...

493
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,680
in a situation like this,
you get a chance and you go for it.

494
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,720
l know it may not seem like it,
but l know exactly what l'm doing.

495
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,400
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.
- l can't do that, Dad.

496
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,720
lf you don't tell the cops, l will.

497
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,600
Listen to me. You ain't gonna do
a goddamned thing, you hear me?

498
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,120
l'm runnin' the show.
l make the decisions.

499
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,400
- He is running the show.
- l'm running the show!

500
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,240
- Dad!
- l'm runnin' the show!

501
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,080
Shh. l make the plays.

502
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,080
You back the plays l make.

503
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,640
l need your cover.

504
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,920
Cover me.

505
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,000
How many with you?

506
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,800
Just my son and l.

507
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,520
What's your purpose in Mexico?

508
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,720
Vacation. l'm taking him
to see his first bullfight.

509
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,960
- They're gonna search the van.
- As long as you don't act...

510
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,720
like a fuckin' nut,
we're gonna be just fine.

511
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,000
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

512
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,120
- What?
- You just called me a ""fuckin' nut.""

513
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
- No, l didn't.
- Yes, you did.

514
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,640
You said as long as l don't act
""like a fucking nut.""

515
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,360
- lmplying that l've been acting
like a fucking nut.
- Take a pill, all right?

516
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
- l just meant be cool.
- Yeah, you meant that.

517
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,080
- But you meant the other too.
- This is not the time, Richie.

518
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,600
- Hey, fuck those spic pigs, man!
You called me a ""fucking nut.""
- Would you just--

519
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,120
- Now, where l come from,
that stops the train in its tracks.
- Keep your fucking voice down.

520
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,360
Or what?

521
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,400
What was that?

522
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,240
Oh. That was, uh...

523
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
just-just my daughter
in the bathroom.

524
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,760
l thought you said
it was just you and your son.

525
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,840
Um, l meant me and my son
and my daughter.

526
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,200
Open up. l'm comin' aboard.

527
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,000
What was the nuttiest thing
l did, Seth?

528
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,840
- l'm curious. Tell me.
What? What was it?
- This is not the time, Richie.

529
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,440
l know. Was it possibly when your ass
was rotting in jail and l broke it out?

530
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,640
Was that the nuttiest thing?
That was nutty, not to mention stupid.

531
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,160
Thanks.

532
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,800
- l'm in the bathroom.
- Open up. lt's the Border Patrol.

533
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,560
lt's open.

534
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:48,200
Do you mind?
Shut the fuckin' door, please.

535
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,160
Excuse me.

536
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,400
Goddam, that was intense!

537
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,080
Oh, baby, we did it.
We're in Mexico.

538
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,760
We're fuckin' in Mexico,
you little piece of fuckin' shit!

539
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,880
Come on! Kate, get out here.
Come on.

540
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,320
All right, listen up.
Everybody listen.

541
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,320
Now, l know that l've put
you all through hell...

542
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,800
and l know that l have been
one rough pecker.

543
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,640
But from here on out,
you guys are all in my cool book.

544
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,280
Now, Scotty, l want you to help me
with Richie. We're gonna lay him down
on the couch over there.

545
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,600
Jacob, you're gonna keep driving
down this street...

546
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,800
until you come to another street
called Digallo.

547
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,040
When you get to Digallo, you're
gonna turn this big bastard left...

548
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,600
and you're gonna go down a couple
of miles until you see a bar
called the Titty Twister.

549
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,840
From what l understand,
you cannot miss it.

550
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,680
- Then?
- And then you stop...

551
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
because that's where we're goin'.

552
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,440
Listen. Don't make a career
out of this, okay? Come on. Hey.

553
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,800
Hey. You okay?

554
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,600
Yeah, l think so.
What happened?

555
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,240
l don't know.
You just passed out.

556
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,600
- l did?
- You said something
about your hand hurtin'...

557
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,520
and then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.

558
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,160
- Really?
- Head hit the toilet.

559
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,840
You scared the shit out of me.
You sure you're okay there?

560
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,480
Yeah, l-l think so.
l'm just a little fucked up.

561
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,040
Well, let me tell you something
that's gonna clear your head right up.

562
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,320
- What?
- We are officially Mexicans.

563
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,160
- We're in Mexico, buddy.
- We are?

564
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,960
Yeah, we're headin' down
to the rendezvous right now.

565
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,440
We're gonna pound booze,
wait for Carlos.

566
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,960
When he gets there,
he's gonna take us down to El Rey.

567
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,560
And then you and l, my brother,
we're gonna kick fuckin' back.

568
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,880
How you like them apples?

569
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,480
Far out.

570
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,600
- Where's my glasses?
- Oh, uh, yeah, they, uh--

571
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,080
They broke when you fell.

572
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,360
- Fuck, Seth!
These are, like, my only pair.
- Well, don't worry about it.

573
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,760
-We'll get you another pair.
-What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Of course l'm gonna worry about it.

574
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,240
- l can't fuckin' see!
- l'll take care of it when we get
to El Rey.

575
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,600
Yeah, like some Mexican
hole in the wall's gonna
have my fuckin' prescription.

576
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,200
lt-lt's not a big deal
until you make it a big deal, Richie.

577
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,480
Now, l was in a very good mood, so stop
bringing me down with this bullshit!

578
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,440
l can't wear this shit.

579
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,320

Okay, troops, it's the homestretch.

Here's the deal.

Carlos is gonna meet us here

595
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,840
Now, we are gonna go in there.
We're gonna take a seat.

596
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,800
We're gonna have a drink.
We're gonna have a bunch of drinks.

597
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,080
And we're gonna wait for Carlos.
Let me say something.

598
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,480
l'm very happy about where we're at.
We got a real, nice...

599
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,960
l-don't-fuck-with-you, you-don't-
fuck-with-me attitude goin' on.

600
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,880
So if everybody just
keeps playin' it cool--
and l'm talkin' to you too, Richie--

601
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,160
then everybody's gonna get
what they want.

602
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,840
Okay, hard drinkers. Let's drink hard.
l'm buyin'. Come on.

603
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,840
Here we go.

604
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,200
Out of the stew pot
and into the fire.

605
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,600
Attention, pussy shoppers!
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.

606
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,200
lf you buy one piece of pussy
at the regular price...

607
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,080
you'll get another piece of pussy of
equal or lesser value for only a penny.

608
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,400
Try and beat pussy for a penny!

609
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,080
lf you can find cheaper pussy anywhere,
fuck it!

610
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,000
Hey, what do we have approaching here?

611
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,120
A new flavour: apple pie pussy.

612
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,160
- Hey, not so fast, slick.
- Step aside, asshole.

613
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,560
Now, is my shit together
or is my shit together?

614
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,560
Here we go.

615
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,440
Hi. How ya doin'?
Enjoying it? l hope so.

616
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,840
Now...

617
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,800
this is my kind of place.

618
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,800
l could become a regular.

619
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,200
Whisky.

620
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,320
- You can't come in here.
- What do you mean?

621
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,760
lt's a private bar.
You're not welcome.

622
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,800
Are you tellin' me that l'm
not good enough to drink here?

623
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,440
This bar is for bikers
and truckers only.

624
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,000
You, get out!

625
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,000
- Take your hand off of me.
- l'm gonna count to three.

626
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,720
No, l'm gonna count to three.

627
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,480
- One.
- Two.
- Now, wait a minute.

628
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:21,800
There's no reason to get ugly.
There is just a misunderstanding
going on here.

629
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,760
You said this bar is
for truckers and bikers?

630
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,640
Well, l'm a truck driver.

631
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,480
lf you look outside your door
in your parking lot, you'll see...

632
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,600
a big recreational vehicle.

633
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,600
That's mine. ln order
to drive that legally...

634
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,760
you need a Class Two driver's licence.

635
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,920
This bar is for truck drivers?
l am a truck driver.

636
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,720
And these are my friends.

637
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,480
Welcome to the Titty Twister.

638
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,680
Bottle of whisky and five glasses.

639
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,960
Coming right out.

640
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,080
- They serve food here, Jose?
- The best in Mexico.

641
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,920
l kind of doubt that.

642
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,040
We're gonna go over here. You send
a waitress over to take our order, okay?

643
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,720
Yeah!

644
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,600
Mary had a little lamb

645
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,040
His fleece was black as coal, yeah

646
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,360
Any time you want a lap dance
with that girl, kid,
just let me know, all right?

647
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,920
lt's on me.

648
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,040
- He followed her to school
- Pass.

649
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,600
- ls it against your religion?
- No, l do drink.

650
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,240
l'm just not drinkin' now.

651
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,080
Fair enough. More for me.
Scott, how 'bout you?

652
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,000
- No.
- Kate, how 'bout you?

653
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,280
No, l can't. l'm not 21 yet.

654
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,440
That means yes.
Post time, Kate!

655
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,440
Here we go. You slam it down, you knock
the glass down on the table, all right?

656
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,960
One, two, three!

657
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Thattagirl, Kate.

658
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,800
Scotty, you ready? Here we go.
You ready for one?

659
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,040
- Okay.
- No, you won't.

660
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,200
Yes, he will. Yes, he will,
because l'm not drinkin' by myself.

661
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,080
- Kate, round two.
You ready? Here we go.
- Yes, l'll have another one. Thank you.

662
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,080
On three. One, two, three.

663
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,960
Why are you so agitated?

664
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,560
l'm still stewin' about that ape
layin' his hand on me.

665
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,960
- What are you gonna do?
- l'm gonna sit here,
and l'm gonna finish this bottle.

666
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,000
And when l am finished,
l'm gonna take this bottle...

667
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,840
and l'm gonna bust it
over his melon fucking head.

668
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,680
Before we stepped in here,
you told all of us to be cool.

669
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,680
- So that means you too.
- l never said do what l do.

670
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,280
l said do what l say.

671
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,400
On my way l passed it

672
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,680
Express yourself

673
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,960
Are you such a fucking loser...

674
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,440
you can't tell when you've won?

675
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,400
- What'd you call me?
- Nothing.

676
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,680
l didn't make a statement.
l asked a question.

677
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,240
Would you like me to ask it again?

678
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,160
Are you such a loser,
you can't tell when you've won?

679
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,400
The entire state of Texas,
along with the FBl...

680
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,440
are looking for you.

681
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
Did they find you?

682
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,800
No, they couldn't.

683
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,280
You've won, Seth.

684
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,440
Enjoy it.

685
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Jacob...

686
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,600
l want you to have a drink with me.

687
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,720
l insist.

688
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,480
To your family.

689
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,480
To yours.

690
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,680
And now, for your viewing pleasure...

691
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,400
the Mistress of the Macabre...

692
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,920
the Epitome of Evil,
the most sinister woman to ever dance
on the face of this Earth--

693
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,880
- Bite this!
- Lowly dog.

694
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,200
Bow your head.

695
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,240
Kneel and worship at the feet...

696
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,720
of Santanico Pandemonium!

697
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Watching her

698
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,640
Strolling in the night

699
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,760
So right, wondering why

700
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,600
lt's only after dark

701
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,840
ln her eyes

702
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,480
The distant firelight

703
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,800
Burns bright, wondering why

704
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,880
lt's only after dark

705
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,720
Find myself

706
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,200
ln her room

707
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,320
Feel the fever

708
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,720
Of my doom

709
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,720
Falling, falling
through the floor

710
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,760
l'm knocking on
the devil's door, yeah

711
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,160
Burning, burning

712
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,680
ln the flame

713
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,320
Now that l know her secret name

714
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,640
You can tell whose heaven will go

715
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,320
But she'll be back
and through the gate

716
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,440
That's what l call a fuckin' show!

717
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,960
Come here!

718
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,120
- That guy. lt's the puta over there.
- Richie, get back on the clock.

719
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,440
- How many?
- Three.

720
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,360
Which one?

721
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,800
This piece of shit here, man...

722
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,440
broke my finger and my nose!

723
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,480
And this faggot kicked me in the ribs
while l was down.

724
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,120
- Up!
- Fuck off, bogeyman!

725
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,840
Fuck!

726
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,280
All right, everybody be cool, or you'll
be just as dead as these fucks!

727
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,000
How's your hand?
Let me see it.

728
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,800
Shit.

729
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,440
Do you think that was funny?

730
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,320
Sit down!

731
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,000
- Richie, look out!
- Motherfuckin' shit!

732
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,080
- Get the fuck off!
- Hey! Hey!

733
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,560
- Get her off me!
- Hey! Hey!

Hey.

What the fuck?

743
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,320
Dinner is served.

744
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,760
Fuck!
Get off me, man!

745

Come on! Come on, you!

746
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,280
No, no, no!
Look out! Look out!

747
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,200
You know what everybody

Let's see if you taste

01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,920
Fuck you.

751
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,960
Hey, hey, hey!

752
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,520
Oh, shit.

753
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,360
Huh?

754
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,080
Give me that!

755
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,640
l'm not gonna drain you
completely.

756
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,760
You'll be my slave.

757
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,920
Because l don't think
you're worthy of human blood...

758
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,440
you'll feed on the blood
of stray dogs.

759
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,080
You'll be my footstool,
and at my command...

760
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,920
you'll lick the dog shit
from my boot heel.

761
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,200
- Oh.
- Since you'll be my dog...

762
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,520
your new name will be Spot.

763
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,120
Welcome to slavery.

764
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,160
No, thanks.
l already had a wife.

765
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,280
We might be in trouble.

766
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,040
Yo. Monkey man.

767
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,200
Anything you got
to say to them...

768
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,720
you can say to me first.

769
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,680
That's enough.

770
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,400
Ain't they supposed to
burn up or somethin'?

771
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,640
Fuck.

772
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,160
Now let's kill that fucking band.

773
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,160
l can do that.

774
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,040
Fuck you, everybody!
Good night!

775
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,040
Fuckers.

776
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,480
Hey, buddy.

777
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,240
l'm sorry
l fucked things up, Richie.

778
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,600
You would've liked it in El Rey.
You would've--

779
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,320
You would've found peace there.

780
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,880
l love you, buddy.

781
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,400
l love you too, Seth.

782
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,320
You touch my brother
with that stake, biker...

783
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,480
and vampires aren't gonna have to
suck your blood; they'll be able to
lick it up off the floor.

784
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,960
- He's not your brother any more.
- That's a matter of opinion,
and l don't give a fuck about yours.

785
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,640
Don't be a fool!
He'll kill us all.

786
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,480
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

787
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,720
Let's go. Move. Move. Move.

788
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,000
Hold him down.

789
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:03,920
Richie, here is the peace in death...

790
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,360
that l could not give you
in life.

791
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,880
Fuck.

792
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,480
Seth, are you okay?

793
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,480
l'm peachy. Okay?
The world is my oyster.

794
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,000
Except for the fact that l just--

795
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,360
l just rammed a wooden stake
into my brother's chest...

796
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,880
because he turned into a vampire...

797
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,120
even though
l don't believe in vampires.

798
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:58,280
Aside from that
unfortunate business...

799
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,680
everything is hunky-dory.

800
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,440
- l'm really, really sorry.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

801
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,000
lf it were to up to you
if you had half a chance,
you would feed us to those fucks.

802
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,400
Then why didn't l?

803
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,640
l'm sorry you lost your brother.
l'm sorry he's dead.

804
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,760
l'm sorry everybody's dead.

805
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,840
But if we're gonna get out of this we
need you clean and sober and thinking...

806
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,240
not drunk.

807
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,560
- What is that?
- Don't know.

808
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,600
First l thought it was just birds.

809
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,040
lt's bats.

810
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,640
Give me a hand.

811
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,320
Hey!

812
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,840
Whoa.

813
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,480
You're dead! Oh!

814
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,960
Come on!

815
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,440
We'll take care of this mess.
Go stake the rest of those ugly fucks.

816
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,040
l'm way ahead of you.

817
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,840
- Watch your step.
What's your name, girlie?
- Kate. What's yours?

818
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,880
- Sex Machine.
Pleased to meet you, Kate.
- Me too.

819
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,480
Okay.

820
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,080
- ls everybody okay?
- Yeah, l'm okay.

821
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,360
- Does anybody know
what's going on here?
- l know what's going on.

822
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,520
We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires
out there trying to get in here
and suck our fuckin' blood.

823
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,520
And that's it.
Plain and simple.

824
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,520
And l don't wanna hear anything about
""l don't believe in vampires""...

825
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,240
because l don't fucking believe
in vampires...

826
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,760
but l believe in my own two eyes
and what l saw is fucking vampires.

827
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,000
Now, do we all agree that
what we are dealing with is vampires?

828
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,520
- Yes.
- You too, Preacher?

829
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:21,000
- l don't believe in vampires,
but l believe in what l saw.
- Good for you.

830
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,200
All right, now that we all agree
that we're dealing with vampires,
what do we know about vampires?

831
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,680
Crosses hurt vampires.
Do we have a cross?

832
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,400
- ln the motorhome.
- ln other words, no.

833
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,560
Wait a second. l mean, just look around.
We got crosses all over the place.

834
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,040
All you gotta do is put two sticks
together and you got a cross.

835
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:38,880
Yeah, he's right.
Peter Cushing does that all the time.

836
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,040
Okay, l'll buy that.
So we got crosses covered. What else?

837
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,760
Wooden stakes in the heart
been workin' pretty good so far.

838
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,080
And garlic. Sunlight. Holy water.

839
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,040
l'm not sure-- Eh, doesn't silver
have somethin' to do with vampires?

840
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,520
- That's werewolves.
- l know silver bullets
are werewolves...

841
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,800
but l'm sure silver has
something to do with vampires.

842
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,000
Well, does anybody have
any silver?

843
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,520
Okay. Then who cares?

844
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,920
Has anybody here read
a real book about vampires...

845
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,840
or are we just remembering
what some movie said?

846
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,760
- l mean, a real book.
- You me-- You mean,
like a Time-Life book?

847
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,840
l take it the answer's no.

848
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,680
Okay, then, what do we know
about these vampires?

849
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,280
Well, we know they got superhuman
strength, but we can hurt 'em.

850
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,200
- Yeah.
- Another thing, though.

851
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,840
lf you're gonna drive a chair leg
through a human, you'd better be
one strong son of a bitch.

852
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,160
l mean, the human body
is one rough, tough machine.

853
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,080
But these vamps-- these vamps,
they're, they're, they have soft bodies.

854
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:38,920
The texture of their skin is softer.
They're mushier.
You can push it right through them.

855
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,000
You see, but if you hit one hard enough,
take their head right off.

856
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:49,760
Actually, our best weapon
against these satanic cocksuckers...

857
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,160
is this man.

858
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,000
He's a preacher.

859
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,440
As far as God's concerned, we might
as well all be a piece of shit...

860
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,480
but he is one of the boys.

861
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,840
Only one problem:
His faith isn't what it used to be.

862
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,960
l've had enough of your taunts.

863
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,480
l'm not taunting you, Jacob.
We need you.

864
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,640
A faithless preacher
doesn't mean shit to us.

865
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:25,480
A servant of God can take a cross
and shove it up these monsters' asses.

866
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:30,120
A servant of God can bless the tap water
and make it a weapon.

867
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,280
Jacob, l know
why you lost your faith.

868
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,160
How could holiness exist...

869
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,120
if your wife can be taken away
from you and the children?

870
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,600
l've always said
that God can kiss my ass...

871
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,080
but l just changed my lifetime tune
about 30 minutes ago...

872
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,800
'cause l know that whatever
is out there tryin' to get in...

873
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,840
is pure evil straight from hell.

874
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,480
And if there is a hell
and those sons of bitches are from it...

875
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,520
then there has got to be
a heaven, Jacob, there's gotta be.

876
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,160
So, which are you?

877
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:17,080
Are you a faithless preacher, or are you
a mean motherfuckin' servant of God?

878
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,440
l'm a mean...

879
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,400
servant of God.

880
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:43,160
l don't know if l can take
much more of that noise.

881
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,720
Sure you can.

882
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,480
You can take it
because you got no choice.

883
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:55,440
How'd you like to spend 24 hours of it
lyin' in some muddy ditch...

884
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,520
with nothing but the rotten corpses
of your friends to keep you company?

885
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,120
What are you talking about?

886
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,680
l was in 'Nam back in '72.

887
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:16,880
l was trapped behind enemy lines
with my entire squad dead.

888
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,280
They thought
they had killed everyone.

889
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,000
Except for me,
they was right.

890
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,720
But it wasn't for
their lack of tryin'.

891
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,040
A grenade blew up right beside me.

892
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,400
That's why l'm so pretty.

893
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,480
And they started pushin'
all them bodies in on top of me...

894
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,600
and all l could do was lay there,
play possum...

895
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,560
listen to the enemy joke, laugh.

896
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,840
Hour after hour after hour
l lay--

897
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,160
- Kill them. Kill them all.
- Kill them.

898
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,600
- Kill them.
- Kill them all.

899
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,400
Sex Machine.

900
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,640
- Kill them.
- Kill them.

901
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,840
Kill them!

902
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,680
So l finally climbed
out of this hole...

903
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,960
and l sneaked up on the enemy
while he was sleepin'...

904
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,160
and l killed one,
two, three, four, five--

905
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,680
When l came to my senses...

906
01:18:53,840 --> 01:19:00,280
l realized l'd killed
an entire V.C. squad single-handed.

907
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:04,120
There was blood...

908
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:09,320
and chunks of yellow flesh
clinging to my bayonet.

909
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,320
To this day, l don't remember--

910
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,680
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
Please! Get it off!

911
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,520
No!

912
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,600
Dad!

913
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,440
Fuckin' bit me.
Fuckin' bit me!

914
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,240
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Come on, Sex Machine!

915
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:13,120
Oh, shit!

916
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,640
Get up. Get up! Up! Come on!

917
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,320
Go! Come on!

918
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:53,640
- Wait. We have to go back
for my father.
- Your dad's dead, Kate.

919
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,680
He is the light.

920
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,920
The people who walk...

921
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,960
in the darkness...

922
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,680
have seen the light!

923
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,240
Open the door!

924
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,360
Open the door!

925
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,480
- Go! Go!
- Daddy!

926
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,880
Jacob, are you bit?

927
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,880
Yeah.

928
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,120
Motherfuck.
Motherfucking vampires!

929
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:37,160
l'm gonna kill every last one
of you godless fuckin' pieces of shit!

930
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:41,640
You bet you are, and l'm gonna help
you do it. But we ain't got much time.

931
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,880
- You're gonna be okay, aren't you?
- No, l'm not.

932
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,840
l've been bit.
ln fact, l'm already dead.

933
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,840
Now, l'd say in the next
20 or 30 minutes...

934
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,960
our friends outside
will bust in this door...

935
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,040
and l'll probably turn into a vampire
within the hour.

936
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,640
Now, you have two choices: You can wait
for me to turn, then deal with me,

937
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,840
or we can kick open that door...

938
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,080
and the four of us can go at 'em,
hit 'em with everything we have.

939
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:13,120
But if we're gonna go at 'em,
we gotta go at 'em now.

940
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,960
What's this stuff?

941
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:22,880
My guess is this little dive
has been feeding on bikers
and truckers for a long time.

942
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,120
This is probably the shipments
that they stole off the trucks.

943
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,120
Well, l say let's tear
this place apart for weapons...

944
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,120
so when they burst through the door
we'll make 'em wish they never did.

945
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:34,000
l don't care about livin' or dyin'
any more. l just wanna send as many
of these devils back to hell as l can.

946
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,320
Amen.

947
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,360
Loving God, bless this water and give us
your protection and strength...

948
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,560
- in this, our darkest hour. Amen.
- Amen.

949
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,960
Before we go any further l need
you three to promise me something.

950
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:57,840
l'll fight with you to the bitter end,
but when l turn into one of them...

951
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,720
l won't be Jacob any more.

952
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,440
l'll be a lapdog of Satan.

953
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,280
l want you three to promise you'll take
me down, no different from the rest.

954
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,320
l promise, Jacob.

955
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,440
Kate? Scott?

956
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,720
- l promise.
- Scott.

957
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,120
Yeah, l promise.

958
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,560
Why don't l believe you?

959
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,040
l'm gonna ask you two again.

960
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:32,640
Then l want you to swear to God
that you'll kill me!

961
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,840
lf you don't, l'm gonna just
kill myself right now.

962
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,080
Now, since you need me
l think you'd better swear!

963
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:44,760
Kate, do you swear to God...

964
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,240
that when l become one of the undead
you'll kill me?

965
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:54,680
Kate! We don't have much time, so l'm
only giving you to the count of five.

966
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,840
One, two, three, four--

967
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,400
Okay! All right!
l promise l'll do it!

968
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,560
Good girl. Now, Scott,
we have even less time...

969
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,560
so l'm givin' you
to the count of three.

970
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,800
- One--
- You don't--
You don't believe in suicide.

971
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,080
lt's not suicide
if you're already dead. Two!

972
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,160
Okay! Okay.

973
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,560
l'll kill you when you change.
l swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

974
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,080
- Thank you, son.
- Okay, vampire killers.

975
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,120
Let's kill some fuckin' vampires.

976
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,040
Come out of darkness
and see the light.

977
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:55,240
Come out of darkness
and see the light.

978
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,600
From the darkness to light.

979
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,000
Come out of darkness
and see the light.

980
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,960
Come out of darkness
and see the light.

981
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,600
Kill 'em all!

982
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,200
Come on! Come on!

983
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,160
Dad?

984
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,760
Dad, not y-- Aah!
Dad! Dad! Dad!

985
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:11,800
l swear to God
in Jesus Christ's name.

986
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:18,320
- Oh, my God!
- Fight now, cry later!

987
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:27,440
Get the fuck off!
No! Get off! Get off! Off! Get off!

988
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,480
Kill me, Kate.

989
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:46,200
Just kill me, Kate.

990
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,040
l can't.

991
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:11,120
- How many bullets do you have?
- l don't know. Not many.

992
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:15,040
When you run out, start cold-cockin'
'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.

993
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,880
Seth, should l save
the last bullets for us?

994
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:31,360
No. Use it on the next fuck
that tries to bite you.

995
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,240
Shoot more holes.
Shoot more holes!

996
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,560
- Perfect.
- Oh, they can't go into the light.

997
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:55,360
Perfect.
All right, go.

998
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,840
Seth, don't leave me.

999
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,560
Hey! Come on, then. Come on.
Come here. Come on!

1000
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:08,120
Come on, you! Come on!
Come here, you fucks!

1001
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,120
Hello!
l'm looking for my friend Seth!

1002
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,200
Carlos! Kick in the door!

1003
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:30,000
- Go!
- Son of a bitch.

1004
01:33:58,760 --> 01:34:01,600
What the fuck
was goin' on in there?

1005
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:07,680
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?

1006
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,200
Why, out of all the godforsaken
shitholes in Mexico...

1007
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,200
do we have to meet here?

1008
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:18,280
One place is just as good
as another.

1009
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:22,080
- You never been here before?
- No.

1010
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,600
l drove by it a couple times.

1011
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:27,600
lt's a rowdy place. lt's out in the
middle of nowhere. There'll be no cops.

1012
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,040
And it's open from dusk till dawn.
Hey, didn't you say you wanted
to meet in the morning? Here we are.

1013
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,480
Well, since you just picked this place
out of a hat, my brother is dead.

1014
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:38,160
That girl's
entire fucking family is dead.

1015
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,880
- What, were they psychos, or--
- They look like psychos?

1016
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,240
ls that what they looked like?
They were vampires.

1017
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,240
Psychos do not explode
when sunlight hits 'em.

1018
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,160
l don't give a fuck
how crazy they are.

1019
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:56,720
Seth, how can l make it up to you?

1020
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:00,000
Can't-- You can't make it up to me,
Carlos. l tell you, you can't do it.

1021
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,400
Can't make it up.

1022
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:08,320
Fifteen percent instead of
thirty percent for my stay in El Rey.

1023
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,040
That's a good start.

1024
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,880
- Twenty-eight.
- My brother's gone.

1025
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:19,080
You understand that? He's gone, and he's
not coming back, and that is your fault.

1026
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,480
Twenty.

1027
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,240
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-five.

1028
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,600
Kate, go to the RV,
get the suitcase.

1029
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,360
You look like hell.

1030
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,640
You want a cold beer?
l got some in the car.

1031
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,120
Come on. They're cold. Huh?

1032
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,520
l got Mexican and domestic.

1033
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,800
- So, how do you like the car?
- lt's all right.

1034
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,640
l said ""like new.""
This is a '90.

1035
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,640
Hey, it is new, cabron. Belonged
to a drug dealer friend of mine.

1036
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,960
Hey, he only drove it, like,
14 times in five years.

1037
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,400
lt's like new, l swear to God.

1038
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,760
- So, what do l do, follow you?
- Yeah. Follow me.

1039
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,160
All right, let's do it.

1040
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,800
l'm sorry.

1041
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,520
Yeah, l'm sorry too.

1042
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,280
- l'll see you.
- Seth.

1043
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,080
You need some company?

1044
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:15,160
Kate, do you know where l'm going?
Do you know what El Rey is?

1045
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:19,040
- No.
- Hey, Seth.

1046
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,720
lt's time to go.

1047
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,080
Go home, Kate.

1048
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,360
l may be a bastard,
but l'm not a fuckin' bastard.

1049
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,600
Hot air hangs
like a dead man

1050
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,000
From a white oak tree

1051
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,240
There's people
sittin' on porches

1052
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,960
Thinkin' how things used to be

1053
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,920
Dark night

1054
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:23,600
lt's a dark night

1055
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,920
A dark night

1056
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,520
lt's a dark night

1057
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,600
Everything about her
was natural

1058
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,160
Everything about her
was cool

1059
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:16,080
But l'm a little partial
for those beautiful girls

1060
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:19,960
Even if their bloods
run blue

1061
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,280
l think l see her

1062
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,640

1064
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,520
She's just killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me

1065
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,920
l think she's killin' me

1066
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:49,320
Her castanets are enormous

1067
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:53,080
Her bongo beat absolute

1068
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:56,560
And when she doin'
midnight performances

1069
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:00,200
She's got a secret
somethin' to boot

1070
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,760
Yeah

1071
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,840

1072
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:08,320

1073
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,600
Oh, l think l love her

1074
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,400
But she's just killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me

1075
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,800
l think she's killin' me

1076
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,920
Ohhh

1077
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:33,760
Miss Santanico Pandemonium

1078
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,920
Don't get any lower
or slower

1079
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:40,760
What you see is
what you're gettin' conmigo

1080
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:43,920
And the bonus
of an albino boa

01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,000

1082

She's just killin' me
Killin' me, killin' me

1085
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:04,720
She's just killin' me
That's some time l had

1086
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,320
Oh, l think l see her

1087
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,120
