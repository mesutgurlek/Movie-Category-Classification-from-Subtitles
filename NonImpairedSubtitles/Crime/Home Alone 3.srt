1
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:05,263
Ten million dollars
for the missile chip.

2
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,501
Not a plan,
but the chip itself.

3
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,337
Why the big price?

4
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,175
My clients have requested it.

5
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,010
I honor my clients'
request.

6
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:25,450
Sounds like your clients
want to build a missile that
can't be detected by radar.

7
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:29,854
I don't ask questions,
Mr. beaupre,

8
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,023
but whoever possesses
this chip...

9
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:35,860
Could dominate
the entire region.

10
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:48,039
Good night, George.
Good night, Mr. Cooper.

11
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,311
Jesus.

12
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,583
He's clean.
Here.

13
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:36,020
Uh, that's, uh--
that's what you asked for.

14
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,057
Air force n.S.B. 100
"c" series.

15
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:43,528
If that goes in a missile,
air defenses can't stop it.

16
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,099
Uh, look.
I got a plane to catch.

17
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,069
Where's my money?

18
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,148
Here. Hide it in the toy car.

19
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,219
We'll slip it right past
airport security.

20
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:19,998
Let's go.

21
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,715
Please remove your jewelry
and place it in the bowl.

22
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,617
My jewelry?
Yes, ma'am.

23
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,186
Step back.

24
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,224
Let's go.

25
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,160
Ma'am, you'll
have to wait. Please.

26
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,162
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

27
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:28,032
That's it. Everything.

28
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:31,302
Thank you.
Thank you.

29
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,042
Next, please.
Thank you.

30
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,513
Next, please.
Thank you.

31
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,763
Oh, my god.

32
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,424
It's cold in here.

33
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,393
They're on time. On time.

34
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,628
Yeah. There's my dad.
Move.

35
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,664
- Move!
- Oh, my god. There's Amy.

36
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,134
Young man!

37
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:44,575
I checked the Dallas, Miami,
New York and Denver lounges.
Nothing.

38
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,178
Bars, restaurants,
club lounge-- clean.

39
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,282
When I was in the John,
i didn't see anything
in there.

40
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,786
It has to be on a plane.

41
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:03,828
We are going to Chicago.

42
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,397
In the winter?

43
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:10,134
I packed tropical.

44
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:14,472
Welcome to Chicago, where it's
a balmy 29 degrees outside.

45
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,842
- Welcome to Chicago.
- Bye. Thanks.

46
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,844
Bye now. Thank you.

47
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,146
Welcome to Chicago.

48
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,714
Bye-bye.
Bye.

49
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,317
Welcome to Chicago.

50
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,457
Here you go, sir.

51
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,492
Thanks.

52
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:40,264
- Mr. beaupre!
- Mr. unger and Mr. jernigan.

53
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,632
Excuse me.

54
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,768
- Excuse me. Move.
- Out of my way.

55
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,837
Did you check any bags, ma'am?

56
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,874
No. Floor it.

57
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:08,126
She's leaving.

58
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,532
Hey!

59
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:51,569
That's him.

60
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:57,942
Excuse me, pop.
Can I ask you somethin'?

61
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:02,446
What?
You had a fare from
the airport around 1620 hours,

62
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,948
January 8.

63
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,517
Senior citizen.
Female. Caucasian.

64
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,253
What?
About 4:30 today.
Old broad.

65
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,556
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You got an address on that?

66
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:15,660
W-- well, north Devon park.
Uh, Washington street.

67
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,929
Describe the house, please.

68
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,830
Well, big, old,

69
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,432
uh, tudor-like place.

70
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,869
- Details.
- Christmas lights.
Wreath on the door.

71
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,671
Christmas tree
at the end of the driveway.

72
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:32,543
And the driveway
was the only one on the block
that wasn't shoveled.

73
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,395
I'm all done, Mrs. hess.

74
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,365
I'm exhausted and sweaty,
but you can't see 'cause
I'm all covered up.

75
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,034
You were supposed to
deal with the snow promptly,
weren't you?

76
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,770
- Yes, but--
- butts are for ashtrays.

77
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:05,376
I don't care for excuses.
We had an understanding,
and you broke it.

78
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,679
Your word is worthless.
Sorry. That'll be
no charge, Mrs. hess.

79
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:13,684
So you can tell
the neighborhood I stiffed you
on a snow removal job?

80
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,319
Mm-mmm.

81
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:22,526
Oh. Is this a loaf
of the famous San Francisco
sourdough bread?

82
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:24,729
This won't make a very tasty
sandwich, will it?

83
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:30,768
- Huh?
- Some silly, inconsiderate
boob who took my bag--

84
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,672
I left my bread
in San Francisco.

85
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,677
Pardon me, Mrs. hess,
but I think
I'm almost, maybe,

86
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,513
possibly, probably
gonna be late for my dinner.

87
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,816
Consider this your payment.
I have no use
for the silly thing.

88
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,353
Thank you.
And have your mother
teach you...

89
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,858
That it is rude
to scratch yourself
in the presence of a lady.

90
00:09:56,995 --> 00:10:00,398
Good night, Alex.

91
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,435
Geez. What a grouch.

92
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:39,870
They're all old.
Most of them are tudor.

93
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,106
They all have wreaths
and old Christmas trees.

94
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,042
And the snow's
all been shoveled.

95
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,811
There are 14 houses.

96
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,113
The toy car must be
in one of them.

97
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,749
We're going to have to
search them all.

98
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,617
We'll come back
when it's light.

99
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,920
We're gonna work houses
in broad daylight?

100
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,357
It's the suburbs,
Mr. unger.

101
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:02,560
Nobody's home during the day.

102
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,909
There you go, speedy.

103
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,544
Charlie, we went
through this last year.

104
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,647
I told you then,
I'm telling you now.
I can't work weekends.

105
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,016
Why not?
I've got three kids
and a husband.

106
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,552
Mary Lou does.
Well, that's Mary Lou.
She has no life.

107
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,622
It means nothing to her
to work weekends.
But I can't do that.

108
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,791
Come on, Karen.
I'm living in a house
that's half renovated.

109
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,060
My kids have activities.
They need to see their
parents doing something...

110
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,529
Other than running
to the car in the morning.

111
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:15,699
I can't really explain
over the phone why we're so
excited about this product.

112
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,501
Okay. But you'll be here
on Wednesday.

113
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,204
Right. I'll be in Cleveland
on Wednesday.
Yeah. Wednesday.

114
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,808
And we'll talk about it then,
face to face.
Man to man.

115
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,843
Yeah. Man to man.
All right.

116
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,314
Your brother's bug.
Your brother's bug.

117
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,249
Careful. Careful.

118
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,251
Oh.

119
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,854
Hmm.
Bull's-eye.

120
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,991
Three from downtown.

121
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,727
And the crowd
goes wild.

122
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:29,940
Oh, man.

123
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,977
I hope they're not--

124
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,886
Alex slammed the toilet seat
down on his thing again.

125
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,187
Bull's-eye.

126
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,189
Alex? What happened?

127
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,157
I had nothing to do with this.
I'm innocent.

128
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,028
Yeah. I-- I gotta go.
My kid slammed the toilet
seat on his thing again.

129
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,130
Huh?
I'll call you back.

130
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,733
All right.
Alex?

131
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,904
Keep that in your mouth.
Mm-hmm.

132
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,173
Chicken pox.
Mom, with all due respect,

133
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,945
this is a scam to get out of
having to turn in his science
project because his bug died.

134
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,214
- What?
- His face doesn't
look that bad.

135
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:14,985
- His body is covered.
- Would that include
his buttock region?

136
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,620
- Shut up!
- This is great.

137
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,557
If he scratches
his chicken spots,
we could call him scar butt.

138
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,127
- Leave.
- Good-bye.

139
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,062
I'll go make you some soup.

140
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,198
I'll bring the TV up
from the family room.

141
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,668
Oh, I'm so sorry.

142
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,202
Hey. Don't scratch.

143
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,205
Keep that under your tongue.
I'll be right back.

144
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,777
Nice family.
Huh, Doris?

145
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:51,789
Take off. You guys
should get going.
See you later, dad.

146
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,974
Mr. greenfield's 401k
is invested in the eafa fund.

147
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,309
You have it listed
in the mid-cap fund.

148
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,845
That's where your 3,000
shortfall is.
Oh. Okay.

149
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,880
Okay?
So you're gonna
make it up next quarter.

150
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,783
Bruce, can i--
i just have to
put you on hold. One sec.

151
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:23,954
Alex. I'm on with the office.

152
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,823
So I think that what we--

153
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:30,394
I'm really sorry, Bruce.
Can I just call you back
in a minute? Thanks.

154
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:39,236
Three, two. Now hold.

155
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:44,208
- And. Let's--
gotcha.

156
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,610
You rang?

157
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,154
Thirsty?

158
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,362
Thanks, mom.

159
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,964
Oh. Here we are.

160
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,900
I do wish that my husband
could have been here today.

161
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,736
Well, it's a cozy
little place.
Oh!

162
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,872
Well, isn't this charming?

163
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,042
And it's available
immediately.

164
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:22,012
My boys are just
gonna love it here.

165
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,381
Yes, they will.

166
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:38,062
Plus special care and feeding
tips next onspets on parade.

167
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,905
Look, Doris.

168
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:59,283
If you think that was amusing,
wait till you see
what I do next.

169
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,063
Oh, yeah.

170
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,812
This is a very important piece.

171
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,152
Hmm?

172
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:32,509
Sit.
I can't wait for next week.

173
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:34,478
I hate dogs.

174
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,415
Charlie, we've been over
all this. You know I can't
come in. Alex is sick.

175
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,518
Billing just called.
He's on his way in
to review his portfolio.

176
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,287
Oh, god. You're kidding.
No.

177
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,455
How long is he in town?
He's leaving Friday.

178
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,157
You know we can't--

179
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,293
no, that's okay.
Mary Lou can handle it.
She can access--

180
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,229
Mary Lou is not who
he expects to see.
You're the point person.

181
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,398
No--
look. You gave me your word
you could handle this.

182
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,235
I know I promised you.
But my child wasn't sick
when I promised you. There's--

183
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,270
it's not my fault
you can't find
a babysitter.

184
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,907
Okay, fine. One hour.
I can come in for one hour.
That is it.

185
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,375
Fine.
If Alex beeps me, I'm gone.

186
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,045
You can fire me if you want to,
but I'm gone.
Karen--

187
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,048
and, Charlie, I just
want you to know that you're
putting me in the position...

188
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:15,152
Of having to choose between
making a house payment and
taking care of my sick child,

189
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,055
and I really
don't appreciate it.
Karen--

190
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,259
jerk.

191
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,194
Sh-- okay.

192
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,264
Did you tell Charlie
that I'm desperately ill?

193
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,900
Thank you, Alex.

194
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,935
Yes. Charlie knows
you're sick.

195
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,270
What about
the family leave act?

196
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:39,643
I just have to go in and
pick up some stuff and sign
some papers and show my face.

197
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,279
I'll be gone an hour
at the very most.

198
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,148
I called Mrs. hess
and told her you'd be alone,
and she--

199
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,650
you called Mrs. hess?
She knows I'm gonna be alone?

200
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:51,321
She said if anything comes up,
she'll be right over.
She wasn't happy about it, but--

201
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,359
she could get tanked up
on iced tea and come over
and make me smoke cigarettes.

202
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,162
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
What do I do
if there's a tornado?

203
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,299
They don't happen in winter.
Social unrest?

204
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,200
I don't think so.

205
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,270
Boredom?
I hear it's deadly
in old folks.

206
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,639
Good-bye, sweetie.

207
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,509
What about crooks?

208
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,680
I don't think
that's a problem
during the day, honey.

209
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,316
Why not?
Nobody's home during the day.

210
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,485
I'm only eight,
and I figured that out.

211
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,588
Don't you think a grown-up crook
could figure it out too?

212
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,557
This is a very
safe neighborhood.

213
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,060
There's only one road
in and out of here.

214
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,496
The doors will be locked.
You have all my numbers.

215
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,564
- I'll be home as soon as I can.
- But, mom!

216
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,401
What about dragons,
giant spiders, mummies,

217
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,071
the living dead
and other figments
of my imagination?

218
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,374
Alex, I can't help you there.

219
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,644
Only you can control
your imagination.

220
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:53,050
That's a scary thought.

221
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,411
Hmm.

222
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:40,690
That's weird.

223
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,832
Oh, my god!

224
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,109
Twenty seconds out.

225
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:04,181
Clear.

226
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,387
- 911 emergency.
- I saw a burglar.

227
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,658
- Are you by yourself?
- My mom just had to run out
for a few minutes.

228
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,694
- I have the chicken pox.
- Can I have your address,
please?

229
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,630
The guy isn't at my house.
He's at the Stephans'.

230
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:25,402
Their address is
3015 Washington street!

231
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:58,702
Nothing.

232
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,359
There's a burglar
in the Stephans' house!
What?

233
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:26,263
I saw him with my telescope.
There's a woman with a dog
and a gray Van...

234
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,931
And a man
in running clothes.

235
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,533
I didn't recognize anybody
but the dog.

236
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:32,636
He looked just like
Johnny Allen's dog.
So I called the police.

237
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,872
You called the police?

238
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:40,977
Take the back.

239
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,813
Yes, sir.

240
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:47,350
Cover me!

241
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:58,528
- Freeze!

242
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:17,514
The burglar alarm
was on and working.

243
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,282
There was no one in the house.

244
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,484
It doesn't appear that
anything's been taken.

245
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,486
I don't know what
your boy saw, but...

246
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:25,755
There wasn't a person
in that house.

247
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,293
I-I'm very sorry about this.
My son's been home
with the chicken pox,

248
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:33,029
and I just had to run to work
to pick up some papers.

249
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,666
I'm completely strapped.
I don't normally do this.

250
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:40,003
Son, false alarms
are no joking matter.

251
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,839
It wasn't a false alarm.
There was a guy in the house.

252
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,409
He had two lookouts
and a driver in a gray Van.

253
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:47,744
He's been running a fever.

254
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,581
You might want to remind him
that ours is serious business.

255
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,416
Oh. He knows.

256
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,352
We gave him a police set
for Christmas.

257
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,653
N-not this Christmas,
but last Christmas.

258
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:00,824
You know, one of those--
a badge and a hat and a whistle.
He took it very seriously.

259
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:03,360
He went around the house
arresting relatives
for various crimes.

260
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:09,899
Oh, you know, not real crimes.
Just sort of leaving the toilet
seat up and snoring and--

261
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,637
absolutely. I will.
Yes. Thank you.

262
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,505
Thank you.

263
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,015
You get in that bed,
young man.

264
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,951
Excuse me, but I saw a man
in Karen Stephans's bedroom.

265
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,420
A white male,
a little older than dad,

266
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,055
and he was wearing
butt-inspection gloves.

267
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:36,393
I have warned you about
that telescope. You look
through it long enough,

268
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,029
you're gonna start
seeing things, whether
or not they're there.

269
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:43,033
I guess you have to be 35
before anyone around here
listens to you.

270
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,934
Don't get smart with me, Alex.

271
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,037
Sick or not,
i am very angry with you.

272
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,672
You have caused
a lot of trouble today.

273
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:53,376
Dad and I have to replace a door
at the Stephans'. Do you think
we're happy about that?

274
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,512
I saw what I saw.

275
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,555
Peter beaupre,

276
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,958
Earl unger,
Burton jernigan...

277
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,494
And Alice ribbons.

278
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:13,730
They were ticketed
under known aliases...

279
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,498
But didn't board
the Hong Kong flight.

280
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,904
I believe they're
still in the U.S., but
beyond that... I don't know.

281
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,407
Ladies and gentlemen,

282
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,943
we've got to find that chip.

283
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:31,881
What went wrong
with the burglar alarm?

284
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,917
Nothing.
It wasn't the alarm.

285
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,952
Then who called the police?

286
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,421
Mr. jernigan,
care to speculate?

287
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,691
Cars came and went.
The mailman came by.

288
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,928
We could have a watcher
on any house in any street.

289
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,565
- It could be anybody.
- I don't think
it's just anybody.

290
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,434
I think it's someone
on our street.

291
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,838
Someone we are not tracking.

292
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,874
Someone we've missed.

293
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:08,485
Dad, cab's here.

294
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:12,622
Oh, shoot.
Your mom's not back yet.

295
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,923
Well, all right.

296
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:17,527
Your mom had to take
some documents to the bank.

297
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,596
She can't be gone
more than a few minutes.

298
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:22,899
Mrs. hess is home.
You'll be fine, okay?

299
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,001
My beeper number's
on speed dial on the telephone.

300
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,036
Second button.
Mom's on the first button.

301
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,639
Right. Yeah.
So, you're okay?

302
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,473
"Positutely."

303
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:34,644
All right.
Give me a kiss.
All right.

304
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,513
Dad.

305
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:40,817
Alex, this is a very safe
and secure neighborhood.

306
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,853
We have great police,
as you learned yesterday.

307
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:47,690
- Nothing bad is gonna
happen to you. Okay?
- Dad.

308
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:48,992
Yeah?
Got your tickets?

309
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:51,060
- Yep.
- Got your wallet?

310
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,129
Yeah. It's in my pocket.

311
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,732
Where's your pocket?

312
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:02,005
Yeah.

313
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,607
Thank you.
Bye, dad.

314
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:35,805
She's leaving.

315
00:29:56,928 --> 00:30:01,531
3025 is all clear.
Red sedan heading south.

316
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:05,068
Turning right. Hold.

317
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:38,635
Hi.
Hi.

318
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:41,104
You are just in time,
Mr. pruitt.

319
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:45,275
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait. Oh, no.

320
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,187
Yes.

321
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:11,634
- Abort. Abort.
- Evacuate the area.
I'm on my own.

322
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:38,595
Let's go!

323
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,765
Move! Move!

324
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,705
Cover it!

325
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:53,910
Cool.

326
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:58,581
Okay. Come on.

327
00:32:08,158 --> 00:32:09,993
Nothing.

328
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,629
Let's check upstairs.

329
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,902
So, uh,
where's the burglar?

330
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,304
There is no burglar.

331
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:25,241
Just a kid
home sick from school
makin' false alarms.

332
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,878
How embarrassing.

333
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,380
Mm-hmm.

334
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:38,121
Son, this is
the second time in two days
that you've called the police.

335
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:42,258
It's a very serious matter
when a person calls the police.

336
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,962
I saw a burglar yesterday,
and I saw a burglar today.

337
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,431
Alex, listen
to the chief.

338
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,366
There was no one
in that house.

339
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:54,270
What about Johnny Allen's dog?
I talked to Johnny last night.

340
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,040
His dog was kidnapped
on Monday morning.

341
00:32:57,042 --> 00:33:00,176
- Did he see it happen?
- Alex,

342
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,279
apologize to the chief
and go up to your room.

343
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:08,217
Excuse me
for being a good citizen.

344
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,719
Alex!

345
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,021
I-I'm very sorry.
This will not happen again.

346
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,124
Will it, honey?
Really, I promise you.

347
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,761
Well, we wouldn't want
to discourage him
from calling us, uh,

348
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:22,799
in the event that something
real ever does happen.

349
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,303
Loser.

350
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,805
- Shut up.
- Make me.

351
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,941
Now that you've pranked
the cops twice, it goes
on your permanent record.

352
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,411
For the rest of your life,
if you call for help,
it won't come.

353
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:39,082
Dad missed his plane.
He was late for a meeting
with his boss.

354
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,884
We have to fork over
much-needed family cash
to the Stephans...

355
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:46,089
And to an evil octogenarian
so they can have
their doors repaired.

356
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:48,191
And even worse--

357
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,926
the world laughs, Alex.

358
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:53,029
You've stained
the family name.

359
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,370
First the Stephans,

360
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,039
then Mrs. hess.

361
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,943
I agree, Doris.
The next stop
is the alcotts' house.

362
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:10,146
What kind of a burglar
goes into a house
and doesn't take anything?

363
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:14,350
Do you know what I think?
I think they're looking
for somethin' special.

364
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:19,822
And they're lookin' in
everybody's house 'cause
they don't know who has it.

365
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:24,260
The question is... what is it?

366
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:38,141
If nobody's gonna
do anything about this,

367
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:41,511
I'll just have to
do it myself.

368
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,531
I am so sorry.

369
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,200
- I'm clearly not awake.
- It's all right.

370
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,069
Have a nice day.

371
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,505
I'll try.
Mm-hmm.

372
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,594
Watch this, Doris.

373
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,091
Hmm?

374
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,534
Hmm.

375
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:19,035
Look, Doris.

376
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:24,573
Boo!

377
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:43,492
Oh. I forgot about
the stairs.

378
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:17,693
Hmm.

379
00:38:27,604 --> 00:38:30,606
Got him, Doris.
Got him.

380
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:35,111
Oh, yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

381
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,179
You are so busted.

382
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,749
- Ah!

383
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:45,755
I have it--
the toy car.

384
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:49,225
- It's videotaping me.
- Huh?

385
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,359
What?

386
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,262
Come back
on that last message.

387
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,202
Ow! Oh!

388
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,208
Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go!

389
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:11,313
Don't spin! Don't spin!

390
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:38,140
You there.
Huh?

391
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,443
Now, you was friendly to me.
I don't have to kill you.

392
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:43,279
- You got money doesn't belong to you.
- Now, you back off.

393
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:48,250
-This ain't
none of your business.
-All right. Drop the saddlebags.

394
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:06,368
Bring-bring!

395
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,572
Hello. This is Karen.

396
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,840
Hi. How's it goin'?

397
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:14,610
Uh-huh. Yeah,
I'm runnin' late
for the office again.

398
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,179
I-i think blue chips
are overvalued.

399
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,448
Technology stocks
would be good.

400
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,883
Technology stocks.

401
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,720
Listen, hon.
I'm in the shower.
Can I call you back?

402
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:46,242
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

403
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:48,177
See ya!

404
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,621
Oh!

405
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:04,627
The car's outside.
I got a woman in the house.
Get over here!

406
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:15,571
Come on! Get up!

407
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:33,522
Ow! Ooh!

408
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:54,677
Shoot!

409
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,680
Everybody's in a hurry.

410
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,848
It's a video camera.
Someone's onto us.

411
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,418
Do you think it really matters?
Chip's in the car.

412
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,621
We're at the airport
in 45 minutes.
Where's Alice?

413
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:09,358
What happened?

414
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,295
There is a woman in the house.
I'll go back in
and deal with her.

415
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,198
Get the chip.

416
00:42:22,372 --> 00:42:25,975
Hmm.

417
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:33,515
Yes!

418
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,951
I got it.

419
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:47,830
Ma'am, may I have
a word with you?

420
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:50,733
Don't come in.
I'm naked.

421
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:54,737
What's on your mind,
monkey butt?

422
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,609
Come on. Come on.

423
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:07,449
What's that funky smell?

424
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:13,522
- I lost it!
- What?

425
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:20,663
Come on.
Go, go, go!

426
00:43:25,935 --> 00:43:29,605
- It's going out of range!
- I got it.

427
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:57,366
I see it.

428
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,773
Look out.

429
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:17,720
Jernigan, which direction?

430
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:21,824
It got past me.
It's heading south on Adams.

431
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:24,059
But I'm right behind
the little--

432
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:36,138
it's off the street,
going through backyards,
heading west.

433
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,441
Alice, what's your position?

434
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,080
Fourth house,
moving to the alley.

435
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:01,730
I see it!
It's going through the hedge.

436
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:05,501
- Jernigan, position?
- You're there.

437
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:08,737
- I got it!
- I got it!

438
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,717
Unger, what's your position?

439
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,686
Heading to Washington street.

440
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,688
I didn't copy. Where?

441
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,992
I said I'm heading to wa--

442
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:36,498
stop, you nitwit!

443
00:46:09,532 --> 00:46:11,633
I don't see anything.

444
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,047
I'll look around.

445
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:54,743
I don't have it yet.

446
00:46:54,745 --> 00:47:00,048
We're out of time.
Give it up.

447
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:35,250
They got the tape.
Why'd they still
chase the toy car?

448
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,919
It's not that expensive.

449
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:40,155
I'm sure they don't have
enough time to play with it.

450
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:46,995
Whoa.

451
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,134
Whoa.

452
00:48:05,214 --> 00:48:06,882
Hmm.

453
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,218
Look, Doris.

454
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:16,625
Computer chip, huh?
Where'd you find it?

455
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:21,196
I found it in a remote control
car that I got for shoveling
snow for Mrs. hess.

456
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:24,933
She lives across
the street from us.
It says U.S. air force on it,

457
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:28,203
but you have to look
under a magnifying glass
in order to see it.

458
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:32,674
Kid, a lot of toys
have "air force"
written on it.

459
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,811
This is a recruiting office,
son. We don't handle
matters like this.

460
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:40,949
Can I give you the number
on the chip and you can
call the right guys?

461
00:48:45,254 --> 00:48:48,824
Do you think we should
tell mom about the chip?

462
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:53,161
Yeah, I guess you're right.
The less they know the better.

463
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,797
Those guys are bad news.

464
00:49:01,437 --> 00:49:06,108
I can't tell you how much
i appreciate you hitting me
with the minivan.

465
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,710
Never let your emotions
get the best of you.

466
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,947
You weren't paying attention.
You should have been
more vigilant.

467
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,382
You should have taken
driver's ed.

468
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:16,218
It's a kid.
It has to be a kid.

469
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:21,757
I'm gonna have bad knees
when I'm old, and I'll have
Burton jernigan to thank.

470
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:24,393
The cops come twice.
They don't believe the kid.

471
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:28,263
He takes matters
into his own hands.
It can't be anything else.

472
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:31,366
If that's the case,
i say take no chances.

473
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:35,737
Tomorrow, whack every kid
in the neighborhood.
Burn 'em all.

474
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,472
Then look for that stupid car.

475
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:41,243
My thoughts keep
turning to number 3026.

476
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:44,112
It's within the operating
radius of the toy car.

477
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,849
It's on the sight lines
of all the houses
I've been in.

478
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,333
Hello?
Do you have
the missile chip?

479
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:10,939
- We are close.
- If I don't have the chip
in 24 hours, Mr. beaupre,

480
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,975
I will have no choice
but to terminate
the mission...

481
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,712
And nullify
all the participants.

482
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:19,281
You understand,
don't you?

483
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:24,319
Guys, dad's home tomorrow night.
Now, I have my quarterly client
meeting from noon till 5:00,

484
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:27,122
so I need you and Molly to come
straight home after school...

485
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,825
To stay with Alex
until dad gets home.
I can't.

486
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,760
No way. Impossible.
I have gymnastics.

487
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,528
- I have hockey.
- Do I need to repeat myself?

488
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,165
Well, I thought
you were putting the bite
on Mrs. hess to watch Alex.

489
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,470
- Yeah. She's a lot more
responsible than me and Stan.
- Mrs. hess is a backup.

490
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:45,807
Unless there's an emergency,
i really don't want to
have to call her.

491
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,142
I'll be fine by myself.

492
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,478
Well, there you have it.
It's settled.

493
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,447
Alex, could you pass me
the false alarms?

494
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,383
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I meant the peas.

495
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,019
- Ho, ho.
- Hello?

496
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,856
Oh, hi. Uh-huh.

497
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:04,493
Yeah. He's been home
with the chicken pox. Oh.

498
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:08,063
- Alex, do you know
a Bradley clovis?
- Yeah.

499
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:12,234
This is his mother on the phone.
Did you take a toy car from him?

500
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,070
No, he has one of those...

501
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:20,876
Remote control cars,
but he got it from
the woman across the street.

502
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:22,444
We have it.

503
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:27,082
Alex, what is the matter
with you? You don't
disconnect one of my calls.

504
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,484
Don't talk to
Mrs. clovis, please.
Why not?

505
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,587
She's dangerous.
Dangerous? Honey,
what are you talking about?

506
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,556
It was lies.
They're all lies.

507
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:38,493
It wasn't her.
Honey, what do you mean
it wasn't her?

508
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:48,537
Call her back.
I think you'll be surprised.

509
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,580
Outgoing call.

510
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,052
Rerouted.

511
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:07,422
Hello. Clovises.

512
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,558
Hi. I beg your pardon.
We just--

513
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,128
oh, I'm sorry.
Did I disconnect you,
Karen?

514
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,132
No, no. It was me.
We're-- we're renovating.
The phone lines are a mess.

515
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:21,036
They intercepted the phone call.

516
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:24,272
Listen. I didn't mean
to accuse your son.

517
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:27,442
I'm certain Bradley
just misplaced his toy car.

518
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:31,613
Isn't that the way they are?
They lose something, they assume it's been stolen.

519
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:37,586
Little boys do have
wild imaginations,
don't they?

520
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:41,223
Yes, they do.

521
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,032
They're gonna come
after me tomorrow, Doris.

522
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,601
Nobody will listen.

523
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:56,671
Not my parents
or Molly or Stan...

524
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,608
Or the police
or the air force.

525
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,277
Nobody. So, what do I do?

526
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:07,215
If that means hide,
you're wrong.

527
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:13,021
If that means fight,
you're right.

528
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,925
They'll understand
when I'm done.

529
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,194
They'll know
i was tellin' the truth.

530
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,463
I'm not gonna cry
or feel sad or scared.

531
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:23,365
They're grown-ups,
and they're criminals,

532
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,068
but this is my neighborhood,
and this is my house.

533
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:31,072
And no matter how old they are,
no matter how big they are,

534
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,974
they can't beat me here.

535
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,343
They can't beat me at home.

536
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:11,546
Oh.

537
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,615
Ooh, wanna buy
a little silence?

538
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:16,117
Double or nothin'.

539
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,534
We're watching
a major snowstorm...

540
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:07,802
That's bearing down
on the chicagoland area.

541
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,473
As you take a look at the latest
radar, you can see the snow's
increasing in intensity.

542
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:18,747
Heavy snow is in the forecast,
and residents are urged
to stay indoors if possible.

543
00:55:43,105 --> 00:55:47,475
Approaching target.
All clear.

544
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:56,551
Here we go, Doris.

545
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,328
Whoa! No! Stop!

546
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:12,700
First we free the hostages.

547
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:16,104
Switching on the fiber optics.

548
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,124
Alex, can you
get the door, please?

549
00:56:37,593 --> 00:56:42,730
No answer.

550
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:53,808
Are we certain
target has not left?

551
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:58,346
- Negative.
- We would have seen that.

552
00:57:07,389 --> 00:57:11,326
I repeat: There is
no movement inside.

553
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:14,596
- Permission to enter.

554
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,599
Huh?

555
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,335
No!

556
00:57:22,371 --> 00:57:26,608
Whoa!

557
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,749
- Alice?

558
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:41,756
Hey! Go home. Go home!

559
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,595
All right.

560
00:57:56,472 --> 00:57:59,941
I need assistance.
I'm exposed.

561
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,210
Maintain your position.

562
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:07,949
Do not-- I repeat:
Do not draw attention
to yourself.

563
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:13,821
Pick her up. We'll move in
after the storm hits.

564
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,225
We'll let mother nature
cover our tracks.

565
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,827
Sir, this just came in
from the air force.

566
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:23,731
Some kid named pruitt
called a recruiting
office in Chicago.

567
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:27,569
Said he found
a computer chip
in a toy car.

568
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,638
We're going to Chicago.

569
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,311
Did you watch
the weather for me?

570
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:38,713
Yep. No problems.
Your coat's over there.

571
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:40,848
Oh, thanks. I want
to wear my brown one.
Wait!

572
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,319
Why don't you go
fill your commuter cup
with yummy hot coffee,

573
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,688
and I'll get
your coat for you?

574
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,356
Thanks, hon.

575
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:51,659
I'll make you a sandwich.

576
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:09,510
Here's your coat.
Thanks.

577
00:59:09,878 --> 00:59:11,779
Oh, sweetheart, I am
so sorry about this week.

578
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:16,584
It breaks my heart to have
to come and go like this.
It shouldn't be this way.

579
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:20,655
It's okay.
It's not you.
It's the times.

580
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,957
Thanks, hon.

581
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,493
You have your beeper?
Yep.

582
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:27,395
Great.

583
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,630
I'll call
every half hour.

584
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:31,799
I'll go on line with you
and keep the connection
open all day.

585
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:35,436
I'll have my laptop with me
at all my meetings.

586
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,305
We'll be in contact
at all times.

587
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,742
Plus, I have my cellular,
and you've got
my fax number.

588
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,044
We're wired.
Mmm.

589
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:46,381
Oh, my gosh.
Did Mrs. clovis call?
Mmm.

590
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:47,882
She was gonna stop by
before I left...

591
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,785
To confirm that
Bradley's name wasn't
on the remote control car.

592
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,488
She stopped by when you
were in the shower.

593
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:56,391
- Did you let her have it?
- Big time.

594
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:59,794
- I hope she felt foolish.
- It was painful.

595
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,963
Okay. Be good.

596
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:05,366
Be safe. Keep an eye
on the old place.

597
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,635
I got it all covered.

598
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,771
Mmm!

599
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:57,418
Here we go, Doris.
It's just you and me.

600
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,821
You mean
there's someone else?

601
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:04,492
Get ready to rumble!
Play ball!

602
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:11,592
- Come on.
- It's showtime!

603
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:15,663
If those are real, I'm an eagle.

604
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,834
Hello.
Hi, Mrs. hess.
It's Karen pruitt.

605
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:57,271
Could you possibly
look in on Alex for me?
I'm just going out.

606
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,007
Oh, I'm at work.
I'm really in a bind.

607
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:02,677
Oh. Well? How long?

608
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:05,980
Well, i-it wouldn't be for
more than an hour or so.

609
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,649
All right.
No cooking.

610
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,995
"Call Mrs. hess.

611
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:25,299
Well, she's retired.
What else could she
possibly be doing?"

612
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,234
Babysitter.

613
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:30,972
Do they invite me into their
house for a holiday eggnog?
Well, of course not!

614
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,708
Look who woke up
from her nap.

615
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:43,584
Crooks at 30 yards
and closing.

616
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,620
Let the party begin.

617
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:50,324
Good afternoon.
My husband and I have just
moved into your neighborhood.

618
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,192
What do you want,
a wilkie button?

619
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:56,030
A package was to be delivered,
but the driver got confused.
Perhaps he brought it here.

620
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:57,732
Nope. They didn't
bring anything here.

621
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:01,302
The delivery company
said that no one
answered the door...

622
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:05,840
And the driver left it
in the garage.

623
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:23,758
Sometimes they leave stuff
at the backdoor.

624
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,093
Why are you
closing the door?

625
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:29,063
I left my heart
in San Francisco.

626
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:38,039
Looks like the little rug rat
has the place
locked up pretty tight.

627
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:03,097
Jernigan, I think
I'm gonna enjoy this.

628
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,734
It's been a long time
since I was a kid.

629
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,337
You forget how incredibly
stupid they are.

630
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:14,842
Now, you be careful.
Sometimes when kids get scared,
they wet their pants.

631
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:30,858
Oh!

632
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,230
Yeow!

633
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:47,775
Eee! Yaah!

634
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:54,782
- Mr. unger.

635
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,718
Oh! Oh!

636
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:01,355
Oh!

637
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:05,626
I'm all right.

638
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:40,695
Mr. unger,
what are you doing?

639
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:44,899
Don't touch the yarn.
It's wired.

640
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:48,869
The kid's got the place
booby-trapped.

641
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,072
Make no assumptions.

642
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:54,308
- Watch the welcome mat.
- This boy is clever.

643
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,311
- Have you tried the door?
- Uh, not yet.

644
01:06:57,313 --> 01:07:00,681
Let me point something
out to you.

645
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:06,153
Missed that.

646
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:08,756
Stand clear.

647
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,598
Maybe he's not
so clever after all.

648
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,335
Yeah, i-i just think
we're having an off day.

649
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:42,823
A thought for you
to consider:

650
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:46,827
At airport security,

651
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:50,231
make sure you have
the right package.

652
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,843
I certainly hope
that you're not fond...

653
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,346
Of that little boy
across the street.

654
01:08:12,921 --> 01:08:14,355
I'll leave this open.

655
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:19,360
Fresh air will be
good for you.

656
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:29,136
Ow. Oh. Oh!

657
01:08:29,437 --> 01:08:33,574
You think you're smart,
you little brat.

658
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:38,112
Unger, what's your status?

659
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:46,320
Unger! Unger?

660
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,526
Whoo! Hwah!

661
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:29,029
Heads up.

662
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:31,932
How did that happen?
I don't know.

663
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,341
Ouch.

664
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,617
You got hit with a book?

665
01:09:50,518 --> 01:09:54,388
Books. Plural.
A trunk full of books.

666
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:58,058
Then a set of weights.
We got hit twice,
you dumb broad.

667
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:02,129
Excuse me, Mr. unger.
I didn't get taken down
by an infant.

668
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:05,532
We didn't anticipate the defense
the boy would mount.

669
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:07,668
I'll go in the front.

670
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:13,007
Mr. unger,
you take the north side.
Alice, you take the south side.

671
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:15,109
Where is Mr. jernigan?

672
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,515
Oh.

673
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,198
Attention, travelers.

674
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:42,536
All flights to Chicago
continue to be delayed
due to severe weather.

675
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,472
Please stand by
for further details.

676
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:01,655
Oh! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

677
01:11:25,313 --> 01:11:28,015
- Hi.

678
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:55,776
You can run, but you
can't hide, junior.

679
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,678
- Surprise.

680
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,522
What a loser.

681
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:37,418
Ah! Huh.

682
01:12:43,491 --> 01:12:47,194
Ugh. Eww.

683
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:18,325
I got him!

684
01:13:27,368 --> 01:13:30,571
Huh!

685
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:46,453
Whoa!

686
01:14:00,802 --> 01:14:05,472
Huh?

687
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,647
Ohh!

688
01:14:37,238 --> 01:14:39,907
You are dead, kid.

689
01:14:40,575 --> 01:14:44,178
Ugh!

690
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:51,685
Whoa.

691
01:15:32,994 --> 01:15:35,796
Now things
are lookin' up!

692
01:15:36,297 --> 01:15:39,266
Gotcha!

693
01:15:40,401 --> 01:15:42,436
- Whoa!
- See ya.

694
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,881
Ugh. Yuck.

695
01:15:56,317 --> 01:15:58,685
Steady. Yeah.

696
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:08,895
Well, well, well.

697
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:18,739
Nice try, kid.

698
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:22,876
Oh! Oh.

699
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:58,011
Ooh! Whee-yah!

700
01:17:04,085 --> 01:17:06,620
Hmm.

701
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:22,502
Alice?

702
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:38,685
I'm coming down!

703
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,687
Aah!

704
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,462
Aah!

705
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:11,017
Mr. jernigan,
Mr. unger!

706
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:16,556
- Welcome.
- You got a haircut?

707
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:28,769
Are you almost
done in there?

708
01:18:28,771 --> 01:18:31,905
Don't start with me.

709
01:18:33,841 --> 01:18:35,809
I'll wait.

710
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,928
Let's move.

711
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,264
Ugh. What stinks?

712
01:18:57,266 --> 01:18:59,733
Shut up.

713
01:19:00,134 --> 01:19:02,636
Hello?

714
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:05,305
Honey, you're all out of breath.
Is something wrong?

715
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:10,944
- No, no! Everything's fine.
- I'm so worried.
The weather is terrible.

716
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:19,519
- I'm gonna come home right now.
- No, no. Take your time.

717
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:20,954
Really.
Don't come home, mom.

718
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:25,091
- Um, why don't you pick up
Stan and Molly from school?
- Are you sure?

719
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,595
Yeah. I'm playing Chinese
checkers with Mrs. hess.

720
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,898
- You're not smoking, are you?
- No. I gotta go.

721
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,568
Mrs. hess gets nutty
when you make her wait.

722
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:37,771
- Okay. Play fair.
- Always.

723
01:19:38,473 --> 01:19:41,107
What a brave little fellow.

724
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:51,918
Mr. jernigan.
Living room clear.

725
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,054
Good.

726
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:58,458
Mmm. Nothing
in the kitchen.

727
01:20:01,095 --> 01:20:02,796
Let's organize.

728
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:08,235
Mr. unger, go to the left.
Mr. jernigan, follow me,
slowly.

729
01:20:08,237 --> 01:20:11,004
Go, Doris.

730
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,713
Ah.

731
01:20:19,715 --> 01:20:22,215
Mr. unger, go left.

732
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:25,619
Cover him.
I'll cover the stairs.

733
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:30,123
I'm comin' for you, shorty.

734
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:34,828
Comin' to pay you back
for all the misery
you caused me.

735
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,964
- Mr. unger, what are you doing?
- Kid's in the closet.

736
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:42,569
Scarin' him a little
just before I grab him.

737
01:20:46,073 --> 01:20:49,776
And behind
door number one--

738
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:53,914
towels.

739
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:57,217
- Hmph.
- I saw this door close.

740
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,018
Idiot.

741
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:04,124
Would I make it up?
Why? What's the point?
We working on commission here?

742
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:15,902
Phew.

743
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:30,216
Right.
Follow the sergeant.
We'll go left.

744
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:33,954
Clear the halls.

745
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,190
What's up, fellas?

746
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:44,230
- What's going on?
- You're Mrs. pruitt
from Washington street?

747
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:46,800
Yes.
Agent stuckey,
f.B.I.

748
01:21:46,802 --> 01:21:48,034
I came to talk
to your son.

749
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:52,806
You called the air force
about a computer chip
in a remote control car?

750
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:55,675
- No.
- Oh, god. It's Alex.

751
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:59,012
It's-it's my-my other son.
Why? What's happened?

752
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:02,182
He may be in danger.

753
01:22:02,283 --> 01:22:06,286
- He's not here. He's at home.
- Well, let's move.

754
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,855
Why is he in danger?

755
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:12,192
She asked you
a question, sir.

756
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:16,830
I'm not at Liberty
to discuss it, son.

757
01:22:17,298 --> 01:22:22,335
The "it"
you're referring to
is my little brother.

758
01:22:29,276 --> 01:22:32,178
We think he intercepted
a top secret electronic
device...

759
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,980
Stolen from a defense
department contractor...

760
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:40,086
By a group of international
criminals working for a north
Korean terrorist organization.

761
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:55,368
Mr. jernigan, cover me.

762
01:23:24,231 --> 01:23:28,735
Go, Doris, go.

763
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,169
Sorry, Charlie.

764
01:24:03,871 --> 01:24:06,339
This just ain't your day.

765
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:12,946
Ah!

766
01:24:14,281 --> 01:24:18,351
- Shut up.

767
01:24:21,857 --> 01:24:24,124
What?
Don't move.

768
01:24:25,092 --> 01:24:28,928
- Alice?
- Don't... move.

769
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,064
Alice?

770
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:35,468
- What? Alice?
- Shh, shh, shh.

771
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:38,171
- Alice?

772
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:45,812
- Excellent.
- Run, shorty, run!

773
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:48,815
- Come on, Doris!
- The kid!

774
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:51,017
Doris, come on!

775
01:24:51,485 --> 01:24:53,520
I got you now,
you little rat!

776
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:56,022
I got him!
I got him!

777
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,358
Whoa!

778
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:12,539
You... smacked my winkie.

779
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:15,275
Well, if you changed
your shorts once in a while,

780
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:18,444
maybe you wouldn't have
rats in your pants!

781
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:24,384
All right,
you little rug rat!

782
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:43,169
Where is he?

783
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,405
Stay here, Doris.

784
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:52,312
Yikes.

785
01:25:55,382 --> 01:25:57,917
Come on!

786
01:26:06,026 --> 01:26:08,161
Fire!

787
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:13,867
He's been watching us
the whole time.

788
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:16,469
He had a camera on us.

789
01:26:18,072 --> 01:26:23,142
You're not gonna find me
up there, you big, dumb,
lawbreaking knuckleheads!

790
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,445
He's outside!

791
01:26:31,151 --> 01:26:34,587
Recognize this?

792
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,790
How did he get outside?

793
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:40,660
- The same way you're gonna get outside.
- How?

794
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:42,462
Jump! Go!
Aah! Don't push!

795
01:26:42,464 --> 01:26:45,965
It's a trampoline.
You're jumping onto
a trampoline.

796
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,634
I presume then that you
won't be joining us?

797
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:51,204
No. I'll be covering you
from here. Go!
How comforting!

798
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:55,341
Come on. He's gettin' away!

799
01:26:55,509 --> 01:26:59,646
Yeah, this is a snap.
This is a snap.

800
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:02,081
Go!

801
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:05,518
Whoa!
No!

802
01:27:13,427 --> 01:27:16,129
Huh?

803
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:18,431
Whoa! Waah!

804
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:22,735
Oh, god!
Cold. Very cold.

805
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:28,508
Aah!

806
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,377
Aah!

807
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:33,513
Aah!

808
01:27:36,383 --> 01:27:38,384
Fire!

809
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:46,125
Of course.

810
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:55,568
Here I come,
you little brat.

811
01:28:00,307 --> 01:28:04,010
Ouch.

812
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:12,118
Mrs. hess!

813
01:28:17,591 --> 01:28:19,993
Mrs. hess.

814
01:28:21,228 --> 01:28:24,497
Hmm.
Mrs. hess?

815
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:26,632
Hmm?

816
01:28:29,136 --> 01:28:32,572
You're okay.
I'm here now.

817
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:03,803
Well.

818
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:06,339
It's Alex, isn't it?

819
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:10,543
Today you
learned something:

820
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:13,513
There is a price to be paid
for being a good citizen.

821
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:19,385
In your zeal to aid
your neighbor, you finally
slipped into one of my traps.

822
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:38,638
Can Mrs. hess go inside?
She's very old
and very cold.

823
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:44,811
Please?

824
01:29:51,351 --> 01:29:56,422
Give me the chip!
It doesn't belong to you.
It's not yours.

825
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:03,262
The chip, son.
Give me the chip.

826
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:06,632
That doesn't belong
to you either.

827
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:10,570
What?
That's not your gun.

828
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:18,211
This is your gun.

829
01:30:25,687 --> 01:30:27,854
Gotcha.

830
01:30:30,657 --> 01:30:34,293
Here.
Sit down, Mrs. hess.

831
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,562
Thank you, Alex.

832
01:30:37,798 --> 01:30:40,733
These are times
that call for soup.
Any favorites?

833
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:44,937
No. Thank you.
I'm-- I'm fine, honey.

834
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:49,775
You know, Mrs. hess,
it's really cold outside.

835
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:53,212
You're a pretty tough
old bird.

836
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:57,750
And you're a very
sweet young man.

837
01:30:57,752 --> 01:31:00,386
I just never took
the time to notice.

838
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:03,589
You're not alone in that.

839
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:49,435
- Over here. Hey!
- Wow.

840
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:50,703
Move it!

841
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:54,840
That's it!
Johnson, Williams,
go around back.

842
01:31:56,778 --> 01:31:59,779
Let's go around the back!

843
01:32:00,747 --> 01:32:02,915
Freeze!

844
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:06,919
You gotta be kidding.

845
01:32:07,754 --> 01:32:11,023
- That's it!
- Let's cordon off the other
end of the block!

846
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,260
- Come on!
Move it! Move it!
- Alex.

847
01:32:14,828 --> 01:32:17,697
Check over there!

848
01:32:18,932 --> 01:32:21,267
Mom!

849
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:25,471
Oh!

850
01:32:34,848 --> 01:32:38,417
Oh!

851
01:32:40,887 --> 01:32:44,490
Mom. You're
hugging and kissing me
in front of the cops.

852
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:48,427
Oh, Alex.
I'm so sorry.

853
01:32:48,662 --> 01:32:51,731
I'm so sorry
i didn't listen to you.

854
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:55,334
This is very cool.

855
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:57,737
Bud, you're a hero.

856
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:00,606
- Are you Alex?
- Yeah.

857
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:02,742
Agent stuckey,
f.B.I.

858
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,877
Here's the chip.

859
01:33:05,812 --> 01:33:08,414
There's a senior citizen
across the street...

860
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,684
That's gonna need some soup and
a doctor to look at her feet.

861
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:15,021
There's two guys in our pool
and a woman in our basement.

862
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:17,990
The other one's gone.

863
01:33:22,562 --> 01:33:24,730
This him?

864
01:33:25,899 --> 01:33:28,334
Yup.

865
01:33:28,769 --> 01:33:32,505
Seven years I've been
after this guy.

866
01:33:32,507 --> 01:33:35,274
He always manages
to slip away.

867
01:33:37,744 --> 01:33:39,912
Thanks.

868
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:47,086
- It's just the three, sir.
- Where's your boss?

869
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:51,924
Get 'em out of here!
Yes, sir. Let's go, popsicle.

870
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:54,393
Come on.

871
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:06,339
Ha, ha, ha!

872
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:08,674
Lucy, I'm home!

873
01:34:08,975 --> 01:34:12,745
- What's on your mind,
monkey butt?

874
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:28,961
Houston,
we have a problem.

875
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:33,733
Counting down
in five, four, three,

876
01:34:33,735 --> 01:34:35,634
two--

877
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:38,671
- take it.
- Double or nothin'.

878
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:41,540
I only have one.

879
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:46,011
We have ignition.

880
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:51,717
- It's showtime!

881
01:34:54,822 --> 01:34:56,622
Hey!

882
01:35:05,165 --> 01:35:07,967
Now, I'll be there
in just a minute.
Okay. Bye.

883
01:35:07,969 --> 01:35:11,203
Driver,
it's the big old tudor place
with the Christmas lights...

884
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,606
And the driveway
that hasn't been shoveled.

885
01:35:13,608 --> 01:35:16,142
- Eh?
- That one right there.

886
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:18,010
Oh.

887
01:35:20,847 --> 01:35:23,349
- Um--
get that whole thing?

888
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:26,152
Yeah.

889
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:28,487
Have you ever had
the chicken pox?

890
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:33,492
I had the chicken pox
when Herbert hoover was
in the white house.

891
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:38,597
Hello.
Hey there, stranger.

892
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:41,066
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetie.

893
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:43,636
Hey, buddy! Come here.

894
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:48,507
Let me see.

895
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:51,877
Ah, you don't look
any worse for the wear.
They couldn't touch me.

896
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:56,148
The computer company
that got their chip boosted
is giving Alex a reward.

897
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:59,018
It's a six-figure sum,
which is extremely cool.

898
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:02,655
So, did you
bring me anything?

899
01:36:02,657 --> 01:36:05,891
As a matter of fact,
i did.

900
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:08,093
Come here.

901
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,730
Think you can drive that?

902
01:36:11,732 --> 01:36:14,066
I think we
can handle it.

903
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:17,136
Gentlemen,
start your engines!

904
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:19,505
360, 360!

905
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:25,711
Rat overboard!

906
01:36:25,713 --> 01:36:27,179
Say cheese.
