1
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,027
<i>Every man carries a badge.</i>

2
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,501
<i>Some symbol of his allegiance.</i>

3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,200
<i>His were the scars of a boxer who'd used
his fists to climb the social ladder of the mob.</i>

4
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:52,141
<i>A Jew who'd gained the respect of wops
through a homicidal lust.</i>

5
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,420
<i>He'd sworn an oath of violence.</i>

6
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,214
<i>And his master?</i>

7
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,121
<i>His own insatiable will to power.</i>

8
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,219
<i>He wanted to own this town.</i>

9
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,663
<i>His name is Mickey Cohen.</i>

10
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,504
<i>On my badge is the
city of Los Angeles.</i>

11
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,773
<i>I came back from the war
and I didn 't even recognize it.</i>

12
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,050
<i>Brothels, vice,
blood in the streets.</i>

13
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,451
<i>Cohen is building his empire.</i>

14
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,557
"The children of the night.

15
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,690
What music they make."

16
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,532
It's the damnedest thing, Russo.

17
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,361
I come up here so many times...

18
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,567
...they see me,
they know they're getting a treat.

19
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:47,230
What's the matter with you? You think they're
not gonna hear about this in Chicago?

20
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:48,706
Oh, I'll make sure they do.

21
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,139
You're certifiable, Mickey.

22
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:54,077
You belong in a booby hatch,
eating pudding in your goddamn pajamas.

23
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,541
A minute ago,
you were begging.

24
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:58,583
That's when I thought you were a man.

25
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:01,187
But you're something else.
You're rotten.

26
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:06,893
Aah!

27
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,892
What about now, Tommy?

28
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:10,890
You impressed?

29
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,330
Argh! You prick bastard.

30
00:02:13,502 --> 00:02:15,993
-Okay, boys.
-You sick son of a bitch.

31
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:17,194
Let her rip!

32
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,736
Aah!

33
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,101
Oh, my. Heh, heh.

34
00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:27,341
Now, you go back to Chicago...

35
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:30,349
...you tell them what
you saw here tonight.

36
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:35,954
You tell them that Los Angeles
belongs to Mickey Cohen.

37
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:43,689
Fighting the war had taught me...

38
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:49,271
...the only thing necessary for the triumph
of evil is for good men to do nothing.

39
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:52,871
People are scared.
They say leave it alone.

40
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:54,533
Excuse me, miss?

41
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:57,338
Anyone ever tell you you look like
Lauren Bacall?

42
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,503
No.

43
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:01,014
But Cohen isn't
the only fighter.

44
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:03,152
And I'm ready to
step in the ring.

45
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,619
Son of a bitch didn't waste any time,
did he?

46
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,951
Today's your lucky day.
We're holding auditions.

47
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,184
-Really?
-Let's go.

48
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:17,060
-This is it.
-Ooh, wow.

49
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,223
This is wonderful.

50
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,961
Thank you. I can't wait to let
my folks know about this.

51
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,798
They're gonna be
real proud of you.

52
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,339
You know, this is where
Bacall first met Bogart.

53
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:27,574
What the hell are you doing?

54
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:30,576
What's it look like? He's gonna
give her a bad time in there.

55
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:34,182
O'Mara, for chrissakes, that's Cohen's
place. Nobody goes in there.

56
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:36,149
I don't want any part of this.

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,719
Go get an ice cream.

58
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:46,419
Right this way.

59
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:51,368
You know, we hold all our screen tests
up here, kiddo.

60
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,900
Away from the crowds.

61
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:55,363
Come on.

62
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:01,340
-Help you with something, pal?
-Looking to meet someone.

63
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:03,343
Yeah? What's her name?

64
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,518
I don't know, I thought maybe you
could help me out with that.

65
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:12,880
-No, mister. It's okay, really.
-Get in the goddamn room.

66
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:14,753
-Look at what Daddy found.
-Nice.

67
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,056
I tell you I was partial to blonds?

68
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:22,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, big guy.
Pistola, butt-first.

69
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:25,566
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a cop?

70
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:28,035
Christ, buddy. What are you,
soft in the head?

71
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:39,240
Please! Let me go! Please! Aah!

72
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:50,821
Aah!

73
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:52,794
-Break her, boys.
-Let me go!

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,928
No! No! Stop it, please! Don't!
Please! Please!

75
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:00,468
-Help!
-Shh. Shh.

76
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:03,671
You make another sound
and you're dead.

77
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:12,976
Who is it?

78
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,114
Mitts in the air!

79
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:17,954
Come on!

80
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,823
I don't think so.

81
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:23,430
-Ten bucks says this guy ain't
even heeled. -I'll take that bet.

82
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:26,395
Why don't you come over here
and find out. Come on.

83
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:30,193
Bang.

84
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:42,346
Help! Somebody!

85
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,426
Please help me!

86
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,330
Welcome to Los Angeles, ma'am.

87
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,474
Patty, it was the strangest thing.

88
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:16,743
I arrested Whalen, next thing you know,
lickety-split, he escapes.

89
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,078
Oh, really? He overpowered you again?

90
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,054
-No.
-He just slipped his cuffs?

91
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,852
He sure did.
It was the damnedest thing.

92
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,549
Keep moving.

93
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,096
What happened to you this time?

94
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,254
He resisted.

95
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:33,161
Oh, yeah?
What happened to them?

96
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:34,665
They resisted.

97
00:06:35,336 --> 00:06:36,598
You're working too hard.

98
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,666
Boys.

99
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,402
O'Mara! Get your
Irish ass in here!

100
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:51,782
Weren't you told to stay away
from Cohen's turf?

101
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:53,045
I was.

102
00:06:53,222 --> 00:06:55,884
Hendricks told me you walked in there
without a warrant.

103
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:58,117
-These three are gonna walk.
-Says who?

104
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:00,853
Says Judge Carter.

105
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,564
Habeas corpus.
Well, that's fast work.

106
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:09,796
I didn't know any better, I'd think
someone here stiffed in a call.

107
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:13,133
Listen to me, we got rules
around here, smartass.

108
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:16,037
Do yourself a favor: Learn them.

109
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,906
Is that how you got that new Packard
out there in the parking lot?

110
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,710
Following the rules, boss?

111
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:24,649
Two things you can't take back
on this job, kid:

112
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:28,023
Bullets out of your gun
and words out of your mouth.

113
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,081
That it?

114
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,016
Get out.

115
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:45,598
Karl Lockwood.

116
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:47,739
That's Mickey's bodyguard.

117
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:51,145
I'm sure I'm not the first person
to tell you this...

118
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,543
...but don't feed or
tease the animals.

119
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:57,311
Doesn't it bother you?

120
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,314
No.

121
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:05,623
Not for a long time.

122
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,963
Okay, stay out of trouble.

123
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,472
Connie, look--

124
00:08:23,648 --> 00:08:26,674
-Baby, you promised me.
-I know.

125
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:30,014
You stood right where you're standing
now and you promised me.

126
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:31,450
I know.

127
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,659
I didn't go looking for it.
Scout's honor.

128
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:46,396
John, you go looking for it every time
you leave the house.

129
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:54,872
What happened this time?

130
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,711
Oh, it was just some pimp.

131
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:04,619
He was gonna put the hurt on this poor
girl who didn't know any better.

132
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:06,854
She looked a little like you.

133
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:09,621
I mean, not nearly as pretty, but--

134
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,631
Smooth talk isn't your line, sarge.

135
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:19,936
Look, I don't mind living like
Ma and Pa Kettle.

136
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,107
I don't need a new pair
of shoes every week.

137
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,038
I married an honest cop.

138
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:29,204
You're kind, you don't talk too much,
you're a demon in the sack.

139
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,678
But I don't need a hero, sarge,
I need a husband.

140
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:37,551
So you do not have permission
to go belly-flop on a grenade.

141
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:39,954
Not when we're expecting company.
Do you read me?

142
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:42,922
Yeah.

143
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:57,871
Whores don't grow on trees.

144
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:00,809
They're like mustangs.
You gotta catch them wild...

145
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:03,882
...and break them before you
train them to do tricks.

146
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:09,913
Means I need a quiet place where
I can keep the girls locked up.

147
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,957
Keep them hopped up
on Mexican dope.

148
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,557
Watch your jacket,
it's filthy here.

149
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:18,823
But this cop comes out of nowhere
like an early frost.

150
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:26,470
And now my whole crop of cunt
is ruined.

151
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:29,940
Mr. Cohen, I swear to God--

152
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,408
You're talking to God, Mitch,
so you might as well swear to me.

153
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:41,120
I swear, if it hadn't been for that cop,
this would have never happened.

154
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,723
You think I'm sore about that cop?
Hell no.

155
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,490
He's a square Joe, the guy.

156
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,456
Rescues a damsel in distress.

157
00:10:49,631 --> 00:10:52,759
Goddamn hero is what he is.
They should put a medal on him.

158
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,038
We're gonna have to find a whole
new place. Start over again.

159
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,002
It's like they say:

160
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:05,273
"All good things must one day be burnt
to the ground for the insurance money."

161
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,512
Mr. Cohen, thank you so much.

162
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,017
I swear it won't ever happen again.

163
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,678
I know it won't, kid.

164
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,853
Whoa. Karl, what are you doing?

165
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,152
Let us out of here!

166
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:42,542
Hey!

167
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:45,244
Hey, Jerry.
Want a shine?

168
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:48,152
Hey, Pete, you want a shiner?
Go to bed.

169
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:50,190
Come on, I'm a working
man just like you.

170
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,158
How many times I gotta tell you?
When it gets dark, go home.

171
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,925
I'd love to, but I gotta make just
one more buck before I can get out of here.

172
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,364
-If I give you a dollar,
will you go home? -Yeah.

173
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:00,833
-Do you promise?
-I promise.

174
00:12:01,004 --> 00:12:02,096
Beat it.

175
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,671
Shine? Want a shine?

176
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,706
Go ahead, detective.

177
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,680
-Hey, sugar.
-Hey, Jerry.

178
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:20,317
# Here comes Mr.
Five By Five

179
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:21,956
Ladies.

180
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:26,390
# Solid avoirdupois

181
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:30,222
# Mr. Five By Five

182
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:34,360
# He's 5 feet tall and
he's 5 feet wide

183
00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:38,202
# He don't measure no
more from head to toe

184
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:41,072
# Than he do from side to side

185
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,713
# Mr. Five By Five

186
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:46,372
Jack. Fancy seeing you here.

187
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:47,916
Fancy that.

188
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,084
You look sharp.

189
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:52,586
-Take a pew.
-Yeah, okay.

190
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:54,490
How's it going, pal?

191
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,492
You got a steak à la carte back there
with your name on it.

192
00:12:57,662 --> 00:12:58,720
You're a peach.

193
00:12:59,565 --> 00:13:00,896
Figure you must be starving.

194
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:03,500
You haven't picked a winner in what,
six weeks?

195
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:06,297
-Five. -My boss can
help you out with that.

196
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:10,602
You know we fix the damn races, right?
All you gotta do is ask me.

197
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:12,937
First, Jack, you're not allowed
to tell me that.

198
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:16,604
Second of all, you know I have
a warrant for your arrest, right?

199
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:18,909
-So, what's the charge?
-Usury.

200
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:20,845
What the hell is usury?

201
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:23,078
Loansharking.
Do you want me to pull it out?

202
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:25,189
-It's in my pocket.
-Keep it in your pants.

203
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,325
-I can read it and tell you exactly
what it's for. -It's fine.

204
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,460
-Jerry, can you listen to me for
a second? -Yeah, I'm listening.

205
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:34,925
-Cohen's on the warpath.
-Warpath?

206
00:13:37,704 --> 00:13:40,172
Looks like he's on the
"give me some more" path.

207
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,334
-Just keep your eyes on the players, Jerry.
-Hard to know the players without the playbill.

208
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:47,902
Okay.

209
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:49,776
Up top you got the killer.

210
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:51,473
Wrevock's his name.

211
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,113
And down below,
the Honorable Judge Carter.

212
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:56,380
Max Solomon, Cohen's lawyer.

213
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:59,184
And Burbank Police Chief
Elmer Jackson.

214
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:02,726
On this side of the table,
one Eugene W. Biscailuz...

215
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,930
...the high sheriff of
Los Angeles County.

216
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,504
Who's the tomato?

217
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:18,001
That's Grace Faraday,
Cohen's etiquette tutor.

218
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:20,374
-Is that right?
-He's getting all sophisticated.

219
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:23,046
-Oh, must be nice.
-What's that?

220
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:25,515
I haven't been sophisticated
in weeks.

221
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:28,879
And it's not for lack of trying.

222
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,382
Roast peacock.

223
00:14:32,893 --> 00:14:37,193
Romans couldn't get enough
of this stuff. The guys had class.

224
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:39,232
It's the other fork, darling.

225
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,330
Tonight...

226
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:48,602
...we're celebrating the birth
of a new city...

227
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:53,077
...built right here on the ruins of
Los Angeles.

228
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:55,580
-Congratulations, Mickey.
-Hear, hear.

229
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:58,276
-Cheers.
-Hear, hear.

230
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,219
I think I'll just have a cigarette.

231
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:08,353
Don't worry about it.

232
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:10,728
It's done.

233
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,092
Don't even think about it, Jerry.

234
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,864
The penalty for poaching
the king's deer in this town...

235
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,200
...is still a permanent vacation
in a pine box.

236
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:24,544
Well, you gotta die of something.

237
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,045
Will you excuse me?

238
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,919
Thanks.

239
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:39,754
Sure.

240
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm Jerry.

241
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:49,768
Say, Jerry, I bet you got a ducky
war story behind that lighter.

242
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:51,937
Yeah, sure, I got stories.

243
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:55,672
-Hey, Mac, can I get a
Dirty Shirley? -Coming up.

244
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:58,672
I got shot down once
over the Pacific.

245
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:04,481
I spent the night hanging on to the wing of the
plane, sharks bumping my legs in the dark.

246
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:06,121
Are you weak in the knees yet?

247
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:08,255
Sure, I am.

248
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:12,619
Let's see. You're not quite big enough
to be a shylock.

249
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:13,922
I give up.

250
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:16,156
What's your racket, handsome?

251
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,262
Mostly I just like to play games.

252
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,994
I bet.
What kind of games?

253
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:23,271
I like to play Post Office.

254
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:26,203
Post Office?
It's a kid's game.

255
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,267
Not the way I play it.

256
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,140
But my racket is I'm a Bible salesman.

257
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,979
You wanna take me away from all this
and make an honest woman out of me?

258
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:38,280
No, ma'am.

259
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:41,454
I was just hoping to take you to bed.

260
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:51,300
Chief! Chief, what do you think about
those girls locked up at the Croesus?

261
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,403
Rumor has it that was
Mickey Cohen's place.

262
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:55,367
When you gonna do something
about Cohen?

263
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,906
-Chief has no comment.
-Hey.

264
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,637
Well, who's running
this town, then?

265
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:02,143
Who took it down?

266
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,406
John O'Mara. Homicide.

267
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,542
Just one man did that?

268
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,977
Yes, sir.

269
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,192
Sergeant O'Mara, Daryl Gates.

270
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:19,887
Who the hell is Daryl Gates?

271
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:21,759
The chief's driver.

272
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:24,492
He'd like a word with you, sergeant.

273
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:31,540
Officer Gates, kill the fatted calf,
will you?

274
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:34,705
I've found my prodigal son.

275
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,746
Two Purple Hearts.

276
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,342
Silver Star.

277
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,681
Trained at Camp X?

278
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,045
I never heard of Camp X, sir.

279
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,085
Of course not.

280
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:49,152
But you are skilled in guerilla warfare.

281
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:52,253
All due respect, sir,
may I ask why I'm here?

282
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:54,399
Would you please have a seat,
sergeant?

283
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,864
I want to talk to you about the war...

284
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,866
...for the soul of Los Angeles.

285
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:08,311
You see, our forbearers fought
savage Indians and Mexican bandits...

286
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:10,642
...to win Los Angeles.

287
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:15,550
And now, we're losing her to an
Eastern crook.

288
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,614
No one will testify.

289
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:22,218
They know it's suicide.

290
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:25,087
This isn't a crime wave.

291
00:18:25,265 --> 00:18:30,567
It's enemy occupation, and you've
fought in occupied territory before.

292
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:32,493
I have.

293
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,798
I need you to do it again.

294
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:39,601
To wage guerilla war against
Mickey Cohen.

295
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,913
We're finally going after him.

296
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,105
I'll need men.

297
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:45,775
Recruit them.
And keep it quiet.

298
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,784
You're off the books.

299
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:50,620
You are to make no arrests.

300
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,422
-You want me to kill him?
-No.

301
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:55,494
With Cohen dead...

302
00:18:55,663 --> 00:18:59,121
...his empire would only attract
others of his kind.

303
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:03,461
I want you to shatter
his operations...

304
00:19:03,637 --> 00:19:06,435
...destroy his establishments...

305
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:10,475
...and drive that bastard
out of this city.

306
00:19:11,111 --> 00:19:12,373
Yes, sir.

307
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,982
What are those?

308
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:30,662
I'm supposed to recruit a few guys
for this new outfit.

309
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:31,992
Oh, yeah?

310
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:33,791
What kind of outfit?

311
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:37,167
A small squad.
Five, maybe six guys.

312
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:41,264
What kind of outfit?

313
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,711
We're going after Mickey Cohen.

314
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:52,820
Oh.

315
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,727
Oh, Connie, Jesus.

316
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:08,568
We moved out here, you said we'd found
paradise, remember?

317
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:13,438
Wind was right, you could smell
the ocean right through that window.

318
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:18,737
That's exactly what kept me going when
I was over there, was raising a family here.

319
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:22,241
You can't ask me to just hand it
all over to Mickey Cohen.

320
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:23,942
Mickey Cohen can have L.A., John.

321
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,953
As far as I'm concerned,
he's welcome to the whole lousy town.

322
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:28,249
He just can't have you.

323
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,356
Sweetheart, look.

324
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,422
The war is over.

325
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:41,031
Stop fighting.

326
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:43,633
Come back to me.

327
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,375
I'm trying.

328
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:48,905
I need your help.

329
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:00,720
Hey, come here for a second,
I want to ask you something.

330
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:05,293
Well, you see, the thing is--

331
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:11,961
I bet you say that to all the girls.

332
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:13,227
I don't--

333
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:18,767
--know what you're talking about.

334
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:24,806
Where have you been
all my miserable life...

335
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:29,483
...Jerry the Bible salesman?

336
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,618
Drinking.

337
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:37,992
That's a noble profession.

338
00:21:49,974 --> 00:21:52,169
He'll kill you if he finds out,
you know.

339
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:55,604
Who?

340
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,011
Mickey.

341
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,222
Mickey Mouse?

342
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,986
What are you doing
with that knucklehead, anyway?

343
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,930
Doesn't really seem like your type.

344
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,962
I'm his type.

345
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,168
That's what matters.

346
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:40,055
You are something else,
you know that?

347
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,318
Yeah.

348
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,033
Top of his class. Top of his class.

349
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,961
This one made detective before his
30th birthday.

350
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:54,997
If I'm Cohen, these are the cops
I'm gonna buy.

351
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,406
They'll be lieutenants in a few years.

352
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:01,180
So I should just find other bums
like me?

353
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:05,374
I'm just saying that you shouldn't be
looking at choir boys for this.

354
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:17,025
I'm putting a squad together.

355
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:20,634
-I need an lndian guide who
knows the territory. -Oh.

356
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:25,295
I wish I could help. I'm just in the middle
of a very important case, so I can't.

357
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:28,508
Who's the lucky winner this time?

358
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,243
Mm.

359
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:36,473
Well, good luck.

360
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,810
That's all you got?

361
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:40,486
Sarge, the whole town's
underwater...

362
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:44,954
...and you're grabbing a bucket when you
should grab a bathing suit, you know?

363
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:47,424
Come on, Jerry,
what the hell happened to you?

364
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,229
Hey...

365
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:51,599
...same thing that happened
to you, pal.

366
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:55,596
But the war's over and we
don't have to fight anymore.

367
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:58,837
You're not gonna change anything
around here, sarge.

368
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,305
You're just gonna wake up one morning
on the wrong side of the grass.

369
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:03,603
For what?

370
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,079
If you can't answer that question,
take off the badge.

371
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,149
Drink up.

372
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,857
Okay, but only because it sounded
like an order.

373
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:24,129
How about this guy? They call him
The Sheriff of Central Avenue.

374
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,698
Coleman Harris.

375
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,326
Excessive force and
insubordination.

376
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:30,870
Sounds like a man
after your own dear heart.

377
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:41,808
Aah!

378
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
It's okay, Del.

379
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:45,153
-Now, don't wiggle it.
-Unh!

380
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:47,152
Be best you pull it straight out.

381
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:52,390
Lieutenant. Sergeant John O'Mara.

382
00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:54,520
Can I buy you a drink?

383
00:24:54,997 --> 00:24:57,363
Well, seeing as though
I'm still on duty...

384
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,000
...you better buy me two.

385
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,341
Damn heroin, eating Central Avenue
down to the bone.

386
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:12,975
I lost my niece to it a year ago.

387
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:17,353
I'm the only law that there is down here.

388
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:20,246
What would you say if
I took you upriver?

389
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:22,488
All the way to the headwaters.

390
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:23,751
No more pushers.

391
00:25:24,228 --> 00:25:25,923
Plug it up right at the source.

392
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:31,996
-Sarge.
-What is that?

393
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:33,530
Look.

394
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:35,160
What?

395
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,102
-Oh, no.
-Why not?

396
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:41,074
No, you can't just pull some guy
out of a magazine like he's a decoder ring.

397
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:42,337
You can't do that.

398
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:47,712
Sarge, Max Kennard has shot more crooks
than any L.A. cop in the last hundred years.

399
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:51,947
Sooner or later, there's gonna be gunplay,
and I want Kennard with you when it happens.

400
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:57,217
Max Kennard.

401
00:25:58,062 --> 00:25:59,051
Mind if I join you?

402
00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:01,254
All right.

403
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:05,595
Navidad Ramirez.

404
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:08,361
"Christmas" Ramirez?

405
00:26:08,907 --> 00:26:11,034
It's all right if you're
a burlesque dancer...

406
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:14,110
...but I keep on telling him
it's no kind of name for a lawman.

407
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,974
Mind if I talk with you for a minute?

408
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:20,076
Go on, Navidad. Get some air.

409
00:26:25,057 --> 00:26:27,457
That kid's not gonna last long
riding with you.

410
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:30,459
Hell, nobody'll work with him
on account of his heritage.

411
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,959
I'm going after Mickey Cohen.

412
00:26:35,935 --> 00:26:37,596
And I need a gun hand.

413
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:43,965
Wouldn't you know it?

414
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:46,970
I just happen to have one.

415
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:50,980
-There it is. Good as new.
-Thanks, Dad.

416
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,742
Yeah, don't crash.

417
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,712
Conwell Keeler?

418
00:26:56,455 --> 00:26:58,150
Can I help you with something, fella?

419
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,789
You need someone with brains
to balance the brawn.

420
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:04,859
He was Army lntelligence.

421
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:07,829
Got demoted for not understanding
the need for a warrant.

422
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,493
Rocketdyne's test firing their new
missile up in Santa Susana.

423
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,764
It's supposed to be
faster than the V-2.

424
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,601
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you, baby.

425
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:18,676
You don't know what the V-2 is,
that's okay. This one's faster.

426
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,314
I heard you were the best wire man
in the department.

427
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:23,813
Oh, yeah? Thank you.

428
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,742
Look, these other guys I've been asking,
none of them have families.

429
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:30,312
So you wanna think this over?

430
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,321
-Dad! It's the rocket!
-Oh.

431
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,356
Come on, hurry!

432
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:38,191
Wow. Isn't she a beaut?

433
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,958
Look, Dad.

434
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:43,667
Yeah.
It's pretty great, right?

435
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,973
You know, this...

436
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,974
...a brighter future...

437
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:51,043
...this is what we fought for,
isn't it?

438
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,842
Damn right.

439
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,771
He grows up...

440
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:01,214
...I don't wanna tell him that I just stood by
while Mickey Cohen took it from us.

441
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:08,895
Mr. Cohen, right this way.

442
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,361
Mr. Cohen, how's the haberdashery
business these days?

443
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:12,521
-Booming.
-Ha, ha, ha.

444
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,897
Mr. Cohen. What do you
think about Chief Parker?

445
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,595
-Who?
-Ha, ha, ha.

446
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:21,537
So nobody's heard from Tommy Russo in
a while. Any idea what's happened to him?

447
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:24,106
Tommy went to live
on a big farm...

448
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:28,373
...where he's got lots of room to run and
play with all the other Chicago gangsters.

449
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,576
You want, I'll take you out there
to visit him sometime.

450
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:45,958
-Hi, Jack.
-Mickey.

451
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:47,465
You know Red.

452
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:50,969
I think I'll go bend my elbow
while you boys bend your ears.

453
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:56,436
Pair of Jacks. It's not a
two-of-a-kind night, kid. Scram.

454
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,639
I'll be at the bar.

455
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,448
Scotch.

456
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,990
-Grace.
-Jack.

457
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:13,560
Say, kid...

458
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:17,160
...why don't you cut Jerry loose
before he gets hurt.

459
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:20,258
-Jerry's a big boy, Jack.
-Hm.

460
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:21,926
-Trust me.
-Yeah.

461
00:29:22,438 --> 00:29:25,805
He'll make a big stain on the sidewalk
if Cohen finds out about you two.

462
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:29,073
He's my friend, Grace.
I've known him all my life.

463
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:32,573
He's a sheep in wolf's clothing.

464
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:35,981
He's got a smart mouth...

465
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:38,079
...but he's dumb where it counts.

466
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:45,020
What you did to Russo,
that was a disgrace, Mickey.

467
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:49,996
The man rode on a train out from Chicago
to sit with you in good faith.

468
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:51,925
I don't get you.

469
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:55,697
You have the world
by the ass out here.

470
00:29:55,906 --> 00:30:00,104
You got all the prestige, the purse,
the pussy any man could ask for...

471
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:03,144
...and you go and you poke Chicago
in the eye.

472
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:05,105
Why?

473
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:07,175
More.

474
00:30:07,985 --> 00:30:09,714
I want more, Jack.

475
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:13,021
You wanna weep over Tommy Russo, fine,
we can drink to Tommy.

476
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:15,182
He was a guy who died
building a railroad...

477
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,228
...and I'm sorry he won't be out here
when I drive in the golden spike.

478
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,457
But what happened to
Tommy is nothing.

479
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:25,862
That wasn't murder.

480
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:28,037
It was progress.

481
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,568
I am progress.

482
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:34,502
You know what kills me...

483
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:36,980
...is you think you're something new.

484
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:39,810
I've seen guys like you before.

485
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:42,248
The Mojave is filled with them.

486
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:47,186
Bright boys that wanna shoot their way
to the top of the class. Ha.

487
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:49,751
You think I lack vision.

488
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:51,360
It's the other way around.

489
00:30:51,764 --> 00:30:55,222
Matter of fact, I'm having
a vision right now.

490
00:30:56,335 --> 00:31:01,102
You are gonna wake up one morning with
your best part stuffed into your mouth.

491
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm sorry, did you say something?

492
00:31:06,712 --> 00:31:08,202
I was kidding.

493
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,541
I heard you, Jack,
you're a funny guy.

494
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,477
And I'm not gonna carry water
for you anymore.

495
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:15,342
You dumb kike.

496
00:31:15,721 --> 00:31:19,452
You're old, you're slow.
I've outgrown you.

497
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:22,093
I might be getting old,
I might be getting slow...

498
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:24,525
...but I got friends in Chicago
that are neither.

499
00:31:24,697 --> 00:31:26,528
This isn't Chicago.

500
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:29,362
This is the Wild fucking West.

501
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:31,700
And I've been reading about it.

502
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:35,466
You heard of Manifest Destiny? That's when
you take what you can when you can.

503
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:38,611
The greasers took it from the redskins
and we took it from them.

504
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:42,009
And I'm gonna take it all from you, Jack,
and not just because I can.

505
00:31:42,449 --> 00:31:44,781
But because this is my destiny.

506
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:49,012
Los Angeles is my fucking destiny,
you motherfucker.

507
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,729
When we succeed, nobody will
ever know what we've done.

508
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:03,027
No medals, no promotion.

509
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,232
But I'm here to tell you, there's death
in it waiting for the man who hesitates.

510
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:12,736
Right now, our only advantage is that
he won't know who we are.

511
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:15,814
So I have only one rule in this outfit.

512
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:19,052
Leave these at home.

513
00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:21,487
We're not solving a case here.

514
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:23,514
We're going to war.

515
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,056
That sounds good to me.

516
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,759
Take it easy. No, I'm on your side.

517
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:30,093
Who the fuck is this guy?

518
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:33,465
He's a huge pain in my ass
is what he is.

519
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:35,591
He followed you here?

520
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,133
Real nice, Hopalong.

521
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:39,864
Yeah, but he's heard everything.

522
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:41,870
Yeah, I know your plan.

523
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:43,337
That's what I just said.

524
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:45,306
I want in.

525
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,204
Do you think you're good enough?

526
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:49,177
I got the drop on you, didn't l?

527
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:52,553
Push comes to shove...

528
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,712
...kid'll stay behind his gun.

529
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:01,792
It's your mess, cowboy.

530
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:04,795
When do we start?

531
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:08,458
Tonight. We're gonna hit his casino
across the river in Burbank.

532
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:14,972
# There's a guy in
our cowboy band

533
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:17,577
# He plays the best
bass in the land

534
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,374
# He plays it on and
off the beat

535
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:22,141
# He plays it hot and
he plays it sweet

536
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,050
We destroy the equipment,
burn the money.

537
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:29,055
We're in and out in 10 minutes and across
the river before they know what hit them.

538
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:32,251
-We gonna do it or talk
about it? -Let's go.

539
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,758
Hey, who are these guys, sarge?

540
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:36,762
Squaw need a new
pair of moccasins.

541
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:39,424
-Young brave need firewater!
-Ha, ha, ha.

542
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:41,227
Movie extras.

543
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,233
-Yay!
-Get down! Everybody down!

544
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:51,874
Get down! Do what we tell you
and no one gets hurt!

545
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:53,879
-Get down!
-We're here for the money!

546
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,541
-Kiss the ground!
-Oh, shit! They're cops!

547
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,084
-What?
-Yeah, who are they?

548
00:33:58,254 --> 00:34:00,085
-Those aren't costumes!
-Put them down!

549
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:02,282
These sons of bitches
are guarding the place!

550
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,552
-I said put them down!
-Hey, fuck you!

551
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:05,717
Let's go!

552
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:08,023
Get out! Get out! Abort! Abort!

553
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:09,688
Dirty Burbank sons of bitches!

554
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:11,258
Let's go!

555
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:14,535
That was a stupid idea!

556
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:15,694
Shit!

557
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:17,306
Stay on them!

558
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,940
Hold it right there!

559
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:33,388
-It's not starting! You gotta push it!
-Take your foot off the brake!

560
00:34:38,262 --> 00:34:39,491
Hurry, get in!

561
00:34:39,697 --> 00:34:41,324
Go, go, go! Just go!

562
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,562
Hands in the air! Now!

563
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:48,265
Damn.

564
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:51,974
The shine had this on him.

565
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:55,741
You packing a pig-sticker, Bwana?

566
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:00,476
You must be out here
from Chicago...

567
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:03,753
...or maybe from goddamn Mars.

568
00:35:04,122 --> 00:35:06,613
Because everybody down here
on planet Earth...

569
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:10,227
... knows that Mr. Cohen's place
is sacred ground.

570
00:35:11,663 --> 00:35:12,994
Dragna put you up to this?

571
00:35:13,264 --> 00:35:14,492
Go to hell.

572
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,766
You better believe I'm asking you
a whole lot nicer than Cohen's gonna.

573
00:35:23,175 --> 00:35:24,608
Lock them up.

574
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:39,113
Hey, Jerry. How about a shine?

575
00:35:39,291 --> 00:35:41,350
Oh, look, it's Pete.
No, it's Re-Pete.

576
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:45,293
Look at those shoes. It looks like they've
seen more steps than the Eiffel Tower.

577
00:35:45,464 --> 00:35:49,400
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll make them
shine like the moon, Jerry. The moon.

578
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:50,557
Oh, yeah?

579
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,135
-Okay, Pete.
-All right, all right.

580
00:35:58,778 --> 00:36:02,475
New York. It's like being
a rat in a maze.

581
00:36:02,649 --> 00:36:04,879
Everybody living on
top of each other.

582
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:08,179
You wouldn't believe how goddamn
filthy the place is.

583
00:36:10,023 --> 00:36:11,650
Whole goddamn place.

584
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:12,814
How's your mom?

585
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:15,158
How the hell should I know?

586
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:17,091
You should know how your mom is.

587
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:18,793
Heh. Okay.

588
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:26,497
Listen, I heard Cohen's making a move
on Dragna.

589
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,539
Is that right?

590
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,705
But out here...

591
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:36,740
...a guy's got room to be something
more than he was.

592
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:39,045
What do you know about
Cohen and Dragna?

593
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:42,446
I'm just saying to keep
your head down, that's all.

594
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:46,591
Keep my head down?
You keep your head down.

595
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:47,853
You're a kid.

596
00:36:48,462 --> 00:36:52,296
Only thing you should be worried about is how
you're gonna get your hands up a girl's skirt.

597
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:55,629
-Heh. -That's what you
should be worried about.

598
00:36:57,838 --> 00:36:59,396
The air's dry.

599
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:01,435
Clean.

600
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:02,869
You can taste it.

601
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,209
And that changes you.

602
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,543
Hey, Pete. Go home.

603
00:37:10,718 --> 00:37:12,914
-I'm not even done yet.
-Go home right now.

604
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:15,412
-You hear me?
-Yeah, all right.

605
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:16,649
-Go.
-All right.

606
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,792
-Go now.
-Okay.

607
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:29,793
I love Los Angeles. I love it.

608
00:37:44,186 --> 00:37:45,244
Jerry!

609
00:38:31,635 --> 00:38:33,364
Hey. Hey.

610
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:41,369
You can't shoot me. You're a cop.

611
00:38:42,212 --> 00:38:43,577
Not anymore.

612
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:25,250
Come on.

613
00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:27,015
Get it together, Jerry.

614
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,619
What's the matter with you?
Stop it.

615
00:39:29,794 --> 00:39:32,354
Whose blood is that,
Jerry? Huh?

616
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:35,622
You know that shoeshine kid?

617
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,768
-They killed him.
-I'm sorry about that.

618
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:39,767
You gotta screw your head on.

619
00:39:39,938 --> 00:39:42,532
Somebody just hit Cohen's place
in Burbank.

620
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:46,936
They think it was Dragna's guys,
but I can tell you for a fact it wasn't.

621
00:39:47,113 --> 00:39:50,446
Couple of strong-armed boys made like
to knock over Mickey's casino.

622
00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:52,311
Burbank cops nabbed two of them.

623
00:39:53,285 --> 00:39:55,116
Cohen's sending some
guys over there now.

624
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:02,390
Goddamn it, O'Mara,
you stupid son of a bitch.

625
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,090
I always knew I'd
die in Burbank.

626
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:10,466
They won't kill us here.

627
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:15,103
Cohen will send somebody to pick us up,
and then you'll wish they had.

628
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:22,270
-Watch the corridor, will you?
-All right.

629
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:30,847
Hey, fellas.
How's the food in there?

630
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:32,348
Sarge.

631
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:39,522
What the hell are you doing,
Hopalong?

632
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:41,826
This here is fixing to
be a jailbreak.

633
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:46,298
Supposed to be police officers.
It's like a three-ring circus.

634
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:03,983
-Help you with something, pal?
-Yeah.

635
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:09,395
Why don't you get off your fat ass
and get me my prisoners?

636
00:41:11,098 --> 00:41:13,191
This is the dumbest thing
I've ever seen.

637
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:17,160
You're the one that got pinched
and I'm the dummy?

638
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:20,030
You got here awful quick.

639
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,403
Yeah, well,
Mr. Cohen was in a hurry.

640
00:41:27,248 --> 00:41:28,738
Just one guy?

641
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,018
Yeah, don't worry about it.

642
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:32,909
I can handle these two.

643
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,146
With enough left over for you too, pal,
so just open it up.

644
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,560
Help you fellas?

645
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:43,229
Yeah, we're here to pick
up some garbage.

646
00:41:43,398 --> 00:41:44,524
Two bags.

647
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:46,865
Oh, shit.

648
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,834
Hold it! That guy's bullshit!

649
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:56,038
Lights out.

650
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,444
Floor it, Navidad!

651
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,152
That didn't work.

652
00:42:17,466 --> 00:42:19,025
Who's there?

653
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:22,400
Bwana's a Swahili word.

654
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:25,803
-Means "sir." Got it?
-Unh!

655
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:27,401
Yes, sir.

656
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:31,270
Come on, let's go, let's go.

657
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,485
Now, who the fuck
is this guy?

658
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,422
Jerry Wooters.

659
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:43,115
He's one of us.

660
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:50,127
I know it doesn't look
like much now.

661
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:53,830
But this is gonna be
my crown jewel.

662
00:42:54,003 --> 00:42:55,971
Welcome to El Dorado Trust.

663
00:42:56,473 --> 00:43:00,671
We're standing in the middle
of a money-making machine.

664
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,004
Makes me giddy.

665
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,608
We got all the whores
and dope sewn up.

666
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,182
But pari-mutuel wagering, bang.

667
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,478
Off-track betting, ba-bang.

668
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,587
That's where the real money is.

669
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,916
Have this place open in a few weeks.

670
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:18,187
After that, all the wire traffic west
of Chicago comes right through here.

671
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,420
Millions.

672
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:22,463
I couldn't make it any faster if I was
printing it myself.

673
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,256
What about the Syndicate?

674
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,199
That's the past. This is the future.

675
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,772
I'll buy them off with money we pull
out of this place alone.

676
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,202
Buy every politician from
here to Frisco.

677
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:37,041
Within a month, we'll have the whole
West Coast tied up in a nice ribbon.

678
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:55,124
Come on.

679
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:27,195
All right? Your turn.

680
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,669
You gonna break leather, Hopalong?

681
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,673
Or you just gonna watch us?

682
00:44:52,626 --> 00:44:53,923
You were saying?

683
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:56,195
Get on up here, Navidad.

684
00:44:57,397 --> 00:44:58,830
Sheesh.

685
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,964
You loaded?

686
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,540
Don't shoot where it is, son.

687
00:45:12,112 --> 00:45:13,977
Shoot where it's gonna be.

688
00:45:30,298 --> 00:45:31,765
They got Dragna.

689
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:34,163
They killed everybody in the house.

690
00:45:34,502 --> 00:45:37,596
His wife. Killed the maid,
for chrissake.

691
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:41,438
Cohen must have thought what we did
to his casino was Dragna's guys.

692
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:43,099
This was payback.

693
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:45,078
It's war. People die.

694
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,406
I'm sorry, I can't believe you would
say something like that.

695
00:45:49,884 --> 00:45:52,182
Sarge, I don't want any more
civilian casualties.

696
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:53,512
Then talk to Cohen.

697
00:45:54,122 --> 00:45:55,419
I'd rather listen to him.

698
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,753
All we do is plant a bug and we can
hear everything he says.

699
00:46:00,828 --> 00:46:02,386
One of the clubs?

700
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,025
No, his house.

701
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:17,010
It takes him three minutes
to get around the house. Go.

702
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:45,730
Hey, guys, do you want in on this?

703
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:48,934
-You owe me 10 bucks from last night.
-You always say that.

704
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:50,873
We're here to play cards.

705
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:53,447
-So five-card draw?
-Sounds good.

706
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:10,556
-What are you doing?
-Just looking at a picture.

707
00:47:17,507 --> 00:47:20,567
Cohen's home. Get out now.
Get out.

708
00:47:30,754 --> 00:47:31,914
Dessert, Mr. Cohen?

709
00:47:32,089 --> 00:47:34,216
Oh, hot fudge sundae.

710
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:38,457
Let's taste that, yeah. Mm.

711
00:47:38,629 --> 00:47:40,119
You're the best.

712
00:47:40,431 --> 00:47:42,899
-I'm just gonna powder my nose.
-Whatever.

713
00:47:47,871 --> 00:47:48,997
Shh.

714
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:09,586
Hey, Mickey. Anybody home?

715
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:13,889
Karl, I wanna take a look
at that property.

716
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:17,228
-That bakery down near Boyle Heights.
-You got it, Mickey.

717
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,071
-Hi.
-You heard anything?

718
00:48:20,238 --> 00:48:22,604
Apparently, Johnny Stomp's
balling Lana Turner.

719
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,901
Sinatra sounds pretty sore about it.

720
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:29,775
Judge Carter is a world-class whoremonger
and Mickey takes good care of him.

721
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:30,937
Figures.

722
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,744
Those are the locations of some
of the books around town.

723
00:48:33,918 --> 00:48:37,046
There must be a ton of them.
He's building something.

724
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:39,120
I don't know what it is yet.

725
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,192
Okay, well, we gotta find it.

726
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:43,428
No. Don't touch that.

727
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:44,858
Get some grub.

728
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:49,259
You got something to tell me,
Romeo?

729
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:52,835
It's nothing.

730
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,770
It didn't look like nothing.

731
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:57,101
What the hell is this?

732
00:48:57,276 --> 00:49:00,268
Hey, guys, guys. I just heard
something about a heroin shipment. Shh.

733
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:02,880
-Let me hear. Let me hear.
-Here.

734
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:08,010
-I can't hear it, Con. Turn it up.
-Well, it's up all the way.

735
00:49:08,187 --> 00:49:10,849
-I can't hear anything.
-I think they're leaving the room.

736
00:49:11,023 --> 00:49:13,457
-Oh, come on.
-Yeah, they left the room.

737
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:14,718
Shit.

738
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:20,292
-Where. We need to know where.
-I don't know. I'll keep listening.

739
00:49:20,467 --> 00:49:22,128
-I know a guy who can tell us.
-Who?

740
00:49:22,903 --> 00:49:24,666
Old friend from the neighborhood.

741
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:25,994
Unh!

742
00:49:26,173 --> 00:49:28,801
Cohen's got some medicine coming.
Where's he bringing it in?

743
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:31,000
I don't know! Aah!

744
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:32,975
-Don't lie to me, boy.
-Wait, wait!

745
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:34,408
Harris, they'll kill me.

746
00:49:34,614 --> 00:49:37,845
Not if you leave town, they won't.
Now, start talking.

747
00:49:39,653 --> 00:49:41,848
Burbank Airport, Friday night.

748
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,421
-You sure?
-Yes!

749
00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:46,854
All right. Get your ass
out of here. Damn.

750
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:50,261
I can't believe we going
back to Burbank.

751
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:57,328
That stuff is Mickey's poison.

752
00:49:57,505 --> 00:49:59,735
We shut it down, we take away
his best weapon.

753
00:50:02,844 --> 00:50:04,175
Let me get that for you, sir.

754
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:11,916
We good?

755
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:16,455
All right, let's go.

756
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:19,089
Come on.

757
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:27,958
Let's just wait until they get over
the river into L.A.

758
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:31,069
I think we've worn out our welcome
with the Burbank P.D.

759
00:50:37,312 --> 00:50:38,870
Forget it, let's take them now.

760
00:50:42,885 --> 00:50:45,217
Looks like we picked up
a couple of ticks.

761
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:47,312
Let's burn them off the road.

762
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:52,689
Shit!

763
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:55,161
Oh, my God!

764
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,592
Everybody get down!

765
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:00,235
Hold on to your hats, boys!

766
00:51:01,336 --> 00:51:02,803
Ah! Jesus Christ!

767
00:51:10,646 --> 00:51:11,977
Take them out!

768
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,480
Ah!

769
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,585
You're giving them a clear shot!

770
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:28,762
-All right, that's it!
-Where the hell is he going?

771
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:30,590
Get out of the way!

772
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:31,995
What the hell's he doing?

773
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:33,530
Move over!

774
00:51:42,779 --> 00:51:44,041
Where the hell did he go?

775
00:51:44,447 --> 00:51:45,846
-You see him?
-No, sir!

776
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,277
Damn it, you see him?

777
00:51:49,452 --> 00:51:50,544
Jesus!

778
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:52,849
Oh, shit!

779
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:10,066
What the hell is that?

780
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,368
Shit!

781
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:15,077
Jesus Christ!

782
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:17,547
John, back off! Back off!

783
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:21,009
Grenade! Shit!

784
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:24,177
Grab it!

785
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:34,355
Hit him harder!

786
00:52:37,702 --> 00:52:38,794
All right, hang on.

787
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:42,062
Unh! Son of a bitch. No!

788
00:52:47,846 --> 00:52:49,108
Okay.

789
00:52:50,215 --> 00:52:51,739
Closer, Navidad!

790
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:53,548
Shit.

791
00:53:11,204 --> 00:53:12,762
Let's go, hoss.

792
00:53:14,074 --> 00:53:15,939
-Where do you want them?
-Right here.

793
00:53:18,578 --> 00:53:19,875
Who the hell are you?

794
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:23,538
You don't know what you done, pal.
You think he's gonna laugh this off?

795
00:53:23,717 --> 00:53:25,116
He will hunt you down.

796
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:29,153
-That's not your problem anymore.
You hear me? -Ah!

797
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:32,154
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. -You have their
wallets? What are their names?

798
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:34,486
Edgar Beaumont and Jeffrey Clark.

799
00:53:34,661 --> 00:53:35,889
We know who you are.

800
00:53:36,062 --> 00:53:38,997
You used to run dope for Mickey Cohen.
You're retired.

801
00:53:51,746 --> 00:53:53,270
Let's get out of here.

802
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:08,690
You really wanna win this thing,
or you wanna die trying?

803
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:13,595
Don't get me wrong, I love shooting gangsters
in the legs just as much as the next guy.

804
00:54:13,768 --> 00:54:15,827
But we're gonna have to be smarter
next time.

805
00:54:16,404 --> 00:54:20,272
Playing hot potato with a grenade
isn't much of a strategy.

806
00:54:22,543 --> 00:54:24,443
We got really lucky.

807
00:54:25,113 --> 00:54:28,981
If we keep going head-on at him like this,
we're not gonna make it more than a week.

808
00:54:29,718 --> 00:54:31,151
It worked, Jerry.

809
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:33,120
Get in the car.

810
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:46,232
Mr. Cohen, sir. I.... The, uh....

811
00:54:46,435 --> 00:54:49,563
Someone hit the shipment.

812
00:54:49,738 --> 00:54:51,205
I'm sorry.

813
00:54:54,476 --> 00:54:55,738
Who hit the shipment?

814
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:58,975
Guineas from back East.
Maybe Russo's people.

815
00:54:59,147 --> 00:55:01,445
-I don't know.
-Hm.

816
00:55:02,217 --> 00:55:04,379
Maybe Russo's people.

817
00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:07,747
Well....

818
00:55:10,493 --> 00:55:11,960
These things happen.

819
00:55:14,697 --> 00:55:16,358
-Tsk.
-Thank you, Mr. Cohen.

820
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:19,325
Karl.

821
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:21,730
You know the drill.

822
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:24,934
No! No! Karl, no!

823
00:55:25,108 --> 00:55:26,575
Hey, Karl! No!

824
00:55:27,276 --> 00:55:29,267
-I'm begging you!
-You stupid bastard.

825
00:55:30,113 --> 00:55:33,605
This ain't right!
This ain't right! Aah!

826
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:41,917
# Fallin' for no one but you

827
00:55:43,127 --> 00:55:45,561
# There's no use denying

828
00:55:45,729 --> 00:55:47,356
# I might as well confess

829
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:49,055
-Come in.
-Mrs. O'Mara?

830
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,099
Please, Connie.

831
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:53,702
Jerry Wooters. Nice to meet you.

832
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,237
Nice to meet you too.
What'd you bring?

833
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:58,102
Bear claws.

834
00:56:01,145 --> 00:56:02,544
Uh....

835
00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:04,744
Congratulations.
I didn't....

836
00:56:04,915 --> 00:56:07,315
Thank you. John
didn't tell you?

837
00:56:08,018 --> 00:56:09,144
No, he didn't.

838
00:56:09,319 --> 00:56:11,310
-Where is that guy?
-Out back.

839
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:12,784
Okay.

840
00:56:13,423 --> 00:56:17,553
This little bird told
me when we marry

841
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:19,161
Jerry?

842
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:20,319
Yeah?

843
00:56:20,532 --> 00:56:25,629
I know. What kind of a guy would take on
a job like this with his wife in my condition?

844
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,130
That kind of guy.

845
00:56:28,273 --> 00:56:32,733
My husband's the bravest man I know
but he is not much for abstract thinking.

846
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:35,277
Honor and duty are
as real as I am.

847
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:38,839
So if it comes down to a choice
between his life and his duty--

848
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,314
You want me to push him
in the right direction?

849
00:56:41,786 --> 00:56:43,617
-Can I shove him in the
right direction? -Heh.

850
00:56:43,788 --> 00:56:45,915
That's why I picked you.
You seem sensible.

851
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,648
Well, that's a nice way to put it.

852
00:56:47,826 --> 00:56:50,192
I handpicked all of you guys,
except the Mexican kid.

853
00:56:50,361 --> 00:56:54,161
-I don't know where you found him.
-I don't know where he came from either.

854
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,431
Take that out?

855
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,365
John's a lucky guy, Connie.

856
00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:04,533
Look, you know what?

857
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,575
You should get your
wife a Cadillac.

858
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:08,776
How's your love life these days?

859
00:57:08,948 --> 00:57:10,381
Your wife deserves a Cadillac.

860
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:14,485
You're driving a Studebaker, you should
buy yourself a Cadillac. It's a nice car.

861
00:57:14,653 --> 00:57:16,484
You don't get cars
like that too often.

862
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:20,290
You know, Jerry, one of these nights
she's just gonna get bored.

863
00:57:20,626 --> 00:57:21,888
Scared.

864
00:57:22,728 --> 00:57:26,596
Or he'll give her a rock and she'll
just roll on us in a fit of gratitude.

865
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:30,830
Or he'll just find out she's got
a new swain and that's not good.

866
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:39,009
With all due respect, sarge, you don't
know a goddamn thing about her.

867
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:40,738
Gentlemen.

868
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:45,883
I would congratulate you
on a job well done.

869
00:57:47,187 --> 00:57:49,519
But then I was never here.

870
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:53,155
Cohen has already
organized a dragnet.

871
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:55,419
He has his people inside
the department...

872
00:57:55,629 --> 00:57:58,530
...hunting for the gang
that hit his drug shipment.

873
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:02,391
It's only a matter of time until
he realizes you're cops.

874
00:58:03,169 --> 00:58:06,570
We need to step up our timetable here,
sergeant.

875
00:58:06,873 --> 00:58:09,433
We need to offer Cohen no quarter.

876
00:58:09,643 --> 00:58:11,235
I'm not a quarter kind of guy, sir.

877
00:58:11,711 --> 00:58:12,735
Neither am I.

878
00:58:36,704 --> 00:58:38,228
Unh!

879
00:58:51,419 --> 00:58:52,409
Get out!

880
00:59:27,923 --> 00:59:29,151
Over there.

881
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:33,353
Telephones, wires. Hey, hey.

882
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:35,759
You are dead, pal. You are all dea--

883
00:59:38,434 --> 00:59:39,765
Yeah, we get that a lot.

884
01:00:01,124 --> 01:00:03,354
Find these bastards.

885
01:00:04,627 --> 01:00:06,151
Kill them all.

886
01:00:06,996 --> 01:00:08,658
Kill their families.

887
01:00:08,832 --> 01:00:09,958
Their kids.

888
01:00:10,134 --> 01:00:11,999
Their dogs. Their cats.

889
01:00:12,169 --> 01:00:14,535
They're on the scent of
El Dorado Trust.

890
01:00:14,705 --> 01:00:18,573
We cannot let that happen.
Do you understand me?

891
01:00:20,144 --> 01:00:25,013
El Dorado Trust.

892
01:00:25,716 --> 01:00:27,206
It's an A-bomb.

893
01:00:27,851 --> 01:00:29,910
It's Mickey Cohen's pride and joy.

894
01:00:30,721 --> 01:00:33,053
The whole reason he killed
Tommy Russo...

895
01:00:33,223 --> 01:00:35,555
...was to take over his
Continental Wire service...

896
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:40,023
...which means Cohen's got the only wire
between here and Chicago.

897
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,201
He's building the central book
for the entire western United States.

898
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:47,235
Wait, what's the central book?

899
01:00:47,405 --> 01:00:50,863
All gambling money on the West Coast
will go through a central book...

900
01:00:51,042 --> 01:00:53,272
...and Mickey Cohen
will touch every penny.

901
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:57,438
If he gets that thing up and running,
inside a week it won't matter what we do.

902
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:00,181
It'll be growing faster than we can
tear it down.

903
01:01:00,718 --> 01:01:02,379
He'll own the whole goddamn state.

904
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:03,743
Where is it?

905
01:01:04,923 --> 01:01:06,049
I don't know.

906
01:01:06,691 --> 01:01:08,420
They haven't said a thing.

907
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,250
Well, we gotta find it.

908
01:01:10,428 --> 01:01:12,055
Yes, we do.

909
01:01:13,398 --> 01:01:15,025
We don't have a lot
of time, Jerry.

910
01:01:26,879 --> 01:01:28,244
I'm not gonna get her killed.

911
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:30,712
You gotta ask her.

912
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:32,380
Or I will.

913
01:01:35,087 --> 01:01:37,385
You know, I ain't gotta
prove myself to you.

914
01:01:37,556 --> 01:01:39,786
You asked me to be
here and I'm here.

915
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:42,984
I'm risking my life,
like every single guy in there.

916
01:01:43,162 --> 01:01:44,288
But there's a line.

917
01:01:44,964 --> 01:01:46,295
You go and talk to my girl...

918
01:01:46,465 --> 01:01:49,832
...you put her in danger, you're gonna
cross that line with me, pal.

919
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:52,368
I'm not questioning
your loyalty, Jerry.

920
01:01:52,938 --> 01:01:54,269
Don't go near her.

921
01:01:54,974 --> 01:01:56,942
Just do what needs to be done.

922
01:02:13,293 --> 01:02:14,783
You're going somewhere?

923
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:17,626
I gotta go.

924
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:26,195
You gotta do that in front of me?

925
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,169
You gotta make yourself pretty for him
in front of me?

926
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:34,311
-What's the matter?
-You got a lot of nerve.

927
01:02:36,183 --> 01:02:37,548
What are we doing?

928
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:39,952
I can't figure out your angle.

929
01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:42,281
What's your angle?

930
01:02:42,456 --> 01:02:44,481
What were you doing in
his house, Jerry?

931
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:46,320
You don't wanna know that.

932
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,793
Why didn't you tell
me you're a cop?

933
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:53,195
I'm looking out for you.

934
01:02:53,367 --> 01:02:56,700
-Trust me.
-No. I don't trust you.

935
01:03:00,474 --> 01:03:02,499
He's gonna plant us both.

936
01:03:07,048 --> 01:03:10,074
-That stirs you a little, doesn't it?
-Oh, yeah, that stirs me up.

937
01:03:10,251 --> 01:03:13,584
-It does, Jerry, admit it.
-It stirs me right up.

938
01:03:14,188 --> 01:03:16,349
Maybe that's why you're with him.

939
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:19,192
-You think that's why I'm with him?
-I don't know.

940
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,855
I came out here to be a star, Jerry.

941
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:27,058
I figured I couldn't lose.

942
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:33,106
I figured wrong, didn't I?

943
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:39,974
I'm open to suggestions.

944
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:42,180
Don't go.

945
01:03:43,185 --> 01:03:44,516
Don't let me.

946
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:05,466
One-two. Ho-ho. Whoa.

947
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:07,507
This the one where you
break his jaw?

948
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,378
Hey, Claude Rains.

949
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:16,210
Come here,
I wanna show you something.

950
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,081
Hurt him. Yeah.

951
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:26,584
-This putz was trying to
steal my title. -Heh.

952
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,090
Story of my life.

953
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,534
Some bum's always trying to steal
what's mine.

954
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:35,070
You gotta dance.

955
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:40,603
Come on. Finish him.

956
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:42,768
Oh!

957
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:48,081
-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah?

958
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:50,743
Mom wants to know when you're gonna
put up the lights.

959
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:53,913
As soon as I'm done here.
Can you hand me those wire strippers?

960
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,251
Yeah.

961
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:58,191
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

962
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:01,331
Son, your dad's a genius.

963
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:04,198
Go tell your mom that.

964
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:09,929
So the first one's Pacific Telephone.
The second one's Western Union.

965
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:11,335
And that third one--

966
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:13,772
-Cohen's.
-That's right.

967
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:15,970
That's all there is to it?
Just cut the wire?

968
01:05:16,147 --> 01:05:19,446
No. You cut the wire, they'd be out
here in an hour to repair it.

969
01:05:19,617 --> 01:05:22,108
El Dorado Trust is the terminus
of the wire, right?

970
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:26,621
So all you gotta do is ping the wire and the
pulse echo will tell you how far away it is.

971
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:28,323
Why didn't I think of that?

972
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:30,017
Hey, keep an eye out.

973
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:42,336
What'll it be?

974
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:45,873
Remember 75.

975
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,808
And bingo.

976
01:05:52,217 --> 01:05:53,810
You gotta be shitting me.

977
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,686
Am I the only one who thinks
this is fucking insane?

978
01:05:56,856 --> 01:05:59,086
Because there's an alarm,
it goes right to Cohen.

979
01:05:59,258 --> 01:06:01,590
It'll take me 10 minutes to find it
and disable it.

980
01:06:01,761 --> 01:06:03,160
You got 5 then.

981
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:06,321
Shooting starts, sheriffs are gonna be
all over our asses.

982
01:06:06,499 --> 01:06:07,864
You sure we can pull this off?

983
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:10,426
No.

984
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:12,265
Let's do it then.

985
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:57,783
-Hey.
-Hey.

986
01:06:57,951 --> 01:06:59,316
-Hey.
-Howdy.

987
01:06:59,486 --> 01:07:01,477
-Who are you guys?
-We're the band.

988
01:07:01,688 --> 01:07:02,950
Unh!

989
01:07:04,057 --> 01:07:05,319
Oh, shit.

990
01:07:09,831 --> 01:07:11,890
-Keeler?
-All clear.

991
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,951
# Boom, chica,
boom-boom-boom-boom-boom

992
01:07:38,226 --> 01:07:39,659
Aah!

993
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:46,266
All right, everybody,
time to go home! Out!

994
01:07:46,434 --> 01:07:48,665
Ladies, go on and take
the rest of the night off.

995
01:07:48,837 --> 01:07:51,032
Come on, ladies.
That means you. Get up.

996
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,532
Let's go, ladies. Come on.

997
01:07:53,742 --> 01:07:55,471
We already took care of that.

998
01:08:01,316 --> 01:08:02,840
# Ch-ch-chica, boom

999
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:18,330
# Chica, chica, boom, chica boom
Chica, boom-boom-boom

1000
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,127
# Boom, chica,
boom-boom-boom

1001
01:08:21,503 --> 01:08:23,368
-Aah!
-Everybody out! Now!

1002
01:08:24,339 --> 01:08:25,465
Everybody out!

1003
01:08:52,502 --> 01:08:54,060
My, oh, my.

1004
01:08:55,104 --> 01:08:57,834
What the fuck happened
here, Eugene?

1005
01:08:58,007 --> 01:09:00,908
We don't know, Mr. Cohen.
Right now, I'm coordinating the--

1006
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:03,841
"Coordinating"?
What's this coordinating?

1007
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:05,345
Take the dog.

1008
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:06,505
No, the deputy.

1009
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,414
This how you take
care of business?

1010
01:09:13,591 --> 01:09:15,354
You motherfucker!

1011
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:19,929
You will find the cocksuckers
that did this to me!

1012
01:09:20,097 --> 01:09:22,122
You will find them!

1013
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:25,091
Drink. Come on.

1014
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:27,294
-Look, look. Come on.
-Shut up.

1015
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:29,939
Come on, you son of a-- Drink.

1016
01:09:30,107 --> 01:09:31,301
No, it's right here, man.

1017
01:09:31,475 --> 01:09:33,443
Drink it. Don't be scared,
don't be scared.

1018
01:09:33,611 --> 01:09:37,911
Our young Señor Ramirez is drunker
than a peach orchard sow.

1019
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:39,447
-Let me tap you.
-No, I'm good.

1020
01:09:39,617 --> 01:09:40,606
You sure?

1021
01:09:40,784 --> 01:09:42,115
It's not good right now.

1022
01:09:42,787 --> 01:09:44,277
Sarge, come here for a second.

1023
01:09:44,456 --> 01:09:47,289
-Come on, everybody. Get over here.
-Come on, sarge.

1024
01:09:47,459 --> 01:09:48,790
Sarge, come here.

1025
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,052
To the sarge.

1026
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:52,389
For bringing us all home safe.

1027
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:56,933
You're a bull in a china shop, but we'd
follow you anywhere. To the sarge.

1028
01:09:57,102 --> 01:10:00,435
No, look, this victory
belongs to all of us.

1029
01:10:00,872 --> 01:10:05,605
You know, I've run with a lot of outfits,
but none better than you group of misfits.

1030
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:07,967
Cheers.

1031
01:10:08,146 --> 01:10:10,808
-To the Gangster Squad.
-The Gangster Squad.

1032
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,756
How much did they get away with?

1033
01:10:22,395 --> 01:10:23,487
Nothing.

1034
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:26,021
Neddy says they didn't
take the money.

1035
01:10:32,805 --> 01:10:34,397
They're cops.

1036
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:40,502
Chief Parker put them up to it.

1037
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:46,816
I've had it with that sadistic,
Bible-thumping boozer.

1038
01:10:48,521 --> 01:10:49,954
He's done.

1039
01:10:50,923 --> 01:10:53,448
We never had that kind
of trouble before.

1040
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:55,988
Trust me, Karl.

1041
01:10:56,629 --> 01:11:00,464
I've bought myself enough cops.
I know what I'm talking about.

1042
01:11:02,069 --> 01:11:05,232
These guys are a special brand.

1043
01:11:05,739 --> 01:11:08,037
They're hard cases,
not interested in money.

1044
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:10,642
A cop that's not for sale
is like a dog with rabies.

1045
01:11:10,811 --> 01:11:13,075
There's no medicine for it,
you just gotta...

1046
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:15,981
...put him down.

1047
01:11:18,585 --> 01:11:20,018
Heh.

1048
01:11:23,256 --> 01:11:25,224
Somebody peached to them.

1049
01:11:27,527 --> 01:11:29,893
Somebody up and turned rat on me!

1050
01:11:31,565 --> 01:11:34,830
There's ears in this fucking house!
Find them!

1051
01:11:36,103 --> 01:11:38,163
The slut cluck bitches!

1052
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,038
Come on. We need to get you out of here
before he runs out of pretty things to break.

1053
01:11:43,511 --> 01:11:46,605
Now, you don't ever need to come
back here, Miss Grace. Not ever.

1054
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:06,691
Wrevock's gonna pick up the
shipment tonight in Chinatown.

1055
01:12:06,868 --> 01:12:08,495
Use the laundry truck.

1056
01:12:08,736 --> 01:12:10,101
No, wait, you gotta hear this.

1057
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,441
You don't make this deal,
we're finished, you hear me? Done.

1058
01:12:16,612 --> 01:12:18,910
That hit on Slapsy's is still killing us.

1059
01:12:19,081 --> 01:12:21,982
Wrevock's gonna pick up the shipment
tonight in Chinatown.

1060
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:25,450
Use the laundry truck. Don't fuck it up.
I need this.

1061
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:26,810
We hurt him.

1062
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:31,215
He is bleeding cash. Desperate enough
to do this out in the open.

1063
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:34,226
We intercept that dope,
he is dead in the water.

1064
01:12:35,597 --> 01:12:39,226
You know, I signed up for this...

1065
01:12:40,068 --> 01:12:41,092
...ahem...

1066
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:45,798
...so that I could tell my boy that I
at least tried to do something about it.

1067
01:12:45,974 --> 01:12:49,068
But I hope he never finds out about
all the things we've done.

1068
01:12:49,244 --> 01:12:50,939
Con, we did what we had to do.

1069
01:12:51,113 --> 01:12:55,050
Can you remind me of the difference
between us and them?

1070
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:59,418
Because at this point,
I can't tell anymore.

1071
01:12:59,956 --> 01:13:02,652
You want to find a witness to sign
their own death warrant?

1072
01:13:02,826 --> 01:13:07,854
Con, look, this is the only way
we can beat him. The only way.

1073
01:13:10,934 --> 01:13:12,128
Okay.

1074
01:13:16,506 --> 01:13:20,101
All right, look,
I need you on the wire tonight.

1075
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:21,436
-Okay?
-Oh, no.

1076
01:13:21,611 --> 01:13:25,513
In case Cohen has a change of plan.
It's all right, Con.

1077
01:13:25,682 --> 01:13:28,310
You sit this one out. We can handle it.

1078
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:30,177
All right?

1079
01:13:31,689 --> 01:13:32,781
Okay.

1080
01:13:45,336 --> 01:13:46,360
Hey.

1081
01:13:47,638 --> 01:13:48,969
You wanted to talk to me?

1082
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,207
He thinks somebody ratted.

1083
01:13:51,609 --> 01:13:52,633
He what?

1084
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:56,007
-It's a matter of time before he gets to me.
-What are you doing here?

1085
01:13:56,180 --> 01:14:01,208
-I gotta get out of town. You should too.
-I can't. Gracie, look, for whatever it's worth....

1086
01:14:05,389 --> 01:14:09,257
Look, for whatever it's worth, Cohen had
nothing to do with us. Not for one second.

1087
01:14:09,426 --> 01:14:10,655
Don't run. Just stay.

1088
01:14:13,498 --> 01:14:14,760
Can I help you fellas?

1089
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:17,993
-We'll get to you in a minute.
-We wanna talk to her, is all.

1090
01:14:18,169 --> 01:14:20,694
Hey, we got a message from Mr. Cohen.

1091
01:14:20,872 --> 01:14:23,500
It just seems like the lady
doesn't want to talk to you.

1092
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:27,167
What lady? She's just one of Mickey's
pro skirts, there, pal.

1093
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:35,608
Where is it?

1094
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:37,687
-Where is it?
-It's over there!

1095
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:41,718
-Ah-ah-ah. No, no, no.
-What is that?

1096
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:44,157
Is that your message for her?
Is that acid?

1097
01:14:44,362 --> 01:14:47,593
-Oh, come on. -I ever see you
near her again, I'll kill you.

1098
01:14:47,766 --> 01:14:49,598
-Okay.
-Good.

1099
01:14:53,105 --> 01:14:54,732
Damn it!

1100
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,564
Fuck!

1101
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,476
You're gonna get yours! Aah! Aah!

1102
01:15:01,113 --> 01:15:04,276
O'MARA: We know Cohen's sending
Wrevock here to meet the shipment.

1103
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,783
Maintain surveillance until he reaches
the target location.

1104
01:15:07,954 --> 01:15:09,922
He's gonna lead us right to the dope.

1105
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:15,049
We get this shipment, it's over.
No more business.

1106
01:15:15,227 --> 01:15:17,787
A lot of civilians, this goes south.

1107
01:15:17,964 --> 01:15:21,900
Let's make sure that doesn't happen.
Come on.

1108
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:26,634
-Where's Wooters?
-Wasn't my turn to watch him.

1109
01:15:28,508 --> 01:15:30,169
We're ready to go
now for round 9...

1110
01:15:30,344 --> 01:15:32,505
...of the scheduled 15-round
lightweight championship...

1111
01:15:34,014 --> 01:15:36,141
...in the Olympic Auditorium,
Los Angeles, California.

1112
01:15:44,324 --> 01:15:46,349
Jerry. Grace.

1113
01:15:46,526 --> 01:15:47,686
Come on in.

1114
01:15:47,861 --> 01:15:49,419
Come on, quick.

1115
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,229
I gotta ask you a favor.

1116
01:15:59,606 --> 01:16:01,631
I need you to get Gracie
out of town tonight.

1117
01:16:02,042 --> 01:16:03,236
Yeah.

1118
01:16:04,545 --> 01:16:05,671
I can do that.

1119
01:16:06,748 --> 01:16:07,806
Thank you.

1120
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,039
I gotta go.

1121
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:27,961
Are you guys sisters?

1122
01:16:28,136 --> 01:16:29,569
We can be.

1123
01:16:31,639 --> 01:16:33,903
-Wait here in case he doubles back.
-Got it.

1124
01:18:01,632 --> 01:18:04,123
-Jesus Christ, Wooters.
-Where the fuck were you?

1125
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:05,563
Where's John?

1126
01:18:22,786 --> 01:18:23,775
John!

1127
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:26,585
John! John!

1128
01:18:39,337 --> 01:18:40,599
John, look out!

1129
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:39,025
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

1130
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:57,548
Fuck!

1131
01:20:01,522 --> 01:20:02,989
Oh, Jesus.

1132
01:20:03,323 --> 01:20:04,312
Keeler.

1133
01:20:04,992 --> 01:20:09,395
I was 9 years old when I robbed the
Palace Theater with a baseball bat.

1134
01:20:10,364 --> 01:20:12,332
Cashier was laughing.

1135
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,368
Till I bashed his head in.

1136
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,935
Knocking the place over,
that wasn't the hard part.

1137
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,506
A 9-year-old kid with a cash box...

1138
01:20:21,675 --> 01:20:24,610
...trying to get from Broadway
all the way to Boyle Heights?

1139
01:20:25,179 --> 01:20:28,376
Every block, I must have fought five,
six kids for that box.

1140
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:32,077
But I wouldn't let it go. I wouldn't
let anybody take it away from me.

1141
01:20:34,122 --> 01:20:36,590
But you know who finally
got that box?

1142
01:20:41,729 --> 01:20:42,889
A cop.

1143
01:20:43,832 --> 01:20:45,459
A dirty cop.

1144
01:20:46,201 --> 01:20:48,726
An eavesdropping fucking cop.

1145
01:20:54,709 --> 01:20:56,574
That bug's a nifty piece of work.

1146
01:20:58,346 --> 01:20:59,836
Limited range, though.

1147
01:21:10,259 --> 01:21:12,420
I'm not angry. That's done.

1148
01:21:12,895 --> 01:21:14,886
This is business.

1149
01:21:42,825 --> 01:21:44,520
Don't you worry, Grace.

1150
01:21:44,693 --> 01:21:46,160
I'll get you out of town safe.

1151
01:21:46,328 --> 01:21:48,854
I don't want out of town, Jack.
I want out of this life.

1152
01:21:49,032 --> 01:21:51,830
Jack. Ha, ha, ha.

1153
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:55,966
-You stay here.
-Jack.

1154
01:22:02,412 --> 01:22:03,606
Where is she, Jack?

1155
01:22:04,014 --> 01:22:06,778
Where's that gorgeous
red snatch?

1156
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,276
She's not here, Mickey.

1157
01:22:08,451 --> 01:22:11,045
Did you bring your trouble boys
just to see Grace?

1158
01:22:11,221 --> 01:22:12,984
You expecting some trouble, Mickey?

1159
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:14,650
You looking for some?

1160
01:22:14,824 --> 01:22:16,792
My dog, Mickey, Jr...

1161
01:22:17,194 --> 01:22:19,822
...he shits more trouble
than you're gonna give me.

1162
01:22:19,996 --> 01:22:21,725
We'll see about that, huh?

1163
01:22:21,998 --> 01:22:23,226
Make it good, boys, huh?

1164
01:22:23,433 --> 01:22:24,422
You? You?

1165
01:22:31,876 --> 01:22:33,207
Come here.

1166
01:22:39,517 --> 01:22:41,382
You're up next,
you little creep.

1167
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,754
I've been saving something special
for you, Mickey.

1168
01:22:46,224 --> 01:22:48,954
My boxing days are over, Jack.

1169
01:22:49,961 --> 01:22:52,521
Come on, Mickey. Unh!

1170
01:22:58,202 --> 01:23:00,363
-Does that hurt?
-Fuck you, Mickey.

1171
01:23:29,401 --> 01:23:30,698
Argh!

1172
01:23:49,455 --> 01:23:50,581
John.

1173
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,052
-Damn it, John, don't do this.
-Stay out of it, Jerry.

1174
01:23:54,227 --> 01:23:55,216
Just listen to me.

1175
01:23:56,462 --> 01:24:00,228
You goddamn suicidal son of a bitch.
You want to hit something, you hit me.

1176
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,834
-Get out of my way!
-You want to hit something, hit--

1177
01:24:12,111 --> 01:24:13,544
Mickey!

1178
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,308
Cohen!

1179
01:24:16,816 --> 01:24:18,306
Come on!

1180
01:24:34,268 --> 01:24:35,633
Well, sarge...

1181
01:24:38,305 --> 01:24:40,068
...this is where I get off.

1182
01:26:03,092 --> 01:26:07,654
The papers are calling
for my resignation.

1183
01:26:08,464 --> 01:26:12,560
And the mayor, I'm afraid,
is calling for your head.

1184
01:26:13,402 --> 01:26:17,464
I will likely be replaced by someone
more amenable to Cohen.

1185
01:26:18,074 --> 01:26:21,874
And you, sergeant,
you'll be relieved of your duty.

1186
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:26,575
Your career with the Los Angeles
Police Department is over.

1187
01:26:29,186 --> 01:26:30,813
As for your comrades--

1188
01:26:30,987 --> 01:26:32,955
They were following my orders, sir.

1189
01:26:34,191 --> 01:26:35,590
Blame rests solely with me.

1190
01:26:39,296 --> 01:26:41,457
You've served with distinction.

1191
01:26:42,499 --> 01:26:43,898
I'm sorry, John.

1192
01:26:44,768 --> 01:26:46,133
He won.

1193
01:27:14,599 --> 01:27:16,328
-Here, come here.
-No.

1194
01:27:16,501 --> 01:27:19,129
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1195
01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:44,158
If I leave, Keeler
died for nothing.

1196
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:47,821
Is that what you want me to tell our son
when he asks about his father?

1197
01:28:00,846 --> 01:28:01,835
Connie!

1198
01:28:41,554 --> 01:28:43,613
The war taught us how to fight.

1199
01:28:45,024 --> 01:28:47,015
And, God knows, it was worth it.

1200
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:52,697
But now it's all I know how to do.

1201
01:28:53,901 --> 01:28:55,766
I don't know how to live.

1202
01:28:57,204 --> 01:28:58,967
I just know how to fight.

1203
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,639
Might as well be Mickey Cohen.

1204
01:29:05,879 --> 01:29:07,471
You're a good man, John.

1205
01:29:08,482 --> 01:29:10,780
You might even be a fucking angel.

1206
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:19,989
Either way you're a hero.

1207
01:29:21,929 --> 01:29:26,127
You lose everything and
you win the war...

1208
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,598
...you're a hero.

1209
01:29:29,738 --> 01:29:33,105
You lose everything and
you lose the war...

1210
01:29:38,513 --> 01:29:40,105
...you're just a fool.

1211
01:30:09,211 --> 01:30:11,406
I've been looking for
you everywhere.

1212
01:30:15,117 --> 01:30:16,209
Gracie.

1213
01:30:19,188 --> 01:30:21,850
-I heard about Jack and I
just thought.... -I know.

1214
01:30:26,495 --> 01:30:27,928
Jack saved my life.

1215
01:30:28,731 --> 01:30:30,221
He fought like hell.

1216
01:30:31,367 --> 01:30:33,130
What are you doing here?

1217
01:30:34,737 --> 01:30:36,500
I saw Cohen kill him.

1218
01:30:37,173 --> 01:30:39,903
Well, that's all the more reason
for you to get out of here.

1219
01:30:40,076 --> 01:30:41,407
No, I'm a witness.

1220
01:30:41,577 --> 01:30:43,568
-Gracie. Listen to me--
-I'm a witness.

1221
01:30:43,747 --> 01:30:45,647
I'm your witness, Jerry.

1222
01:30:48,018 --> 01:30:49,315
Gracie.

1223
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:51,052
Let me.

1224
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:04,526
Excuse me. Do I know you?

1225
01:31:04,701 --> 01:31:05,998
Need a favor, judge.

1226
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,195
See, we've been bugging Cohen's house
for a while now.

1227
01:31:09,372 --> 01:31:13,069
Which I understand is illegal
and inadmissible in court.

1228
01:31:13,243 --> 01:31:15,837
But we don't think the papers
are gonna be so choosy.

1229
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:19,379
Mickey's boys get pinched, you cut
them loose, he pays you in whores.

1230
01:31:19,549 --> 01:31:21,608
-That sound familiar?
-What do you want?

1231
01:31:21,785 --> 01:31:23,617
You're gonna retire, judge.

1232
01:31:23,788 --> 01:31:25,983
But before you do, just this once...

1233
01:31:26,524 --> 01:31:28,424
...you're gonna do something right.

1234
01:31:29,861 --> 01:31:30,850
Sign it.

1235
01:31:31,429 --> 01:31:32,987
Come on, sign it.

1236
01:31:36,067 --> 01:31:38,558
I hope you boys know
what you're getting into.

1237
01:31:39,437 --> 01:31:40,802
Where is he?

1238
01:31:41,005 --> 01:31:43,371
He's holed up at the
Park Plaza Hotel.

1239
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:47,272
Rented out every room in the place
and it's a fortress.

1240
01:31:47,445 --> 01:31:49,310
You'll never get him out of there.

1241
01:31:52,283 --> 01:31:54,080
Tomorrow, they'll take my badge.

1242
01:31:55,052 --> 01:31:56,713
Tonight, I'm still a cop.

1243
01:31:57,655 --> 01:32:01,592
I have here an arrest warrant for
Mickey Cohen for the crime of murder.

1244
01:32:03,462 --> 01:32:04,929
I'm bringing him in.

1245
01:32:05,297 --> 01:32:07,595
Think I'll tag along
if you don't mind, sarge.

1246
01:32:08,901 --> 01:32:10,766
I got no plans tonight.

1247
01:32:12,104 --> 01:32:13,093
I'm in.

1248
01:32:13,338 --> 01:32:14,600
Let's finish it.

1249
01:32:21,914 --> 01:32:24,109
# Ole buttermilk sky
I'ma telling you why

1250
01:32:24,283 --> 01:32:27,775
# Now you know
Keep it in mind tonight

1251
01:32:27,953 --> 01:32:31,753
I just got off the phone with Judge Carter.
He says he signed the warrant himself.

1252
01:32:31,924 --> 01:32:33,482
Who's gonna serve it?

1253
01:32:33,659 --> 01:32:35,559
Five guys? Forget it.

1254
01:32:36,261 --> 01:32:37,956
They'll never get through the lobby.

1255
01:32:49,843 --> 01:32:51,310
-Beat it.
-Get inside.

1256
01:32:58,151 --> 01:33:00,813
Think I'll dance with the one
what brung me.

1257
01:33:04,824 --> 01:33:06,348
Mickey Cohen...

1258
01:33:07,227 --> 01:33:11,357
...this is Sergeant John O'Mara of the
Los Angeles Police Department.

1259
01:33:11,831 --> 01:33:13,594
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1260
01:33:14,234 --> 01:33:19,036
Come out quietly with your hands up
and you will not be harmed.

1261
01:33:20,241 --> 01:33:23,472
Mickey Cohen,
this is your final warning.

1262
01:33:23,644 --> 01:33:25,737
I like having only one fork.

1263
01:33:26,881 --> 01:33:29,042
You never make the wrong decision.

1264
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:30,739
Fucking had it.

1265
01:33:30,918 --> 01:33:33,716
All right, Cohen, time's up!
We're coming in!

1266
01:33:34,488 --> 01:33:36,046
We got a better idea, coppers.

1267
01:33:36,223 --> 01:33:37,747
Why don't you take your guns...

1268
01:33:37,925 --> 01:33:40,052
...and shove them up your asses.

1269
01:33:41,395 --> 01:33:42,987
You call it, sarge.

1270
01:33:45,399 --> 01:33:46,388
Light them up!

1271
01:33:52,172 --> 01:33:54,037
Dirty stinking copper!

1272
01:33:54,275 --> 01:33:55,766
-Where you hiding?
-Clear!

1273
01:33:56,745 --> 01:33:58,337
Unh!

1274
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:02,076
Cover me!

1275
01:34:49,966 --> 01:34:51,831
We gotta take out that gun!

1276
01:34:53,602 --> 01:34:54,626
Watch this, hoss!

1277
01:35:38,849 --> 01:35:40,373
I'm out!

1278
01:36:14,552 --> 01:36:18,044
Elmer's got a plane waiting in Burbank,
but we need to leave now, Mick.

1279
01:36:20,491 --> 01:36:22,220
Can I get my tie on?

1280
01:36:23,928 --> 01:36:27,729
Want my fucking tie straight,
I'm gonna go out there in fucking public.

1281
01:36:28,567 --> 01:36:29,829
You all right?

1282
01:36:30,002 --> 01:36:31,367
I'm all right.

1283
01:36:32,171 --> 01:36:33,866
-Hold on.
-Unh.

1284
01:36:35,407 --> 01:36:37,500
Go get that son of a bitch.

1285
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:54,719
That you, O'Mara?

1286
01:36:54,893 --> 01:36:56,622
That's right, coward!

1287
01:36:56,829 --> 01:36:58,353
Come and get it, Cohen.

1288
01:37:00,265 --> 01:37:02,426
Here comes Santy Claus.

1289
01:37:39,606 --> 01:37:41,597
Get the car! Get the car!

1290
01:37:52,753 --> 01:37:54,380
Unh!

1291
01:38:05,466 --> 01:38:06,956
Harris, help me out!

1292
01:38:19,313 --> 01:38:20,780
Come on, let's go!

1293
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,315
Come on! Drive faster!

1294
01:38:29,991 --> 01:38:31,515
Son of a bitch.

1295
01:38:43,638 --> 01:38:45,037
Aah!

1296
01:38:56,685 --> 01:39:00,052
Navidad, come over here
and help me aim.

1297
01:39:07,063 --> 01:39:10,226
Remember, not where
the son of a bitch is, goddamn it.

1298
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:12,094
Where he's gonna be.

1299
01:39:33,623 --> 01:39:35,386
That's my boy.

1300
01:39:50,207 --> 01:39:51,435
Mickey Cohen...

1301
01:39:52,109 --> 01:39:55,806
...you're under arrest for the murder
of Jack Whalen.

1302
01:39:59,283 --> 01:40:01,774
All right, lawman, take me in.

1303
01:40:02,519 --> 01:40:03,577
Come on.

1304
01:40:11,928 --> 01:40:14,123
-Wanna dance?
-Yeah.

1305
01:40:14,298 --> 01:40:16,129
All right, come on.

1306
01:40:28,046 --> 01:40:29,240
You're an interrupter.

1307
01:40:29,981 --> 01:40:32,108
An interrupter of progress.

1308
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:34,611
I'm progress, see?

1309
01:41:01,146 --> 01:41:02,170
Come on.

1310
01:41:27,306 --> 01:41:28,705
Get up! Get up!

1311
01:41:30,509 --> 01:41:32,534
Come on. Come on.

1312
01:41:49,362 --> 01:41:50,659
That's Mickey Cohen.

1313
01:42:03,209 --> 01:42:04,699
Take him away.

1314
01:42:07,947 --> 01:42:08,936
All right, let's go.

1315
01:42:15,089 --> 01:42:17,523
<i>Every man carries a badge.</i>

1316
01:42:17,691 --> 01:42:20,956
<i>Mickey Cohen pledged allegiance
to his own power.</i>

1317
01:42:21,162 --> 01:42:24,427
<i>Violence was his
means and his end.</i>

1318
01:42:25,099 --> 01:42:29,695
<i> When he was sent to Alcatraz, friends of
Jack Whalen welcomed him with a lead pipe.</i>

1319
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:37,404
<i> Parker stayed on as chief of police
until his death in 1966.</i>

1320
01:42:37,745 --> 01:42:40,305
He got credit for Cohen's downfall.

1321
01:42:40,581 --> 01:42:43,209
<i>No one ever spoke of
the Gangster Squad.</i>

1322
01:42:44,318 --> 01:42:49,688
<i>The reign of the gangster Mickey Cohen
in Los Angeles is at an end.</i>

1323
01:42:49,957 --> 01:42:51,926
<i>Parker deserved the praise.</i>

1324
01:42:52,093 --> 01:42:55,460
<i>In tough times, he'd kept his oath
to protect and serve...</i>

1325
01:42:56,198 --> 01:42:59,656
<i>...just like the thousands who walk
their beats every day.</i>

1326
01:42:59,835 --> 01:43:01,496
<i>Maybe without glory...</i>

1327
01:43:01,703 --> 01:43:03,330
<i>...but with pride and honor.</i>

1328
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:08,469
<i>We brought Cohen in, but it was
Grace's testimony that put him away.</i>

1329
01:43:09,244 --> 01:43:12,907
<i>After the trial, she held on to Jerry
and wouldn't let go.</i>

1330
01:43:13,348 --> 01:43:17,444
<i>Jerry always threatened to leave
the force, but he never did.</i>

1331
01:43:17,853 --> 01:43:21,619
<i>I guess he couldn 't shake
the call of duty that echoed in his ears.</i>

1332
01:43:23,258 --> 01:43:27,490
<i>Every man carries a badge,
and this was mine.</i>

1333
01:43:28,431 --> 01:43:30,524
<i>But it was time
to put it away.</i>

1334
01:43:31,968 --> 01:43:35,267
<i>The mob has never had
a foothold in Los Angeles.</i>

1335
01:43:35,438 --> 01:43:38,168
<i>I'd like to think I played
a small role in that.</i>

1336
01:43:39,475 --> 01:43:43,605
<i>I may not be in the line of fire anymore,
but I still love my town.</i>

1337
01:43:45,014 --> 01:43:46,879
<i>It's not paradise...</i>

1338
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:49,113
<i>...but it is the City of Angels.</i>
