1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,271
We've got two tons of potatoes.

2
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,616
Tom!

3
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:53,174
I'll drink to that.

4
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:10,932
Did you know the subject,
Thomas Grunemann?

5
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,949
- Yes.
- Very well.

6
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:15,829
He was my best friend.

7
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:18,516
We grew up together.

8
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:21,812
Can you account for his
disappearance in anyway?

9
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:24,821
- Mrs. Grunemann?
- No.

10
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,707
Did he recently appear to be agitated
or depressed in any way?

11
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:31,955
No.

12
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,084
Mr. Cable, at the plant...

13
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,659
...did he voice any grievance
or discontent about his work there?

14
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:42,226
Not at all.

15
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,427
As a matter of fact, Tom operated best
when he was under pressure.

16
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:48,147
Please forgive me, Mrs. Grunemann,
but I have to ask.

17
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:50,738
Did your husband ever show...

18
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,897
...any moral or sexual problems
or peculiarities?

19
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,305
No.

20
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,026
Any marital problems in general, that is?

21
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:01,008
We were very happy.

22
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:05,841
Did he ever mention specifically,
a girl or a woman in New York City?

23
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:07,665
No.

24
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:10,416
- No.
- Why?

25
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,744
We recovered in his desk at the plant...

26
00:02:13,777 --> 00:02:16,176
...in one of the drawers...

27
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:19,343
...a typewritten letter
that was evidently written...

28
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:21,648
...on the Friday before he disappeared.

29
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:26,735
It was written to a girl in New York City...

30
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:28,847
...and we contacted the police.

31
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:31,023
They brought her in, questioned her...

32
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:34,415
...and she said that she had received
six or seven letters of this kind.

33
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:35,662
Can I see it?

34
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:40,495
Well, it's an obscene letter,
Mrs. Grunemann.

35
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:43,853
I would like to see it.

36
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,934
I would like you to remember that
it was written by a very disturbed man.

37
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:56,781
I don't believe it.

38
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,516
I'd like you to know that situations
of this kind are not unique.

39
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:13,100
A man will lead a double life.

40
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:17,387
A Jekyll-and-Hyde existence
and his wife has no idea what's going on.

41
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,417
Has anybody...

42
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,809
... talked to you about
the financial arrangements?

43
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,457
Well, that depends, naturally,
on how long you want me for...

44
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:55,369
... and what you want to do.

45
00:03:58,728 --> 00:03:59,976
I know you.

46
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:02,536
It will be very nice.

47
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,600
I'd like to spend the evening
with you if it's...

48
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:08,872
If you'd like that.

49
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:13,255
Have you ever been with a woman before?
Paying her?

50
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,207
Do you like it?

51
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:19,367
I mean, I have the feeling that
that turns you on very particularly.

52
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:22,567
What turns me on is because I have...

53
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:25,126
... a good imagination and I like...

54
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:26,855
... pleasing.

55
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:30,213
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?

56
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,766
I think in the confines of one's house,
one should be...

57
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,093
... free of clothing and inhibitions.

58
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:41,413
Inhibitions are always nice
because they're so nice to overcome.

59
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:45,445
Don't be afraid. I'm not.

60
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,468
As long as you don't hurt me
more than I like to be hurt...

61
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,692
... I will do anything you ask.

62
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:58,051
You should never be ashamed
of things like that. You mustn't be.

63
00:04:58,116 --> 00:05:01,763
You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.

64
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,507
I think the only way
that any of us can ever be happy...

65
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:08,548
... is to let it all hang out.

66
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:11,331
You know, do it all and fuck it!

67
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:17,283
All right.

68
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,330
Would you stand up, please?

69
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,410
- Hello.
- Hi.

70
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,602
Hi, can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.

71
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,161
- Take your hat off.
- Take my hat off?

72
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:33,633
Yeah. Okay.

73
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,584
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.

74
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:38,305
Now, that's the color.

75
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,576
The coloring is great. I don't know.

76
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,968
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.

77
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:46,241
Hello. Can I see your hands?

78
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,952
- Thank you.
- She's got funny hands.

79
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:54,591
- Hi.
- She is great.

80
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,998
- Beautiful eyes.
- Yes.

81
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:59,231
- All right. That's the coloring.
- Yeah, let me see you smile.

82
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:03,007
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great. But I've seen you before.

83
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,087
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?

84
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,687
- Yes, I have.
- You have?

85
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,919
- How do they send people with a conflict?
- It's got to be a new face.

86
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,166
Call that agency.

87
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,662
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.

88
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:16,285
- C minus.
- C minus.

89
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,740
- Got to find her today.
- That's it. Thank you, ladies.

90
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,405
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

91
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:32,988
I'm exhausted.

92
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,484
One more day of this and I'll plop.

93
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:38,908
- Hello.
- Hi.

94
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:41,212
Just have a seat, please.

95
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,620
It's been six months. Tom Grunemann
has been missing for half a year.

96
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:51,867
And all the FBI has to offer is
a report that must bore even you.

97
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:57,402
There are thousands of honest, decent men
who simply disappear every year.

98
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:01,434
Neither Mrs. Grunemann
nor I are willing to just dismiss this case.

99
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:05,786
And therefore we feel entitled
to investigate on our own.

100
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:08,761
You're entitled.
There are some very competent...

101
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,961
John Klute offered us his services,
and we've accepted.

102
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:15,769
Klute knew Tom,
and he has many ideas about the case.

103
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,808
Have you ever done
missing persons work before?

104
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:19,865
No.

105
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:23,385
- Have you spent any time in the city?
- No.

106
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,272
Well, speaking frankly...

107
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:27,736
You're wondering why
we thought of Klute?

108
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,857
Frankly...

109
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,128
...he's interested.

110
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,048
And he cares.

111
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:38,071
Why didn't you ever find out
anything from that girl?

112
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,599
We held her under surveillance...

113
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:43,703
...expecting your boy Grunemann
to show up there.

114
00:07:44,216 --> 00:07:45,143
He didn't.

115
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:48,118
We arrested her
on a C.P. Charge. Convicted.

116
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:49,910
Two months women's city prison.

117
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,854
Offered to reduce sentence.
She cooperated.

118
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:56,438
She thought she remembered him
from those letters from before.

119
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:58,038
She made that connection.

120
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,717
But she hadn't seen him since then
and couldn't identify his photograph.

121
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:05,781
A good call girl,
she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.

122
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:07,925
Faces get blurred.

123
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,029
And since then,
she's reported several incidents...

124
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:13,813
... like breather calls,
anonymous phone calls.

125
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:17,012
Also, somebody may be following her,
watching her.

126
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,484
Things like that.

127
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:22,101
So I guess it's conceivable
that Grunemann's still around there.

128
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,573
Still bugging her.

129
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:25,588
Hey, Trina! Bree.

130
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:30,803
Listen, I could use a quick $50.
You got a commuter for me?

131
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,595
Terrific.

132
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:37,810
Right.

133
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:42,034
Terrific. Yeah. 'Bye.

134
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,400
Hi. I'm Bree.

135
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,353
Yeah. Come in, please.

136
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:13,233
I'm glad to know you, Bree.

137
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:17,584
I'm glad you could come. Sit down, please.

138
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:23,983
Where are you from?

139
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:25,871
Can I get you a drink?

140
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:28,430
Yeah, I'd like a ginger ale. Thank you.

141
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:30,095
I'm from Chicago.

142
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:32,750
You come to New York often?

143
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:36,142
No, I don't come to New York too often.

144
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,334
- Too bad.
- Three times a year maybe.

145
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,029
What kind of party did you have in mind?

146
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:02,028
We could have
a nice half-and-half party for $50.

147
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,325
We could have a good time for $50.

148
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:09,035
Or if you wanted something extra,
it would be a little more.

149
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:17,707
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...

150
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,147
Tell me what you want.

151
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:26,443
Tell me what you want.

152
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:34,378
That sounds fantastic.

153
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,898
That's so exciting.

154
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,394
But it's going to cost you more.

155
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:42,728
That's fantastic.

156
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:45,737
That's going to be $100.

157
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:49,256
- Sure, fine.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,945
- Yes, very good.
- $100.

159
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:53,256
Very good.

160
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:56,168
I like to get business done
at the beginning.

161
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:59,240
That way we don't have to think about it,
then we can...

162
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,120
...just have a good time.

163
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,158
I like your mind.

164
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:06,824
Yes.

165
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:07,879
So.

166
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:12,583
Chicago.

167
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:29,541
This is the bed?

168
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:32,677
This is the bed.

169
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:35,813
Very nice.

170
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:01,059
There's the bed in operating position.

171
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:13,667
You're so nice.

172
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,010
Come here.

173
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:30,848
Angel. My angel!

174
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:36,439
"We gather together

175
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:39,223
"to ask the Lord's blessing

176
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,206
"He hastens

177
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:45,270
"and chastens his wisdom divine

178
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:49,237
"and from the beginning

179
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:52,437
"the fight we were winning

180
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:57,877
"Lord, be at our side...

181
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,685
"divine"

182
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:17,268
It's 12:00 a.m.
This is Jim Donnelly, WNEW News.

183
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:22,132
Con Edison has again resorted to a cutback
in voltage to conserve generating capacity.

184
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,051
At three percent...

185
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:44,242
Hello?

186
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,665
Hello?

187
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:43,400
- Who is it?
- Miss Daniel, my name is Klute.

188
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,217
John Klute. And I'd like to talk to you.

189
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:49,032
- What do you want?
- My name is John Klute.

190
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:52,103
You said that.

191
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you
some questions about Tom Grunemann.

192
00:17:56,872 --> 00:17:58,535
- Who?
- Tom Grunemann.

193
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:00,616
He wrote you some letters.

194
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:01,351
Wow.

195
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:05,990
He was a research engineer at
the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania.

196
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,647
He disappeared from there last December.

197
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:11,430
- I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?

198
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:15,174
You know what I'm talking about,
Miss Daniel.

199
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:16,614
Honest.

200
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,462
Can I ask you some questions please?

201
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,918
Do you have any identification?

202
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:33,988
You're not a cop? You're not FBI?

203
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,412
You're a private detective?

204
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:40,580
And you just want
to ask me some questions?

205
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,258
- They're not very recent. That's last year.
- They're quite good.

206
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:23,777
What have you done that I might have seen
on Broadway or off-Broadway?

207
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:28,097
- Well, I study with George Tainter.
- George? George is very good.

208
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:29,760
He's a good man to begin with.

209
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:32,256
I've been in two of his productions.

210
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,912
- Two of his workshop productions.
- Workshop.

211
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,216
Well, they're very nice.

212
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,256
How do you feel about being an actress?

213
00:19:40,448 --> 00:19:43,583
- I like it very much.
- You think you know yourself?

214
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:48,543
- As much as anybody.
- Do you really know yourself?

215
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:49,982
- No.
- That's very important.

216
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:52,894
- I forget myself when I act.
- You can't forget yourself.

217
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,094
You have to know yourself
and kind of like yourself.

218
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:58,527
You have to relate. Relate to people.

219
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:01,118
I had an identity crisis
two years ago and since then...

220
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:03,294
...I've been working to know myself.

221
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,021
That's very important.

222
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:06,653
Don't hide your face.

223
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:10,941
You have a nice face, you shouldn't hide it.
Excuse me just a second.

224
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:17,213
Julian? Yes, okay, send her in.

225
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:18,812
Well, I'm very busy.

226
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:23,196
Thank you for stopping by.
If you're in anything off-off-Broadway...

227
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:26,812
How are you today?

228
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:30,300
I won't be able to come back anymore.

229
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:31,707
I'm sorry.

230
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:35,259
Because I just can't afford it.

231
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,139
Did I fail you, Bree?

232
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:41,562
I come here all the time,
I pay you all this money...

233
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,442
...and why do I still want to trick?
Why do I still...

234
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:47,739
...walk by a phone
and want to pick up the phone and call?

235
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,297
Did you think I had some magic potion?

236
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,457
You'd come in and tell me your problem
and I would just take it away?

237
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:57,466
What's the difference
between going on a call...

238
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,737
...as a model or an actress, as a call girl?

239
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,529
You're successful as a call girl...

240
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,569
Because when you're a call girl
you control it, that's why.

241
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:07,641
Because someone wants you.

242
00:21:09,273 --> 00:21:10,456
Not me.

243
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:14,200
I mean, there are some johns that I have
regularly that want me...

244
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:15,959
...and that's terrific.

245
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,817
But they want a woman...

246
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:20,249
...and I know I'm good.

247
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,440
I arrive at their hotel or their apartment...

248
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:31,222
...and they're usually nervous,
which is fine, because I'm not.

249
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,886
I know what I'm doing.

250
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:36,854
For an hour...

251
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,917
...I'm the best actress in the world.

252
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:43,541
I'm the best fuck in the world. And...

253
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,262
Why did you say
you're the best actress in the world?

254
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:48,342
- At that time?
- Because it's an act.

255
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:49,654
That's what's nice about it.

256
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:52,566
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to...

257
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:57,013
...care about anything.
You don't have to like anybody.

258
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:01,973
You just...

259
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:07,573
...lead them by the ring in their nose
in the direction they think they want to go.

260
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:12,212
You get a lot of money out of them
in as short period of time as possible.

261
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:16,051
You control it and you call the shots...

262
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,708
...and I always feel just great afterwards.

263
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:22,003
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.

264
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:23,730
Why not?

265
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:26,802
You say there's nothing wrong.
Why not? You said...

266
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:30,355
There's a difference. I don't think
there's anything wrong with it...

267
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:32,818
...morally. I didn't enjoy it physically.

268
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:38,002
I came to enjoy it
because it made me feel good.

269
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:42,258
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.

270
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:43,889
It made me feel...

271
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:52,368
...that I had some control over myself,
that I had some control over my life.

272
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,248
That I could determine things for myself.

273
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:57,713
I don't know.

274
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,633
I don't know why I'm here.

275
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:03,536
It's just so silly to think that
somebody else can help anybody, isn't it?

276
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:13,360
I could come over tonight. Are you alone?

277
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,431
In about an hour.

278
00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:19,567
Okay. See you in an hour.

279
00:24:20,778 --> 00:24:21,834
Bree.

280
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:32,841
You look beautiful.

281
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:34,440
Thank you.

282
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:41,640
Enjoy.

283
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:48,456
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.

284
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:52,232
I've just got back from Cannes, you know.

285
00:24:52,808 --> 00:24:53,799
And I...

286
00:24:56,807 --> 00:24:57,766
Well...

287
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,607
...I have something
rather exciting to tell you.

288
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:02,662
Yes?

289
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,695
Cannes was very amusing.

290
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,541
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.

291
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:14,437
A very nice little Italian marquis
was rather enthusiastic about me.

292
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:19,397
But a young man can be so silly.

293
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,317
Then one night...

294
00:25:26,854 --> 00:25:28,741
...at the gambling tables...

295
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:31,716
...I saw him.

296
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:34,468
A stranger, he was looking at me.

297
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,140
He was standing very still
on the other side of the room...

298
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:42,627
...and his eyes were looking right into me.

299
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:47,268
And I knew that
for the first time in my life...

300
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:52,259
Please.

301
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:57,698
Not young. He wasn't young.

302
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:00,769
He had gray sideburns.

303
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,450
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?

304
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:10,977
No one could tell me who he was.

305
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:14,850
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?

306
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:21,472
But there was a feeling stirring inside me,
a pagan feeling.

307
00:26:25,632 --> 00:26:28,671
The next day on the beach
in my beach pavilion...

308
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:32,032
It was so warm on the sand...

309
00:26:32,864 --> 00:26:34,656
...and I saw him again.

310
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:38,207
He was staring at me.

311
00:26:41,663 --> 00:26:43,774
His eyes were burning into me.

312
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:47,551
I was helpless.

313
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:51,870
He didn't even have to say anything,
and I knew.

314
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:55,390
I knew that somehow...

315
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:02,973
You know, I've never liked young men.

316
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,869
And I knew...

317
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:11,549
...that he would awaken something in me...

318
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:15,389
...that no young man had ever awakened.

319
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,140
He was so wise...

320
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,044
...and he taught me so many things...

321
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,467
...with his hands.

322
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,746
In his eyes I felt so beautiful.

323
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:49,178
Miss Daniel.

324
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:52,697
Can I come upstairs
and ask you some questions now?

325
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:05,272
You bastard!

326
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,112
Is this the shakedown, hon?

327
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:11,672
You picked a loser. I don't have it!

328
00:28:11,736 --> 00:28:12,888
I'm looking for Tom...

329
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:16,056
You think I'd live in this kip
if I were taking calls full-time?

330
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:19,511
- I'd be back on Park Avenue.
- Can I ask you some questions?

331
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:23,800
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig,
you mean?

332
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,444
Have a seat.

333
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:58,484
Would you like some wine?

334
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:00,885
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.

335
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:04,660
There isn't any beer anyway.

336
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:13,012
I've already told the police
everything I know.

337
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:15,379
I don't even remember the schlub!

338
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,611
They showed me that already.

339
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:26,353
I understand this is Grunemann.
I told them, I don't remember.

340
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,242
Family-type man. It figures.

341
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,737
Look...

342
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:42,513
...will you please just try
to get it from my side?

343
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:45,169
A year ago...

344
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:48,177
...I was in the life full-time.

345
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:50,416
Living on Park Avenue.

346
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:54,289
This very nice apartment, leather furniture.

347
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:58,448
And then the cops dropped on me.
They caged me.

348
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:01,519
Started asking me about a guy
that I'm supposed to have seen...

349
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,175
...a year before that! Two years ago!

350
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:06,735
He could be in Yemen!

351
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:11,759
Grunemann, what does that mean?
It's a name, I don't know him!

352
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:15,663
And they start showing me these pictures,
and they don't mean anything to me.

353
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:18,543
Then they started asking me
if I'd been getting letters...

354
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:20,494
...from some guy out in Cabbageville.

355
00:30:20,526 --> 00:30:21,806
Tuscarora.

356
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,966
Yeah, all right, I had been.

357
00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:28,718
Very sick letters.

358
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,557
So they said, "Well, that's, Grunemann.

359
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:35,372
"So would you please
tell us when you and he..."

360
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:40,877
Well, there was a guy once. A freak.

361
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,052
Could've been him.

362
00:30:43,117 --> 00:30:45,932
Apparently Grunemann liked
to beat up on girls.

363
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:49,708
Well, this guy hired me
and then he tried to kill me...

364
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:52,011
...and that was about two years ago.

365
00:30:52,236 --> 00:30:55,595
Tommy, allie allie in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.

366
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,210
You remind me of my uncle.

367
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:08,234
What else do you remember
about the man who beat you up?

368
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:09,674
Nothing.

369
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,002
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.

370
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:15,562
See, usually it's a fake out.

371
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,929
You probably know about that.

372
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:23,016
They pretend to tie you up and whip you
while you wear a dress with a cloth belt.

373
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:25,225
Hell, it's their money, I don't care.

374
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:27,753
I'll swing from a shower rod
and whistle Maytime.

375
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,857
Except this guy really freaked out on it.

376
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:34,696
But you cannot identify this man
as Tom Grunemann?

377
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:36,905
I can't identify him as anybody!

378
00:31:40,552 --> 00:31:43,239
So, is that it?

379
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,191
Listen...

380
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,440
...why don't you go downstairs...

381
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,150
You have such a nice mouth.
...and get those tapes?

382
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:02,311
Bring them back up here
and we'll have a party...

383
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:05,413
...you and I.
- Wouldn't that be nice?

384
00:32:08,518 --> 00:32:11,589
What about afterwards,
the telephone calls?

385
00:32:12,326 --> 00:32:14,085
Just phone calls, right?

386
00:32:15,078 --> 00:32:18,149
What is it? The phone rings,
you answer it, there's no one there.

387
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:20,549
Kids having fun,
burglars finding empty apartments.

388
00:32:20,645 --> 00:32:23,204
It happens all the time.
It doesn't mean anything.

389
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:25,668
But you reported
that you had been followed.

390
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:27,588
Look, I'm sorry.

391
00:32:27,685 --> 00:32:28,804
I've been...

392
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:32,068
...leading everybody astray. It doesn't...

393
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:37,188
Okay, I get these feelings,
but they're just feelings. That's just me.

394
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:44,611
I'm sure you'll find this amusing,
but I'm afraid of the dark.

395
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,106
Sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people and hear things.

396
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,370
I go out in the morning and
I think somebody's opened my mailbox.

397
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:58,882
If there's trash in front of my door
I think somebody's trying to freak me out.

398
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:03,553
It's just nerves. I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.

399
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,873
Bree Daniel.

400
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,305
How is Ted? Yes.

401
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,359
Thank you. Thank you very much.

402
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,224
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?

403
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,479
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.

404
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,702
I'm having a conversation
with a very nice cop.

405
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:48,126
He's not a cop actually, he's a private...

406
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:58,333
Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to somebody.

407
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,029
Most of them, yes.

408
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:03,229
And that's how you met
the man who beat you up?

409
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:05,469
I don't remember.
It was two years ago. God!

410
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:08,029
How else do you get dates then, pimps?

411
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:11,676
You're very square, cookie.

412
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:15,260
No, pimps don't get dates for you,
they just take your money.

413
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,907
The police have given me a list of names.

414
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:23,484
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?

415
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:27,035
I'm sure this is going to amuse you, too.

416
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:29,627
But I'm really trying
to get away from all that.

417
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,995
What about this evening, the old man?

418
00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:34,747
You saw that?

419
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,346
Goddamn you!

420
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:39,418
He's 70 years old!

421
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:43,705
His wife's dead.
He's cut garments since he was 14.

422
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:47,130
He's maybe in his whole life
had one week vacation and I'm all he's got!

423
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:49,273
He never lays a hand on me!

424
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:51,417
What harm is there in that?

425
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:54,777
What's your bag, Klute?

426
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:58,201
What do you like? You a talker?
A button freak?

427
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:01,592
Like to have your chest walked around
with high-heel shoes?

428
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:04,152
- You like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.

429
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:06,904
Or do you get it off
wearing women's clothes?

430
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,271
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.

431
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:15,255
I hope this isn't going
to make my cold any worse.

432
00:35:17,111 --> 00:35:21,654
- Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.
- He was my old man. We broke up.

433
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:22,743
When?

434
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,071
- When did you break up?
- About eight months ago.

435
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:28,950
Would you mind not doing that?

436
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:31,510
What?

437
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:34,390
Okay?

438
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:40,853
Well, I thought I could trade you
for those tapes.

439
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:45,141
Doesn't it get Ionely down there
in your little room?

440
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:49,429
Maybe I could bring some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.

441
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:50,933
No, thank you.

442
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:54,740
Men have paid $200 for me
and here you are turning down a freebie.

443
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,467
You could get
a perfectly good dishwasher for that.

444
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:13,939
What are you doing with my keys?

445
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:15,443
Give me your hand.

446
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,098
I knew it.

447
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:35,345
Don't be afraid.

448
00:36:36,466 --> 00:36:38,449
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.

449
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:41,265
There's someone on the roof.

450
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:45,264
Sit.

451
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:47,537
Sit!

452
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:55,238
Tom?

453
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,205
Tom?

454
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:35,811
- You didn't get him?
- No.

455
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:39,108
Was it Grunemann?

456
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:41,027
I didn't see him.

457
00:39:45,538 --> 00:39:47,457
Who sent you on that date?

458
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,633
Frankie Ligourin.

459
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:59,362
You and I will go talk
to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.

460
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,159
Don't be afraid. I'm not.

461
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:42,397
Would you like me to hold you?

462
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,686
I'm just trying to figure you out.

463
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,973
I may say not many people
have been very successful at that.

464
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:55,933
That's all right. I'll figure you out
before the evening is over.

465
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:00,188
I hope you do,
and in a way, I hope you don't.

466
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:06,683
The only responsibility you have to me
is to enjoy yourself.

467
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:11,164
Inhibitions are always nice
because they're so nice to overcome.

468
00:41:11,484 --> 00:41:14,715
- Because I'm very bad, you know.
- In what way? How are you bad?

469
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:17,883
In my head. I have very wicked ideas.

470
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:21,147
Lots of them.

471
00:41:21,276 --> 00:41:23,483
I'm sure that as you're sitting
at your desk...

472
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:26,491
... you've all kinds of strange things
going through your mind.

473
00:41:26,555 --> 00:41:29,403
You should never be ashamed
of things like that.

474
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,033
Nothing is wrong.

475
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:35,322
You know that I will do anything you ask.

476
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:40,602
I think the only way
that any of us can ever be happy...

477
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:43,481
... is to let it all hang out.

478
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:59,417
I was just finishing up some work.
Mocking up a few photographs.

479
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:02,616
I used to be a photographer.
Did Bree tell you?

480
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:05,080
Before I got into publishing.

481
00:42:05,144 --> 00:42:08,952
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.
He knows you were my pimp.

482
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:12,407
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?

483
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:21,270
I always respected Bree.

484
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:22,967
I'd like to make something clear.

485
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,582
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.

486
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:29,590
I don't go after a girl.

487
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:34,070
Girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?

488
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,469
I'm looking for a man, Tom Grunemann.

489
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:39,604
Miss Daniel tells me that the date
that beat her two years ago...

490
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:42,196
...might've been that man,
and you sent her on that date.

491
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:44,148
Two years ago? Sorry.

492
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:48,532
I understand you use narcotics.

493
00:42:48,629 --> 00:42:51,636
Maybe I could have someone come over
and look at your...

494
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:53,172
...arms.

495
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,299
You know, I may stand better
with the cops than you do.

496
00:42:57,972 --> 00:43:00,275
Why don't you sit down and relax?

497
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:08,787
It was a family matter.

498
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,699
Between the girls.
Had two other girls then.

499
00:43:11,987 --> 00:43:14,162
Two other girls besides Bree.

500
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:17,106
One of them, Jane McKenna...

501
00:43:18,227 --> 00:43:21,075
...she blows a little jealous of Bree.

502
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:23,698
Bree comes first.

503
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:27,601
Evidently she knew this freak
who beats up on women.

504
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:31,153
She cons me into passing him on to Bree...

505
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,457
...so Bree would get hurt.

506
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:36,304
I didn't know until afterwards.

507
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:41,137
You can't tell them one of
their own in-laws laid a freak on them.

508
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,216
Peace in the family.

509
00:43:44,465 --> 00:43:45,904
Beyond that...

510
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:48,560
...I don't know. That's all she wrote.

511
00:43:51,888 --> 00:43:53,679
Did you see the man?

512
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,311
No.

513
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,335
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?

514
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:04,334
Baby, would I be telling you all this?

515
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:06,287
She copped out long ago.

516
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,229
She committed suicide, Baxter.

517
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:14,830
And the other girl, what's her name?

518
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,069
- Arlyn?
- Page.

519
00:44:17,934 --> 00:44:19,310
How do I find her?

520
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:22,350
I don't know. She's a junkie.

521
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:27,149
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco, they just drop out.

522
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:31,501
Anything else?

523
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:38,796
Did you like my friend Frankie?

524
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:41,516
Not very much.

525
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,388
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?

526
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:48,523
You're not going to find Arlyn Page,
she's a junkie.

527
00:44:49,068 --> 00:44:51,468
Didn't he tell you
that he sent me that guy?

528
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:54,283
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.

529
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:01,098
Well, she's dead.

530
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:08,329
Your tapes.

531
00:45:09,226 --> 00:45:12,938
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls.

532
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:16,296
What for?

533
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:21,032
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.

534
00:45:22,825 --> 00:45:24,297
Tell me, Klute...

535
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:28,264
...did we get you a little?
Just a little bit? Us city folk.

536
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:31,176
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?

537
00:45:33,768 --> 00:45:35,335
All that's so pathetic.

538
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:39,495
Fuck off!

539
00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:54,534
I'll tell you something, Jack.

540
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:57,861
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.

541
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,957
Not today when they all rang,
that was nothing but jangling.

542
00:46:02,086 --> 00:46:04,453
But here, in this corner...

543
00:46:05,318 --> 00:46:08,901
...where the bells come down
from heaven and the echoes linger...

544
00:46:10,085 --> 00:46:13,893
...or in the fields where they come across
the quiet of the countryside...

545
00:46:14,373 --> 00:46:16,036
...my voices are in them.

546
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:18,500
Hark!

547
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:23,588
Do you hear?

548
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,444
"Dear child of God."

549
00:46:25,764 --> 00:46:27,619
That's just what you said.

550
00:46:28,516 --> 00:46:33,026
At the half-hour they will say,
"Be brave, go on."

551
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:38,850
At the three-quarters they will say,
"I am thy help."

552
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:42,274
When is it the hour.

553
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:44,738
When the great bell goes after:

554
00:46:44,898 --> 00:46:48,226
"God will save France."

555
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:53,218
- It is then that St. Margaret...
- Thank you very much.

556
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,650
The script please.

557
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,889
Very interesting accent.

558
00:46:58,178 --> 00:46:59,105
Booth!

559
00:47:03,745 --> 00:47:04,769
Thank you.

560
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,215
All right, so what do you want, cop?

561
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,822
- I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.
- I told you you wouldn't find her.

562
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:29,087
If I can't find her, I can't find him,
and if I can't find him...

563
00:47:29,152 --> 00:47:31,679
...then you're in trouble.
So what do you say?

564
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:35,070
Okay?

565
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:44,221
It's going to cost. Time is money.

566
00:47:45,054 --> 00:47:47,165
Okay. Well, I can pay you $100.

567
00:47:47,646 --> 00:47:51,517
- I can make $100 in a lunch break.
- $100 is all I've got.

568
00:47:52,477 --> 00:47:54,492
You were very good upstairs.

569
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:00,635
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?

570
00:48:01,852 --> 00:48:04,572
Buy you lunch. Do you want lunch?
Come on.

571
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,452
Whenever it suits you.

572
00:48:08,124 --> 00:48:09,691
No, make it...

573
00:48:10,172 --> 00:48:11,547
...Monday at 8:00 p.m.

574
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:17,051
I said Monday, 8:00 p.m.
Now don't be naughty!

575
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:23,322
He's a lovely man.

576
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:26,074
Comes here...

577
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:29,402
...spends a bundle of money,
and never even touches the girls.

578
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:33,274
Comes from Grosse Pointe,
has a big house, eight servants...

579
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:37,113
...but all he wants to do is come here
and scrub out my bathroom.

580
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:39,609
8:00 p.m., Monday...

581
00:48:40,186 --> 00:48:41,306
...Mr. Clean.

582
00:48:45,913 --> 00:48:47,320
Arlyn Page...

583
00:48:47,673 --> 00:48:49,113
...I had let her go.

584
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:52,536
With the kind of people I get...

585
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:55,480
...I couldn't have a gal
who was zonked out all the time.

586
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:58,072
You know, I get the crème de la crème.

587
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,280
No, she was trouble...

588
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:03,224
...and I don't allow any trouble here.

589
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,104
Che si può fare?

590
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:09,527
Honni soit qui mal y pense.

591
00:49:10,775 --> 00:49:13,271
Do you have any idea
where I can look for her?

592
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:16,087
Try Mama Reese's.

593
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,518
Bree...

594
00:49:19,766 --> 00:49:23,542
...if you get Ionely or have no place to go,
you come here.

595
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:26,325
You'll always have a home here.

596
00:49:37,397 --> 00:49:38,197
Why?

597
00:49:38,997 --> 00:49:40,212
She's a junkie.

598
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,084
She was with you after she left Frankie,
wasn't she?

599
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,972
Well, she's not now.

600
00:49:48,884 --> 00:49:50,868
I tried to do everything for her.

601
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,748
I took her into my own place,
my own little flat on First.

602
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:57,139
You know that sweet place?
We could of had everything together.

603
00:49:59,635 --> 00:50:01,363
Then the bitch sold my mink!

604
00:50:03,955 --> 00:50:08,242
- Do you know anybody that's seen her?
- As far as I'm concerned, she's dead!

605
00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:30,572
Who is it?

606
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,003
Bree Daniel.

607
00:51:39,052 --> 00:51:40,395
I couldn't sleep.

608
00:51:41,676 --> 00:51:43,563
I keep thinking I hear noises.

609
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,675
Can I come in?

610
00:51:50,411 --> 00:51:51,370
Come in.

611
00:52:05,258 --> 00:52:07,401
It was probably just my imagination.

612
00:52:08,746 --> 00:52:09,737
Sit down.

613
00:52:16,649 --> 00:52:18,249
I'm sorry I woke you up.

614
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:20,392
I just...

615
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:24,583
I don't think
he's going to come back again.

616
00:52:25,672 --> 00:52:28,167
I just don't want to be alone right now.

617
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:32,743
Do you mind if I stay here a while?

618
00:52:35,016 --> 00:52:39,239
- Lf you'd like to go back upstairs, I'd come...
- I'd really rather not go upstairs.

619
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:01,893
Why don't you lie down here? Sleep here.

620
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:05,669
- Where are you going to sleep?
- I'll pull that out.

621
00:53:13,061 --> 00:53:14,052
Lie down.

622
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:56,032
Thank you.

623
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:01,792
Good night.

624
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:05,344
Good night.

625
00:55:39,642 --> 00:55:41,018
What's the matter?

626
00:55:43,193 --> 00:55:44,537
You were terrific.

627
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,120
A real tiger.

628
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:00,631
Are you upset
because you didn't make me come?

629
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,511
I never come with a john.

630
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:12,150
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue,
I sort of knew you would.

631
00:56:13,366 --> 00:56:15,125
Everybody always does.

632
00:56:27,413 --> 00:56:30,388
Arlyn Page?
Yes, she was with me about three months.

633
00:56:30,613 --> 00:56:32,692
She was lucky I kept her that long.

634
00:56:33,045 --> 00:56:34,676
She was out of it.

635
00:56:35,253 --> 00:56:38,965
Somebody said she was streetwalking
over on Lexington Avenue.

636
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:41,972
Or was it Eighth? You might take a look.

637
00:56:43,157 --> 00:56:45,492
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.

638
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:51,059
Yes, she used to dress the way you do.

639
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:55,027
The whore? Yes, I threw her out.

640
00:56:56,852 --> 00:56:59,027
Do you know where she went from here?

641
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:01,458
Live like animals, her and the man.

642
00:57:02,067 --> 00:57:03,026
Out!

643
00:57:03,571 --> 00:57:05,394
She was living with a man?

644
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:07,314
He was worse than the whore!

645
00:57:39,312 --> 00:57:40,240
Cappy!

646
00:57:40,912 --> 00:57:42,991
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree!

647
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:44,367
Cappy, is that you?

648
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,574
- It's all right.
- Cappy, we got a radio...

649
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:49,647
Arlyn, it's okay.

650
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:55,407
Bree, honey...

651
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:57,550
...I'm waiting for someone.

652
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:00,430
You've got to help us.

653
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:05,069
Can't you see I'm strung out?

654
00:58:05,486 --> 00:58:07,597
It'll only take you a couple of minutes.

655
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:10,732
A couple years ago,
Jane sent me a guy that beat me.

656
00:58:10,766 --> 00:58:12,653
If he sees you, he won't come.

657
00:58:12,782 --> 00:58:16,237
Was she seeing a freak,
one of her regular johns? Was he a freak?

658
00:58:16,686 --> 00:58:18,157
Yes. What about it?

659
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:20,684
Did he come around a lot?

660
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:32,363
No, he was an older guy.

661
00:58:32,428 --> 00:58:33,515
It's very important.

662
00:58:33,612 --> 00:58:36,138
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you!

663
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,122
It's very important, please.

664
00:58:38,156 --> 00:58:40,779
- Can you give me a description of him?
- Cappy?

665
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:45,642
- Cappy, listen. No!
- Cappy, don't run!

666
00:58:45,707 --> 00:58:48,586
Cappy, don't run! I've got a radio, Cappy!

667
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,471
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow.
A narcotics addict.

668
01:03:04,663 --> 01:03:07,158
I believed her. I believed her absolutely.

669
01:03:07,703 --> 01:03:10,102
The man who did those beatings
was not Tom Grunemann.

670
01:03:10,135 --> 01:03:12,502
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?

671
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:16,438
Tom is still connected because of
the letters, whether he wrote them or not.

672
01:03:17,142 --> 01:03:21,237
The only way that I'm going to find him
is to find the man who did do the beatings.

673
01:03:21,302 --> 01:03:24,084
The only way I'm going to find him
is to pursue Arlyn Page...

674
01:03:24,182 --> 01:03:27,861
...and try to secure
from her some kind of identification.

675
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:33,300
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania on Friday
and I'll fill them in on things.

676
01:03:33,365 --> 01:03:34,837
How is it back there?

677
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,612
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.

678
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,340
John, I want to tell you how much
I respect your dedication. Thank you.

679
01:04:02,642 --> 01:04:06,066
Because I'm very bad, you know.
I have very wicked ideas.

680
01:04:06,226 --> 01:04:10,514
As you're sitting at your desk you have
strange things running through your mind.

681
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,746
You should never be ashamed
of things like that.

682
01:04:13,778 --> 01:04:15,537
Nothing is wrong.

683
01:04:16,785 --> 01:04:18,929
Do you mind if I take my sweater off?

684
01:04:20,114 --> 01:04:23,281
I like to sort of walk around here
with no clothes on.

685
01:04:23,377 --> 01:04:26,032
I think people wear clothes much too often,
don't you?

686
01:04:26,097 --> 01:04:28,689
I think in the confines of one's house,
one should be...

687
01:04:28,753 --> 01:04:31,568
... free of clothing and inhibitions.

688
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:37,295
I think the only way
that any of us can ever be happy...

689
01:04:38,192 --> 01:04:41,359
... is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!

690
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,034
I was trying to get away from...

691
01:07:25,698 --> 01:07:27,586
...a world...

692
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:32,258
...that I had known, because I don't think
it was very good for me, and...

693
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:34,530
...I found myself...

694
01:07:38,242 --> 01:07:39,778
...Iooking up its ass...

695
01:07:43,362 --> 01:07:47,617
...and seeing people that I used to know...

696
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:54,496
...and that I liked a lot...

697
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:01,727
...that were my friends.

698
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:07,071
Sort of.

699
01:08:07,903 --> 01:08:08,991
Girls...

700
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,519
...and...

701
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,438
...that could have been me.

702
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:28,157
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.

703
01:08:32,957 --> 01:08:34,812
I guess I just realized...

704
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,964
...that I don't really give a damn.

705
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:52,699
What I would really like to do
is be faceless and bodiless...

706
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:56,699
... and be...

707
01:08:57,116 --> 01:08:58,427
... left alone.

708
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:03,514
You're lucky they're still here.

709
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:07,962
We don't keep unclaimed possessions
in suicide cases more than a year.

710
01:09:13,114 --> 01:09:15,226
Number 497.

711
01:09:22,009 --> 01:09:23,385
Jane McKenna.

712
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:13,622
I thought there would be more.

713
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:36,564
Well, there's this man, this detective...

714
01:10:38,036 --> 01:10:40,947
... and I don't know exactly what is...

715
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,899
... happening or what he wants out of me,
or anything like that.

716
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:48,595
But he took care of me.

717
01:10:49,267 --> 01:10:51,475
Did you feel threatened by it?

718
01:10:54,547 --> 01:10:57,906
I don't know. When you're used
to being lonely and somebody comes in...

719
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:00,818
... and moves that around,
it's sort of scary I guess.

720
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:12,081
How do you feel when you feel scared?

721
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:17,616
- Angry.
- At whom?

722
01:11:19,089 --> 01:11:22,928
- Whoever is making me feel that way.
- Do you feel angry at him?

723
01:11:24,496 --> 01:11:25,743
Half of the time, yes.

724
01:11:25,808 --> 01:11:28,335
How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?

725
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,703
I want to...

726
01:11:40,207 --> 01:11:41,935
... manipulate him.

727
01:11:41,999 --> 01:11:42,798
How?

728
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,366
In all the ways
that I can manipulate people.

729
01:11:48,623 --> 01:11:50,958
I mean, it's easy
to manipulate men. Right?

730
01:12:18,764 --> 01:12:21,483
They were bringing
a freighter down through Kill Van Kull.

731
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,564
Propellers washed it up on top.

732
01:12:26,956 --> 01:12:29,292
Arlyn Page was probably an alias.

733
01:12:46,698 --> 01:12:49,290
- Sorry.
- Man, can you help me out?

734
01:12:51,626 --> 01:12:53,577
Yes. What?

735
01:12:56,201 --> 01:12:57,960
I mean, can you help me out?

736
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,815
I mean...

737
01:13:05,128 --> 01:13:06,920
...that's my baby, dead.

738
01:13:10,696 --> 01:13:12,007
I have to get up.

739
01:13:17,863 --> 01:13:21,542
- You know what it means, my baby dead.
- Got to get up.

740
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,334
Okay?

741
01:13:47,493 --> 01:13:50,404
Lt. Trask, please. John Klute.

742
01:13:53,253 --> 01:13:56,708
I think we should run down and check on
everybody who knew Tom Grunemann.

743
01:13:56,772 --> 01:13:59,651
I don't think the man
who wrote the letters was Tom.

744
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,892
Just run down and check on everything.

745
01:14:03,012 --> 01:14:04,132
Talk to you.

746
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:25,090
You're up, are you?

747
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:32,385
How are you?

748
01:14:34,561 --> 01:14:36,320
Trask wants you to call him.

749
01:14:39,457 --> 01:14:40,993
He told me about Arlyn.

750
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,944
It probably doesn't have anything
to do with anything...

751
01:14:56,928 --> 01:14:58,655
...but just as a precaution...

752
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:02,623
...when you go out,
if you tell me where you're going to go...

753
01:15:02,688 --> 01:15:05,023
...a phone number where I can find you.

754
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,743
Just so I can always
keep in touch with you.

755
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:09,438
Okay?

756
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:11,711
Sure.

757
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:21,597
I'm all right.

758
01:15:21,854 --> 01:15:22,813
I know.

759
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,573
I feel physically, that's what's different.

760
01:15:28,765 --> 01:15:31,965
I mean, I feel. My body feels. I enjoy...

761
01:15:34,845 --> 01:15:36,477
...making love with him.

762
01:15:39,549 --> 01:15:40,508
Which...

763
01:15:41,852 --> 01:15:46,363
...is a very baffling and bewildering thing,
because I've never felt that before.

764
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:50,588
I wish that I could let things happen and...

765
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:52,827
...enjoy it, you know...

766
01:15:53,019 --> 01:15:55,323
...for what it is and while it lasts...

767
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,586
...and relax about it.

768
01:16:00,091 --> 01:16:04,123
But all the time,
I keep feeling the need to destroy it.

769
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:07,098
To break it off.

770
01:16:07,834 --> 01:16:08,793
To...

771
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:11,386
...go back to...

772
01:16:12,762 --> 01:16:14,777
...the comfort of being numb again.

773
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:20,825
I keep hoping, in a way,
that it's going to end.

774
01:16:21,562 --> 01:16:22,553
Because...

775
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:26,009
...I had more control before,
when I was with tricks.

776
01:16:26,073 --> 01:16:29,081
I knew what I was doing
and I was setting everything up.

777
01:16:31,609 --> 01:16:35,000
And that's what's so strange:
It's that I'm not setting anything up.

778
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:36,471
That...

779
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:38,233
...something is...

780
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,135
You know what this is like,
but I've never felt it before.

781
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,600
It's a new thing and it's so strange.

782
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,287
The sensation that something...

783
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,799
...that is flowing from me naturally
to somebody else...

784
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:58,646
...without it's being prettied up or...
I mean, he's seen me horrible!

785
01:16:59,222 --> 01:17:01,462
He's seen me ugly!

786
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:02,934
He's seen me...

787
01:17:04,438 --> 01:17:06,901
...mean. He's seen me whorey...

788
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:09,877
...and it doesn't seem to matter.

789
01:17:10,677 --> 01:17:12,309
He seems to accept me.

790
01:17:16,181 --> 01:17:17,493
I guess...

791
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:22,741
...having sex with somebody and feeling
those sort of feelings towards them...

792
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:24,468
...is very new to me.

793
01:17:27,445 --> 01:17:30,196
I wish that I didn't keep wanting
to destroy it.

794
01:17:35,156 --> 01:17:37,396
You know, I'm trying to stay out of it.

795
01:17:41,236 --> 01:17:42,131
Yes.

796
01:17:47,795 --> 01:17:50,098
I'd love to party with you, but l...

797
01:17:50,386 --> 01:17:51,345
Yes.

798
01:17:54,258 --> 01:17:55,986
Marta, try to get somebody else...

799
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:58,673
...and if I change my mind
I'll call you, okay?

800
01:18:23,696 --> 01:18:26,415
You're not going to get hung up on me,
are you?

801
01:18:27,312 --> 01:18:30,447
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Yes, can I have a bag please?

802
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:32,431
- Yes.
- A couple of bags please.

803
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:38,031
Well, let me see how much those weigh.

804
01:18:38,095 --> 01:18:41,934
- A pound and a quarter.
- I'll have some of those small tomatoes.

805
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:44,782
- No mushy ones.
- Okay, thanks.

806
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:53,997
- What do you have in your bag?
- What?

807
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:56,173
What have you got in your bag?

808
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:29,674
Can I have a cantaloupe, please?

809
01:20:28,486 --> 01:20:29,445
Wait.

810
01:20:57,092 --> 01:20:58,595
He cut up my clothes...

811
01:20:59,652 --> 01:21:01,059
Oh, my God!

812
01:21:02,947 --> 01:21:04,547
Oh, my God!

813
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:21,570
Hello?

814
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:25,537
I can be a very bad girl, you know.
I sometimes need a spanking.

815
01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:30,369
I have very wicked ideas.

816
01:21:30,466 --> 01:21:32,161
I will do anything you ask.

817
01:21:32,257 --> 01:21:35,584
You should never be ashamed
of things like that. You mustn't be.

818
01:21:35,681 --> 01:21:37,441
You know, there's nothing wrong.

819
01:21:37,537 --> 01:21:42,016
I think the only way
that any of us can ever be happy...

820
01:21:42,433 --> 01:21:46,592
... is to let it all hang out.
You know, do it all and fuck it!

821
01:21:47,104 --> 01:21:50,495
The only responsibility you have to me
is to enjoy yourself.

822
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:56,446
She can't remember.

823
01:21:57,536 --> 01:21:59,199
Well, it could have been...

824
01:21:59,968 --> 01:22:03,487
...it could have been hidden in his pocket,
I've seen one of those.

825
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:09,119
All right. I'll wait for you here.

826
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,484
Bree?

827
01:22:30,589 --> 01:22:34,204
Trask and some officers are coming
to examine your apartment.

828
01:22:35,677 --> 01:22:37,980
I want you to stay here today and...

829
01:22:38,812 --> 01:22:39,899
...tomorrow.

830
01:22:41,436 --> 01:22:42,972
You'll be safe here.

831
01:22:43,324 --> 01:22:45,787
I'll only be gone
for a few minutes tomorrow.

832
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,346
Bree?

833
01:23:10,554 --> 01:23:11,513
Bree?

834
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:19,801
Well, you look like you've been
with many women, but I didn't know...

835
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:23,256
... if you'd ever paid for a woman before.
I mean, you wouldn't need to.

836
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:26,425
So if you do, it's obviously
because it excites you.

837
01:23:26,521 --> 01:23:29,144
Because you're not a man
that would have to pay for a woman.

838
01:23:29,241 --> 01:23:31,352
You could have any woman you wanted.

839
01:23:31,608 --> 01:23:34,775
The only responsibility you have to me
is to enjoy yourself.

840
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,111
I will do anything you ask or want.

841
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,015
Since you know that there are
no limits to my imagination.

842
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:47,830
I place no moral judgments on anything.

843
01:23:55,382 --> 01:23:58,646
We checked out 42 letters
of Tom Grunemann's friends.

844
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:03,061
And we only came up with one
with any similarity to the obscene letter.

845
01:24:03,925 --> 01:24:05,781
All right, there's Tom Grunemann.

846
01:24:06,838 --> 01:24:09,973
Different margins, different spacings.

847
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:16,180
That's mine.

848
01:24:16,565 --> 01:24:18,484
You said to check out everybody.

849
01:24:20,117 --> 01:24:22,101
Same margins, top and sides.

850
01:24:22,613 --> 01:24:24,884
He does best with his middle fingers.

851
01:24:25,684 --> 01:24:28,627
We get fainter registrations
on outside keys.

852
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:32,243
Notice how he invariably does that
with the "T" and the "H."

853
01:24:47,634 --> 01:24:48,722
Who is it?

854
01:24:50,322 --> 01:24:51,473
Peter Cable.

855
01:24:57,618 --> 01:25:00,497
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.

856
01:25:03,121 --> 01:25:06,032
I'm sorry we have to meet here,
but I'm pretty rushed for time.

857
01:25:06,097 --> 01:25:08,304
I have a business meeting
tonight in Chicago.

858
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,680
Any developments?

859
01:25:11,057 --> 01:25:12,912
I think I can close the case.

860
01:25:15,024 --> 01:25:17,135
I think I can close the case...

861
01:25:17,232 --> 01:25:20,240
...if I can have $500
to purchase Jane McKenna's address book.

862
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:24,304
I don't understand what you mean.

863
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,830
Well, I've found a contact
who will sell me the book.

864
01:25:26,928 --> 01:25:30,991
A little black book containing the name
of the client that beat up Bree Daniel.

865
01:25:32,143 --> 01:25:34,670
He is also the man
who came into Bree Daniel's...

866
01:25:34,766 --> 01:25:36,941
...apartment yesterday and wrecked it.

867
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:41,485
We know that now because
of the semen that he left in her underwear.

868
01:25:41,518 --> 01:25:45,773
The blood type is AB,
and Tom's was type A. It wasn't Tom.

869
01:25:51,118 --> 01:25:55,661
I think this man killed Jane McKenna
and Arlyn Page. I think he drowned them.

870
01:25:56,941 --> 01:26:00,556
I you should prepare yourself
for the fact that Tom is possibly dead.

871
01:26:02,797 --> 01:26:06,508
The only way I'll find out is to find him.
I need the money before tomorrow night.

872
01:26:06,604 --> 01:26:08,812
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.

873
01:26:08,876 --> 01:26:11,820
- He's bringing the book to my apartment.
- At what time?

874
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,868
8:30.

875
01:26:14,348 --> 01:26:17,804
I'll notify the board
as soon as I get to Chicago...

876
01:26:17,867 --> 01:26:20,554
...and have them wire you
the money immediately.

877
01:26:21,867 --> 01:26:23,178
Thank you, John.

878
01:26:23,275 --> 01:26:25,931
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.

879
01:26:27,274 --> 01:26:28,970
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

880
01:27:51,364 --> 01:27:53,155
I don't want you to do this.

881
01:27:53,828 --> 01:27:54,787
Bree.

882
01:27:56,387 --> 01:27:58,851
I'm just going to a girlfriend's apartment.

883
01:28:00,387 --> 01:28:02,179
I can't stay here, obviously.

884
01:28:09,571 --> 01:28:11,266
Please.

885
01:28:13,699 --> 01:28:15,266
Not with him.

886
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:18,977
This other girl has a very big apartment,
lots of room.

887
01:28:20,385 --> 01:28:22,560
But it's not necessarily how it looks.

888
01:28:23,777 --> 01:28:24,736
Look...

889
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:28,001
...we all respect each other, right?

890
01:28:28,577 --> 01:28:30,081
I respect you.

891
01:28:31,969 --> 01:28:33,345
Bree respects you.

892
01:28:34,209 --> 01:28:36,224
But you have to respect her, too.

893
01:28:38,465 --> 01:28:39,840
Her best interests.

894
01:30:21,816 --> 01:30:24,023
Mrs. Daniel, I have to close up now.

895
01:30:24,057 --> 01:30:27,448
Leave your name and number
with the service and she'll get back to you.

896
01:30:28,696 --> 01:30:29,911
I can't.

897
01:30:30,232 --> 01:30:32,535
Well, I have to close up now.

898
01:30:36,727 --> 01:30:38,422
I almost killed somebody.

899
01:30:38,616 --> 01:30:41,719
Well, I'm certain the doctor would like
to speak with you about it.

900
01:30:41,815 --> 01:30:45,943
As a matter of fact, I'll have her call you
as soon as she gets home. I promise.

901
01:30:48,086 --> 01:30:50,645
- Can I use your phone?
- Sure.

902
01:30:56,566 --> 01:30:59,093
Is Mr. Goldfarb there? Mr. Goldfarb Sr.

903
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:05,525
I have to talk to somebody.

904
01:31:05,589 --> 01:31:07,828
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?

905
01:31:09,877 --> 01:31:11,316
About half an hour?

906
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:22,227
Detective Trask, please.

907
01:31:24,532 --> 01:31:25,747
Hi, John Klute.

908
01:31:26,771 --> 01:31:29,171
He didn't take the plane, he cancelled out.

909
01:31:30,452 --> 01:31:32,179
I'm at home in my apartment.

910
01:31:32,723 --> 01:31:34,546
I don't know where she is. I'll find her.

911
01:31:36,211 --> 01:31:38,226
Okay. I'll leave word if I go out.

912
01:31:38,515 --> 01:31:39,474
Okay.

913
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,224
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.

914
01:32:07,089 --> 01:32:08,400
Mr. Goldfarb!

915
01:32:09,776 --> 01:32:11,984
Mr. Goldfarb!

916
01:32:15,088 --> 01:32:17,007
Hello. What can I do for you?

917
01:32:18,288 --> 01:32:20,367
I'm sorry. I mean Mr. Goldfarb Sr.

918
01:32:20,528 --> 01:32:23,662
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.

919
01:32:23,887 --> 01:32:27,054
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.

920
01:32:27,247 --> 01:32:29,550
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.

921
01:32:29,647 --> 01:32:31,023
No, really. I don't mind.

922
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:34,030
You're going to miss your train,
Mr. Goldfarb.

923
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:36,366
Excuse me.

924
01:32:37,262 --> 01:32:39,629
Did he leave a message for me?
Bree Daniel.

925
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:42,829
I thought that was for tomorrow!

926
01:32:55,885 --> 01:32:57,420
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.

927
01:32:59,692 --> 01:33:02,188
Yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.

928
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:05,707
I know you don't like to get in
in the middle of the picture!

929
01:33:05,803 --> 01:33:07,755
Yes, right away. Bye-bye.

930
01:33:14,028 --> 01:33:15,723
We're closing now, Miss.

931
01:33:16,587 --> 01:33:18,666
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?

932
01:33:18,763 --> 01:33:20,842
Poor man, everybody's friend.

933
01:34:46,116 --> 01:34:47,363
Hello?

934
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:49,348
Hello?

935
01:34:50,788 --> 01:34:53,955
This is Bree Daniel.
Has the doctor checked in yet?

936
01:34:54,339 --> 01:34:58,626
When she does, tell her I'm at 246-1383.

937
01:34:59,076 --> 01:35:00,995
I'll wait five minutes.

938
01:36:28,253 --> 01:36:30,012
How I can reach the doctor?

939
01:36:30,108 --> 01:36:32,187
The doctor hasn't checked in yet.

940
01:36:32,412 --> 01:36:34,812
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniel.

941
01:36:34,908 --> 01:36:37,915
I'm sorry sir,
but we only take messages for the doctor.

942
01:36:38,331 --> 01:36:39,963
Has she called in or anything?

943
01:36:40,059 --> 01:36:42,106
Has she called the doctor at all today?

944
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:45,082
- She left a forwarding number.
- Can I have that number, please?

945
01:36:45,179 --> 01:36:46,746
I'm not allowed to give that out.

946
01:36:46,811 --> 01:36:49,371
I'm a police officer.
Please don't make me prove this.

947
01:36:49,467 --> 01:36:53,018
You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.

948
01:36:53,114 --> 01:36:56,730
I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?

949
01:37:06,265 --> 01:37:08,313
Can we talk about this reasonably?

950
01:37:09,593 --> 01:37:12,920
I know you're expecting some kind
of extravagant behavior but...

951
01:37:15,225 --> 01:37:16,536
...do you believe me?

952
01:37:16,953 --> 01:37:17,848
Yes.

953
01:37:18,969 --> 01:37:20,089
We can talk?

954
01:37:27,223 --> 01:37:29,302
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.

955
01:37:30,904 --> 01:37:35,127
I'm a very well-off man.
I have a position to respect...

956
01:37:36,918 --> 01:37:40,182
...I would feel personally,
very uncomfortable to be...

957
01:37:41,782 --> 01:37:43,189
...connected with...

958
01:37:43,927 --> 01:37:47,318
...a certain kind of woman.
I'm sure you understand what I mean.

959
01:37:51,414 --> 01:37:53,301
Look, John Klute works for me.

960
01:37:56,118 --> 01:37:57,781
I know you're his contact.

961
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:01,780
I know he's trying to acquire...

962
01:38:02,645 --> 01:38:04,212
...Jane McKenna's book.

963
01:38:07,573 --> 01:38:11,156
I'm in a position
to offer more for it than he can.

964
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,755
You don't understand
what I'm talking about, do you?

965
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:22,483
Yes. Jane McKenna's book.

966
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,659
- And I'll try to get it for you.
- No.

967
01:38:26,099 --> 01:38:28,658
Obviously you're frightened
and you're lying.

968
01:38:30,226 --> 01:38:33,361
No, I'm not. I will, I'll try to get it for you.

969
01:38:35,059 --> 01:38:36,114
Is this...

970
01:38:37,074 --> 01:38:38,962
...something Klute's invented.

971
01:38:40,722 --> 01:38:42,353
Is this a trap for me?

972
01:38:43,313 --> 01:38:46,737
- Klute knows about me, doesn't he?
- Knows what about you?

973
01:38:50,033 --> 01:38:51,889
Then everybody knows about me.

974
01:38:53,681 --> 01:38:56,849
So, it doesn't make any difference
what I do anymore, does it?

975
01:39:29,902 --> 01:39:31,917
I've no idea what I'm going to do...

976
01:39:34,574 --> 01:39:36,206
...and I'm so deeply puzzled.

977
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:41,420
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.

978
01:39:44,494 --> 01:39:47,085
And yet, I don't consider myself
a terrible man.

979
01:39:48,492 --> 01:39:51,148
No more than others.

980
01:39:53,036 --> 01:39:56,620
See, Tom Grunemann discovered me.
We were here on business together...

981
01:39:57,132 --> 01:40:00,396
...and he found me and Jane McKenna
in my hotel room.

982
01:40:03,724 --> 01:40:06,572
She had become hysterical
and she started...

983
01:40:06,955 --> 01:40:08,139
...screaming...

984
01:40:09,548 --> 01:40:11,563
...and I guess I hit her.

985
01:40:11,627 --> 01:40:14,571
I don't actually recall
how it all happened so quickly.

986
01:40:15,018 --> 01:40:18,153
Anyway, she fell and hit her head,
and that's when Tom...

987
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:22,089
...came in the room.
I guess he must've heard her screaming.

988
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:26,666
But I never understood...

989
01:40:26,762 --> 01:40:29,706
...why she did that.
She had never screamed before.

990
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:34,633
It was the...

991
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:37,225
...revulsion and the...

992
01:40:37,897 --> 01:40:40,040
...contempt that I saw on his face...

993
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:45,064
...and the certainty that sooner or later
he would use it against me...

994
01:40:45,161 --> 01:40:46,792
...within the company.

995
01:40:49,448 --> 01:40:52,359
I tried to endure that
as long as I possibly could.

996
01:41:00,199 --> 01:41:02,791
You just want me to keep on talking,
don't you?

997
01:41:03,367 --> 01:41:05,767
No, I don't. I do understand. I really do.

998
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:08,103
Well, that's what you all do.

999
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:12,742
You make a man think that he's accepted.

1000
01:41:14,918 --> 01:41:17,125
It's all just a great big game to you.

1001
01:41:19,366 --> 01:41:24,005
You're all obviously too lazy and
too warped to do anything meaningful...

1002
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:25,798
...with your life, so you...

1003
01:41:26,437 --> 01:41:28,932
...prey upon the sexual fantasies of others.

1004
01:41:31,685 --> 01:41:35,108
I'm sure it comes as no great surprise
to you when I say that...

1005
01:41:35,876 --> 01:41:36,996
...there are...

1006
01:41:37,061 --> 01:41:38,980
...little corners in everyone...

1007
01:41:40,324 --> 01:41:42,435
...which were better off left alone.

1008
01:41:43,492 --> 01:41:46,211
Little sicknesses, weaknesses, which...

1009
01:41:47,683 --> 01:41:49,379
...should never be exposed.

1010
01:41:52,803 --> 01:41:55,714
That's your stock in trade, isn't it,
a man's weakness?

1011
01:41:59,202 --> 01:42:01,666
I was never really fully aware of mine...

1012
01:42:02,754 --> 01:42:04,642
...until you brought them out.

1013
01:42:28,512 --> 01:42:30,240
How far out of town are we?

1014
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,927
- Five miles outside of New York.
- Do you mind if I turn...

1015
01:42:37,503 --> 01:42:38,847
... the lights down?

1016
01:42:39,263 --> 01:42:42,111
No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.

1017
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:46,975
My name is Peter Cable.

1018
01:42:47,935 --> 01:42:50,334
I work for the Tole American Corporation...

1019
01:42:50,975 --> 01:42:54,621
... which is situated in Pennsylvania
and in New York.

1020
01:42:55,134 --> 01:42:57,982
I would not be telling you these things...

1021
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:00,509
... if my intentions weren't honorable.

1022
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:07,037
- You look familiar to me.
- In what way?

1023
01:43:08,381 --> 01:43:11,037
I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.

1024
01:43:12,861 --> 01:43:14,909
I guess I have a confession to make.

1025
01:43:14,973 --> 01:43:17,692
We did meet before. About two years ago.

1026
01:43:19,196 --> 01:43:22,075
I often wondered
whatever happened to Arlyn Page...

1027
01:43:22,428 --> 01:43:23,772
... and here you are.

1028
01:43:25,756 --> 01:43:27,067
Yeah, I remember.

1029
01:43:29,532 --> 01:43:30,491
Listen...

1030
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:34,172
... l've got get out of here. I mean I can't...

1031
01:43:36,155 --> 01:43:37,787
I remember you.

1032
01:43:37,851 --> 01:43:41,274
- Well, what do you remember?
- You beat me up, that's what you did!

1033
01:43:42,555 --> 01:43:43,579
It's okay.

1034
01:43:44,827 --> 01:43:47,354
Just freaked me out for a minute, that's all.

1035
01:43:47,674 --> 01:43:50,650
I promise to drive you back afterwards.

1036
01:43:51,226 --> 01:43:52,570
Okay.

1037
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:55,545
Why don't you just tell me
what you'd like, and then...

1038
01:43:55,609 --> 01:43:59,448
- ... after you tell me what you'd like...
- I'd like to spend some time with you.

1039
01:43:59,545 --> 01:44:02,680
- I have been looking for you for two years.
- Why?

1040
01:44:05,912 --> 01:44:07,256
That's my business.

1041
01:44:10,393 --> 01:44:13,176
I will say that you gave me
a great deal of pleasure.

1042
01:44:13,273 --> 01:44:18,040
I saw in you things that I had not seen
in other women of your profession.

1043
01:44:19,351 --> 01:44:21,655
I will not harm you at all physically.

1044
01:44:22,776 --> 01:44:23,799
It's all right.

1045
01:44:23,863 --> 01:44:26,519
No, it's not all right,
and you know it's not all right.

1046
01:44:26,551 --> 01:44:30,518
No, it is all right. If that's what you...
But, you have to tell me first.

1047
01:44:31,383 --> 01:44:33,111
If that's what you want...

1048
01:44:33,687 --> 01:44:35,254
- ... that's fine.
- Arlyn...

1049
01:44:35,351 --> 01:44:38,806
... why don't you lie down on the bed
and make yourself comfortable.

1050
01:44:39,030 --> 01:44:43,061
I'll not strap you in, I'll not tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.

1051
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:48,950
Be comfortable.
Nothing's going to happen.

1052
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:56,885
Nothing's going to happen.

1053
01:44:59,509 --> 01:45:00,468
Okay.

1054
01:45:03,605 --> 01:45:07,284
- Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
- I am perfectly comfortable.

1055
01:45:07,668 --> 01:45:09,523
Just put your head down.

1056
01:45:11,732 --> 01:45:14,676
You have such lovely long blonde hair.

1057
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,547
Turn your head.

1058
01:45:20,532 --> 01:45:21,587
Like that.

1059
01:45:24,435 --> 01:45:26,579
Don't!

1060
01:45:26,643 --> 01:45:28,850
Don't!

1061
01:46:49,357 --> 01:46:51,724
I've explained to him what I have to do...

1062
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:54,283
... and I think he understands.

1063
01:46:55,019 --> 01:46:58,091
What could ever happen for us?
I mean, we're so different.

1064
01:46:58,763 --> 01:47:01,323
I know enough about myself
to know that whatever...

1065
01:47:01,420 --> 01:47:04,012
... lies in store for me it's not going to be...

1066
01:47:04,139 --> 01:47:07,083
... setting up housekeeping
with somebody in Tuscarora...

1067
01:47:07,179 --> 01:47:10,986
... and darning socks and doing all that.
I'd go out of my mind.

1068
01:47:24,681 --> 01:47:28,041
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know how I feel about him.

1069
01:47:29,161 --> 01:47:31,944
It's so hard for me to say it! God!

1070
01:47:32,009 --> 01:47:34,121
- To say what?
- I'm going to miss him.

1071
01:47:49,031 --> 01:47:50,439
Bree Daniel.

1072
01:47:55,303 --> 01:47:56,358
How is Roy?

1073
01:48:03,846 --> 01:48:06,917
Well, I'm leaving town right now
and I don't expect to be back.

1074
01:48:08,358 --> 01:48:09,830
You're very nice.

1075
01:48:10,854 --> 01:48:12,709
Thank you. Goodbye.

1076
01:48:27,877 --> 01:48:30,212
I have no idea what's going to happen.

1077
01:48:30,372 --> 01:48:32,964
I just can't stay in the city, you know?

1078
01:48:34,692 --> 01:48:36,131
Maybe I'll come back.

1079
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,612
You'll probably see me next week.
