1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,800
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,100
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,200
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,600
No, it ain't.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,900
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,000
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,300
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,400
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,000
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,500
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,300
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,700
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,300
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,700
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,100
Personally, I can do without her.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,200
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,100
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,900
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,000
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,300
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,900
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,400
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,400
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy--

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,200
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,500
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,400
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

29
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,700
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,600
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,700
- How many "dicks" is that?
- A lot.

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,000
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,600
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,000
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious dick action.

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,400
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.

36
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,900
Chew? Toby Chew?

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,100
It hurts. It hurts her.

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,600
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,200
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,300
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,900
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

42
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,000
what it was once like
to be a virgin.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Hence, "Like A Virgin."

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,300
Wong.

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,400
-Give me that fuckin' thing.
-What in hell do you think you're doin'?

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,500
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,900
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,800
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,700
"Toby. Toby?

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,900
Toby? Toby Wong.

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,000
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,900
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,300
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,200
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.

55
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,700
Give me that book.

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,600
Are you gonna put it away?

57
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,100
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,300
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?

60
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,200
Shit.

61
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,300
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,100
You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,700
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?

65
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,600
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

66
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,100
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

67
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,700
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,500
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

69
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,700
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.

70
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

71
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,400
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,900
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

73
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,800
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.

74
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,100
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

75
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,400
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

76
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,400
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

77
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,100
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,400
You guys can get the tip.

79
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,700
Should be about a buck apiece.

80
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,900
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,300
Sorry. It's my book now.

82
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,300
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

83
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,000
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
Come on, throw in a buck.

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,400
I don't tip.

86
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,100
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

87
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,200
You don't believe in tipping?

88
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,400
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

89
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,100
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.

90
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,700
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

91
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,400
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

92
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,100
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

93
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,500
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,900
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.

95
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,500
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

96
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,400
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

97
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,700
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

98
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,300
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,600
I'd go over 12% for that.

100
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,500
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.

101
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
I want it filled six times.

102
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,600
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

103
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,600
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

104
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,300
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

105
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,700
another cup of coffee.

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,000
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,100
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

108
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,000
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.

109
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,000
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?

110
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
You know what this is?

111
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,000
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,400
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

113
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,600
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

114
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,900
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,300
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

116
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,100
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

117
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,200
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

118
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,900
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

119
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,800
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

120
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
The reason is
because of their tips.

121
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,300
Fuck all that.

122
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,600
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

123
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,800
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

124
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,900
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,100
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

126
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,600
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,200
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

128
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,100
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

129
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,400
If you're expectin' me to help out with
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.

130
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,300
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

131
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

133
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,600
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

134
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,300
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

135
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,900
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

136
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,800
He don't tip?

137
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,700
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

138
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,000
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

140
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,400
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.

141
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,600
Never mind what you
normally would do.

142
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,000
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.

143
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,000
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...

144
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

145
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,000
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,600
as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...

147
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,200
just keeps on truckin'.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,500
just keeps on truckin'.

149
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,300
I'm gonna die.

150
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm gonna die!

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,100
Just hold on, buddy boy!

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,700
I'm gonna die!

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,900
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

154
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,100
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,600
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,300
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

157
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,300
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

158
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,700
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

159
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,800
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

160
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,800
Are you a doctor?

161
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,600
Are you a doctor?

162
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,100
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

163
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,600
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

164
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

165
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,200
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,500
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

167
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,100
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,300
you're gonna be okay.

169
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,700
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

170
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,000
Say it!

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,900
You're gonna be okay!

172
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

173
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,300
Oh, God!

174
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,400
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

175
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
Say it!

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,100
Okay, Larry.

177
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,000
Correct! Correct!

178
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I'm okay.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,400
Look where we are.

180
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,000
Look where we are.

181
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,800
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

182
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,600
We're in a warehouse.

183
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,900
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

184
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,600
Come on, who's a tough guy?

185
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,400
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

186
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,300
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

187
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,200
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

188
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,500
We made it. We made it.

189
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,800
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

190
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

191
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,900
Look where we are.

192
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,500
Hold on. Hold on.

193
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,600
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.

195
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,200
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

196
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,400
I can't do anything for you.

197
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,800
But when Joe gets here...

198
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
which should be any time now...

199
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,900
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

200
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,300
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

201
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,600
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

202
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,800
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.

203
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,300
Would you please hold me?

204
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,900
Yeah, sure.

205
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
You go ahead and be scared.

206
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,900
You've been brave enough
for one day.

207
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,900
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

208
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,300
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

209
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,700
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,700
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

211
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,600
It's not good, no.

212
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,000
Hey, Larry...

213
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,000
bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.

214
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,800
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

215
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,900
But I got my senses back now.

216
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,900
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

217
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

218
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,700
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!

219
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,300
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

220
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,900
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

221
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,500
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

222
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,000
I swear to fucking God, man.

223
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,100
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

224
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,700
I won't tell them anything.

225
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,500
You'll be safe, man.

226
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,800
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?

227
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,800
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

228
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Along with the kneecap...

229
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,600
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

230
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,700
No shit!

231
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,600
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

232
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm talkin' days.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,100
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

234
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
Time is on your side.

235
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,000
Was that a fucking setup, or what?

236
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,500
Shit. Orange got tagged?

237
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,100
Gut shot.

238
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,500
Fuck. Where's Brown?

239
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,800
Dead.

240
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
How did he die?

241
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,400
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

242
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,400
This is bad.

243
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,100
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?

244
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,700
As opposed to good?

245
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Man, this is fucked up.

246
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,200
This is so fucked up.

247
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,100
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

248
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,500
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?

249
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,900
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

250
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,200
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.

251
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,400
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

252
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,900
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

253
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,500
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...

254
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,000
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

255
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,900
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...

256
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,300
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!

257
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,000
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,600
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...

259
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,000
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,500
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

261
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,200
I haven't had a chance to think.

262
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,500
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

263
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,400
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.

264
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,700
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

265
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,600
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...

266
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,100
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

267
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,900
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!

268
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,600
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

269
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,000
Larry, don't leave me.

270
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,800
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

271
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,300
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

272
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
I'm right over there.

273
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,600
Larry...

274
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm gonna fucking die.

275
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,600
Larry.

276
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,900
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

277
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,000
I felt funny about
this job right off.

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,700
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.

279
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,900
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.

280
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,500
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

281
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,400
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.

282
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,800
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.

283
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,900
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

284
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,500
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

285
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,400
Are you cool?

286
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm cool.

287
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,900
Splash some water on your face.

288
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,400
Take a breather.

289
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,200
Relax. Have a cigarette.

290
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
I quit.

291
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,900
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

292
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,800
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

293
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,300
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

294
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,400
Then the alarm gets tripped.

295
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,700
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

296
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,000
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.

297
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,300
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--

298
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

299
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,900
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

300
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,300
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

301
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,400
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.

302
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,200
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

303
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,900
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

305
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,800
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

306
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,100
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

307
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,600
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!

308
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,200
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

309
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,400
You're right.
This is bad.

310
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,000
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

311
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,400
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.

312
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,200
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!

313
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,600
Get the fuck outta the way!

314
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,700
Move it!
Get outta the way!

315
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,200
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

316
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,400
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

317
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Move!

318
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,600
Jesus!

319
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,100
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!

320
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,300
Move it!
Move outta the way!

321
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,600
I tagged a couple of cops.

322
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,700
Did you kill anybody?

323
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,800
- A few cops.
- No real people?

324
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Just cops.

325
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

326
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

327
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,500
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

328
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't want to kill anybody.

329
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,700
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

330
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,100
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.

331
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,400
That's the way I look at it.

332
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
The choice between
doin' ten years...

333
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,800
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...

334
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,700
ain't no choice at all.

335
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,300
But I ain't no madman, either.

336
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,000
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.

337
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,600
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

338
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,500
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

339
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

340
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,100
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

341
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,800
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.

342
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,500
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?

343
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,700
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.

344
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.

345
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,800
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

346
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,200
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.

347
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,700
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.

348
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,800
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?

349
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,100
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

350
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,500
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

351
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,100
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

352
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,200
After that,
I don't know what went down.

353
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
It was every man for himself.

354
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,100
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...

355
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,200
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

356
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
What do you think?

357
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,500
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

358
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,700
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

359
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,100
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

360
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,800
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

361
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,000
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--

362
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,400
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

363
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,100
I got the diamonds.

364
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,700
That's my boy.

365
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,400
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

366
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,600
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.

367
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,000
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.

368
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,000
That was the plan.
We meet here.

369
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,900
Then where the fuck is everybody?

370
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,100
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.

371
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,000
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

372
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,400
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

373
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,300
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.

374
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,800
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

375
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,000
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

376
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,800
What?

377
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,600
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.

378
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,000
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

379
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,400
No shit?

380
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,900
Thank God we discovered in time.

381
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,000
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

382
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,100
So who's the rat this time?

383
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,000
Mr. Blue?

384
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,700
Mr. Brown?

385
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,900
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

386
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,300
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe go back a long time.

387
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,500
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.

388
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,100
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

389
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,100
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.

390
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,600
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.

391
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,500
For all I know, you're the rat.

392
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,900
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

393
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

394
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
For all we know, he's the rat.

395
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,900
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

396
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,000
so don't you be calling him a rat!

397
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,300
Look, I'm right, okay?

398
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,800
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

399
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,800
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

400
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,400
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs...

401
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,300
and make a right.

402
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,300
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

403
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,800
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

404
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,200
But I thought you two
were a team.

405
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,000
We were for a little while.

406
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,700
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

407
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
Why?

408
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,900
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

409
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,900
What's she doin' now?

410
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,400
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.

411
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,600
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

412
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,700
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

413
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,800
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

414
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

415
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,000
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

416
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,200
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

417
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,700
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

418
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,900
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

419
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
Bad luck.

420
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
I guess you can say that again.

421
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,800
What's the exposure like?

422
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,800
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

423
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,100
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

424
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,500
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

425
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,400
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

426
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,100
Security pretty lax.

427
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,500
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

428
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,400
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

429
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,100
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

430
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,200
They're like a way station,
you know?

431
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,500
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
-No, they're not.

432
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,700
What's the cut, poppa?

433
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,300
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

434
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,400
Look, man, you do what you want.

435
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,100
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.

436
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--

437
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,600
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

438
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,700
Huh? ls he dead or what?

439
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,000
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

440
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,600
I think he's just passed out.

441
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,700
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.

442
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,400
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

443
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,300
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.

444
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.

445
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,300
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

446
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,000
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

447
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,800
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.

448
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,300
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

449
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,500
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.

450
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,700
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

451
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,700
You got an idea, spit it out.

452
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,500
Joe could help.

453
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,200
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.

454
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

455
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,200
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?

456
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

457
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,700
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

458
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,200
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

459
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,500
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

460
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,200
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

461
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,800
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.

462
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,000
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

463
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,800
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.

464
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,700
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...

465
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,300
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

466
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,100
He begged me to do it.

467
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

468
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,000
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

469
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,700
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.

470
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,300
He knows a little about me.

471
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,500
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

472
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,600
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

473
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,000
Why?

474
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,000
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

475
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,600
It was just
a natural conversation.

476
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

477
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,200
He asked.

478
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,100
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

479
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,500
It was my fault he got shot.

480
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,900
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

481
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,300
He's screamin'.

482
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,400
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

483
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,200
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...

484
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,800
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.

485
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,000
And he asked me
what my name was.

486
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,100
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

487
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,200
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?

488
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,100
It's against the rules?

489
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't trust you enough?

490
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,100
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

491
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,600
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

492
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,800
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

493
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,200
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

494
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,400
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

495
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,300
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.

496
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,600
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.

497
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,700
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!

498
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,200
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?

499
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,800
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.

500
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

501
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
If we don't, he's gonna die.

502
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,300
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

503
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,900
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

504
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,100
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

505
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,200
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

506
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,200
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!

507
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,000
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!

508
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,700
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...

509
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
and that can't happen!

510
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,300
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!

511
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,800
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

512
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

513
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,500
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

514
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,000
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!

515
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,900
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

516
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,600
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

517
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
Mr. Blonde.

518
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,500
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

519
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,800
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.

520
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,800
Hey, you okay?

521
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,200
Did you see what happened to Blue?

522
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,800
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.

523
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,500
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.

524
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,700
Enough! Enough!

525
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,800
You better start talkin', asshole.

526
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,500
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

527
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,200
We're already freaked out.

528
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,600
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

529
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,300
Okay, let's talk.

530
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,700
We think we got
a rat in the house.

531
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,700
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.

532
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,500
What makes you say that?

533
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Is that supposed to be funny?

534
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,100
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

535
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,900
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

536
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,100
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

537
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,600
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

538
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,700
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

539
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,400
Fuck you, maniac!

540
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

541
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,500
What's this guy's problem?

542
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,400
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!

543
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,200
I got a big fuckin' problem...

544
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,200
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

545
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,500
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!

546
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,800
In the store! Remember?

547
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,600
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.

548
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
You almost killed me!

549
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,600
Asshole!

550
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,900
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.

551
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,800
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

552
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,600
or are you gonna bite?

553
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,700
What was that?

554
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,000
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

555
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,700
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

556
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,600
or are you gonna bite?

557
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,500
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!

558
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,100
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?

559
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,300
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

560
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,600
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.

561
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,500
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

562
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,000
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

563
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,700
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

564
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,400
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
-You takin' his side?

565
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!

566
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.

567
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,000
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

568
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,700
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.

569
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,500
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

570
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,400
Wow.

571
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,500
That was really exciting.

572
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,200
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

573
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,400
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

574
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,600
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

575
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,300
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

576
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,000
Follow you? Where?

577
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,500
To my car.

578
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,000
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

579
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,700
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.

580
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

581
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

582
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,300
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

583
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,800
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

584
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,100
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

585
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,500
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

586
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,700
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

587
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,900
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?

588
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,700
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

589
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,800
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

590
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,200
So in the meantime...

591
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,800
I'll show you guys somethin'.

592
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
Jesus Christ.

593
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...

594
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,000
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

595
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

596
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

597
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,400
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

598
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,700
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

599
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,100
I know you'll pay me back.

600
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,900
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

601
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,900
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.

602
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,700
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan
or lrving the tailor. You ride it out.

603
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,200
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

604
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

605
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,000
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

606
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,300
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

607
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,900
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

608
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,600
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

609
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,900
How does freedom feel, huh?

610
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,000
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

611
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,900
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

612
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,700
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

613
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,800
How about a little Remy Martin?

614
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Sure.

615
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Who's your parole officer?

616
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,000
Seymour Scagnetti.

617
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,500
How is he?

618
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,400
He's a fuckin' asshole.

619
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

620
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,000
It never ceases to amaze me.

621
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,100
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

622
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,900
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

623
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,500
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

624
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,700
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.

625
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,600
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

626
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Forget about you?

627
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,400
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

628
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,000
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.

629
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,800
Thanks a lot, Joe.

630
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
Ah, Vic.

631
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Toothpick Vic.

632
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,800
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

633
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,200
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.

634
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,600
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

635
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,300
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

636
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,800
I was-- My fuckin'--
This week's been crazy.

637
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,000
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

638
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,100
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.

639
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,000
That I should've picked you up?

640
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,700
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

641
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,800
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic...

642
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,500
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.

643
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,100
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

644
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
He's ruining the business.

645
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,800
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."

646
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,000
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

647
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,600
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...

648
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,400
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.

649
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,300
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.

650
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,400
That's very true.

651
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,000
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

652
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Come on, this ain't a playground!

653
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,000
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

654
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,700
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

655
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,800
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

656
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,400
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

657
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,800
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

658
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,000
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...

659
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,200
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.

660
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,400
I don't think of you that way.

661
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,500
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

662
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,700
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

663
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,000
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

664
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,400
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

665
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,600
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

666
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,200
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

667
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,400
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

668
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,400
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...

669
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,800
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...

670
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,600
and it's comin' out your mouth!

671
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,400
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

672
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,200
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

673
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,300
Now both of you, sit down.

674
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,400
Now, Eddie...

675
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,300
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.

676
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,300
Vic here's got a parole problem.

677
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,200
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

678
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,800
Scagnetti. Fuck.

679
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,700
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

680
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,900
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

681
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,100
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

682
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Well, I wanna.

683
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,200
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...

684
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,600
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...

685
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,700
before I can move out on my own.

686
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,000
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...

687
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,300
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...

688
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,200
every fuckin' night.

689
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,600
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

690
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,500
This ain't all that bad.

691
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,600
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.

692
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,400
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.

693
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,600
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

694
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,000
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.

695
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,900
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

696
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,800
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.

697
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,700
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.

698
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,200
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.

699
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,700
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...

700
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,900
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"

701
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,400
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

702
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,600
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.

703
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,700
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.

704
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,200
You just missed him.

705
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,800
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

706
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,400
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."

707
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,000
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.

708
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,600
We got places all over the place.

709
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,700
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?

710
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,700
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

711
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,500
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

712
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,700
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...

713
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,300
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

714
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,500
you know, do some real work.

715
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,800
Well, it's hard to say.

716
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,700
It's kind of a strange time now.

717
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,100
Things are kind of--

718
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,100
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

719
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,200
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.

720
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,700
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

721
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,900
Get you a job,
give you some cash...

722
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,900
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...

723
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,100
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?

724
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,100
Huh?

725
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,800
Dad, I got an idea.

726
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,500
Just hear me out.

727
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,000
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...

728
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,300
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.

729
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,200
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.

730
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,500
I'd like to have him in.

731
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,100
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.

732
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
All right, Vic...

733
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,700
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?

734
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,200
I'd feel great about it.

735
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,400
K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

736
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,400
If you're the 12th caller...

737
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,800
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...

738
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,000
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...

739
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."

740
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,800
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.

741
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,900
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

742
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,400
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.

743
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,100
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.

744
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,600
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.

745
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,400
Get up! Get up!

746
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,600
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

747
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,900
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

748
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,400
I don't know who did what!

749
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,500
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

750
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,300
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

751
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,200
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

752
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,100
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

753
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,300
All right.
You sure that's what he said?

754
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,800
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

755
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Huh? Fuck you!

756
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,300
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

757
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,800
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

758
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,700
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

759
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,000
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.

760
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,900
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

761
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,500
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

762
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,800
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

763
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,900
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

764
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

765
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,900
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

766
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,200
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.

767
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,500
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

768
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,100
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

769
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,800
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

770
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,200
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.

771
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,400
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

772
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,700
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

773
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,600
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?

774
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,300
I don't know, but somebody did.

775
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,000
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--

776
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,900
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!

777
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,900
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...

778
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,300
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

779
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,100
Where's Joseph?

780
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,400
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

781
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,800
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.

782
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,100
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

783
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,600
What'd Joe say?

784
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,500
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

785
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,500
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?

786
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,600
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.

787
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,900
You ain't dying. He is.

788
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,400
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

789
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,100
Who?

790
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,600
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

791
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,300
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?

792
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,600
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.

793
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,400
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

794
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,400
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

795
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,500
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

796
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,700
Either he's alive or he's dead...

797
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,700
or the cops got him
or they don't.

798
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,900
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.

799
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,800
Why are you beatin' on him?

800
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,200
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

801
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,400
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

802
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,000
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

803
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,200
Come on, man, think!

804
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,600
All right,
first things fuckin' last.

805
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:43,100
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.

806
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,500
I got a bag.

807
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

808
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,800
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.

809
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,000
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

810
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,900
Okay.

811
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,800
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

812
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,400
White and Pink,
take a car each.

813
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,000
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.

814
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,000
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

815
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,900
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

816
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,300
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

817
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,500
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

818
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,400
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...

819
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,500
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.

820
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,000
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

821
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:32,000
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.

822
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,900
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...

823
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,700
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

824
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,700
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

825
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,100
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.

826
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,700
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

827
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,500
Tell him!

828
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,000
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

829
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,800
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...

830
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,500
bam, bam.

831
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,800
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

832
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,900
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

833
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,300
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.

834
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,900
My fuckin' hero.

835
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,400
Thanks.

836
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,100
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

837
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,200
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

838
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,900
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

839
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,900
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.

840
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,900
I haven't been looking at you guys.

841
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,400
Shut the fuck up, man!

842
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,200
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.

843
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,200
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

844
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,800
Now here's the news!

845
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,000
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!

846
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,100
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...

847
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,300
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...

848
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,300
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.

849
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,300
Fine. Let's go.

850
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,100
Alone at last.

851
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,000
Guess what.

852
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,600
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

853
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,200
Now, where were we?

854
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,900
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

855
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

856
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,500
They don't tell me anything.

857
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,900
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

858
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,100
Torture you?
That's a good--

859
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,200
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.

860
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,700
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.

861
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,600
- My what?
- Your boss.

862
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,400
Excuse me, pal.

863
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.

864
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?

865
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,800
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?

866
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,900
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.

867
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,900
Get that fuckin' shit off.

868
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,700
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

869
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,300
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know...

870
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,100
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...

871
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,400
regardless.

872
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,700
Not to get information.

873
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,200
It's amusing to me...

874
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,600
to torture a cop.

875
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,700
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.

876
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,300
All you can do is...

877
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,500
pray for a quick death...

878
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,500
which...

879
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,600
you ain't gonna get.

880
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,900
Oh, God.

881
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,800
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?

882
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,200
It's my personal favorite.

883
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,700
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

884
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,600
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...

885
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,600
from April of 1974.

886
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,500
That reached up to number five...

887
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,900
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

888
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,900
Hold still.

889
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,000
Hold still, you fuck.

890
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,000
Was that good for you too?

891
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,400
Hey, what's goin' on?

892
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,900
You hear that?

893
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,300
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

894
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,500
Don't! Stop! Stop!

895
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,800
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.

896
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,700
That burn a little bit?

897
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,100
Don't! Stop!

898
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,700
Please stop.

899
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,800
Just stop. Stop.

900
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,700
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.

901
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,300
Don't burn me, please.

902
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,000
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.

903
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,900
I'm not gonna say anything.

904
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,000
No! Please, no.

905
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,600
- You all through?
- Stop!

906
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,700
You all through?

907
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,300
Please.
I got a little kid at home.

908
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,900
You all done?

909
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,800
- Don't!
- Have some fire.

910
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,100
Oh, shit.

911
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,600
Hey, you.

912
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,500
What's your name?

913
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,800
Marvin.

914
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,800
Marvin what?

915
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,400
Marvin Nash.

916
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,600
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--

917
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,100
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.

918
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,500
Yeah, I know.

919
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,400
You do?

920
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,800
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.

921
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,300
Newendyke.

922
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,400
Freddy Newendyke.

923
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,200
Frankie Ferchetti...

924
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,000
introduced us
about five months ago.

925
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,100
I don't remember that at all.

926
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,000
I do.

927
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,300
Freddy.

928
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,900
How do I look?

929
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,900
What?

930
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,100
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.

931
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,000
That fuck.

932
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,800
That sick fuck!

933
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,700
That fuckin' bastard!

934
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,900
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

935
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,800
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.

936
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,700
What the fuck
are they waiting for?

937
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,900
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...

938
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,400
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

939
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,600
I'm fuckin' deformed!

940
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,100
Fuck you!

941
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,400
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

942
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,400
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

943
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,400
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.

944
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,200
I was sent in to get him.

945
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,700
All right?

946
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,700
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

947
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,100
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.

948
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,100
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...

949
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,500
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.

950
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,500
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.

951
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,300
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.

952
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,700
This better not be a joke.

953
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,400
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.

954
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,400
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

955
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,300
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.

956
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,500
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.

957
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,500
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?

958
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,000
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?

959
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,500
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

960
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,100
We get there...

961
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,100
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.

962
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,000
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

963
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,800
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

964
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,800
Okay, Mr. Orange.

965
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,400
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

966
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,000
Yes. Mr. White.

967
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,500
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

968
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,600
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?

969
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,600
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.

970
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,700
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?

971
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,500
Mr. White.

972
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,200
- A little.
- About what?

973
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
The Brewers.

974
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,700
Milwaukee Brewers?

975
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,800
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.

976
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:46,500
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

977
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,200
And I'll bet you everything...

978
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,300
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.

979
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,500
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...

980
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,900
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.

981
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,300
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.

982
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,900
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.

983
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,000
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.

984
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,900
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.

985
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,800
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...

986
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,000
and that I was ready to move.

987
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,700
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.

988
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,000
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.

989
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,200
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.

990
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,100
He's selling out his friends.

991
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,000
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

992
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
I'll take care of his ass...

993
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,700
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.

994
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,200
Gone.

995
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,600
Use the commode story?

996
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,100
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.

997
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,100
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

998
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,300
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.

999
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,900
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1000
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:05,900
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.

1001
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,100
What is this?

1002
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,000
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1003
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:16,200
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

1004
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,500
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.

1005
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,000
Think about it like it's a joke.

1006
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,100
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.

1007
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,000
You can tell a joke,
can't you?

1008
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,900
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...

1009
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,900
and tell a joke, all right?

1010
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:34,700
The things you gotta remember
are the details.

1011
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,700
The details sell your story.

1012
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,700
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.

1013
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,300
You gotta know
all the details--

1014
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,000
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.

1015
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,700
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.

1016
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,600
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...

1017
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,500
they used in high school.

1018
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,400
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...

1019
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,800
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...

1020
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,200
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

1021
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,500
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

1022
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,300
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.

1023
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,000
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...

1024
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,100
and how you perceived
the events that went down.

1025
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,000
The only way to do that...

1026
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,900
is keep sayin' it...

1027
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,400
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

1028
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,500
This is during
the L.A. marijuana drought, 1986.

1029
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:36,700
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...

1030
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,800
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.

1031
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,100
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

1032
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,900
and all my friends knew it.

1033
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,600
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--"

1034
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,200
I say, "Hey, dude.

1035
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,300
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"

1036
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:01,100
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.

1037
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,400
It got to be--

1038
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:12,100
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.

1039
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,600
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.

1040
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,900
She didn't even have to
meet these people.

1041
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,800
I was doing all the work.

1042
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:26,100
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.

1043
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,600
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.

1044
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,700
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"

1045
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,100
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.

1046
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
When I get some,
I'll call you."

1047
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,400
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.

1048
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,800
They're my friends and everything,
but still--

1049
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:45,100
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.

1050
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,400
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.

1051
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,000
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.

1052
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,100
This was a very weird situation.

1053
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,400
Remember back in '86...

1054
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,700
there was a major
fuckin' drought.

1055
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,100
Nobody had anything.

1056
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,400
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.

1057
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,300
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.

1058
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,100
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...

1059
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,900
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.

1060
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,400
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--

1061
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,300
ten percent
and free pot for me...

1062
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,200
if I helped her
that weekend.

1063
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,600
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1064
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,900
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1065
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,000
What for?

1066
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,800
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.

1067
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,700
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.

1068
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,500
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1069
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,200
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

1070
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,100
She keeps asking me, asking me.

1071
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1072
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,200
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.

1073
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,200
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?

1074
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,300
The guy needed it right away.

1075
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,600
Anyway, we get to
the train station...

1076
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,600
and we're waitin' for the guy.

1077
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,100
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.

1078
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:04,800
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.

1079
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,600
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?

1080
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,600
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

1081
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,000
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.

1082
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...

1083
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,200
and they looked at me.

1084
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,000
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

1085
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,600
German shepherd starts barking.

1086
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,800
He's barkin' at me.

1087
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,400
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.

1088
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:43,900
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':

1089
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,800
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."

1090
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,200
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.

1091
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,700
Bam! Right in the face.

1092
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:56,600
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.

1093
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,900
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1094
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,800
They can smell it on me.

1095
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,100
Shut up.

1096
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,500
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.

1097
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,400
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...

1098
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,800
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."

1099
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,700
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...

1100
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,400
"I know, I know."

1101
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,900
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.

1102
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:26,600
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!

1103
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,600
Put your hands on the dash."

1104
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,600
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.

1105
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,900
"I know, buddy, I know."

1106
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,600
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.

1107
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,200
And I said...

1108
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,100
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...

1109
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,600
if you don't put your hands up."

1110
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,100
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...

1111
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,300
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?

1112
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,400
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1113
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,600
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.

1114
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,900
What was he goin' for?

1115
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,200
His fucking registration.

1116
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,900
- You're kidding.
- No, man!

1117
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,600
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.

1118
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,900
That close, man.

1119
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,100
You knew how to handle
that situation.

1120
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.

1121
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,400
Tell me more about Cabot.

1122
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,200
I don't know.

1123
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,100
He's a cool guy.

1124
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,400
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.

1125
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,200
You remember
the Fantastic Four?

1126
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,100
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...

1127
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,000
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?

1128
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,300
Thing.

1129
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,100
Motherfucker...

1130
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,100
Iooks just like the Thing.

1131
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,700
Hey! Showtime!

1132
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,600
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.

1133
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,300
I'll be right down.

1134
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,000
He'll be right down.

1135
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,800
Don't pussy out on me now.

1136
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,700
They don't know.

1137
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,900
They don't know shit.

1138
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,000
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.

1139
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,400
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.

1140
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,800
There goes our boy.

1141
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,900
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...

1142
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,400
to work undercover.

1143
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,300
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.

1144
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,500
I know what I'm talking about.

1145
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,100
Black women ain't the same
as white women.

1146
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,500
There's a slight difference.

1147
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,300
Very funny.
You know what I mean.

1148
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,700
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

1149
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,500
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.

1150
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,000
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.

1151
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,800
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...

1152
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:55,200
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1153
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,500
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...

1154
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,300
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.

1155
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:04,400
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.

1156
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,400
Tell you guys a story.

1157
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:11,200
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.

1158
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,100
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

1159
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:16,600
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.

1160
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,500
Where was she from?
Compton?

1161
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,800
She's from Ladora Heights.

1162
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,200
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.

1163
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,500
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.

1164
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,100
It's the black Palos Verdes.

1165
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,900
Anyway...

1166
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:36,200
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1167
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,900
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.

1168
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,700
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.

1169
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:45,600
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...

1170
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,900
about the black female cop?

1171
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,800
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar! "

1172
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,600
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.

1173
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,500
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.

1174
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,400
Pam Grier did the film.

1175
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:05,000
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1176
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,100
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?

1177
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.

1178
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,200
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.

1179
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,500
Anne Francis.

1180
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,300
No. That was Honey West.

1181
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,000
Anne Francis is white.

1182
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,200
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.

1183
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,700
We come into the club
one night...

1184
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,600
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.

1185
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,700
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.

1186
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,300
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"

1187
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,200
Apparently Lady E...

1188
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:39,600
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.

1189
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,700
He used to do things to her.

1190
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,600
Like what?
What would he do?

1191
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,300
Beat her up?

1192
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,200
I don't know.
He just did things.

1193
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,900
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1194
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,100
She waits for him to get drunk.

1195
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,000
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.

1196
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,300
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...

1197
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,400
and glues his dick
to his belly.

1198
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,100
Jesus Christ!

1199
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,900
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.

1200
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:12,200
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.

1201
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,200
Was he all pissed off?

1202
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:21,300
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

1203
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:29,300
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?

1204
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,100
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.

1205
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Well, let me tell a joke.

1206
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,600
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...

1207
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,300
San Quentin...

1208
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,300
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.

1209
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,600
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?

1210
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,500
It's your fault, his fault--"

1211
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,200
All that bullshit.

1212
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,900
Finally somebody says...

1213
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,200
"Wait a minute.

1214
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,200
While we were
planning this caper...

1215
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,700
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."

1216
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:59,400
Got the message?

1217
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,400
I don't mean to holler at ya.

1218
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,900
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...

1219
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:11,300
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.

1220
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,200
Find me a different character
down there.

1221
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,500
Right now it's a matter
of business.

1222
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,000
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...

1223
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,800
who you already know...

1224
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,600
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.

1225
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,000
Under no circumstances...

1226
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,200
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...

1227
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,400
by your Christian names.

1228
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,700
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1229
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,500
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...

1230
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,300
where you might've done time...

1231
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,100
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

1232
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:49,000
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...

1233
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,500
is what you're gonna do.

1234
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,600
That should do it.

1235
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,100
These are your names--

1236
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...

1237
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:01,400
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...

1238
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,500
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

1239
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,100
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?

1240
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,200
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1241
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,800
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.

1242
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:17,100
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.

1243
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,500
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

1244
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,800
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.

1245
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,900
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.

1246
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,200
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.

1247
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,100
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1248
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,900
How about Mr. Purple?

1249
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

1250
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,400
You're not Mr. Purple.

1251
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,600
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

1252
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,300
Who cares what your name is?

1253
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,900
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

1254
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,600
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?

1255
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,200
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

1256
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,300
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.

1257
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,900
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

1258
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,400
There's two ways you can go
on this job--

1259
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,700
my way or the highway.

1260
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,700
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

1261
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,300
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.

1262
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,900
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1263
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,800
I'll move on
when I feel like it.

1264
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,600
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?

1265
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:23,200
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.

1266
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,300
Let's go to work.

1267
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,200
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1268
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,700
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.

1269
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,500
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.

1270
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,000
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.

1271
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,100
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

1272
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,700
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.

1273
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,800
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my dick.

1274
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1275
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:56,200
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.

1276
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,200
We're there
for those stones, period.

1277
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,700
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1278
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,700
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.

1279
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,700
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1280
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,100
A store like this
is insured up the ass.

1281
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,900
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

1282
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:20,600
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

1283
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,900
smash their nose with your gun.

1284
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,300
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

1285
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:28,300
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.

1286
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1287
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,600
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.

1288
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:38,500
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1289
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,100
If it's the manager,
that's different.

1290
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,400
The managers know not
to fuck around...

1291
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,600
so if he's giving you static...

1292
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,800
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.

1293
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,700
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.

1294
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,900
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.

1295
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,800
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.

1296
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,400
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.

1297
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,300
Fuck.

1298
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,800
Jesus.

1299
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,000
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.

1300
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,400
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.

1301
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,300
Is he dead?

1302
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,400
Did he die or not?

1303
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:05,900
Let's go.

1304
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,400
Hold it! Get out!

1305
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,900
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1306
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,900
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.

1307
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,700
I can't believe she killed me.

1308
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,200
Who'd have fucking thought that?

1309
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,900
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.

1310
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,800
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

1311
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,400
But you ain't dying.

1312
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,600
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

1313
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,600
I'm gonna die.
I know it.

1314
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,700
What the fuck happened?

1315
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:59,700
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1316
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,000
What? I didn't hear you.

1317
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,400
I said...

1318
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,600
Blonde went crazy.

1319
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:13,000
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1320
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,000
This cop?

1321
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,900
He went crazy?
Something like that?

1322
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:23,000
Worse or better?

1323
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,200
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.

1324
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1325
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,100
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.

1326
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,700
What'd I tell ya?

1327
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:38,200
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1328
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:41,400
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.

1329
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:45,000
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1330
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,000
I don't buy it.

1331
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,400
Doesn't make sense.

1332
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:56,000
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.

1333
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,500
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1334
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,700
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.

1335
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:05,800
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.

1336
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,600
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

1337
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,700
was gonna kill you...

1338
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,900
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...

1339
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,800
take the diamonds and scram.

1340
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:17,900
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?

1341
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,300
I swear on my mother's soul...

1342
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,000
that's what happened.

1343
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,900
The man you killed
just got released from prison.

1344
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,800
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1345
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,400
He could've fuckin' walked.

1346
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:35,600
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

1347
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,500
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.

1348
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,800
He did four years for us.

1349
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,200
So, Mr. Orange...

1350
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,200
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...

1351
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,900
who did four years
for my father...

1352
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,700
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...

1353
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,700
you're telling me that
now that he's free...

1354
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,600
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...

1355
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:04,200
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...

1356
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,000
to rip us off?

1357
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,900
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1358
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,500
What the hell for?

1359
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,400
It'd just be more bullshit.

1360
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,400
This man set us up.

1361
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,600
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.

1362
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:27,300
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?

1363
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,900
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.

1364
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,300
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...

1365
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,700
what you're talking about.

1366
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:40,300
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1367
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,000
Like hell I am.

1368
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,100
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

1369
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,800
He's a good kid.

1370
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,300
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1371
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,100
We're all real emotional.

1372
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,300
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.

1373
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:56,700
You don't know jack shit!

1374
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,900
I do.

1375
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,800
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...

1376
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,900
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.

1377
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,900
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.

1378
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,900
How do you know all this?

1379
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,300
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.

1380
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,500
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1381
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:17,200
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.

1382
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,500
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1383
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,900
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

1384
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,700
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.

1385
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:29,600
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1386
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,500
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1387
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,100
Larry, look...

1388
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,100
it's been quite a long time.

1389
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:37,500
A lot of jobs.

1390
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,500
There's no need for this, man.

1391
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,900
Let's just put our guns down...

1392
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,600
and let's settle this...

1393
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,300
with a fucking conversation.

1394
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,700
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.

1395
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,900
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.

1396
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:56,200
Larry, we have been friends.

1397
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,200
You respect my dad
and I respect you...

1398
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,100
but I'll put bullets
in you.

1399
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,500
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.

1400
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,400
Goddamn you, Joe...

1401
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,800
don't make me do this.

1402
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,500
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!

1403
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,700
I'm sorry, kid.

1404
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,800
Looks like we're gonna...

1405
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,000
do a little time.

1406
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,100
I'm a cop.

1407
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,700
Larry...

1408
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,800
I'm sorry.

1409
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,600
I'm...

1410
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,800
so sorry.

1411
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,800
I'm a cop.

1412
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,500
I'm sorry.

1413
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,200
I'm sorry.

1414
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,300
I'm...

1415
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:00,600
sorr--

1416
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,300
Freeze!

1417
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:06,300
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

1418
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,200
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1419
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:11,000
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1420
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,200
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!
