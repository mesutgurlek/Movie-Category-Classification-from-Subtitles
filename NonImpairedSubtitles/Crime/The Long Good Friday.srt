1
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,089
Two large Bushmills please, darling.

2
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,310
Do you want another drink?

3
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:55,816
I'll buy you.

4
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,363
What's happening ?

5
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:09,617
- Get in.
- Alright

6
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:14,165
- Inside.

7
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,918
Harold will be well pleased.

8
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,412
- When is he back?
- Today.

9
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,377
Highly confidential.

10
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:36,552
I need them tomorrow,
for a counsel meeting.

11
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:39,886
No sweat, I'll get them photo-copied.

12
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:42,345
And the Americans?

13
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,930
- I'll reckon they're coming.
- Good.

14
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:50,060
- About the nosh: on the corporation?
- Of course, counsellor.

15
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,899
- See you, Jeff.
- See you.

16
00:08:38,463 --> 00:08:39,839
Wait a minute!

17
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:36,239
These are plans, he needs them
back by this afternoon.

18
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,951
Good old George.

19
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,909
- Everything alright while I was away?
- Yeah.

20
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,166
The new casino has gone through.

21
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,831
- No problems?
- No, everything's alright.

22
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,174
Did anyone guess where I was?

23
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:54,637
Alan reckoned a health farm.

24
00:09:55,474 --> 00:09:58,012
One or two rumours about New York.

25
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,683
- But nobody guessed?
- No.

26
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:39,433
Should have left 10 minutes ago,
I'm late for church.

27
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,861
I hate being late for church.

28
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:45,856
There you are.

29
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:49,735
Bye bye, have a nice Easter.

30
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:54,742
God rot your soul.

31
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:18,906
Oh Christ Harold she's always with us
when she goes to church.

32
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,116
She's got really religious in her
old age, hasn't she?

33
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:25,995
Church 3 times a day, it's Good Friday.

34
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,626
Have a Bloody Mary.

35
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:31,290
She thinks Paula is an angel
and I'm the devil in disguise.

36
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:36,462
Ah well, me and Paula have only been divorced
for 10 years, give her a chance to get used to it.

37
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,598
Cheers.

38
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:42,302
- Have you organised everything?
- Yes, it's coming along.

39
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,521
Charlie should be landing about now.

40
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,569
Here.

41
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:54,523
- Maybe we should have gone to the airport to meet him.
- Nah, play it cool.

42
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:59,581
When the governor of Coca-Cola drops in to London
the Queen don't go dashing off to Heathrow, does she?

43
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:02,956
- Queen?
- Well you know what I mean.

44
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:04,707
All plated up, right?

45
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:07,800
He went to school with princess Ann,
played hockey with her, all that.

46
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:12,264
- It's lacrosse at Benenden, hockey's frightfully vulgar.
- Yes, yes plenty of, yeah.

47
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:14,766
The Yanks love snobbery.

48
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:18,934
They really feel they've arrived in England
if the upper classes treat them like shit.

49
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:22,109
- Gives them a sense of history.

50
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:25,277
We'd better check how the chef's progressing.

51
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:28,107
That geezer don't half know about grub.

52
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,742
The smells that have been coming up from the galley
all morning have been driving me potty.

53
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:34,666
You lay off the vodka.

54
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:42,374
- It's going well?
- Madam, look at this.

55
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,055
These blue plates with these
white plates, it's ridiculous.

56
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,147
Now that's a right horrible ponce.

57
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,643
The polly's French isn't he?

58
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:00,277
It's really splendid.

59
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:03,364
We thank you very much.

60
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:05,906
Very nice.

61
00:13:06,163 --> 00:13:08,655
These French geezers really know their stuff, eh?

62
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:12,251
- Are they new?
- Bought 'em yesterday, 20 quid a piece.

63
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,961
I bet Harold was reluctant
to take the labels off, eh?

64
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:19,172
He broke two of them demonstrating
their exquisite delicacy.

65
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:22,223
He doesn't know his own strength.

66
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:28,561
Have you sorted out Immigration for the Yank?

67
00:13:28,816 --> 00:13:32,269
- Yeah Parky's dealt with that.
- Then you may go and have a drink on deck.

68
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,670
Hello, are you alright?

69
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,588
Having a good time?

70
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,425
Enjoy yourselves.

71
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:41,184
Counsellors.

72
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:42,716
Excuse me I won't keep him.

73
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:47,351
Those plans came in very handy
my son, much obliged.

74
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:49,267
No sweat, Harold.

75
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:53,113
- The license on the casino,
did that go through alright, no problems?
- A slight problem.

76
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:56,119
- How's that?
- Counsellor Taylor seems to think you're a gangster.

77
00:15:57,622 --> 00:16:01,537
- What's the SP on the American?
- Just pump him full of information, everything you've got.

78
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,879
- Instant planning permission, all that sort of chat?
- Yeah.

79
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:08,091
The Yanks think we're a cock handed corner shop over here.

80
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,135
Exhume the fishes, right?

81
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,597
I'll tell him I quickly mind an enterprise that should appeal?

82
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,851
Parky, you're not drinking?

83
00:16:19,357 --> 00:16:21,563
Harold you know I only drink when I'm on duty.

84
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,983
- How's business, alright?
- A drizzle of complaints.

85
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:25,732
You get a lot of that in your game, eh?

86
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,195
Hello, Dave.

87
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:31,619
- How are you, last time I saw you, you had spots.
- Thanks very much.

88
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:34,364
Even I notice the coppers are getting younger now.

89
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,543
- He's a detective sergeant now Harold.
- Is he?

90
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,457
Celebration, come here.

91
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,466
Champagne my son.

92
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:43,171
Here's to you.

93
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,836
Nice seeing real friends doing well.

94
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:48,307
Here's to real friends.

95
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,101
Hi George.

96
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:53,469
Jeff.

97
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,012
Won't be a minute.

98
00:16:57,486 --> 00:17:02,114
Keep your eyes on the boy's behaviour, will you?
I don't want any of 'em acting like delinquents.

99
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,609
No chance, they know it's important.

100
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:07,030
I told 'em to put their wedding suits on.

101
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,249
I think you're gonna like Charlie.

102
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:12,003
So what's the plan?

103
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:13,630
A cocktail here so we can clog the marina,

104
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:17,832
then off down river so they can see
the scope of the whole project.

105
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:21,180
- Have you fixed the moorings?
- It's all under control.

106
00:17:21,516 --> 00:17:23,058
Another thing...

107
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:26,308
Harris has got a lot of talking to do
this afternoon...

108
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,981
...can you keep him off the booze?
Top him off with Perrier water or something.

109
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:33,188
Harold, he's here.

110
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:35,523
You two pipe him aboard and I'll be up, right?

111
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,002
I can't believe you.

112
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:51,792
- The kid from New Yersey, eh?
- The boy from Stepney.

113
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:54,511
Charlie, have some champagne.

114
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,640
You should be the captain of this boat,
great timing.

115
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,894
Listen I wanna propose a toast.

116
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:04,316
- Hands across the ocean, right?
- To the future.

117
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,027
To the future here.

118
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:10,780
Harold, I don't think you met Tony,
when you were over there?

119
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:13,110
- Tony?
- My lawyer.

120
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,574
- Mr. Shand, Tony.
- Very nice to meet you.

121
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:22,504
- Charlie, Tony would you like to come and meet some people now?
- Good.

122
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:24,500
They're important, but they're nice. Come on.

123
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:29,845
Keep your eye on that Tony.

124
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:32,763
He never said he was gonna bring anybody.

125
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,678
They always come in two's, like the bailiffs.

126
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,892
Means they mean business.

127
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:37,342
Hola.

128
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,511
Hi.

129
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,733
"Happy are those who are called to His supper"

130
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,736
"Lord I am not worthy to receive You"

131
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:30,910
"but only say the word and I shall be healed."

132
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,061
My God!

133
00:20:56,318 --> 00:20:57,646
Ladies and gentlemen.

134
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:08,281
I'm not a politician.

135
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,964
I'm a businessman with a sense of history.

136
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:16,256
And I'm also a Londoner,

137
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:23,131
and today is a day of great historical
significance for London.

138
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:27,641
Our country is not an island anymore.

139
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:32,102
We're a leading European state.

140
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:37,407
And I believe that this is the decade,

141
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,035
in which London will become Europe's capital.

142
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:46,538
Having cleared away the outdated,

143
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:51,294
we've got mile after mile and
acre after acre of land,

144
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,502
for our future prosperity.

145
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:58,507
No other city in the world...

146
00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:03,107
has got right in its centre,
such an opportunity...

147
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:06,224
for profitable progress.

148
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,563
So it's important that the right people...

149
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:15,204
mastermind the new London.

150
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:22,622
Proven people, with nerve,
knowledge and expertise.

151
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,970
That, ladies and gentlemen,

152
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,262
is why you are all here today.

153
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,852
All trusted friends.

154
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:43,611
and why Charlie and Tony are here today,
our American friends,

155
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:49,280
to endorse the global nature of this venture.

156
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:52,957
Let's hear it ladies and gentlemen.

157
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:57,203
Hands across the ocean.

158
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,857
There used to be 80 or 90 ships in here at one time.

159
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,355
They used to queue up to get in...

160
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:17,230
all the way up to Galleon's Reach
right down to Tilbury.

161
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:21,952
Used to be the greatest docks in
the world at one time, this.

162
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:25,030
Things change Harold, don't get nostalgic.

163
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,369
Look to the future.

164
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:30,083
You realise you're 35 minutes away from Europe?

165
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,499
Great potential.

166
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,419
I live in a new country,

167
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:38,011
and I respect the past, but always
keep my eye on the future.

168
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,894
Don't touch, I'll take care of that.

169
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:54,899
You've got to go to sleep Charlie,
we've got a tight schedule.

170
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:57,776
I want you to meet my property lawyers, the best...

171
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,408
and then there's an accountant who
specialises in gambling tax.

172
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:04,539
This isn't a horse race,
don't rush me Harold.

173
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:06,706
Then there's someone you've got to meet.

174
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:10,799
Harold I said don't rush me,
I hate tight schedules.

175
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:15,256
I've got everything covered that I
have to cover, but in my own time.

176
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:20,476
We're just docking now, it will be
nice and quiet if you want to sleep.

177
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:25,562
Come on Harold, let's leave Charlie
alone for a while.

178
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:38,792
Bad luck putting the hat on the bed.

179
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:43,627
Relax, he'll be alright.

180
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:47,097
Yeah, poor old sod is tired.

181
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:20,426
Look out for the boys in blue.

182
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:32,688
Yeah?

183
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:36,241
Yeah.

184
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:41,205
What?

185
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,923
Right.

186
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,854
This is...

187
00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:04,766
diabolical.

188
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,351
What is it?

189
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:12,107
Blown up, he's dead.

190
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:17,081
Eric is dead, a car bomb.

191
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:22,540
My mother's alright, she's suffering from shock,
she's in the London Hospital.

192
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,330
I don't understand.

193
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:29,091
You need a million dollar computer
to understand this.

194
00:26:30,182 --> 00:26:34,133
Who'd do such a thing, it's outrageous.
Outside a church...

195
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:37,854
you don't go crucifying people outside
a church on Good Friday.

196
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:41,110
- What's the matter Harold?
- Eric's been blown up.

197
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,523
- A bomb?
- Yeah in the Rolls.

198
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:48,114
- I don't believe it, when?
- Just now.

199
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:51,908
Mother's in hospital suffering from shock,
I'm not surprised.

200
00:26:52,584 --> 00:26:54,957
She went to church to say her prayers,
not to get blown up.

201
00:26:55,254 --> 00:26:59,205
- But why?
- Someone tried to discredit you in front of...

202
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:01,301
The Yanks?

203
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,427
No, nobody knew, did they?

204
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:08,384
- Well they mustn't find out.
- They're sleeping.

205
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:13,605
Right, I want everybody in the corporation
working on this, fast!

206
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,402
And I want Colin here.

207
00:27:15,653 --> 00:27:17,896
Where is he? He should have been here.
Where is he?

208
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,818
- He went swimming.
- Swimming?

209
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:21,785
He should have been here.

210
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:24,706
Right, I want everyone working.

211
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:27,709
Razors, you round them all up
and get them moving, fast.

212
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:31,543
Right, keep them on their toes because
I want this settled, tonight.

213
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:36,044
And you'd better see your mother.

214
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:39,765
Yeah.

215
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:46,142
Listen, if anyone hears anything, anything at all,
I'll be at the Mayfair casino, right?

216
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:52,070
It's the work of a maniac.

217
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:59,539
I'll have his carcass dripping blood by midnight.

218
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:39,170
More bad news...

219
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:41,668
...Colin.

220
00:28:41,924 --> 00:28:43,799
- Colin?
- Yeah.

221
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:46,256
He's dead.

222
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:51,453
I did my national service with Colin

223
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,667
We did 6 months in the glasshouse together.

224
00:29:56,386 --> 00:30:01,132
Two kids of 18, 6 months. They put us right
through it the bastards.

225
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,929
Salisbury Plain manoeuvres.

226
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:12,360
Used to hump this bleedin' great wireless about.

227
00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:20,412
One window, snow, blizzards,

228
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:22,491
freezing the bollocks off the ponies.

229
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:24,704
I got lost.

230
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,457
In them days you stayed lost,
until they nicked you for being AWOL.

231
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:33,588
And Colin, on a 24 hour pass,

232
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:37,806
he came out looking for me on his own.

233
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,428
It's lucky he found me or I
would've froze to death.

234
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,560
Yeah.

235
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:48,275
Colin never hurt a fly...

236
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,489
...well only when it was necessary.

237
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:56,828
It was always clean, never anything
malicious about Colin.

238
00:30:57,416 --> 00:31:00,085
- Why size him up?
- On my grief.

239
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:01,914
Sorry, H.

240
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:10,839
Me and Colin was very close.

241
00:31:13,017 --> 00:31:15,343
I've known him since we was at school.

242
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:20,901
What's going on?

243
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:27,527
They try and blow up me mum,
wipe out me best mate...

244
00:31:28,994 --> 00:31:30,821
What are they trying to do?

245
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:33,697
Put the frighteners on me, wind me up, what?

246
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:43,832
Harold,

247
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:49,057
I've kept it all incognito, they're gonna
collect the body in an ice cream van.

248
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:53,522
There's a lot of dignity in that, isn't there?
Going out like a raspberry ripple.

249
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:56,976
They're gonna store the body in the
freezer down the abattoir

250
00:31:57,736 --> 00:31:59,610
Alright, granddad.

251
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:02,896
Thanks for the cool.

252
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:07,829
- Did anyone see anything?
- Not what happened,

253
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:11,000
the pool attendant found him but
I told her it was a haemorrhage.

254
00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:13,577
- Good lad.
- Better close the bars, Harold.

255
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:16,329
No, open up, let 'em enjoy the holiday.

256
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:20,418
If you hear anything, anything at all,
you give me a bell.

257
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,091
Come on.

258
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,831
- Thank Christ you're here.
- Any news?

259
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,964
Colin's murdered.

260
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,294
- Colin's what?
- Dead.

261
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:57,760
- Where?
- In the swimming pool.

262
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:01,889
- Drowned
- Don't be stupid, he did life saving.

263
00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:04,137
What does it all mean, a bomb in here and...

264
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:07,603
- A what?
- There's a bomb in the casino.

265
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,558
You'd better show us.

266
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,288
I wonder how it got disconnected?

267
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:23,579
Well the wire must have come loose
when Lou opened it.

268
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,755
Stroke of luck though, innit?

269
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:31,344
Last night...

270
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:35,089
...where there any peculiarities?

271
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:38,811
No, the usual crowd, regular punters,
nothing really.

272
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:40,771
But no strangers?

273
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:44,849
A few Arabs, it was a good night,
nothing unusual.

274
00:33:45,862 --> 00:33:47,606
Nothing unusual he says!?

275
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,492
Eric's been blown to smithereens,
Colin's been carved up,

276
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:53,702
and I've got a bomb in me casino,

277
00:33:53,955 --> 00:33:56,790
and you say nothing unusual?
- Well you know what I mean Harold.

278
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,246
Parky meeting King George V dock now.

279
00:34:00,713 --> 00:34:04,379
He's put out a story the bomb in the car
was a gas leak, it will buy us some time.

280
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,585
Nice one, come here.

281
00:34:09,472 --> 00:34:12,428
There was nothing unusual when I was
in New York, was there?

282
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,056
No, nothing at all.

283
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:17,935
- Nothing alien
- No.

284
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:22,731
How much did we pay Parky last year, 20 grand?

285
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,733
- More.
- Right.

286
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:27,442
Then he can start earning his bloody money.

287
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,631
Who's having a go at me?

288
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:47,508
Can you think of anybody who might have
an old score to settle, or something?

289
00:34:50,604 --> 00:34:52,396
Who's big enough to take you on?

290
00:34:56,903 --> 00:34:58,777
Well there was a few.

291
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:00,824
Like who?

292
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:07,790
Nah, they're all dead.

293
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:37,699
Let's walk.

294
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:44,329
We can't have bombs going off Harold,
we can't have corpses,

295
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:48,168
I had to stick my neck right out to keep
this out of the forensic blokes' hands.

296
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:51,174
- Did you come up with anything?
- Nothing, I thought you were gonna tell me.

297
00:35:51,425 --> 00:35:53,632
- What, no whispers?
- Nothing, not a thing.

298
00:35:58,475 --> 00:35:59,804
Look at this place.

299
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:05,312
You know I once caught the pocks
of some Indonesian bird here,

300
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,275
I was just a bobby on the beat then.

301
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:13,318
So this is where they're gonna build
the 1988 Olympic stadium?

302
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:18,496
Can you imagine nig-nogs doing the
long jump along these quays?

303
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:21,709
Stick a rocket up their arsehole,
they'll jump alright.

304
00:36:25,965 --> 00:36:29,834
- I want action on this, Parky.
- The Yanks are clean, we've checked them out.

305
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:35,427
You got to go down to a third division messenger
to even come up with a sniff of villainy with that lot.

306
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,812
How about Tottenham?

307
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,770
They can't even nick car batteries
without getting electrocuted.

308
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,359
Some of the Clancy mob are out.

309
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:50,866
This is too accomplished for them.

310
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:54,113
Besides no one's had their teeth pulled out.

311
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:57,251
The spades?

312
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,628
Do they overlap?

313
00:37:00,923 --> 00:37:03,497
I've never dealt in narcotics.

314
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,293
I don't know, don't know where
they're after do I?

315
00:37:06,847 --> 00:37:08,674
I'll check it out.

316
00:37:09,516 --> 00:37:11,176
I'm sorry about Colin.

317
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:16,062
I'll put him on the missing persons list,
that should hold it off for a while.

318
00:37:17,025 --> 00:37:21,189
- Just as well, the commissioner will be poking around.
- Well stall him.

319
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,278
We should have sorted this out
by this afternoon, I'm hoping.

320
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,323
We're looking forward to this this deal
of yours Harold, with the Yanks,

321
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,872
the legitimisation of your corporation.

322
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,957
But we don't like fuss. Calm exteriors.

323
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:42,884
For 10 years there's been no aggro and it's all been
down to you Harold, you've had it under control.

324
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:47,682
Now do yourself a favour and get this lot under control
before the heavy mob is on you like a ton of horse shit.

325
00:37:48,937 --> 00:37:50,562
Give us that case.

326
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:54,102
Get that checked out, will you.

327
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:56,935
- What is it?
- It's the bomb from the casino.

328
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:02,317
- Are you riding around with a bleedin' bomb?
- It's alright, it's been disconnected.

329
00:38:03,955 --> 00:38:08,618
- I'll get the bomb people to have a look at it.
- No Parky, get it checked out privately, right?

330
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,121
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

331
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:17,168
I want the name of your top grass.

332
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:21,093
No way, Harold

333
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,102
- I'll get more out of him than you can.
- That's true.

334
00:38:25,313 --> 00:38:30,355
You do realise how this deal is gonna
be worth in 1988, do you?

335
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:32,903
Billions.

336
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:37,033
I'll cut in you in for a percentage
for the name of your grass.

337
00:38:39,704 --> 00:38:41,828
- He trusts me Harold.
- I trust ta.

338
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:46,116
- I've known him a lot of years.
- Then you should remember his name, shouldn't you?

339
00:38:49,174 --> 00:38:51,297
- If I give it to you...
- No ifs, Parky.

340
00:38:54,389 --> 00:38:55,799
A percentage?

341
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:00,634
Erroll.

342
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:03,138
- Erroll the Ponce from Brixton?
- Yeah..

343
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:14,865
Can't trust nobody, did you hear all that?

344
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:16,907
Brixton.

345
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:37,015
Which one's Erroll's house?

346
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:41,142
Never heard of him, man.

347
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:45,441
Razors, teach him some respect.

348
00:39:55,544 --> 00:39:56,872
Fucking hell!

349
00:39:57,504 --> 00:39:58,784
What are you doing?

350
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,578
Are you crazy?

351
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:03,511
I don't like people looking up
my nose when I'm talking to them

352
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:05,459
He could have killed me.

353
00:40:06,556 --> 00:40:09,261
The way it's been going today I'll
probably get you cut price funeral.

354
00:40:12,646 --> 00:40:14,189
Now Erroll's house, which one is it?

355
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:17,609
Number 33.

356
00:40:19,654 --> 00:40:24,068
This used to be a nice street, this.
Decent families, no scum.

357
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:48,342
The beauty and the beast - blow his head off.

358
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:52,938
Are you in training or are you doing this for pleasure?

359
00:40:54,028 --> 00:40:58,193
- We had a party last night.
- Booze, bins and pox.

360
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:00,984
Harold, get them to take that metal out of my ear.

361
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,950
No, I'm disgusted. Shoot him, let's put some muck
on the ceiling.

362
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:08,293
Please! What do you want?

363
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,755
Have you seen anything of my Eric flying
past your window about 2 hours ago?

364
00:41:13,884 --> 00:41:15,544
What are you talking about?

365
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:18,425
Come on, downstairs. Down to the kitchen.

366
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:26,556
Put some deodorant on, I'm heavily into personal protection.

367
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:45,742
Filth.

368
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,425
Is there no decency in this disgusting world?

369
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,639
Here, while it's with us,
give yourself another prick.

370
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:06,562
Tell him what your name is.

371
00:42:08,115 --> 00:42:09,313
Razors.

372
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:13,442
Otherwise known as Clapham Junction.

373
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,246
Or as the youth of today call him:
The Human Spirograph.

374
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,459
65 inches of stitching.

375
00:42:22,715 --> 00:42:26,132
- Now you're gonna feel what it's like boy.
- He was a very popular fellow.

376
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:28,084
Harold, what do you want?

377
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:36,135
I have it from a very reliable source,
that you know what's what,

378
00:42:37,565 --> 00:42:40,567
and you have ears and I wanna
know what you've heard.

379
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:42,527
Look am I supposed to know something?

380
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:45,532
Razors.

381
00:42:47,827 --> 00:42:50,116
- What do you know about Colin?
- What about Colin?

382
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:52,581
I don't know nothing about Colin.

383
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,583
Look Harold, I've been here all night.

384
00:42:55,503 --> 00:42:56,831
Look what's up?

385
00:42:57,088 --> 00:43:01,585
Someone's been playing Guy Fawkes with
my Rolls, that's what's up mate.

386
00:43:05,348 --> 00:43:06,628
What about Eric?

387
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:08,433
- Eric?
- You heard.

388
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,681
Well he doesn't like Colin.

389
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,062
I mean, queers get right up his hooter, you know?

390
00:43:16,403 --> 00:43:19,190
After what happened this morning
you'd have to find his hooter to get up it.

391
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:22,026
Is something up with him then?

392
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,579
Well, let's put it this way:

393
00:43:25,997 --> 00:43:29,581
apart from his arsehole being about 50 yards
away from his brains,

394
00:43:30,335 --> 00:43:34,001
and the choirboys playing "'unt the thimble"
with the rest of him, he ain't too happy.

395
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:35,585
Well I haven't heard anything.

396
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:38,167
Well use your scarce ears.

397
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:52,482
Listen Erroll, the only decent grass
is the grass that grasses to me, right?

398
00:43:52,736 --> 00:43:54,445
Harold, if I knew something...

399
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:01,996
Colin's been stabbed.

400
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:10,416
Well his boyfriend used to come here to score,
but he never said nothing so I know nothing.

401
00:44:11,174 --> 00:44:15,671
Well a lot of people come here to score
but we sell very good shit.

402
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:17,669
Like you?

403
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:21,055
- Who's got it in for me?
- I don't know!.

404
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:23,135
Cut him.

405
00:44:28,778 --> 00:44:30,522
I still can't hear anything.

406
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:37,362
I don't fucking know.

407
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:55,304
- Minded your car, mister.
- You should've asked for the money first.

408
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,970
I could've slashed your tires.

409
00:45:02,526 --> 00:45:05,444
Here you are, don't get drunk.

410
00:45:12,204 --> 00:45:13,579
Little acorns.

411
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:15,660
Little acorns grow..

412
00:45:15,917 --> 00:45:18,373
Exactly, that's how I started.

413
00:45:19,003 --> 00:45:20,961
- Didn't we all?
- Not Jeff.

414
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:23,006
Busy getting himself an education, weren't ya?

415
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:27,091
- Different generation, that's all.
- Billiard halls was my game.

416
00:45:27,763 --> 00:45:29,638
Remember old Sammy?

417
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:34,177
I tore up 2 of his tables in a week,
he used to pay me not to play.

418
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:40,689
What do you think?

419
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,072
You told the yanks you control it here,

420
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:49,571
if they're sticking that many millions in it,
they wanna test if you DO control it.

421
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,952
No it's way off the mark.

422
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:58,798
They might check books and finances but they aren't going
to wipe out my firm, are they? I don't want anarchy.

423
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:06,133
These people deserve something better than this.

424
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:10,892
Not dog shit on the doorstep.

425
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,535
So nothing?

426
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:36,757
- Not a word, or no one's heard.
- No one's heard nothing?

427
00:46:37,179 --> 00:46:38,839
That just ain't natural.

428
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,181
It's like one of them silent, deadly farts.
No clue, and then pow, you go cross-eyed.

429
00:46:46,564 --> 00:46:50,479
- We've asked all the usual.
- Well maybe it's about time you asked the unusual, innit?

430
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:52,016
Like who?

431
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:54,687
- All the chaps are out asking, H.
- Well you've given up?

432
00:46:55,783 --> 00:46:58,405
- Where are they?
- Down the casino.

433
00:46:58,661 --> 00:47:01,117
Well get them of their arses and
make them start again, right?

434
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,868
Go on, what are you waiting for?

435
00:47:13,804 --> 00:47:16,260
- Have you heard from Parky?
- Not yet.

436
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,973
Eugene will phone the minute he checks in.

437
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,349
Razors is back with the car.

438
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,185
Dinner at the pub.

439
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:28,988
Oh Christ.

440
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:31,148
Well you got to entertain 'em a bit, haven't ya?

441
00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:41,001
- Are you refreshed?
- You bet, I'm ready for your tightest schedule.

442
00:47:41,378 --> 00:47:44,415
Like you said Charlie, it's not a horse race, relax.

443
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,000
Sorry to hear the news Harold.

444
00:47:47,552 --> 00:47:49,295
Victoria was just telling us about it.

445
00:47:51,973 --> 00:47:56,019
Yes, well she hasn't been well for a long time,
hasn't she? Poor mother.

446
00:47:56,646 --> 00:47:59,564
Don't worry, she'll be alright.
She's a fire, you know.

447
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,685
- I had to spend some time with her, you understand.
- That's nice.

448
00:48:04,196 --> 00:48:06,106
Shall we go, dinner?

449
00:48:06,824 --> 00:48:09,494
It's my favourite pub Charlie,
you're gonna love it, I'll tell ya.

450
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,368
I bought this pub about 2 years ago Charlie

451
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:23,337
the brewery turned it into slum, it's got real
old London character,

452
00:48:23,593 --> 00:48:25,717
- you'll love it.
- That's nice

453
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:29,423
- I'm taking the counsellor in the Merc.
- Oh God help me have you seen him drive?

454
00:48:30,352 --> 00:48:32,060
You can always walk, sunshine.

455
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:34,748
Let me out.

456
00:49:35,553 --> 00:49:36,833
Stay back, stay back.

457
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:39,138
It might still be dangerous, stay back.

458
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,399
- Are you alright, Pete?
- I'm alright.

459
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,114
- What about your customers?
- I don't know I think they're alright.

460
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,239
It blew up there, there was no one up there.

461
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:03,740
Jesus.

462
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:09,000
If we've been 5 minutes earlier...

463
00:50:11,271 --> 00:50:12,682
Yeah.

464
00:50:12,939 --> 00:50:14,220
What the hell's going on?

465
00:50:14,483 --> 00:50:16,939
- Keep it on the sofa.
- Alright.

466
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:21,773
- What is it, what is it?
- You gotta help Pete, right?

467
00:50:23,744 --> 00:50:26,864
Occupy 'em.

468
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:28,866
Anything that's necessary
just buy me some time, right?

469
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:32,461
- Yeah I'll take them to Justine's.
- Terrific.

470
00:50:32,713 --> 00:50:34,456
Get Razors to book a table.

471
00:50:36,717 --> 00:50:38,711
- It was the gas.
- Gas?

472
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:42,304
This natural gas causes dangerous leaks sometimes.

473
00:50:42,557 --> 00:50:46,010
Harold wants us to go onto a restaurant,
while he's dealing with it.

474
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:48,182
He'll join us later.

475
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:50,313
Jeff, stay with Harold will you, I'll drive.

476
00:51:20,393 --> 00:51:22,102
How did he get in here in the first place?

477
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:25,391
Do you know how many people come up here
during the night?

478
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:28,183
And nobody spotted nothing, nothing at all?

479
00:51:28,528 --> 00:51:29,939
Nothing happened tonight mate.

480
00:51:31,114 --> 00:51:35,065
Mind you, a couple of days ago two guys came up,
they wanted protection..

481
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,908
I thought they were comedians, they had
big heads, sunglasses,

482
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:42,001
I thought the agency send them down for cabaret.

483
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:45,541
Protection, on my boozer?

484
00:51:46,257 --> 00:51:47,835
he actually made threats?

485
00:51:48,093 --> 00:51:51,510
I told 'em to piss off, I took no notice of 'em.

486
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:56,551
- Much obliged.
- I'm sorry mate, you know...

487
00:51:57,103 --> 00:51:59,013
Didn't wanna worry you, sorry.

488
00:52:00,857 --> 00:52:02,352
Razors, come here.

489
00:52:03,778 --> 00:52:06,020
Get on the trumpet. I want all the corporation...

490
00:52:06,281 --> 00:52:08,688
at the Mayfair Casino in half an hour.

491
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:12,486
I want them all there, I don't want any excuses.

492
00:52:12,788 --> 00:52:14,911
I'm gonna nail these bastards, right?

493
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,918
- Who are they?
- Well we're gonna find out, aren't we?

494
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,421
It's getting dark, people get frightened
in the dark, they talk, don't they?

495
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,961
Hello Parky,

496
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:26,670
I'm afraid the business got a little bit burned.

497
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:34,263
What did these comedians look like?

498
00:52:34,606 --> 00:52:39,601
I don't know H., I've never seen them before,
they just looked like any other micks, heavy micks.

499
00:52:40,321 --> 00:52:42,360
- Micks?
- Yeah, you know, Irish.

500
00:52:43,157 --> 00:52:44,735
Quite hard looking Paddies.

501
00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:48,403
I'd never dream they'd do this, I'm sorry.

502
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:51,071
Harold.

503
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,582
Irish he said, Irish.

504
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,632
This is Special Branch Harold,
it ain't normal villainy.

505
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:05,174
- It's indecently abnormal, that was meant for me.
- It's serious.

506
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:07,924
Listen.

507
00:53:09,271 --> 00:53:12,937
Check out all the micks in the
heavy mob working on my manor.

508
00:53:13,192 --> 00:53:17,191
- I want names and addresses, right?
- Will you listen to what I'm trying to tell you.

509
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:19,946
- This very serious.
- Oh leave off.

510
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:23,241
It's just villains trying to
frighten their way into a few quid.

511
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:26,865
Harold, we're talking about bombs,
two bleedin'bombs.

512
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,837
- Did you get that one checked out by the way?
- Still waiting for the report.

513
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:31,629
Well get a fucking move on it.

514
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:35,965
Harold, if those boys are Irish it's a different game,

515
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:40,265
- now those boys don't know the rules.
- Names and addresses of the micks, right?

516
00:53:44,812 --> 00:53:50,270
Two or three micks have been very busy,
covering a lot of ground here since yesterday,

517
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,778
and not one of you lot has turned up with a thing.

518
00:53:54,783 --> 00:53:57,700
It's impossible no one knows nothing.

519
00:53:58,036 --> 00:54:01,121
Someone, somewhere, knows...

520
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,203
and we're gonna find him..

521
00:54:04,962 --> 00:54:09,209
I want a top capture from every manor,
and I don't want no punters.

522
00:54:09,675 --> 00:54:12,760
This is personal, I want the man who knows...

523
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:16,765
Right. Who fancies what?

524
00:54:19,645 --> 00:54:22,398
Well me and Chris will take Soho, we're gonna see
Maltese Charlie,

525
00:54:22,649 --> 00:54:24,393
a couple of drinks and he'll talk.

526
00:54:25,444 --> 00:54:26,772
Use that, it's cheaper.

527
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:29,069
Remember, the license is in the post.

528
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:32,200
Well, I only use it to get the pigeons
off the caravan roof, don't I?

529
00:54:34,955 --> 00:54:37,625
I don't want want none of you playing
Roy Rogers on this lot, right?

530
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:41,004
As soon as you finish with 'em,
you give 'em back to Razors.

531
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:42,748
How about the Finsbury Park hill billies?

532
00:54:43,006 --> 00:54:46,791
- I like the singsong but who do you fancy for a lullaby?
- Well Chopper's in the boob.

533
00:54:47,428 --> 00:54:48,626
Harry and Pinchers?

534
00:54:48,971 --> 00:54:50,514
- Why not?

535
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:52,550
They're like Siamese twins them two.

536
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:57,140
Pick 'em up together, the split 'em apart,
we'll interfere with their telepathy, right?

537
00:54:58,692 --> 00:55:00,565
Has anybody seen the major lately?

538
00:55:00,985 --> 00:55:03,358
I heard he's a sick man, bedridden.

539
00:55:03,697 --> 00:55:06,402
It will make a nice change for him, a night out, eh?

540
00:55:06,951 --> 00:55:09,074
Right, arm up and get going.

541
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:11,198
And use the butcher's truck, right?

542
00:55:11,581 --> 00:55:14,333
Me and Razors will take the trip
to the Elephant and Castle.

543
00:55:14,584 --> 00:55:16,792
- Where do we meet?
- Two hours from now at the abattoir

544
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:22,926
And remember: scare the shit out of 'em but don't
damage 'em, I want 'em conscious and talkative.

545
00:55:23,304 --> 00:55:24,584
And lads,

546
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:28,391
try and be discrete, eh?

547
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:57,205
I think we'd employ your talents better
if you went to help Victoria with the Yanks.

548
00:55:58,469 --> 00:56:00,261
- Are you sure?
- Oh yeah.

549
00:56:02,474 --> 00:56:03,754
Do you reckon...

550
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,726
Colin was jealous of you?

551
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:09,982
Come again?

552
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,440
Well I was trying to ease him out,
you know how potty he could go.

553
00:56:16,365 --> 00:56:17,777
So?

554
00:56:18,952 --> 00:56:21,324
Well is Colin the reason for all this?

555
00:56:21,997 --> 00:56:25,616
You know how bitchy queers get
when their looks start fading...

556
00:56:26,502 --> 00:56:29,076
I don't know, he wasn't my type.

557
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,512
- How do you stay so cool?
- I'm on the winning side.

558
00:56:37,057 --> 00:56:38,171
Yeah.

559
00:56:39,893 --> 00:56:42,266
- Help Vicky out, right?
- Yeah.

560
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:48,230
- I want you at the abattoir by midnight, right?
- Alright.

561
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,543
Thank you.

562
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,704
If I knew Mr. Shand wanted this table tonight...

563
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,006
Well there was a change of plan.

564
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,134
You can say that again.

565
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:11,714
Would you care for a drink before you order?

566
00:57:13,808 --> 00:57:15,088
Charlie?

567
00:57:15,351 --> 00:57:18,388
- Yeah, bourbon on the rocks.
- I'll have the same, please.

568
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:20,599
A screwdriver, lots of vodka.

569
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,560
A San Pellegrino for me, please.

570
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:28,064
I think we should skip the flambé cooking,
considering the gas situation in London.

571
00:57:29,242 --> 00:57:31,615
That sort of thing doesn't happen twice in one day.

572
00:57:32,913 --> 00:57:34,621
You should level with us.

573
00:57:36,585 --> 00:57:39,040
We're not just a pair of jerks out of college you know.

574
00:57:41,214 --> 00:57:42,875
No, absolutely not.

575
00:57:43,217 --> 00:57:45,839
Two bombs, that affects everyone.

576
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,592
Let's order, shall we?

577
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:52,143
Soupe de jour and the chef's special.

578
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:56,053
I'll have my usual.

579
00:57:57,484 --> 00:58:01,648
No soup, hors d'oeuvres and the special.

580
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,283
I'll have the same.

581
00:58:05,993 --> 00:58:09,577
So Charlie, how did you know about the bombs?

582
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,200
It's our business to know these things.

583
00:58:12,544 --> 00:58:14,786
A bottle of champagne, very cold.

584
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:20,375
Harold has got bad problems.

585
00:58:20,678 --> 00:58:24,511
- But he's dealing with them right now.
- He's been dealing with them all day.

586
00:58:25,183 --> 00:58:28,599
- He's very thorough.
- I like your loyalty.

587
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:30,765
I'm being frank.

588
00:58:31,482 --> 00:58:36,358
Victoria, unless you tell us what Harold's bad
problems are and how he's dealing with them...

589
00:58:37,156 --> 00:58:39,694
...I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do...

590
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:43,819
Tony and me we're gonna leave the table,
check out of the Savoy,

591
00:58:44,748 --> 00:58:47,239
grab the first plane home...

592
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:48,960
there will be no deal.

593
00:58:50,421 --> 00:58:52,461
It's not a good idea to bullshit us, Victoria.

594
00:58:55,552 --> 00:58:57,011
Cheers.

595
00:59:00,265 --> 00:59:01,761
Well?

596
00:59:05,063 --> 00:59:06,855
A car was blown up,

597
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,483
then a bomb was found at the Mayfair Casino,
it hadn't detonated.

598
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:16,322
- One of our men was found dead in a swimming pool.
- Yeah, he was stabbed.

599
00:59:16,827 --> 00:59:19,235
I'm giving Charlie all the essential details.

600
00:59:19,831 --> 00:59:21,455
Well I think that is an essential detail.

601
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:27,168
An auto, casino, a stabbing, a bar blown up...

602
00:59:27,423 --> 00:59:30,708
- What is this, a gang war?
- No, no question.

603
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:32,249
Then what?

604
00:59:33,013 --> 00:59:36,845
Isn't it obvious Charlie?
This deal is very big, someone is envious.

605
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:41,264
Harold and I have no doubt that by tomorrow
the problem will be settled.

606
00:59:41,898 --> 00:59:44,853
- You sound very confident.
- I am.

607
00:59:47,112 --> 00:59:49,439
Tony, you're the lawyer, tell me what you're thinking?

608
00:59:53,161 --> 00:59:58,239
I think we can afford to give you 24 hours to resolve
your problems before we make a final decision.

609
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:03,250
OK Victoria, I'll give you until tomorrow.

610
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:08,839
But just one more foul up and
we're on our way back home.

611
01:00:09,097 --> 01:00:10,639
That goes without saying.

612
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:18,141
- Nothing personal Victoria, but business is business.
- I understand.

613
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,948
Harold what are you doing on this side of the river?

614
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:11,700
- Hi, Billy.

615
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:14,537
- Scotch?
- Sorry to hear about your mother.

616
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,088
The car blew up, that's what I heard.

617
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:21,131
- Have you got a spot of bother?
- No.

618
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:23,467
The music's loud here, innit?

619
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:25,517
- I'll get him to turn it down a bit.
- No, listen, Billy.

620
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:30,185
I've got a little bit of business I want to
drop you all by, can we talk in the other bar?

621
01:01:30,442 --> 01:01:31,722
- Right.
- Nice one.

622
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:33,694
Jimmy,  bring the drinks around the back.

623
01:01:41,705 --> 01:01:43,496
Everybody's American, ombrero,

624
01:01:43,749 --> 01:01:48,044
- If there's anything going, put me in.
- Well there's plenty of money for everybody,

625
01:01:48,296 --> 01:01:51,547
- I just need the right people you know what I mean?
- Well I'm your man...

626
01:01:55,471 --> 01:01:57,879
Alternate car Billy or I'll blow your spine off.

627
01:01:59,434 --> 01:02:00,763
It's not a shooter is it Harold?

628
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:04,887
Don't be silly Billy, would I come
hunting for you with me fingers?

629
01:02:05,942 --> 01:02:09,359
If you're looking to make an investment,
you've come to the right place.

630
01:02:10,697 --> 01:02:15,242
It's all gonna happen, with or without Harold.
My hotels are gonna be there!

631
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,538
Will you get us a cab to the Savoy?

632
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:19,995
I'll show you the plans tomorrow.

633
01:02:20,251 --> 01:02:21,531
Magnificent.

634
01:02:21,794 --> 01:02:26,671
Pie in the sky hotels, if you know what I mean,
something to be proud of.

635
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:28,419
Yes I think it's time we all went home, don't you?

636
01:02:28,677 --> 01:02:32,426
No, Victoria, Charlie understands, right?

637
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,425
We're two of a kind me and him.

638
01:02:34,726 --> 01:02:38,974
We had to claw our way out from the gutter.
We're self-made men, right Charles?

639
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:43,316
I don't think Mr. Restivo is as familiar
with the gutter as you assume.

640
01:02:43,903 --> 01:02:46,774
If you don't watch your fucking step counsellor,
you'll be right back in it.

641
01:02:47,032 --> 01:02:48,574
Come on Vicky, don't be like that.

642
01:02:51,871 --> 01:02:53,282
I'll tell you what...

643
01:02:53,873 --> 01:02:58,287
...we'll have some more brandy's at the bar
and I'll tell you all about my plans, Charlie.

644
01:02:59,046 --> 01:03:00,789
Don't be hostile, Vicky.

645
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:03,422
- Jeff.
- Hello Jeff.

646
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,339
Charlie.

647
01:03:05,595 --> 01:03:06,626
Tony.

648
01:03:07,722 --> 01:03:09,716
- everything alright?
- You tell me...

649
01:03:10,851 --> 01:03:13,473
I've put our American friends
in the picture about today, Jeff.

650
01:03:14,605 --> 01:03:19,233
Then you'll understand why Harold couldn't make it.
It's all under control.

651
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:22,240
I'm sure Harold Shand can find a way out of this one.

652
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:24,115
Meantime, I'm going to take a piss.

653
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,861
Stay right where you are folks.

654
01:03:28,664 --> 01:03:31,748
- That guy's a loud-mouth
- I don't like drunks.

655
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:34,288
Do you trust him?

656
01:03:34,546 --> 01:03:36,539
Harold can handle him.

657
01:03:37,132 --> 01:03:40,169
A city counsellor is a very wise investment at the moment.

658
01:03:40,845 --> 01:03:43,550
- We'll talk out that tomorrow. Good night Victoria.
- Good night.

659
01:03:43,806 --> 01:03:45,218
Good night.

660
01:03:45,809 --> 01:03:48,431
- Thanks for the dinner.
- Good night, Charlie.

661
01:03:48,812 --> 01:03:50,354
Good night.

662
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:53,476
Oh Christ am I pleased to see you.

663
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:55,729
That bloody Harris is a liability.

664
01:03:57,615 --> 01:03:58,895
Any news yet?

665
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,480
No, not yet.

666
01:04:00,743 --> 01:04:02,617
Where have the Yanks gone?
I've just bought some more brandy's.

667
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,449
Go home , Harris. Go home.

668
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:09,583
Don't look down your nose at me Victoria, makes you go cross-eyed.

669
01:04:10,088 --> 01:04:13,005
You can't even see that I'm not the real bastard, he is.

670
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:19,050
Aren't you?

671
01:04:20,516 --> 01:04:22,474
I'll get you a cab home, counsellor.

672
01:04:23,353 --> 01:04:25,061
I'll talk to you later.

673
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,761
OK,

674
01:04:27,275 --> 01:04:28,555
bastard.

675
01:04:49,967 --> 01:04:52,590
God, I don't think I've ever been
so pleased to see anyone in my life.

676
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:57,099
It's been hard night.

677
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,426
You did a good job.

678
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,808
Without the help of counsellor Harris.

679
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,072
He fancies you, you know...

680
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:13,493
...then a lot of people do.

681
01:05:19,669 --> 01:05:23,335
Must be my sparkling personality.

682
01:05:57,630 --> 01:06:00,632
I'll see you to your door, just in case.

683
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,421
Thanks.

684
01:06:05,848 --> 01:06:07,805
If you miss it, it's unlucky.

685
01:06:16,068 --> 01:06:17,860
It won't move unless you press the button, you know.

686
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:30,120
It's not moving.

687
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:32,204
It's temperamental, I'll do it.

688
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:44,135
I hate lifts.

689
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:47,260
Gets really claustrophobic in here with a lot of people.

690
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:51,893
Depends on the people.

691
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:17,344
I wanna lick every inch of you.

692
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,398
Saved by the bell. Good night.

693
01:08:13,206 --> 01:08:14,700
Bastard.

694
01:08:42,157 --> 01:08:44,695
It's a long time since I went to a funeral.

695
01:08:45,243 --> 01:08:49,158
That's a strange thing. Did Jeff tell you
about the funeral the day you got back?

696
01:08:49,623 --> 01:08:52,079
A funeral every half hour down the East India Dock Road.

697
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,496
A woman got out of the funeral car and gobbed at him.

698
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:59,008
- Eh?
- I didn't see it properly, H.

699
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,178
I didn't crack on.

700
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:12,974
You're gonna love this here.

701
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,604
You will gonna love this.

702
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,614
Shut up all of ya!

703
01:10:21,106 --> 01:10:24,273
For more than ten years there's been peace

704
01:10:25,766 --> 01:10:28,140
everyone to his own patch.

705
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:30,471
We've all had it sweet.

706
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:35,725
I've done every single one of you
favours in the past

707
01:10:36,237 --> 01:10:39,987
I've put money in all your pockets,
I've treated you lot  well, even when you was out of order, right?

708
01:10:40,242 --> 01:10:42,320
even when you was out of order, right?

709
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:48,791
Well now there's been an eruption.

710
01:10:51,882 --> 01:10:54,587
It's like fuckin' Belfast on a bad night.

711
01:10:56,346 --> 01:11:01,590
One of my closest friends is lying out there in the freezer.

712
01:11:02,103 --> 01:11:05,307
And believe me, all of you...

713
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:08,235
...nobody goes home until I find out who done it, and why.

714
01:11:08,485 --> 01:11:11,273
Harold believe me, if I knew I'd say.

715
01:11:12,532 --> 01:11:14,775
the last thing I want is any trouble.

716
01:11:15,453 --> 01:11:18,787
- Everything's going too well for us.
- You lying bastard.

717
01:11:20,584 --> 01:11:23,372
Look things have never been so good between
South London and East End.

718
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:25,254
You bastard.

719
01:11:32,474 --> 01:11:33,754
Get him out of here.

720
01:11:34,017 --> 01:11:35,297
Bastard.

721
01:11:37,271 --> 01:11:39,976
Jeff, you behave yourself!

722
01:11:44,947 --> 01:11:47,569
Right lads, it's your decision.

723
01:11:49,703 --> 01:11:51,862
Frostbite or verbals, one of them two, right?

724
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,469
- What's the matter with you?
- Listen.

725
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:08,088
Listen.

726
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:11,187
If you kill him, we've got a gang war on our hands, right?

727
01:12:11,438 --> 01:12:14,440
We already have. They're walking all over you.

728
01:12:14,692 --> 01:12:16,601
That's 'cause we ain't got no lead!

729
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:27,330
Parky. About time.

730
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,997
- Well?
- You've got to drop it Harold,

731
01:12:31,087 --> 01:12:32,666
it's not that lot.

732
01:12:32,923 --> 01:12:35,165
- I've had the bomb checked.
- And?

733
01:12:35,426 --> 01:12:37,466
It's the same sort of device the IRA use.

734
01:12:38,471 --> 01:12:41,046
This is Special Branch now, Harold.
I'm turning it over to them.

735
01:12:41,559 --> 01:12:45,427
What do the Irish got to do with me,
it's just a bunch of hoods trying to muscle in.

736
01:12:46,023 --> 01:12:47,849
For Christ sake Harold, they're not just gangsters.

737
01:12:48,108 --> 01:12:50,682
They run half of Londonderry on terror,
could be London next.

738
01:12:50,945 --> 01:12:54,814
- No, I run London.
- Not now Harold, they're taking it away from you.

739
01:12:55,868 --> 01:12:58,110
It's Special Branch now and I'm getting out.

740
01:13:01,666 --> 01:13:03,956
Remember who pays your wages Parky,

741
01:13:04,212 --> 01:13:06,003
you ain't going nowhere.

742
01:13:07,715 --> 01:13:11,500
Now tell me something worthwhile

743
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:18,603
There was a robbery at counsellor Harris'
demolition yard, explosives.

744
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:22,481
We pulled in the security guard, Flynn.
We grilled him for hours,

745
01:13:22,734 --> 01:13:24,893
but he just wouldn't crack, he was too scared.

746
01:13:25,404 --> 01:13:28,359
Alan, check out this geezer Flynn, bring him in.

747
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,110
Harold you can't do that!

748
01:13:30,994 --> 01:13:33,830
Don't you ever tell me what I can or can't do.

749
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:39,208
Bent law can be tolerated for as long as they're
lubricating, but you have become definitely parched.

750
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:42,373
If I was you, I'd run for cover and close the hatch,

751
01:13:42,842 --> 01:13:46,129
cause you're gonna wind up on one of
those meat hooks, my son.

752
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,682
Right, let 'em go, they don't know nothing.

753
01:13:52,937 --> 01:13:57,232
Jeff, clean 'em up and get them off and
give them a grand each expenses, just keep 'em sweeped.

754
01:13:57,485 --> 01:13:58,814
What are you doing?

755
01:13:59,488 --> 01:14:01,112
I'm gonna go home, I need some time to think.

756
01:14:01,365 --> 01:14:04,485
Alan, first thing in the morning that
security geezer, right?

757
01:14:04,744 --> 01:14:06,072
Razors, come on son.

758
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:10,368
Dave, do as he says, put 'em in a bubble bath.

759
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:13,120
- Eh?
- You heard.

760
01:14:14,589 --> 01:14:15,965
Let's go lads.

761
01:15:55,763 --> 01:15:57,512
How did it go with Charlie?

762
01:15:59,738 --> 01:16:01,987
Well I stopped him going home.

763
01:16:02,249 --> 01:16:06,556
- Going home?
- Yeah they were going home, they're not stupid.

764
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:11,359
They knew it was a bomb,
and now they now the rest.

765
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:13,787
- How?
- I told them.

766
01:16:14,132 --> 01:16:17,226
- You did what?
- I told them everything, Harold.

767
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:19,856
I had to.

768
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:23,628
Victoria,

769
01:16:25,135 --> 01:16:26,598
listen sweetheart,

770
01:16:27,771 --> 01:16:30,865
I'm setting up the biggest deal in Europe,

771
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,082
with the hardest organization since Hitler
stuck as swastika on his jockstrap.

772
01:16:35,428 --> 01:16:39,605
I've been through incredible lengths
all day to keep it incognito,

773
01:16:40,114 --> 01:16:44,171
and now you, over a sherry,
calmly told the whole story.

774
01:16:44,926 --> 01:16:49,151
I had to tell them everything
or the deal would have finished.

775
01:16:50,993 --> 01:16:54,170
Howard, your trouble is you just
don't understand their psychology.

776
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:56,589
Bollocks you smart ass prat.

777
01:16:59,445 --> 01:17:01,359
I can't talk to you.

778
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,583
I'm going to bed, good night.

779
01:17:04,925 --> 01:17:06,758
Come here I'm talking to you!

780
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:09,644
Don't treat me like one of your thugs.

781
01:17:15,009 --> 01:17:16,294
What's happening to me?

782
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:22,444
I'm sorry.

783
01:17:23,335 --> 01:17:27,976
For 10 years it's been calm, no trouble.

784
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:30,393
And now this.

785
01:17:34,424 --> 01:17:36,672
Listen I wouldn't hurt you for the world, come here.

786
01:17:37,058 --> 01:17:38,343
I'm sorry.

787
01:17:38,607 --> 01:17:39,891
I'm so scared Harold.

788
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:43,411
I don't want to die,

789
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,510
don't let them kill us.

790
01:17:48,858 --> 01:17:50,142
Alright.

791
01:17:51,285 --> 01:17:52,748
It's alright.

792
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:05,003
It will be alright, believe me.

793
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:23,032
What is it, boy?

794
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:29,943
For Christ sake,

795
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:32,483
Help me..

796
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:45,800
Sherry.

797
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:53,697
I'm sorry, H.

798
01:20:54,629 --> 01:20:57,045
It's alright Alan it's not your fault,
you weren't to blame.

799
01:20:57,809 --> 01:21:00,689
There's some fresh coffee in the kitchen,
go make yourself some breakfast.

800
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:02,776
Ta.

801
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,065
So someone got to him before you could.

802
01:21:21,495 --> 01:21:23,038
How did they know?

803
01:21:23,748 --> 01:21:27,199
- Or was it a coincidence?
- That's stretching it a bit, innit?

804
01:21:33,424 --> 01:21:35,630
That means it's someone close to home.

805
01:21:43,352 --> 01:21:46,803
You know last night in the restaurant
I had a funny feeling.

806
01:21:47,648 --> 01:21:51,182
Harris being really strange.

807
01:21:55,197 --> 01:21:57,770
he said something to Jeff,
just as we were leaving.

808
01:21:59,534 --> 01:22:02,286
He said that I got it all wrong,
that Jeff was the real bastard.

809
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,783
Why should he say that?

810
01:22:33,193 --> 01:22:34,438
Razors.

811
01:22:35,404 --> 01:22:37,361
That funeral you were talking about...

812
01:22:37,615 --> 01:22:40,237
something about a bird gobbing in Jeff's face.

813
01:22:40,827 --> 01:22:42,155
That's right.

814
01:22:42,412 --> 01:22:44,535
Find that woman, I wanna talk to her.

815
01:22:46,207 --> 01:22:48,615
Well get her name and address off the undertakers.

816
01:22:49,586 --> 01:22:51,625
How do I know, I wasn't there, was I?

817
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,916
Look it up in the Yellow pages there can't be
that many undertakers in the area.

818
01:22:57,135 --> 01:23:00,504
Right. And as soon as you've found her,
come and pick me up.

819
01:23:01,472 --> 01:23:03,679
Right. I'll see you. Ta.

820
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:38,963
Mrs. Benson?

821
01:23:43,891 --> 01:23:45,930
You're a bastard, Harold Shand.

822
01:23:46,519 --> 01:23:48,345
A vicious bastard.

823
01:23:49,146 --> 01:23:52,313
You left him to die in a stinking ditch,

824
01:23:52,566 --> 01:23:55,686
and didn't have the decency to...

825
01:24:03,661 --> 01:24:06,531
- When did he die?
- Ten days ago, you should know.

826
01:24:06,789 --> 01:24:08,331
Where?

827
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,113
Belfast.

828
01:24:11,752 --> 01:24:13,412
Belfast?

829
01:24:15,464 --> 01:24:18,880
- What was he doing there?
- That Jeff Hughes sent him.

830
01:24:19,552 --> 01:24:22,387
- What?
- He was hired.

831
01:24:22,638 --> 01:24:27,930
The blond one, that Colin, always asked him
to do the chauffeuring on the long runs.

832
01:24:28,603 --> 01:24:31,355
- A chauffeur?
- A mini cab.

833
01:24:35,527 --> 01:24:37,069
Your husband drove Colin...

834
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:42,990
and he got topped in Belfast?

835
01:24:43,243 --> 01:24:44,903
Yes, left there.

836
01:24:45,996 --> 01:24:48,569
I was left with all the arrangements,

837
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:52,665
to bring the body back here...

838
01:24:54,087 --> 01:24:56,246
and not so much as a penny for me and the kids.

839
01:24:58,967 --> 01:25:01,090
And Jeff Hughes hired him?

840
01:25:01,428 --> 01:25:02,708
Yes.

841
01:25:05,515 --> 01:25:09,133
- And that bastard hasn't payed me any compensation.
- Alright, alright.

842
01:25:09,603 --> 01:25:12,094
You'll get some compensation,
the corporation will look after you.

843
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:16,150
- Is there anything you need?
- I'll need a 100 quid a week.

844
01:25:18,236 --> 01:25:19,517
Alright.

845
01:25:20,322 --> 01:25:21,947
Anything else you want?

846
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,862
I just want him back.

847
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:50,849
Get him a decent stone, send me the bill.

848
01:28:16,127 --> 01:28:18,452
- Drink?
- Yeah.

849
01:28:26,804 --> 01:28:30,553
- Do you ever worry about your liver?
- No, we're just good friends.

850
01:28:33,394 --> 01:28:37,143
My mum used to have a go at my old man about
his boozing and he always used to say:

851
01:28:37,398 --> 01:28:39,141
"If you drink less than your doctor, you're alright."

852
01:28:43,154 --> 01:28:44,778
It's hot in here, shall we go on deck?

853
01:28:45,489 --> 01:28:46,900
Hot?

854
01:28:48,618 --> 01:28:49,863
Are you hot?

855
01:28:50,369 --> 01:28:51,828
This will cool you down.

856
01:28:59,838 --> 01:29:01,463
What did you want to talk about?

857
01:29:03,508 --> 01:29:05,086
Shouldn't we be well...

858
01:29:06,595 --> 01:29:08,504
with what's going on...

859
01:29:09,681 --> 01:29:11,389
Everything's alright.

860
01:29:12,184 --> 01:29:13,678
Alright?

861
01:29:15,229 --> 01:29:16,639
I'm using the word the way you use it.

862
01:29:18,649 --> 01:29:20,107
What?

863
01:29:22,402 --> 01:29:23,434
Alright?

864
01:29:23,695 --> 01:29:26,815
I remember vividly when you met me at
Heathrow of the plane form New York...

865
01:29:27,491 --> 01:29:30,527
I said how's things been,
and you said "Alright".

866
01:29:34,081 --> 01:29:36,453
- I'm not with you.
- Aren't ya?

867
01:29:37,918 --> 01:29:39,198
Top that?

868
01:29:42,464 --> 01:29:45,085
Quite frankly, I'm a bit flabbergasted...

869
01:29:45,342 --> 01:29:48,426
you forgot to mention this carry on
in Belfast while I've been away.

870
01:29:51,807 --> 01:29:53,267
Ah, that.

871
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:55,226
Yeah, that.

872
01:29:56,437 --> 01:29:58,928
What about this mini cab driver, Phil Benson?

873
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:02,140
He's...

874
01:30:02,402 --> 01:30:04,727
Well he was a friend of Colin's.

875
01:30:05,905 --> 01:30:07,234
He got killed.

876
01:30:08,449 --> 01:30:10,241
It's a long story.

877
01:30:10,743 --> 01:30:14,029
- I know I should've told you, but...
- Well tell me now.

878
01:30:15,164 --> 01:30:20,040
What the bloody hell was Colin doing
with a Lime'ouse mini cab driver in Belfast?

879
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:21,670
Colin can't drive.

880
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:24,485
Ah, that makes sense.

881
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,872
Second question: Belfast, what was he doing there?

882
01:30:30,168 --> 01:30:33,621
I know Colin fancied soldiers,
but that's taking his buggery a bit far, innit?

883
01:30:35,051 --> 01:30:38,387
- He had to make a delivery.
- A delivery of what?

884
01:30:39,015 --> 01:30:40,475
Come on I'm curious...

885
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:44,478
what Chieftain tanks, bars of
chocolate, Fiesta Durex's, what?

886
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:49,109
- Money.
- Well ain't they got any banks out there?

887
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,948
Well what money, what for and who to?

888
01:30:55,209 --> 01:30:57,582
He was delivering for Harris.

889
01:31:01,343 --> 01:31:02,672
He had a problem.

890
01:31:02,929 --> 01:31:07,060
He was being leant on to deliver,
deliver money I mean to Belfast.

891
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:10,057
Leant on by who?

892
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,605
He's got a 100 micks on his labour force,
he's without business without them.

893
01:31:14,948 --> 01:31:18,949
He was being leant on to organise a delivery.
He asked me.

894
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:25,874
So you got my Colin to deliver for Harris money to Belfast?

895
01:31:27,261 --> 01:31:28,671
Yeah.

896
01:31:31,475 --> 01:31:33,268
Well that is irregular.

897
01:31:34,147 --> 01:31:38,312
I don't approve of my men delivering funds for the IRA.

898
01:31:38,695 --> 01:31:43,194
He had no choice, he has to do what they ask,
otherwise his buildings don't get built.

899
01:31:44,413 --> 01:31:47,665
That's why he never has a strain, that's why we use Harris.

900
01:31:49,797 --> 01:31:51,422
Jesus Christ!

901
01:31:54,345 --> 01:31:57,218
Of all the faces here you could have used,
of all of them...

902
01:31:58,894 --> 01:32:02,063
you have to pick Colin for a job like that?

903
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:13,665
So he took a dip, yeah?

904
01:32:15,088 --> 01:32:16,630
Yeah, he stupidly helped himself.

905
01:32:17,549 --> 01:32:18,961
How much?

906
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:21,172
- 5.000.
- What?

907
01:32:23,517 --> 01:32:26,852
You mean all this anarchy is for 5 poxy grand?

908
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:32,027
And three of their top men where wiped out,

909
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:36,654
The night Colin delivered.

910
01:32:45,929 --> 01:32:48,599
So they put 2 and 2 together and come up
with the answer, didn't they?

911
01:32:50,227 --> 01:32:54,559
'cause Colin's my man, it's down to me.
I'm the one that's grassed them up aren't I?

912
01:32:55,819 --> 01:32:57,480
This is all revenge.

913
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,658
Yeah.

914
01:33:01,954 --> 01:33:03,331
Revenge.

915
01:33:05,293 --> 01:33:06,753
I'll fucking show them.

916
01:33:09,132 --> 01:33:12,717
That security guard, he could
give us a clue, couldn't he?

917
01:33:14,474 --> 01:33:17,596
- Did he say anything?
- Nah not much when Alan got to him.

918
01:33:19,315 --> 01:33:20,597
No?

919
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:24,278
Alan found him dying,
he'd been nailed to the floor.

920
01:33:28,956 --> 01:33:33,288
- When was this then?
- It must have been just after you saw him and before Alan saw him.

921
01:33:33,797 --> 01:33:37,963
Otherwise you would've  noticed, wouldn't you?
I mean a geezer nailed to the floor,

922
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:41,255
a man of your education would definitely
have spotted that, wouldn't he?

923
01:33:42,185 --> 01:33:44,595
Traitor! Fucking Judas!

924
01:33:45,357 --> 01:33:46,686
I didn't do nothing.

925
01:33:46,943 --> 01:33:51,193
Maybe you didn't nail the geezer, but it's
down to you all the same, isn't it?

926
01:33:51,534 --> 01:33:54,026
- It had nothing to do with me.
- Don't lie to me boy,

927
01:33:54,289 --> 01:33:57,410
I can smell your lies and all,

928
01:33:58,462 --> 01:34:03,672
I can smell your greed, ambition,
a disgusting like betrayal.

929
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,176
Why Jeff?

930
01:34:06,642 --> 01:34:08,054
Why?

931
01:34:08,311 --> 01:34:10,352
He threatened to kill me, I was scared.

932
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:25,790
- You put the finger on me, didn't you?
- No I didn't. It was Harris.

933
01:34:26,131 --> 01:34:31,129
For micks, prick hard micks,
red-neck terrorist scum.

934
01:34:32,058 --> 01:34:33,802
Blame me, blame Colin.

935
01:34:34,353 --> 01:34:35,729
Revenge?

936
01:34:36,147 --> 01:34:38,271
It's me who's gonna take revenge.

937
01:34:38,526 --> 01:34:39,986
I'll crush them like beetles.

938
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:44,318
- Never.
- You watch, I'm gonna annihilate them.

939
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:47,746
- You can't wipe them out.
- You just watch me.

940
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:53,624
Kill 10, 20 bring out the tanks
and the flame-throwers,

941
01:34:53,884 --> 01:34:56,341
They pour back. It's like an army of ants.

942
01:34:57,682 --> 01:34:59,011
Work with them.

943
01:34:59,268 --> 01:35:02,105
- It's my manor!
- Jesus Christ.

944
01:35:03,149 --> 01:35:07,648
The British Army has been diving a battle
shit-frying at them from all angles,

945
01:35:07,907 --> 01:35:09,401
- and you're not impressed?
- Shut up.

946
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:11,618
They can take over here any time they want.

947
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,245
- Just shut up.
- You wont'stop them.

948
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,207
To them you're nothing, nothing,
a shit on their shoes.

949
01:37:08,893 --> 01:37:10,637
Jeff. He was with Harris.

950
01:37:11,606 --> 01:37:13,315
They sold me out.

951
01:37:15,195 --> 01:37:16,655
I'm gonna kill him.

952
01:37:16,906 --> 01:37:18,235
Razors!

953
01:37:21,372 --> 01:37:23,282
- Razors!
- Harold!

954
01:37:24,836 --> 01:37:26,497
Take it easy.

955
01:37:27,548 --> 01:37:29,376
- Calm down..
- Give me the gun.

956
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:38,059
You've got Harris, right?

957
01:37:38,441 --> 01:37:39,935
You've got him.

958
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:45,239
Now you use him. You use him to stop
this bloody havoc, right?

959
01:40:13,774 --> 01:40:16,942
- Counsellor Harris' office please.
- I'll show you the way.

960
01:40:17,196 --> 01:40:19,404
- Thank you.
- He's on the second floor.

961
01:40:21,662 --> 01:40:24,665
- A friend of yours, sir?
- Yes a very old friend, yeah.

962
01:40:25,196 --> 01:40:28,197
Nice fellow isn't he?
And a hard worker.

963
01:40:29,743 --> 01:40:32,280
Has been on all that bloody phone all afternoon.

964
01:40:33,537 --> 01:40:36,787
- He has done a lot for the Irish community around here, hasn't he?
- So they tell me.

965
01:40:38,542 --> 01:40:42,754
You know it's 3 weeks since they turned
over the pages of the Book of Remembrance,

966
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:44,837
there's a work to rule.

967
01:40:45,256 --> 01:40:48,340
I said to the Union bloke, I said it's
a good job they didn't work to rule in 1418

968
01:40:48,593 --> 01:40:50,669
in the trenches in France.

969
01:41:04,649 --> 01:41:06,441
- Is this it?

970
01:41:07,152 --> 01:41:10,521
- Are you gonna need me to show you the way down again?
- No, I think I can manage, thanks a lot.

971
01:41:20,456 --> 01:41:21,736
Harold.

972
01:41:22,082 --> 01:41:23,577
How unexpected.

973
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:31,057
Harold call it off!

974
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:33,688
You can't do it.

975
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:35,850
You can't deal with these people.

976
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:39,437
For Christ sake, they're not interested in money.
They're political, they're fanatics!

977
01:42:40,822 --> 01:42:42,279
Come on, George.

978
01:42:55,626 --> 01:42:57,037
Come in.

979
01:43:02,383 --> 01:43:04,625
O'Flaherty, Harold Shand.

980
01:43:06,637 --> 01:43:08,759
There's 60 grand here.

981
01:43:10,348 --> 01:43:14,097
- To make sure there's no more hard feelings.
- Gonna have to wait and see the boss about that.

982
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:15,759
Where is he?

983
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:18,690
He's out there. Last race.

984
01:43:19,065 --> 01:43:20,440
He'll be back in a minute.

985
01:44:45,144 --> 01:44:46,887
This is Mr. Shand.

986
01:44:47,438 --> 01:44:50,011
He's brought the money and he wants an answer.

987
01:44:53,568 --> 01:44:56,901
- How much is that?
- 60 grand, it's in the case.

988
01:44:57,906 --> 01:44:59,364
You'd better count it.

989
01:45:01,367 --> 01:45:03,194
If you don't mind, I will.

990
01:46:19,689 --> 01:46:21,848
You wait here, I'll got and get them,
I won't be a minute

991
01:46:26,862 --> 01:46:28,819
Mr. Restivo?

992
01:46:44,837 --> 01:46:46,166
Where's Charlie?

993
01:46:48,091 --> 01:46:49,750
Everything's alright.

994
01:46:50,217 --> 01:46:52,340
All the troubles are over.

995
01:46:52,844 --> 01:46:54,220
What did he say?

996
01:46:55,847 --> 01:46:57,306
Sorry, Harold.

997
01:46:57,683 --> 01:47:01,182
But I'm glad you dropped in to say
goodbye, that's real nice.

998
01:47:02,019 --> 01:47:03,976
- What are you leaving?
- Yeah.

999
01:47:04,272 --> 01:47:06,893
- You're not going back to New York?
- Next flight out.

1000
01:47:08,234 --> 01:47:09,977
Come on, Charlie

1001
01:47:10,236 --> 01:47:13,356
I know we've had a few problems, we've only
been here a couple of days.

1002
01:47:13,656 --> 01:47:18,364
Yeah a couple of days that turned out to be
another St. Valentines Massacre.

1003
01:47:18,618 --> 01:47:21,323
But that settled it, once and for all.

1004
01:47:22,914 --> 01:47:27,871
Yes, I'd like a porter to suite 513 please,
and we'd like a cab right away.

1005
01:47:28,419 --> 01:47:29,913
Thank you.

1006
01:47:31,004 --> 01:47:33,163
You two can't wait to get out of here, can you?

1007
01:47:33,549 --> 01:47:37,131
I always react like that to bombs blowing up, mass murders...

1008
01:47:37,845 --> 01:47:39,220
It's a hang-up of mine.

1009
01:47:41,013 --> 01:47:44,881
It's coming to something when the Mafia
can't handle a little problem, innit?

1010
01:47:45,143 --> 01:47:46,518
A little problem?

1011
01:47:46,769 --> 01:47:48,809
Tony did you hear what he said?
A little problem...

1012
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:52,226
This is like a bad night in Vietnam

1013
01:47:52,608 --> 01:47:55,063
But it's over, I've pulled the plug on 'em.

1014
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:57,727
We do not deal with gangsters, period.

1015
01:47:58,655 --> 01:48:02,439
This country is a worse risk than Cuba was.
It's a banana republic.

1016
01:48:03,034 --> 01:48:04,363
You're a mess.

1017
01:48:05,662 --> 01:48:06,941
Ciao, Harold.

1018
01:48:10,124 --> 01:48:11,535
Bon voyage then.

1019
01:48:19,883 --> 01:48:21,211
I'll tell you something...

1020
01:48:24,178 --> 01:48:28,342
I'm glad I found out in time just what a partnership
with a pair of wankers like you would've been.

1021
01:48:29,559 --> 01:48:32,097
A sleeping partner's one thing,
but you're in a fucking coma!

1022
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:36,104
No wonder you got an energy crisis
your side of the water!

1023
01:48:36,523 --> 01:48:40,852
But us British, we're used to a bit more
vitality, imagination,

1024
01:48:41,403 --> 01:48:43,479
touch of the Dunkirk spirit, know what I mean?

1025
01:48:45,948 --> 01:48:48,071
The days when Yanks could come over 'ere...

1026
01:48:48,326 --> 01:48:50,034
and buy up Nelson's Column...

1027
01:48:50,286 --> 01:48:54,118
an 'arley street surgeon and a couple'a Windmill
Girls are definitely over!

1028
01:48:54,624 --> 01:48:57,660
- Now look...
- Shut up you long streak of paralysed piss.

1029
01:49:01,338 --> 01:49:04,789
What I’m looking for is someone who can contribute

1030
01:49:06,217 --> 01:49:08,922
to what England has given to the world:

1031
01:49:09,471 --> 01:49:15,674
culture, sophistication, genius. A little bit more
than an 'ot dog, know what I mean?

1032
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:22,393
We’re in the Common Market now, a
and my new deal is with Europe,

1033
01:49:23,901 --> 01:49:28,811
I’m going into partnership with a German
organisation. Yeah! The Krauts!

1034
01:49:29,238 --> 01:49:34,031
they've got ambition, know-how,
and they don’t lose their bottle.

1035
01:49:35,787 --> 01:49:37,364
Look at you...

1036
01:49:38,497 --> 01:49:39,955
The Mafia?

1037
01:49:40,707 --> 01:49:42,367
I've shit 'em.

1038
01:50:10,193 --> 01:50:11,735
Hey hold up, where's Victoria?
