00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,682
HE WOULD JUMP
AT AN OPPORTUNITY
TO DO THIS.

286
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:44,186
RICKY ?  RICKY
"I LOST THE TRUCK" RICKY ?

287
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,691
I--  YOU SAID YOU LIKED HIM.
YOU WANTED TO WORK WITH HIM.

288
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:52,194
THAT WAS BEFORE HE LOST
MY CARPET-CLEANING VAN.

289
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,698
OKAY.  LET ME TALK TO HIM.
HE'LL WORK IT OFF.

290
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,702
JESUS.  YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW THE KID.

291
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,204
THE LITTLE THAT I KNOW
ABOUT HIM SCARES ME.

292
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,707
I GREW UP WITH HIM.
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

293
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:08,210
UH-HUH.  WELL,
YOU VOUCH FOR HIM ?

294
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,213
[ Muttering ]
I-I-I GREW UP WITH THE GUY.
UH-HUH.

295
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:13,716
YOU VOUCH FOR HIM ?

296
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:16,719
DO I--
YOU MEAN, DO I--
DO YOU VOUCH FOR HIM ?

297
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:23,726
UM, HE--  YEAH.
YEAH, OF COURSE I VOUCH FOR HIM.

298
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:26,228
HOW ABOUT THIS ?

299
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:28,230
YOU'RE IN, HE'S IN.

300
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,733
I DON'T--

301
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:34,236
YOU'RE BEATIN' PEOPLE UP.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET PAID FOR IT.

302
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,239
THINK ABOUT IT.

303
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:42,244
YOU GOTTA TAKE THAT GUY OUT.
YOU OWN THAT GUY.
YOU OWN HIM.  COME ON !

304
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,246
WE NEED GUNS.
HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT GUNS.

305
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,248
HE IMPLIED SOMETHING
ABOUT GUNS, I'M SURE.

306
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:49,251
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU IMPLY.  IT'S SOMETHING
YOU LAY OUT ON THE TABLE.

307
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,254
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT GUNS.  BESIDES,
I'M NOT TAKING THE JOB.

308
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,757
IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY
OF A LIFETIME, BOBBY.
YOU NUTS ?

309
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:57,259
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

310
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:00,262
NO,YOU'VEBEEN WAITING
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
YOU'RE DAMN STRAIGHT.

311
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:02,264
YOU THINK I LIKE LIVIN'
ON FUCKIN' YUCCA ?

312
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:04,767
[ Ricky ]  YOU DO GOOD
ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
AND THEN YOU'RE IN.

313
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,769
YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITIES
AFTER THAT.
WHAT ABOUT BOXING ?

314
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,771
BOBBY, YOU'RE OUTTA
YOUR MIND.
OH, YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.

315
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:11,774
I CLOWNED WITH YOU
FOR TWO FUCKIN' ROUNDS,
DID THIS SHIT.
OH, STOP.

316
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:14,276
IT WAS A FUCKIN' DRAW.
I DIDN'T TRAIN FOR THE FIGHT !
THAT WAS HORSESHIT !

317
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,779
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
A PROFESSIONAL BOXER !
LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW.

318
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,281
I'M NOT TALKIN'

YOU'LL NEVER BE A BOXER.

COME ON.  RIGHT NOW.
DON'T START FUCKIN' PUSHIN' ME.

LET'S DO IT.
DON'T BE A FUCKIN' CHILD.
 DON'T BE A FUCKIN' CHILD !

321
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:27,790
[ Man ]  RICKY !  BOBBY !
CUT THAT SHIT OUT !
[ Both ]  SORRY, COACH.

322
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,793
HOW'S THE BOXING GOING ?

323
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:34,296
REALLY GOOD, COACH.
YEAH, REALLY GOOD.
HE'S FIVE, FIVE AND ONE.

324
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,799
STICK WITH IT, BOBBY.
YOU KNOW IT TAKES TIME.

325
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,301
YOU ALWAYS HAD
THE HEART.

326
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:42,304
[ Ricky ]
HOW 'BOUT ME, COACH ?
DID I ALWAYS HAVE HEART ?

327
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,307
WHAT ARE YOU
GAWKIN' AT, LADIES ?

328
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,810
THIS IS NOT RECESS.
[ Blows Whistle ]

329
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,812
[ Coach ]
RUN A PLAY.
LET'S RUN A PLAY.

330
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:53,315
FUCK HIM.  YOU'D THINK
HE'D LET IT GO AFTER A WHILE.

331
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:57,319
THE FACT IS WE PROBABLY
COULD'VE BEAT FAIRFAX
IF YOU HADN'T GOT SUSPENDED.

332
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,822
WHATEVER, MAN.
FUCKIN' ASSHOLE.

333
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,824
I MEAN, T-SHIRTS ?
REALLY.
I LIKED THOSE SHIRTS.

334
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:03,826
YOU NEVER WORE
THOSE SHIRTS ?
WE COULD HAVE BOUGHT THEM.

335
00:19:03,826 --> 00:19:05,828
I ALMOST GOT SUSPENDED
OVER THAT SHIT.

336
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:09,832
THANK GOD YOU TOOK THE BULLET
FOR ME AND DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
I APPRECIATE IT.

337
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:12,835
WANT A HIT ?
NAH, MAN, I GOTTA
PICK UP THE BABY.

338
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:15,838
WHY YOU ALWAYS GET STUCK
PICKIN' UP THE KID ?
I LIKE IT, OKAY ?

339
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:19,341
IT'S NOT EVEN YOUR KID.
YOU WANT A LIFT, OR YOU
WANNA STAY HERE AND WALK ?

340
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,343
[ Woman ]
THAT LOOKS GREAT.

341
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:25,347
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DON'T
GET A DRINK INSTEAD OF
SITTIN' INSIDE THIS PLACE.

I PROMISED CHLOE
WE'D COME HERE.

SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE SHE IS, BOB.

344
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:33,355
SHE'D HAVE MORE FUN
IF WE WERE AT BOARDNER'S.

345
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:37,359
SHE COULD PLAY
THE TRIVIA GAME OR THE LITTLE
RACING GAME THING SHE DOES.

346
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,362
SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL.
LITTLE GIRLS DON'T LIKE
TO GO TO BARS.

347
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:42,364
WE HAD FUN.
WE WENT TO BARS
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

348
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,867
AND ALL THE DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
RIGHT ?  REMEMBER SLIMMY ?

349
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:48,370
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
THERE'S NO SMOKING
ALLOWED IN THE STORE.

350
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:52,374
WHY, YOU SERVING FOOD ?
NO, IT'S STORE POLICY.

351
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:54,376
AND YOU CAN'T SIT
AT A STATION UNLESS
YOU PURCHASE A CERAMIC.

352
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:58,881
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS SHIT ?
I CAN'T SIT AT A STATION
WITHOUT PURCHASING A CERAMIC ?

353
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,883
WHY DON'T YOU BRING ME
AN ASHTRAY, THEN ?

354
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:04,386
CAN I COLOR ME THAT,
A CERAMIC ASHTRAY ?
RIGHT AWAY.

355
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,892
AND WHAT COLOR PAINTS
CAN I GET YOU ?
I DON'T KNOW.

356
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:14,396
SURPRISE ME.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
I'M FEELING TODAY.

357
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:17,399
NOW, LISTEN TO ME.

358
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:20,903
I THINK MAXIE'S STARTING
TO REACH OUT TO YOU
WITH THIS THING,

359
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,905
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT YOU SHOULD LET SLIP BY.

360
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,907
WHAT'S WRONG, BABY ?
HE'S NOT DOING IT.

361
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:26,909
WHAT IS
SHE SAYING ?
HE'S NOT PAINTING.

362
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,912
-I'M GONNA PAINT
 WHEN I GET MY PAINTS.
- THERE YOU GO.

363
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:35,417
THERE'S A NICE WAY
TO DO THAT.
WILL YOU PAINT ?

364
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,420
MAXIE WON'T LET ME DRIVE JESS
ANYMORE.
WHO'S HE HAVE
DRIVIN' HER ?

365
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,423
I DON'T KNOW.  I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S GOT GOIN' ON.

- ISN'T IT FUN ?
- WHAT'S THAT, SWEETIE ?

ISN'T IT FUN ?
WHAT'S THAT ?

ISN'T IT FUN ?
WHAT FUN ?

369
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,433
ISN'T IT FUN TO PAINT ?
TO PAINT ?
YEAH.  I LOVE IT.

370
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:54,937
REALLY CALMS ME DOWN.
FROGS AREN'T PURPLE,
BY THE WAY.

371
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,940
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A PURPLE FROG ?
YOU HAVE ?

372
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,442
WHEN YOU WERE ASLEEP ?
WHY YOU GIVING HER
A HARD TIME ?

373
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,945
THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY.
IF WE PLAY THIS RIGHT--

374
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:05,447
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING.
HE'S A SKETCHY CHARACTER.

375
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:09,451
I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT HIM
IN FRONT OF THE "ABY-BAY."
OKAY, LET'S DROP IT.

376
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:11,954
LET'S DROP IT.
LET'S "EX-NAY"

DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HE SAID ?

383
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,975
WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THAT ?

384
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:39,197
-HERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.
- I DON'T WANT GRILLED CHEESE.

385

GRILLED CHEESE.
I HATE CHEESE.

- YOU'RE NOT MY DADDY.
- YOU WANNA BUST MY HORNS ?

392
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,720
OR DO YOU WANT
SOME SPAGHETTI ?

393
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:07,225
- I WANT SPAGHETTIS.
- OF COURSE.  IT'S YOUR
  FAVORITE FOOD, RIGHT ?

394
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,729
YEP.
I WANT YOU TO WATCH ME
VERY CAREFULLY,

395
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,732
SO YOU'LL LEARN
HOW TO COOK.

396
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,235
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK,
YOU EAT IN RESTAURANTS
EVERY DAY.

397
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:20,238
YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAT,
BECAUSE COOKS IN RESTAURANTS
SCRATCH THEIR ASS...

398
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,742
AND THEY TOUCH THE FOOD,
AND IT'S NO GOOD,
IT'S NOT CLEAN.

399
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,245
THERE'S THINGS YOU WANNA
SPEND YOUR MONEY ON INSTEAD
OF RESTAURANTS, RIGHT ?

400
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,749
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON ?
TURTLES...

401
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,751
TURTLES.
AND STUFF
THAT I CARE ABOUT.

402
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,753
WHAT DO YOU
CARE ABOUT ?

403
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,255
I CARE ABOUT GETTING...

404
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:41,760
FOOD FOR MY PETS AND...

405
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,762
FEEDING THEM
EVERY DAY.

406
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:47,265
THAT'S RIGHT.  FEEDING THEM
EVERY DAY.  IF YOU DON'T FEED
THE ANIMALS, WHAT HAPPENS ?

407
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,768
THEY DIE.
THEY DIE,
RIGHT ?

408
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,271
THIS IS CALLED
PASTA PUTTANESCA.
 YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS ?

409
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,274
THAT MEANS
BAD GIRL'S PASTA,

410
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,276
AND THERE'S
ONLY ENOUGH FOR ONE.

411
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,780
THAT MEANS YOU GET TO EAT IT.
THAT MEANS I GOTTA EAT
A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH.

412
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,282
LOOK AT THAT.  CAN YOU
SMELL THAT ?  SMELLS GOOD.
YEAH.

413
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,785
[ Doorbell Rings ]
[ Jessica ]  BABY,
COULD YOU GET THAT ?

414
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,288
ALL RIGHT.  HOLD ON A SECOND.
DON'T TOUCH THE STOVE.
IT'S HOT.

415
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,290

I GOT IT.

00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,305
HO'S FINE.
HO'S A FUCKING PIMP, OKAY ?

420
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,808
HE ENCOURAGES WENDY
TO TURN TRICKS,
AND SHE'S HIS FUCKING WIFE !

421
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,310
KEEP IT DOWN.
HE CAN HEAR YOU.
IT'S MY HOUSE !

422
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,813
I'M NOT GONNA KEEP IT DOWN.
HE'S NOT FUCKIN' DRIVIN' YOU !

423
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,315
LISTEN TO ME, BOBBY.

424
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,317
THIS IS MY JOB,
OKAY ?

425
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,821
IT PUTS A ROOF OVER ME,
MY DAUGHTER AND YOU,

426
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,323
FOR AS LONG
AS YOU WANNA STAY.

427
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,325
I WANT YOU TO QUIT.

428
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,829
WILL YOU LOOK
AT MY BILLS ?  I CAN'T.

429
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:55,333
I'M NOT GONNA PUT HER THROUGH
WHAT I WENT THROUGH.
I-I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

430
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,836
I'LL SUPPORT YOU.
WITH WHAT ?

431
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,838
I--  MAXIE OFFERED
TO STAKE ME.

432
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,843
MAX OFFERS
A LOT OF THINGS, OKAY ?

433
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,346
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
HE'S NOT THE SWEET OLD GUY
YOU THINK HE IS.

434
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,350
DON'T GET
MY HOPES UP, OKAY ?

435
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,354
IF I QUIT, AND IT DOESN'T
WORK OUT, THEN WHAT, HUH ?

436
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,858
I-I CAN'T GO
THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

437
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,901
[ Max ]
THIS IS THE LAST TIME I SPEAK
TO EITHER OF YOU IN PERSON...

438
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,404
ABOUT WORK-RELATED MATTERS.

439
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,907
ALL OUR INTERACTIONS
IN THE FUTURE
WILL BE SOCIAL.

440
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:39,911
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
THAT ARE WORK-RELATED,

441
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,414
YOU WILL DIRECT THEM
TO RUIZ.

442
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,417
HE HAS
MY COMPLETE CONFIDENCE.

443
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,921
EVERYTHING YOU NEED
OR NEED TO KNOW...

444
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,923
IS IN
THOSE ENVELOPES.

445
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,926
DO NOTOPEN THESE ENVELOPES...

446
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,928
UNTIL YOU HAVE
LEFT THE OFFICE.

447
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,812
I STARTED OPENING IT--
MIND IF I BORROW
A PIECE OF TAPE ?

448
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,747
- THAT WAY I'LL--
- OPEN THE FUCKIN' THING.

449
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:21,753
YOU WILL EACH HAVE $1,500,
A NUMERIC PAGER,

450
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:25,257
A DOUBLE-"A" BATTERY

451
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,260
ROUND-TRIP TICKET
TO J.F.K.

452
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,262
YOU WILL BE CONTACTED
ON YOUR PAGER--

453
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,764
SO WE'RE GOING
TO NEW YORK CITY ?

454
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,769
YES, YOU'RE GOING TO NEW YORK.

455
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,274
YOU WILL BE CONTACTED
ON YOUR PAGER--

456
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,775
[ Ricky ]
MAX, ONE MORE THING.

457
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:49,281
WHO AM I DROPPING THIS
OFF TO ?  WHO GETS
THEIR HANDS ON THIS ?

458
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,284
THAT'S YOUR PER DIEM.

459
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,786
YEAH,
THAT'S MY PER DIEM.

460
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,289
WHO DO I GIVE IT TO ?
 WHO DO I DROP IT OFF TO ?

461
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,292
IT'S YOURS.
YOU KEEP IT.
THIS IS MINE TO HAVE ?

462
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,794
YES.  YES.
FOR SPENDING MONEY ?

463
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:06,298
AND YOU GOT
1,500 TOO ?
UH-HUH.

464
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,300
YOU WILL BE
CONTACTED...

465
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,802
ON YOUR PAGER
AS TO WHERE YOU GO.

466
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,807
YOU HAVE EACH BEEN GIVEN
AN EXTRA BATTERY.

467
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:20,812
SO THERE SHOULD BE
ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE...

468
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,814
WHEN YOU GET
A PAGE...

469
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,816
THAT YOU WILL
ANSWER IT IMMEDIATELY.

470
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,818
YES.
YES, SIR.

471
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,821
YOU WILL NOT CARRY
ANY OTHER PAGERS WITH YOU.

472
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:34,326
YOU WILL NOT,
FOR THAT MATTER,
CARRY ANYTHING...

473
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,829
OTHER THAN WHAT
I HAVE JUST GIVEN YOU.

474
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,332
- KEYS ?
- WHAT ?

475
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,835
WHAT ABOUT MY HOUSE KEYS ?
THAT WAY I CAN GET BACK IN.

476
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:47,339
I COULD LEAVE 'EM WITH YOU.
WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO.
YOU'RE CALLIN' THE SHOTS.

477
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,342
YOU CAN CARRY YOUR KEYS.

478
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,344
YOU WILL NOT MENTION
MY NAME...

479
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,348
OR IMPLY THAT YOU
ARE IN MY EMPLOY.

480
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,351
YOU WILL NOT
SPEAK TO ANYONE
WHEN YOU ARE WORKING.

481
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,355
WHEN YOU ARE NOT WORKING,
YOU ARE CONSIDERED
TO BE ON CALL...

482
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,358
AND AVAILABLE
24 HOURS A DAY.

483
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,361
THAT MEANS THAT YOU
DO NOT GET DRUNK...

484
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,364
OR DO ANYTHING
THAT WILL PREVENT YOU...

485
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,367
FROM OPERATING
IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER.

486
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,869
THERE IS A NUMBER
IN YOUR PAGER'S MEMORY.

487
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,373
IT IS A CAR SERVICE.

488
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,876
IF THEY CALL YOU UP AND THEY
ASK YOU THE ACCOUNT,

489
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,879
YOU SAY "CARDIFF GIANT."

490
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,882
THEY WILL COME
AND THEY WILL
PICK YOU UP...

491
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:34,386
AND TAKE YOU
WHEREVER YOU
WANT TO GO.

492
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:38,890
THAT MEANS THAT
THERE IS NO DESTINATION
THAT YOU CANNOT REACH...

493
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,393
WITHIN 15 MINUTES.

494
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,896
FIFTEEN MINUTES.
IS THERE A PATTERN
FORMING HERE ?

495
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:48,400
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.
WHAT IS IT ?

496
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,902
- YOU WANT US TO BE
  WHEREVER YOU WANT--
- LET HIM TELL ME.

497
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,906
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I GOT IT.

498
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,409
TELL ME.  WHAT IS IT ?

499
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,412
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE PICKING ON ME, MAX.

500
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:04,916
BECAUSE YOU LOST
MY FUCKIN'
CARPET-CLEANING VAN,

501
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,553
AND I DON'T LIKE YOU,
YOU COCKSUCKER !

502
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,758
I PARKED THE VAN AND
LEFT IT FOR FIVE MINUTES,
YOU WANT US TO BE...

503
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:17,262
WHEREVER YOU WANT US TO BE
A.S.A.P.
I LOCKED IT,
PUT THE CLUB ON IT--

504
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,764
YES.  GOOD-BYE.

505
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,767
WHAT AM I DROPPING OFF
ON THE TRIP ?

506
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,770
WHAT'S THE--
WHAT ARE WE--
GOOD-BYE !

507
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:00,805
[ Bobby ]
HERE WE ARE.

508
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,808
3D AND G.
 3D AND G.

509
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,315
I THINK YOU GOT IT WRONG, BOB.
THAT'S MINE.  I'M IN 3D.

510
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,317
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE, 3G.
THEY'RE BOTH AISLES.
WHAT'S THE--

511
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,820
I WAS ASSIGNED THAT SEAT.
 I LIKE TO FOLLOW THE RULES.
OKAY.

512
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:22,827
YOU'RE IN 3G,
AND I'M IN 3D.
ALL RIGHT.  OKAY.

513
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:26,831
OH, MAN.  SEE,
WHEN YOU'RE IN WITH MAXIE,
HE TAKES CARE OF YOUR SHIT.

514
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,335
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?
STRETCH IT OUT, KEEP IT NICE.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE.

515
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,338
BEATS THE HELL OUT OF
CLEANING CARPETS.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

516
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,840
COMFORTABLE, COMFORTABLE,
 COMFORTABLE.
I WONDER WHAT THE MOVIE IS.

517
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,343
I'LL ASK THE LADY
WHAT THE MOVIE IS.
DON'T BUG HER.

518
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,345
THEY LIKE TO HELP.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE HERE FOR.

519
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,347
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.
DON'T CARRY GUILT WITH IT.

520
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,849
CHAMPAGNE OR ORANGE JUICE ?
OH, PERFECT.

521
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,852
WHAT A WONDERFUL KICKOFF
TO THE TRIP.  CHEERS.
OKAY.

522
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,356
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
UH, OOH.  OKAY.

523
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,359
MY BUTTON DOWN HERE.

524
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,362
[ Ricky ]  I LOVE
THIS SHIT, MY MAN.
[ Bell Dings ]

525
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,864
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
YOU WITH ME ?

526
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,866
GIVE ME IT.
RIGHT HERE.
YES ?

527
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,868
YEAH, I WAS
JUST WONDERING...
EXCUSE ME.
SORRY.

528
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,871
WHAT THE MOVIE WAS TONIGHT.
IT'S IN YOUR COPY
OFAMBASSADOR.

529
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,873
I BELIEVE IT'S
MICKEY BLUE EYES.

530
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,876
UGH.
I CAN BRING YOU
A LIST OF VIDEOS.

531
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,879
I JUST WANT TO OFFER THE OTHER
PASSENGERS A DRINK FIRST.
THAT'S GREAT.

532
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,383
WHAT'S THE OVERHEAD
ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

533
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,385
WHAT'S THE ACTION
THAT'S GONNA COME MY WAY ?

534
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,887
WHAT'S THE ACTION THAT'S
GONNA COME YOUR WAY ?
YEAH.

535
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:26,391
WHAT'S IT GONNA COST ME
FOR THE VIDEOS ?
OH, NO.

536
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,393
YOU'RE UP FRONT.
EVERYTHING'S FREE UP HERE.

537
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,896
OH !  WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.
SEE THAT SHIT ?

538
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,898
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT--  SEE, NOW--

539
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,402
THEY SET YOU UP.
[ Bell Dings ]

540
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,905
THEY DROP THIS ON YOU.
I BET THERE'S A HIDDEN TAX.

541
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,907
EXCUSE ME, SWEETIE.
YES.
EXCUSE ME.

542
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,910
WHERE THE DRINKS
ARE CONCERNED,
IS THAT A HIDDEN TAX ?

543
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:49,914
DOES THAT FALL UNDER
THE COMPLIMENTARY SERVICE, OR IS
THAT SOMETHING YOU PAY FOR ?

544
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,916
NO, NO.  THEY'RE COMPLIMENTARY.
WOULD YOU CARE FOR ANOTHER ONE ?

545
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,419
THEY'RE COMPLIMENTARY.
YOU BET YOUR ASS I WOULD.
YES.

546
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,921
[ Chuckling ]
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.

547
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,923
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

548
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,926
CAN I GET A CUTTY
ON THE ROCKS TOO ?
IS THAT COMPLIMENTARY ?

549
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,429
YES, YES.
CHEERS, MAN.
YOU HEAR THAT SHIT ?

550
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,431
EVERYTHING UP HERE
IS FREE.
OKAY.

551
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,433
YOU CAN DRINK AS MUCH
AS YOU WANT UP FRONT,

552
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,435
HAVE A NICE FLING,
WE GET OUR VIDEOS GOING.

553
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:15,440
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ON CALL,
WE COULD DRINK AS MUCH AS WE
WANT, BUT WE REALLY SHOULDN'T.

554
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,442
OH, YEAH, BECAUSE THEY'RE
PROBABLY GONNA PAGE US...

555
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,944
AND ASK US TO WHACK OUT
THE PILOT UP FRONT.

556
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,447
UNLESS WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO
IN THE NEXT FIVE HOURS,

557
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,950
WE COULD SIT HERE,
HAVE DRINKS, RELAX LIKE
GENTLEMEN AND ENJOY OURSELVES...

558
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,952
AND ACTUALLY HAVE FUN
WITH THE TRIP,
TRUE.

559
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,456
VERSUS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE
TRIP AND EVERY TIME I SIT DOWN,
IT'S YOUR SEAT, MY SEAT.

560
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,458
AS LONG AS WE DON'T
SHOW UP HAMMERED--

561
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,461
AS LONG AS WE DON'T TALK
TO SOMEONE LIKE A SCHOOLTEACHER,
WE HAVE FUN.

562
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,964
WE HAVE TO REPRESENT MAX.
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TO DO.
I'M REPRESENTING FUCKING MAX.

563
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,966
COULD YOU STOP
WITH THE--

564
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,970
YES.  EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

565
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,473
I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED.
WHERE'S YOUR HOME ?

566
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,475
I OPERATE
OUT OF CHICAGO--
I'M RICKY SLADE.

567
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,477
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

568
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,979
THIS IS MY FRIEND HERE.
 THIS IS ROBERT RICIGLIANO.

569
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,981
AND WHAT
WAS YOUR NAME ?
TERI.

570
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,985
IT TURNS OUT
WE'RE GONNA BE SPENDING
THE NIGHT IN NEW YORK.

571
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,989
IT WORKED OUT WELL FOR ALL
OF US.  I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT
BACK TO THE BUSINESS CLASS.

572
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,492
ROUND UP
A COUPLE HONEYS.

573
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,496
AT OUR HOTEL ROOM, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE KIND OF A POOL PARTY,
CALIFORNIA GANGSTER STYLE.

574
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,498
YOU KNOW, KICK-ASS
POOL PARTY THING ?

575
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:17,001
LISTEN, ASSHOLE.  I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI.

576
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,003
NO MAN TALKS TO ME
LIKE THAT.

577
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,005
NOW, YOU CAN EITHER
LEARN SOME MANNERS,

578
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,508
OR I CAN MAKE A FORMAL COMPLAINT
TO THE AIRPORT AUTHORITIES...

579
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:27,011
AND WE CAN SORT THIS OUT
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING STANDBY
FOR THE NEXT FLIGHT TO KENNEDY.

580
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,013
OKAY.  YEAH.

581
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,517
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"WE CAN SORT IT OUT" ?

582
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:36,020
DOES SHE HAVE TO DO THAT
SO THEY DON'T KNOW
SHE'S INTO MY SHIT ?

583
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,023
LET'S SORT IT OUT NOW.
[ Bell Dings ]

584
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,530
SHIT !  I GOT
NO NEW PAGES.

585
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,032
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO.

586
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,034
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST CALL A CAB.

587
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,537
[ Bobby ]
OH, WAIT.
THERE'S OUR GUY.

588
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,039
LOOK.  THE SIGN.
CARDIFF GIANT.

589
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,042
HI, I THINK

00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,551
YOU'RE GOING TO
THE SOHO GRAND HOTEL,
AM I RIGHT ?

592
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:10,555
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL I KNOW--  CARDIFF GIANT.
THAT'S OUR ACCOUNT.

593
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,559
RIGHT, AND YOU'RE STAYING
AT THE SOHO GRAND.  YOU GOT
ANY LUGGAGE CHECKED ?

594
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,061
NO.
TRAVELIN' LIGHT.

595
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,564
[ Ricky ]
HEY, UH, IS IT NICE ?

YOU'LL LOVE IT.

00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,576
SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, BOBBY.

600
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:35,079
FIRST CLASS, YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN ?  YOU GOTTA GET USED
TO IT.  YOU DESERVE IT.

601
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,582
YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.

602
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:41,085
HEY, LADY, YOU MISSED OUT.
I'M STAYING AT THE SOHO GRAND
THIS TRIP.

603
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,088
I'D GIVE YOU A RIDE,
BUT I GOTTA STRETCH MY SHIT OUT.

604
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,591
I'M A TALL DRINK OF WATER.
I DON'T WANNA WRINKLE ANYTHING.

605
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:01,105
[ Whirring ]

606
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,893
LOOKS GOOD.  OKAY,
SO WHENEVER I WANT TO--

607
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:10,398
UH, YEAH, WELL, UH,

609
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,403
CALL MY NUMBER.
IT'S MY CELL.
OKAY.

610
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:17,405
YOU WANT ONE HERE ?
GET A CARD.

611
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,409
PERFECT, MY MAN.

612
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,913
SO, JIMBO, YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH
LIKE MY BOY FOR THIS THING,
LIKE MY OWN PRIVATE GUY ?

613
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:30,418
WELL, I HANDLE MOST OF, UH,
CARDIFF GIANT'S ACCOUNTS.
YEAH.  OKAY.

614
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:33,421
[ Ricky ]  DO YOU
KNOW MY PAGER NUMBER ?
I DON'T KNOW.  WHAT IS IT ?

615
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:37,425
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU'D KNOW WHAT IT IS.

616
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:40,428
YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHAT KIND OF JOB
I'M THROWIN' DOWN THIS TIME ?

617
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:43,931
THE JOB ?
[ Whirring,
  Glass Squeaking ]

618
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:46,934
ALL I KNOW IS, UH,
THAT I'M TAKING YOU
TO THE SOHO GRAND.

619
00:34:46,934 --> 00:34:48,936
[ Bobby ]
WHERE IS THAT ?
IT'S IN SOHO.

620
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,484
[ Man ]
THE AREA IS CALLED SOHO...

621
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:38,486
BECAUSE IT'S LOCATED
JUST DIRECTLY SOUTH OF HOUSTON.

622
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,488
THEREFORE IT'S SOHO.

623
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:43,991
[ Bobby ]  YEAH.
THERE'S A SPA DOWNSTAIRS.
YOU GENTLEMEN WORK OUT ?

624
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:46,494
[ Ricky ]
LET'S SEE THE DIGS HERE.
IS THAT ALL RIGHT ?

625
00:35:46,494 --> 00:35:48,496
OH, MAX.
LOOKIN' GOOD, HUH ?

626
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:51,499
THERE'S AN EXCELLENT CAFE
CALLED CAVIAR,
AND IT'S DOWNSTAIRS.

627
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:55,503
IT'S GREAT FOR PEOPLE-WATCHING,
AND WILLEM DAFOE COMES THERE
SOMETIMES AND--

628
00:35:55,503 --> 00:35:58,005
WHERE ARE YOU
GENTLEMEN FROM ?

629
00:35:58,005 --> 00:36:00,508
WE'RE FROM OUT OF TOWN.
HERE'S THE KEY
TO THE MINIBAR.

630
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:02,510
OH, GREAT.
IS THAT FOR THIS HERE ?

631
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,512
ROOM AND TAX
HAVE BEEN PICKED UP

[ Ricky ]
I'M SORRY.  AN INCIDENTAL.
I'M NOT FOLLOWING EXACTLY.

634
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:14,021
OH, THAT'S, UH, PHONE,

642
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:37,545
I DON'T.
NOT ON ME, SIR.
OKAY, BRING ME BACK 80.

643
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,547
ARE YOU SURE ?
GO ON.  YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

644
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:43,050
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR.
I'M SORRY.
HOW IS IT ?
SO I KNOW.

645
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,053
WHAT KIND OF ROOM
ARE WE LOOKING AT
NOW THAT THIS HAPPENED ?

646
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:49,557
- ALL THE SUITES
  ARE ABOUT THE SAME, SIR.
-YEAH.  OKAY.  LOOK IT.

647
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:53,060
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO NEGOTIATE.
I KNOW YOU GOT FISH
TO DROP OFF, PROBABLY.

648
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,062
WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING AT ?
HONESTLY,

649
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:57,565
THE SUITES
ARE ABOUT THE SAME.
IF YOU BRING ME BACK 60,

650
00:36:57,565 --> 00:36:59,567
DOES ONE SUITE LOOK BETTER
THAN THE OTHER SUITES ?
HI, GIRLS.

651
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,569
UNCLE BOBBY HERE.

652
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:04,572
...AS GOOD A SUITE AS
WE HAVE, UNLESS YOU WANT
TWO BEDROOMS.

653
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:06,574
WOULD YOU LIKE
TWO BEDROOMS ?
NO, THAT'S COOL.

654
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:09,076
JUST MAKE SURE I GET BACK
THE ORIGINAL 80, THEN.

655
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:11,579
I WANT BACK THE 80.

I COULD GET LAID ON THE SUBWAY.

661
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:29,096
STAY WITH ME HERE.
JUST STAY WITH ME.
GO QUICKLY.

PRETTY HOT TONIGHT.

663
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,101
FORUM'S HOT ?
MIGHT BE HARD
TO GET IN.

664
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:36,103
YOU LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT.
LOOK AT ME.  OKAY ?

665
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:38,105
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS ?
THROW IT TO ME.

666
00:37:38,105 --> 00:37:41,108

NEED ME TO WRITE IT DOWN ?
PERFECT.

667
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:43,611
NO.  WE'LL SEE YOU
WITH THE 80.
I'LL BRING UP YOUR CHANGE.

668
00:37:43,611 --> 00:37:45,613
I'LL PUT THIS IN YOUR ROOM.
DON'T SPILL THAT.
I LIKE THE FISH.

669
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:48,115
COME ON !
WHO YOU CALLIN' NOW ?

670
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:50,117
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

671
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:55,122
HELLO, ROOM SERVICE ?
CAN I GET A COUPLE CHEESEBURGERS
AND TWO HEINEKENS, PLEASE ?

672
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:58,626
NO, I'M RICKY SLADE,
BUT I'M ACTUALLY STAYING--
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT ?

673
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:02,630
THAT'S COOL.
THEY GOT COMPUTERS SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY WHAT ROOM YOU'RE IN.

674
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,133
- FIND OUT HOW MUCH IT IS.
-JUST SO YOU KNOW,
 THEY KNOW WHERE YOU'RE AT.

675
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:08,135
HOW MUCH IS IT ?  PERFECT.

676
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:11,639
IF IT'S UP IN THE NEXT
15 MINUTES, I'M GONNA
TELL YOU HOW I DO RIGHT NOW.

677
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,642
TEN-DOLLAR TIP.
I'M SETTIN' THE PRECEDENT NOW.

678
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:16,644
HOW MUCH IS IT ?
IN THE FUTURE
WHEN I CALL,

679
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:19,146
AND I SAY THAT
TO YOU, OKAY ?

680
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:21,649
HOW MUCH WAS IT ?
IT'S 46.
THAT'S ALL.

681
00:38:22,149 --> 00:38:25,152
FORTY-SIX PLUS TEN.
YEAH, BUT YOU
HAVE TO TIP PEOPLE.

682
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,154
IT'S MY FUCKIN' ROOM.
YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

683
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:32,159
BOB, YOU HEARD THE CAPTAIN.
YOU HAVE $150 IN INCIDENTALS.

684
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,161
THAT FALLS UNDER
THE INCIDENTAL, BUT YOU
DIDN'T WANNA LISTEN.

685
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:37,164
- RICKY, HOW LONG
  ARE WE GONNA BE HERE ?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

686
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:40,167
WE DON'T KNOW.  THAT'S MY POINT.
 WE MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE IT LAST.

687
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:43,170
DO YOU WANT 'EM
TO PUT IT ON MINE ?
I WANT THIS TO STOP.

688
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,675
- IT'S ON ME, OKAY ?
- I'VE LOOKED FORWARD TO
  THIS TRIP FOR A LONG TIME.

689
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:49,677
COULD WE JUST BE
SMART ABOUT THIS ?
I'LL BE SMART.

690
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:52,179
FINE, BUT I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

691
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:56,183
- I DON'T LIKE YOUR ATTITUDE.
- YOU DON'T LIKEMYATTITUDE ?
  WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT ?

692
00:38:56,183 --> 00:38:59,186
LOOK AROUND.
WE'RE MOVING UP IN THE WORLD.
WE SHOULD BE ENJOYING OURSELVES.

693
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:02,690
I KNOW YOU HAD A BLUE-COLLAR
MENTALITY POUNDED INTO YOUR HEAD
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.  I HAVE TOO.

THAT'S AN AGE
WE WANNA GET HER GOING.
I LISTENED TO THE COUNSELOR.

SHE SAID SHE TESTED

YES.

SHE SAID THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
WITH THE MAGNET SCHOOLS,
WILL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.
