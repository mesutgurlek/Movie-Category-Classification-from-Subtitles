In the criminal justice system

00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:06,850
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

the police
who investigate crime

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,654
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,385
These are their stories.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,588
Nice trip, Mr. Grobman?

7
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,822
Too short, Rudy.
Is there any mail?

8
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,263
Oh, yes, sir. And a
package from the court.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,028
Well, make sure my wife gets that
when she comes up from the garage.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,467
Oh, sure thing.

All I saw, Judge
Grobman was wounded,

17
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,241
and that car was
fishtailing out of here.

18
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,116
Brand new Jaguar XJR.

19
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,588
And did you see anybody hangin'
around here before it happened?

20
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,523
Nobody who didn't belong.

21
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,925
She's a nice lady.
She gonna be okay?

22
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,758
I hope so.
Thanks for your help.

23
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,123
Which hospital?
St. Marks.

24
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,133
Husband went with her in the ambulance.
Any witnesses?

25
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,601
Not that we know of. We got the
car info from the doorman,

APB went out maybe seven minutes
after shots were fired.

Okay, thanks. Canvass the tenants and see
if there's anybody we need to talk to.

Victim's Denise Grobman,

She and her husband have lived
here for nine years and change.

Husband's an architect.

What do you got?

32
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,084
Victim went down, here. .38's hers.
Two rounds fired.

needs a gun?

Maybe she hands
out too much alimony.

You find the slugs?

36
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,195
No. Blood over here
can't be hers.

37
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,993
She might've hit him two
out of two, good shooting.

38
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,034
Fair. Good would be
him layin' here dead.

three cigarette butts.

for the first opportunity.

41

Fuse box is open. Maybe it
was an electrician working.

42
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,805
Maybe. Dust it anyway.

43
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,471
Yeah. No problem.

car-jacker's got two gunshot wounds,

I'm feelin' lucky.

We have a cottage
in Sag Harbor.

51

We'd been there a few days.

53
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,848
No.

00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,947
Mr. Grobman?
She came through surgery.

What are her injuries?

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,461
She took two hits, one
severed her lumbar spine,

60
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,662
the other damaged her kidneys,
we had to remove one of them.

61
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,136
Will we be able to talk to her?

62
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,503
If she lives.
Give me your card.

63

64

Uniforms turned up a witness.

65
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,177
He was smokin' a cigarette.

66
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,080
The fuse box was open,
I figure he workin' on it.

67
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,345
What did he look like?

68
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,683
Like a guy who'd be
workin' on a fuse box.

69
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,986
And I don't think this is who
shot the lady and stole her car.

ED: Why not?

71
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,854
Well, if he wanted a car,

72
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,862
he would have taken my
Mercedes, wouldn't he?

73
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,524
I leave the keys
in the ignition.

74
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,759
Why?

75
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,393
Well, I got tired of
spending half my time

76
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,563
trying to remember
where I put them.

77
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,100
Thanks.

78
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,770
If he'd wanted just any car,

79
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,402
he'd have taken
the old man's Mercedes.

80

Jag was stolen to order.

00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,544
Well, hospitals don't have any

83
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,018

Here's your possibles.

They specialize in high-end
European cars to order.

88
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,225
So, in other words,
if I wanted an XJR,

89
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,821
and I didn't
want to pay retail...

90

Check with the
auto theft squad.

92
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,063
These guys have all got DMV
clerks on the payroll.

Hard to catch them.

94
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,770
So the clerk puts the stolen car in the
system under a different VIN number?

95
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,243
Yeah. Well, how do you figure
out which ones are stolen?

96
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,576

registered since last Thursday.

99
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,447
Two private party sales, which is almost
always how the stolen ones show up.

100
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,084
Well, who sold them?

101
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,890
Seller's gonna be a phony
if the car's hot.

102
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,055
Okay, then, who bought them?

103
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,435
Got a Susan Robbinson,
and a Matthew Carton, MD.

104

Hey.

110
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,913
Who wants to know?

111
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,410
I didn't know it was stolen.

112
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,045
Is this the guy
you bought it from.

113
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,987
No. He was older.

114
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,581
One of these?

115
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,363
You got no record, why do you
wanna do this the hard way?

116
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:24,167
Nice leather upholstery. Cleans up
pretty good, but not good enough.

117
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,762
What's that mean?

118
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,567
Blood in the seams.
Do you read the papers?

119
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,903
A New York state judge
was shot over this car.

120
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,967

what that means for you.

I couldn't afford a
decent car any other way.

124
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,023
How much did you pay for it?

125
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,788
20k.

126
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,995
You could've gotten a perfectly
good, legal car for half that much.

said he had a line on
an XJR, did I want it?

139
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,768
He wanted 5k, I told him three.

140
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,330
Ha. The doctor paid twenty.
Nice profit margin.

141

00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,405
No, I mean, was he in
pain, limping, bleeding.

144
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,173
Looked fine to me.

145
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,274
Where can we find him?

00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,251
What the hell is this, man?

161
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,687
One,

162
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,916
two.

163
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,654
Hey, that's mine.

164
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,024
Must be six,
seven hundred here.

165
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,563
Three grand goes
pretty fast, huh?

166
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,621
Well, well, well, what's this?

167
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:40,004
Blood. Wow. Probably
10, 15 grand here.

168
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,437
Where'd you get it, Bobby?

169
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,768
Bite me.

170
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,467
Go ahead, bite him.

171
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,111
I didn't steal the car.
I didn't shoot no judge.

172
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,477
Look, I wasn't even there.

173
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,676
You sold the car to Krasner.

174
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,616
He thought it was
his cousin's car!

175
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,779
Hey, the gun we took off
of you's at the lab.

176
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,789
If it turns out it's the
one that shot the judge,

177
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,256
it's bye-bye, Bobby.

178
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,486
I told you,
it's my cousin's gun.

179
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,495
The cousin you left to die.

180
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,087
Hey, I was gonna call that in,

181
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,722
you know, when
I got out of state.

182
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,028
Not that you asked,
but he's in surgery.

183
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,798
Your story better match the one
he tells when he comes to.

184
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,396
Where'd the bloody
14 grand come from?

185
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,809
Possession and sale
of stolen property.

186
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,043
No charges on the shooting
or the car theft.

187
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,280
That's up to the D.A., you can
take your chances if you want.

188
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,018
All right.

189
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,761
Danny said he has
a line on an XJR,

190
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,263
I told him I got experience,
he should let me rip it.

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,731
He said, no,
it's a piece of cake,

192
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,790
he just wanted me
to help him turn it over.

193
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,131
So you talked to Krasner.

194
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,365
Yeah, Krasner tops
out at 3 grand.

195
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,201
Danny said that's okay 'cause
he got something in the works

196
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,538
that's worth like,
10 times that.

197
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,873
ED: What was in the works?

198
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,276
He wouldn't tell me.

199
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,281
Ten times three is 30,000.

200
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,044
We took almost 15 off of you,

201
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,175
where's the rest of it?

202
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,378
That's all he had on him.

203
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,977
What? You ripped
a guy off for 15 grand

204
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,489
and you didn't even ask
him where rest of it was?

205
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,286
Yeah. He said
he didn't have it yet.

206
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,690
Look, you want more than that,

207
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,557
you're gonna have
to talk to Danny.

208
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,129
We got a situation.

209
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,963
Looks like that big wad of money
was some kind of down payment.

210
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,400
Half up front, half later.

211
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,528
Murder for hire?

212
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,662
Well that's what it looks like.

213
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,071
We won't know for sure until
we lean on Cousin Danny.

214
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,767
Well, you're gonna
have to lean pretty far.

215
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,141
He just died on
the operating table.

216
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,740
So we do it the hard way.

217
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,083
Who wanted Judge Grobman dead?

218
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:39,123
Well, she sat on the criminal
court bench for ten years

219
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,522
before she moved over to civil.

220
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,356
And she'd just accepted a position
at the Justice Department,

221
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,726
Assistant Attorney
General for Civil Rights,

222
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,321
due to move DC next month.

223
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,162
What's the connection
to Danny Ward?

224
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:52,999
Well, what we've got, Danny Ward
had 14 jobs since high school.

225
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,063
Pizza delivery, air conditioner
repair, pretzel vendor...

226
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,437
I get the idea.

227
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,875
Arrested four times,
penny-ante stuff,

228
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,379
one conviction for disorderly
conduct, probation.

229
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,676
Big step up from there to
carjacking and attempted murder.

230
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,342
The gun we took from Cousin
Bobby shot the judge.

231
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,615
Her gun shot
the late Danny Ward.

232
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,122
It's Danny's blood
on the money.

233
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,516
Okay, that's settled.

234
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,083
Let's move on to who hired him.

235
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,153
Had to be somebody who knew when they
were comin' back from Long Island.

236
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,256
Well, assuming she
didn't hire him herself,

237
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,232
we know one other
person who knew.

238
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,098
Start with him.

239
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,736
I don't know this man.

240
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,773
The name "Danny Ward"
mean anything to you?

241
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,035
No.

242
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,340
Do you really think that somebody
hired him to shoot my wife?

243
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,745
Yeah. Somebody who knew when you
and your wife were comin' back.

244
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,648
But nobody knew
except Denise and me.

245
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,789
Oh, you don't think
that I hired him?

246
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,915
Who else knew when
you'd be coming home?

247
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,257
Well, we came back early, we were
supposed to stay till Sunday.

248
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,421
But Denise's clerk
called Thursday morning.

249
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,726
Something about a meeting
she had to go to on Friday.

250
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,698
So you and the clerk
knew, who else?

251
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,360
Well, nobody that I know of.

252
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,495
You and your wife
get along okay?

253
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,172
Hey, it's our job to ask.

254
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,708
Yeah, well, you're
way off base there.

255
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,766
We've been married
twenty-seven years.

256
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,814
I've given her a painkiller.
You've got two minutes.

257
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,873
We'd like to talk to her alone.

258
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,247
I'm goin' in with you.

259
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,980
No, sir, you're not.

260
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,625
That's him.

261
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,355
You returned fire?

262
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,925
Yes.

263
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,431
I don't remember anything else.

264
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,801
Forgive me, you and your husband
have a good relationship?

265
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,767
Why?

266
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,332
It looks like someone hired
this guy to shoot you.

267
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,779
Not my husband, not possible.

268
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,816
Anybody besides
him and your clerk

269
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,943
who knew you were
comin' back to the city early?

270
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,654
I can't remember.

271
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,748
BRISCOE:
You did the driving?

272
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,157
Walter wanted a nap.

273
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,593
At noon?

274
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,957
Up late.

275
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,659
Why'd he get out before you
drove into the garage?

276
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,402
Not Walter.

277
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,805
Ridiculous.

278
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,933
Please, I need to rest.

279
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,480
ED: Your boss ever
get any threats?

280
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,882
All judges get threats.

281
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,510
The D.A.'s office
checks them out.

282
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,781
They never found
anything serious.

283
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,220
We'd like to check
'em out ourselves.

284
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,621
I'll get you the file.

285
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,193
What time did you
call the judge?

286
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,422
Around 9:30
that morning.

287
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,856
Were there ever any problems
between the judge and her husband?

288
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,363
Uh, he probably wishes
she wouldn't work so hard.

289
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,199
Career comes first, huh?

290
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,537
A tie for first.
They're a devoted couple.

291
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,703
Uh, did you tell anybody else
that she was coming back early?

292
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,440
I called her doorman
to tell him

293
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,175
I was messengering
a packet to her.

294
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,342
Documents she needed for
the conference on Friday.

295
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,408
The judge was a plaintiff
in a civil action?

296
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,383
Judge Grobman's president
of a co-op board,

297
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,549
they sued their management
company a couple of years ago,

298
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,990
Marleton Realty.

299
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,152
ED: What for?

300
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,095
They were extorting kickbacks from
subcontractors and service companies.

301
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,222
They get ugly?

302
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,268
Extremely. The head of
Marleton is not a nice man.

303
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,532
Greg Torino?

304
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,832
Yes.

305
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,373
Torino even found a way to put the
bite on other companies' delivery men.

306
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,137
This avenue look promising?

307
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,905
Torino's a real piece of work.

308
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,210
Judge Grobman ripped him to shreds
and almost put him out of business.

309
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,046
Where's that list
of Danny Ward's jobs?

310
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,623
He worked briefly for
All-Kool Heating and Air.

311
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,685
Guess who did maintenance and repairs
for Judge Grobman's building.

312
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,888
All-Kool.

313
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,192
There's the dot that connects
Torino to Danny Ward.

314
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,461
It doesn't explain how
Torino could've known

315
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,831
the Grobmans were
coming home early.

316
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,831
The doorman.

317
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,372
The judge's clerk
told the doorman.

318
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,567
And he probably knows
people at Marleton.

319
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,207
I didn't have a damn
thing to with it.

320
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,407
I didn't tell anybody the
Grobmans were coming back early.

321
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,973
It's a straight line from you,
to Torino, to the shooter.

322
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,518
I got nothing to do
with Torino!

323
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,144
I'm the one who blew the
whistle on him to the board.

324
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,280
Who got All-Kool
this contract. Torino?

325
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,689
They were already here when
Torino took over management.

326
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,953
They don't owe him anything.

327
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,189
And Torino put the bite on
everybody except All-Kool?

328
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,525
That's what I'm saying.

329
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,623
We're gonna leave Officer Johnson
here to keep you company

330
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,326
while we check on some things.

331
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,664
You can't leave a cop here.

332
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,136
It'll tone up the place.

333
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,540
Danny Ward didn't do any residential
work, strictly commercial.

334
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,442
Here.
Here's his job list.

335
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,538
There's no Torino
on any of these jobs?

336
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:31,775
No.

337
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,545
I'd like to help you
nail that son of a bitch

338
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,950
but I don't see how he and Danny
could have crossed paths.

339
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,488
How'd you get the maintenance
contract to Judge Grobman's building?

340
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,455
No idea.
I was a crew foreman then.

341
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:41,890
The owner back
then must've known,

342
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,052
but he's dead.

343
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,151
Would it be in those files?

344
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,457
Maybe.

345
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,960
Yeah, we got recommended off a job
we did at a Queens mini-mall.

346
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,559
Can you look up that job?

347
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,270
Ha. Here you go.

348
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,179
Well, well. Look who
designed the mini-mall.

349
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,839
Walter Grobman.

350
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,974
Did Danny Ward work
on this project?

351
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,143
Yeah. I remember.

352
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,085
The design firm had a bad experience
with another cooling company

353
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,451
and they were all over Danny

354
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,718
to make sure this
job got done right.

355
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,725
Thanks for coming in,
Mr. Grobman,

356
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,558
we know things
are tough right now.

357
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,120
Anything I can do.

358
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,097
Well, obviously we're
tryin' to tie the shooter

359
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,635
to someone who had a
grudge against your wife.

360
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,628
Well, I don't see
how I can help you there.

361
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,866
Well, we just wanted
to make sure, now,

362
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,705
you said you'd never seen
this man, Danny Ward, before.

363
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,711
Is that right?
Yes.

364
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,178
You sure about that?

365
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,311
Yes, why?

366
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,113
Because two years ago,
you worked closely with him

367
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,586
during the construction of
the Crosstown mini-mall.

368
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,850
He installed the
heat and the air.

369
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,487
No, no. Not this guy.
That guy was heavier.

370
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,551
Well, this picture was
taken two years ago.

371
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,494
His cousin says
it's a good likeness.

372
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,532
Nah, I'm sorry,
I don't recognize him.

373
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,226
Why don't you
recognize the name?

374
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,631
Well, I never knew
his last name.

375
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,933
BRISCOE: (SIGHS)
The owner of All-Kool

376
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,373
says you left instructions
for Danny almost every day,

377
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,571
in envelopes with "Danny
Ward" written on them.

378
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,205
Well, you know,
it was two years ago.

379
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,147
Why was your wife
drivin' on Thursday?

380
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,583
Because she wanted to.

381
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,678
She said you asked her to drive
so you could take a nap.

382
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,450
Oh. Maybe I did.
I don't remember.

383
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,651
Do you remember why you got
out at the front entrance

384
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,887
instead of going into
the garage with her?

385
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,395
Look, I didn't hire anybody.

386
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,193
Mr. Grobman,
we talked to your doorman.

387
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,326
You and your wife went to your
cottage 10, 12 times a year,

388
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,599
this was the first time you ever
got out in front of the building.

389
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,606
Yeah. We went to the market.

390
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,869
We had grocery bags
plus suitcases,

391
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,569
why not let the doorman help?

392
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,135
That your idea or your wife's?

393
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,272
Keep in mind
we're gonna ask her, too.

394
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,216
Look, My wife is lying in the
hospital in excruciating pain,

395
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,184
and you're accusing
me of puttin' her there.

396
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,244
I don't have to listen
to any more of this.

397
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,187
ED: We were thinking that
this was just a coincidence,

398
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,021
but you're doing
a lousy job explaining it.

399
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,322
I don't have to explain anything.
Now get out of my way!

400
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,623
Ed, Ed.

401
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,824
Mr. Grobman, you sure you
don't want to clear this up?

402
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:05,836
Excuse me, but I am on my way to
visit my wife in the hospital!

403
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,338
You're not going near her. You're
under arrest for attempted murder.

404
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,668
(SCOFFS)

405
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,942
The People ask the
defendant be remanded.

406
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:19,006
My client's wife is in the hospital
unable to care for herself,

407
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,948
Mr. Grobman needs
to be with her.

408
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,453
She's there because the defendant
tried to have her killed.

409
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,614
He shouldn't be
allowed near her.

410
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:28,249
This is an affidavit from
Judge Denise Grobman,

411
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,622
the victim in the case.

412
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,219
She gives him an alibi,
Your Honor.

413
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,458
"Walter was with me when I learned
we had to return to the city early"

414
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,161
"and he was with me
continuously thereafter."

415
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,000
"He had no opportunity
to arrange the incident."

416
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,438
In other words,
the D.A. has no case.

417
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,271
We ask that the
defendant be ROR'd.

418
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,778
Ms. Carmichael?
One million dollars.

419
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,643
That's ridiculous.
My client can't raise that.

420
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,239
He's a successful
architect, Your Honor.

421
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,875
He's not Frank Gehry.

422
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,544
Most of the Grobman money
is tied up in trusts

423
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,213
from Mrs. Grobman's family.

424
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,520
What is accessible is earmarked
for his wife's care.

425
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,391
Bail is set at $25000 dollars.

426
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,761
Did you read my affidavit,
Ms. Carmichael?

427
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,307
Yes.

428
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,867
Do you grasp the meaning
of the word continuously?

429
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,178
He was never out of your
sight, your hearing?

430
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:28,879
No. Now, I'd like
to be with my family.

431
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,387
You understand your husband
knew the man who shot you.

432
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,621
He lied about why you
were behind the wheel.

433
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,220
You call that evidence?
My God.

434
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,256
Whoever arranged this shooting

435
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,393
was someone who knew you were
coming back to the city early.

436
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,802
I realize that you are doing your
job, but please, it's absurd

437
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,575
and if you insist on
prosecuting my husband,

438
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,841
I will testify on his behalf!

439
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,614
I want you to leave
my parents alone.

440
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,157
Your father knew Danny Ward
and lied about it.

441
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:09,522
He made a mistake.

442
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:13,325
Look, you have no idea what these
past two weeks have been like.

443
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,366
My parents have a good marriage

444
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,095
and my father did not do this.

445
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,501
Hey. You guys. Hey.

446
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,369
Hi, Dad. Okay, now remember,
we have to be quiet.

447
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,909
Grandma wants to see you,
but she doesn't feel good.

448
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,780
Why didn't you ask Judge
Grobman about the alibi

449
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,713
before you arrested
her husband?

450
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,308
VAN BUREN: My detectives
didn't want him loose.

451
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,819
You want it on your head if
he kills her in the hospital?

452
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,913
The Grobmans left Sag Harbor

453
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,219
shortly after the judge
heard from her clerk.

454
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,487
How did Mr. Grobman
get it arranged so fast?

455
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,655
Well, he probably already had
it arranged for Sunday night,

456
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,131
that's when they were originally
scheduled to come home.

457
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,429
One phone call to
rearrange the hit.

458
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,935
You have phone records
from their cottage?

459
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,062
We're on it.

460
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,232
JACK: Now the judge has set low bail you're
right back where you didn't want to be.

461
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,004
I doubt that. He'd have to
be an idiot to kill her now.

462
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,740
So the arrest was pre-emptive?
Come on, Lieutenant.

463
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,179
What's the problem?

464
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:08,184
This man hired someone
to blast his wife.

465
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,277
And I'll be glad to nail
his hide to the wall.

466
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,413
If he did it.

467
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,151
If you bring me
a case. Fast.

468
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,794
We pulled the IUDs from the phone at the
cottage and both their cell phones.

469
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,064
Nothin' that day on the cells and
only one call from the cottage.

470
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,195
Who to?

471
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,036
Listed under a D. Van Horn,
11:17 a.m., Sag Harbor.

472
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,900
An hour and a half after the
clerk left the message.

473
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,308
Well, maybe Grobman
called D. Van Horn,

474
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,371
and D. Van Horn
called Danny Ward.

475
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,576
Yeah, we should be so lucky.

476
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,475
VAN HORN: It was
just after 11:15.

477
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,179
I just got back from the market

478
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,314
but Walter didn't
call Denise did.

479
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,585
What did she want?

480
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,523
Oh, to apologize for
last minute regrets.

481
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,290
They were supposed to stop by
for drinks that afternoon.

482
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,197
Denise said it was an office thing.
She just found out.

483
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,825
Just then, at 11:15?

484
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,961
Yes she had a message
from her clerk.

485
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,562
I can't believe Walter had
anything to do with this.

486
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:03,732
Why is that?

487
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,400
Ah. It just doesn't track.

488
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,466
I've known Denise
her whole life

489
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,479
and Walter for
damn near 30 years.

490
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,277
Ever since he came back
from California with her.

491
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,477
I mean they're the golden
couple that everybody envies.

492
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,984
There are no problems
between them?

493
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,180
Well, they're not saints

494
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,350
and they both have stressful
careers, but nothing major.

495
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,485
What does "they're
not saints" mean?

496
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,853
Walter wasn't thrilled about the
Justice Department appointment.

497
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,490
He didn't want to move
to DC, but who would?

498
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,695
Couldn't he design buildings
from pretty much anywhere?

499
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,932
I guess, but I think lately he's
been tired of playing tag-along.

500
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,235
How so?

501
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,503
We had a little reception
about a month ago

502
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,443
to celebrate
Denise's appointment

503
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:46,972
and Walter was introducing himself
as Mr. Judge Denise Grobman.

504
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,353
You said you went to
the market in Sag Harbor.

505
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,410
Yes.

506
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,013
Did you see
Mr. Grobman in town?

507
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,922
No. But I drove past their
house on the way back

508
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,952
and Walter was in the side yard running
water from the hose over his head.

509
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,362
I guess he'd been jogging.

510
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,694
Why do you say that?

511
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:05,361
He had his jogging clothes on.
He runs every day.

512
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,335
Took it up a couple
of months ago.

513
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,999
CARMICHAEL: Judge Grobman
swore in her affidavit

514
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,374
he never left the house
at all that morning.

515
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,073
If he heard the message
come through earlier...

516
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:20,345
You think he went jogging and
called Danny Ward along the way.

517
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,683
Briscoe and Green are pulling IUDs
on pay phones he would've passed.

518
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,621
You run across anything
that smells like a motive?

519
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,627
As far as the cops can tell Grobman
didn't gamble, he didn't play the field.

520
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,527
The insurance money and her
estate go to the grandkids.

521
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,490
Still looking.

522
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,441
No, I don't think
he tried to kill her.

523
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:47,137
But yes, I am breaking
off our partnership.

524
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,906
You mind if I ask why?

525
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,538
Walter's a really
good architect

526
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,378
but you have to consider
the client's needs,

527
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:55,282
and he's just not willing
to do that anymore.

528
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,014
Well, isn't that
part of the job?

529
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,419
Thank you.

530
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:03,187
Client wants Colonial, Walter gives him
50 reasons why it should be Bauhaus.

531
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:06,822
Won't take no for an answer,
client goes someplace else.

532
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,627
So do I, finally.

533
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,964
That's the Prager Prize, the
Nobel Prize of architecture.

534
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:15,164
Walter won it as part of a team
when he was starting out in LA.

535
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,774
That was 25 years ago.

536
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,400
Walter was a prodigy.

537
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,274
He never lived up
to expectations?

538
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,870
It's hard when you won't
listen to the client.

539
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,813
He's a great guy
in a lot of ways,

540
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,282
it's just that he,
I don't know,

541
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,682
he needs to be right
all the time.

542
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,652
Is that part of his
relationship with his wife?

543
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,587
It's part of who he is.

544
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:36,217
She never had a problem
with it that I could see.

545
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,592
He had free rein on their
new country house.

546
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,621
What new country house?

547
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,064
They bought 20 acres
in Dutchess County.

548
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,659
Walter was going to design
their dream house.

549
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,898
How many country houses
do they need?

550
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,270
The one in Sag Harbor's
Denise's, from her father.

551
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,865
This one was gonna be theirs.

552
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,001
Was?

553
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,169
He gave it up.

554
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:58,045
Denise's job at the Justice Department?
Eight days a week.

555
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,676
Walter said, what good's a
dream house with nobody in it?

556
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,756
Twenty-five years ago, he was an
award-winning young architect,

557
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,916
she was scrambling
to pay her student loans.

558
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,982
Now the shoe's
on the other foot.

559
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,653
He suddenly just had enough?

560
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,322
The co-op's in her name,
the cottage is in her name,

561
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,095
his net income last year
was half what she made.

562
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,398
Where'd he get the money
to pay Danny Ward?

563
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,940
He put a $20,000 deposit
on the land upstate

564
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,771
and got it back when
they changed their minds.

565
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,866
(PHONE RINGING)

566
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,605
And it was
never re-deposited?

567
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,806
Not in any of their accounts.

568
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:35,080
Carmichael.
You're sure?

569
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,319
Thanks, Lennie.

570
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,053
Bingo.

571
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,857
Your clerk left
a message at 9:30.

572
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,659
Mr. McCoy, this is
all the same nonsense.

573
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:53,630
At 10:14, a call was made from
a pay phone in Sag Harbor.

574
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,536
A call to Daniel Ward,

575
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,233
the man who shot you.

576
00:24:58,397 --> 00:25:00,172
Are you sure?
CARMICHAEL: Yes.

577
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:04,006
At 11:00, your neighbor saw
your father in the yard

578
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,573
in his jogging clothes, cooling
himself off with the hose.

579
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,284
Tell the nurse I need Demerol.

580
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,446
Now, Dana.

581
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,627
You have a witness who
saw him use the phone?

582
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,684
Not yet.

583
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,753
His prints on the keypad?

584
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,389
We're running them now.

585
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:24,964
Isn't it obvious what happened?

586
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,698
Someone was watching us, that
person called Daniel Ward.

587
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,673
How did that person know you were
going back to the city early?

588
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,902
I don't want
to hear this. I can't.

589
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:40,749
Walter did not do this.
It's not possible.

590
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:51,151
Briscoe and Green have talked to
practically everyone in Sag Harbor,

591
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,957
no one saw Grobman
use the pay phone.

592
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,964
Anybody see him jogging?

593
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,765
About a dozen, but no one can
remember what time or which day.

594
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,429
And there's nothing
in Forensics?

595
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,767
No smoking gun.

596
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,240
As long as his wife's giving him an
alibi, this isn't going anywhere.

597
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,174
(PHONE RINGING)

598
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,504
Carmichael.

599
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,876
Yes.

600
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,715
(SIGHING) Thank you.

601
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,417
Judge Grobman filed an application
to terminate her treatment.

602
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,490
Her dialysis?

603
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,187
She wants to die.

604
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,726
Bad time for
an irrevocable decision.

605
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,270
Anytime's bad.

606
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,637
It's her life, only she can
decide if it's worth living.

607
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,608
I'm not sure
it should be up to her.

608
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,613
ADAM: Up to the proper court
to consider her application.

609
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,807
Even then.

610
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,043
You have a moral objection?

611
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,607
Yeah, I do.

612
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,518
CARMICHAEL: Have you forgotten
your professional obligation?

613
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:55,787
If for whatever reason she's not around
to testify on her husband's behalf...

614
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,418
That's pretty damn callous.

615
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,293
It's a civil matter,
anyway we have no standing.

616
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,763
We do now.

617
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,901
Mr. Grobman's
filed for a TRO

618
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,564
to block his wife's application
to terminate treatment.

619
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,004
Quick work.

620
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,372
JUDGE PONGRACIC:
You want me to grant a TRO

621
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,812
to stop Judge Grobman
from terminating dialysis?

622
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,213
In effect, her life.

623
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,080
Yeah, so she can
testify for your client.

624
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,380
Isn't this a civil
matter, Counselor?

625
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,681
She's a witness, Judge.

626
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,848
You can preclude her from taking
any action until after the trial.

627
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:27,982
That could take months.

628
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,788
In the meantime, my clients
spends every minute of every day

629
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,260
in unendurable pain.

630
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,354
I saw Mrs. Grobman on
Wednesday, Your Honor,

631
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,126
she's coping with her pain.

632
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,667
What, you're siding
with the defense on this?

633
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,966
Your Honor, this should be decided
based on what is best for my client.

634
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,370
Somebody else's
jurisdiction, Mr. Brizard.

635
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,603
Mine is protecting the integrity
of the trial process.

636
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,112
Her testimony is absolutely
crucial to my client's defense.

637
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,149
In that case,
I'm gonna grant the TRO.

638
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,207
My client has asked me
to propose an alternative.

639
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,651
Her testimony
could be taken now,

640
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,484
preserved on videotape
for the jury.

641
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,486
Any objection?

642
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,126
If we can tape her testimony

643
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,361
we'll withdraw the
application for the TRO.

644
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,233
You don't give a damn about
anything but her testimony.

645
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,671
Your Honor, this is giving
him exactly what he wants.

646
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,730
His wife dies and
he gets away it.

647
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,277
That's enough, Ms. Carmichael.
Mr. McCoy?

648
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,973
Your Honor, the D.A.'s
office has concluded that

649
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,483
Judge Grobman was mistaken
in her affidavit.

650
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,213
I'd welcome the chance
to cross examine her.

651
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,017
Are you saying she perjured herself?
Denise Grobman?

652
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,955
The word I used was mistaken.

653
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,285
This is an
inconceivable situation.

654
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,092
Denise is a friend
and a colleague.

655
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:44,225
But if her testimony is exculpatory,
I don't have much choice.

656
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,668
Application for TRO is moot.

657
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,468
Witness to be examined at the
earliest possible moment.

658
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:57,276
My husband never left
the cottage that morning.

659
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,782
He didn't go for a run.

660
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,715
CLAYMORE: Where was he?

661
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,515
Part of the time he was
in the yard with me,

662
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,853
and he spent an hour so
going over blueprints.

663
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:09,986
Where?

664
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,358
In the garage,
there's a studio.

665
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,827
Would you have
known if he had left?

666
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,128
Yes.

667
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,397
Is the telephone answering
machine in the garage?

668
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,098
No, in the house.

669
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,869
Thank you.
No further questions.

670
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:35,475
Can you explain why your husband
was in the yard at 11:00,

671
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:39,148
in jogging clothes, running
water over his head?

672
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,122
It was a hot day,

673
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,955
and he lives in his jogging clothes
when we're at the cottage.

674
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:48,192
He worked up a sweat
going over blueprints?

675
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,857
DENISE: I guess so.

676
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,630
And he was so exhausted from
looking at these blueprints,

677
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:57,970
that he needed to take a nap
in the car while you drove?

678
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,737
He was tired, yes.

679
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,106
At noon?

680
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,272
Yes.

681
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,642
I want to remind you,
Judge Grobman

682
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:10,346
that you not only took an
oath today to tell the truth,

683
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:14,482
you also took an oath 12 years ago
when you were sworn in as a judge...

684
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,718
Your Honor!

685
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,522
...to uphold the
laws of this state...

686
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,027
Walter did not do this.

687
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,223
...and the rules
of the court.

688
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,732
I'm tired, I'm in pain.

689
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,633
No matter how many different
ways he approaches the question,

690
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,330
the answer is the same.

691
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,103
My husband did not
arrange the shooting.

692
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,770
He had no motive,
he had no opportunity.

693
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,336
Why are you protecting him,
Judge Grobman? You know he...

694
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,881
JUDGE PONGRACIC:
That's enough, Mr. McCoy.

695
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,679
Your cross-examination
is over.

696
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,384
The witness is excused.

697
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:55,388
So I expect you'll
dismiss the charges now.

698
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:57,127
Not a chance.

699
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,294
You're gonna drag this out?

700
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:02,632
You don't give a damn
about this family, do you?

701
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:06,505
My motion to dismiss will be
on your desk in the morning.

702
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,776
Now what?

703
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:12,372
If she dies before we can shake
her loose from her lies...

704
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,541
Why is she doing this?

705
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,280
Why is she covering for the man who
turned her life into a living hell?

706
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,084
Of course she
knows, Mr. McCoy.

707
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:27,528
We both know that
my dad tried to kill her.

708
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,257
Did she tell you that she knew?

709
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:35,999
No.

710
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:40,066
She won't even admit it
to herself but I can tell.

711
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,544
If she knows,
why's she covering for him?

712
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,345
Guilt.
Guilt?

713
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,775
She can't take back who she is.

714
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,887
I'm sorry,
I'm not following you.

715
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,219
My mom's career
always came first.

716
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,523
And I don't mean that she neglected
being a wife and a mother,

717
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,587
she just never realized
how my dad felt.

718
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,061
See, she was more
successful then he was,

719
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,602
she kept moving up

720
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,103
and he just treads water.

721
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:11,835
They argued about it?

722
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:18,410
He would shout that he gave up his
dreams to move east with her,

723
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,075
that she had it all
and he had nothing.

724
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,211
JACK: What was your
mother's reaction?

725
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,120
Well, she thought that they
supposed to be partners,

726
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,659
that what was good for one,
was good for both.

727
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,884
She didn't see a problem.

728
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,800
Do you want your father
to be held accountable?

729
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,666
You think your mother might
change her mind about facing it?

730
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:47,972
Isn't it obvious that she would
rather die than face it?

731
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,341
If she dies, it's over.

732
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,482
I've tried so hard to talk
her out of wanting to die.

733
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:03,458
She still has her mind, and
she has people who love her.

734
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,525
She's so depressed that
she can't think straight.

735
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,934
Would you be willing to sign
an affidavit about that?

736
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,074
Yes.

737
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,548
You're challenging Judge Grobman's
competency as a witness on what grounds?

738
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,318
I have an affidavit from the Grobman's
daughter stating that her mother

739
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,381
is too depressed
to think rationally.

740
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,327
Is she qualified to diagnose
her mother's emotional state?

741
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,193
Our psychiatrist,
Dr. Skoda, is.

742
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:44,598
Your Honor, if you rule that my
client isn't competent to testify,

743
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,660
you collaterally damage her
application to terminate her life.

744
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:48,864
Not necessarily.

745
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,338
Already the State
Attorney General

746
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,467
and the hospital are contesting
my client's application.

747
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,911
Any ruling that puts her competency
in question weakens our position.

748
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,915
My only concern can be this
criminal case, I'm sorry.

749
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,781
You have my permission
for Dr. Skoda to examine her.

750
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,147
DR. SKODA: It's not
irrational to want to die?

751
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,022
Not if you're
in this condition.

752
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,326
Your condition is new.

753
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,757
How do know you won't
change your mind?

754
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21,567
I'm not interested in
any more questions.

755
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,475
If you don't convince me
your decision is rational,

756
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,669
you may lose control
over your situation.

757
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,071
Look at me.

758
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,510
I'm not even in control
of my bowels.

759
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,986
Can't you people leave
me alone, let me die?

760
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,088
I'm in pain every
minute of every day.

761
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,692
I've spoken with your doctors,

762
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,423
they say the pain is treatable.

763
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,726
It's all treatable.

764
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,762
A catheter,

765
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,634
a colostomy bag,

766
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,331
a dialysis machine,

767
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,538
a wheelchair,
a physical therapist,

768
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,270
a lifetime supply of Demerol.

769
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,342
Would you want that?

770
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,017
Will your husband
take care of you?

771
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,291
Yes.

772
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:22,323
I know people who are
paraplegic, even quadriplegic,

773
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,389
who lead vital,
productive lives.

774
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,467
Would you like to meet them?

775
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,664
I'm tired.

776
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,812
Can't you people
just leave me alone?

777
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,139
Can't you let me die?

778
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,314
Is it her physical condition

779
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,860
or her mental state
that's driving her?

780
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,327
I can't give
a clean answer to that.

781
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,125
They're feeding off each other.

782
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,665
Is she competent?

783
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,463
She's overwhelmed,
depressed, confused.

784
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,197
Is that a no?

785
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,471
My opinion,

786
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,373
she's not capable of making a
rational decision right now.

787
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,138
So we make it for her.

788
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,576
Riding this into the ground.

789
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,809
At first, I thought the cops
were wrong, they weren't.

790
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:18,415
Walter Grobman hired
someone to kill his wife,

791
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,319
because he felt eclipsed.

792
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,217
He's destroyed her life
for no good reason.

793
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,888
Why she's shielding him,
I will never understand.

794
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:30,866
But I know my job, I'm gonna convict
this narcissistic son of a bitch.

795
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,162
What about her?

796
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,931
Her life is over
whether she dies or not.

797
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:37,974
His conviction is the only thing
we can salvage out of this mess.

798
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,169
If you have her declared
incompetent to testify,

799
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,213
no civil judge will let
her pull the plug.

800
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,079
Then she'll be alive, not dead.

801
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,708
For a life she doesn't want.

802
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,549
Is this a thing that
you decide for someone else?

803
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,931
She's clinically depressed
and in massive denial.

804
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,763
Her judgment is
impaired by depression,

805
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:07,804
pain, denial and drugs.

806
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,202
She's suicidal.

807
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:11,172
Thank you, Dr. Skoda.

808
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,041
If somebody came to you and told you they
were thinking of committing suicide,

809
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,378
you would treat
them wouldn't, you?

810
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,917
Yes. If that's
what they wanted.

811
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,577
Because your
profession considers

812
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:26,589
suicidal thoughts to be
symptomatic of neurosis?

813
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:27,817
DR. SKODA: Yes.

814
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,291
Can you foresee
any circumstances

815
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:34,160
in which a person could make a
rational decision to end their life?

816
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,958
Such decisions are
always made under duress.

817
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:42,233
Aren't rational decisions
often made under duress?

818
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,434
Yes.
I suppose so.

819
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,811
As a medical doctor, do you
support a patient's right to die?

820
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:53,975
My personal beliefs...

821
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,712
As a medical doctor.

822
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,226
Then, no. I don't.

823
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,488
Thank you.
No more questions.

824
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:10,028
Judge Grobman,
are you depressed?

825
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:13,365
Of course I am,
who wouldn't be?

826
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:17,066
Can you articulate your reasons for
wanting to terminate your life?

827
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,402
I'm in constant pain,

828
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,570
I'm told it will
never get better.

829
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,445
There's nothing the doctors can
do to give me back my life.

830
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,419
I don't want to live like this.

831
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:34,982
Does your desire to die spring
from your physical condition,

832
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,721
or from the possibility it was
your husband that did this to you?

833
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,490
From my physical condition.

834
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,632
My husband did nothing.

835
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,695
Thanks.

836
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,674
You do understand that we're not here
to decide your right to die, don't you?

837
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,735
Of course I do, Mr. McCoy.

838
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:00,713
You want to prove
I'm irrational

839
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,844
so you can preclude my testimony
on behalf of my husband.

840
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:08,049
You left the hospital three
days ago, is that right?

841
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,182
Yes.

842
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,858
Where are you staying?

843
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,089
With my daughter
and her family.

844
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,825
Why not with your husband?

845
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,924
Because my daughter
lost the coin toss.

846
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,230
Could you be
responsive, please?

847
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,534
My husband has a business to run.
My daughter doesn't.

848
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:26,667
Do you get nursing care
at your daughter's?

849
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,540
Yes.

850
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,746
Around the clock?

851
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,213
Yes.

852
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,116
Why couldn't they do that
just as well at your house?

853
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,654
My daughter insisted
I stay with her.

854
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,883
Did she say why?

855
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:45,859
Judge Grobman?

856
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,921
You've convinced her
her father tried to kill me.

857
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,993
Do you understand that your husband
knew the man who shot you?

858
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,493
You say.

859
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,374
Do you understand that your husband
was one of a very few people

860
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,878
who knew that you were coming
back to the city early?

861
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,039
So what?

862
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:11,384
Do you understand that your
husband made the phone call

863
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,217
that set up the shooting?

864
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,258
I don't know that,
and neither do you.

865
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:17,020
But you do understand

866
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,925
that your husband
resented for 25 years

867
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,332
your accomplishments,
your success.

868
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,803
We had a good marriage.

869
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,637
Did he say to you,
more than once,

870
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,303
that if he hadn't knuckled
under to what you wanted

871
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,474
he'd have gotten the
recognition that he deserved?

872
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,347
He didn't mean it
the way it sounds.

873
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:43,579
How did he mean it?

874
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:46,212
Why do you hammer
and hammer at this?

875
