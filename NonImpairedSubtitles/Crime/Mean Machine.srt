1
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:38,325
New car, Z?

2
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:42,159
For your information only,
that's a prototype. Bother.

3
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:47,456
Yes? Right. I'll be back in a sec'.
Don't touch a thing.

4
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:02,600
England captain,
Danny "Mean Machine" Meehan,

5
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:05,473
is licensed to score with Umbro.

6
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:15,564
Licensed to get hammered, you mean.

7
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,530
Large whisky.

8
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:06,365
Do you want anything in that?

9
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,782
Yeah, a double.

10
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:12,040
It's lively in here.

11
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,336
Didn't you use to be Danny Meehan?

12
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:17,211
Used to be.
A very long time ago.

13
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:20,469
Sir, we're going to
have to breathalyse you.

14
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:23,342
No need, officer. I'm totally pissed.

15
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,307
Come on, Danny. No trouble.

16
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,510
Oh, look, a miniature copper!

17
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:34,141
You'd better come along with us.

18
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,272
Don't be silly. Come on!

19
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:40,613
You are nicked, sunshine.

20
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:43,488
BBC news headlines.

21
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,697
This morning, ex England football captain

22
00:02:46,872 --> 00:02:48,912
Danny Meehan was jailed for three years,

23
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,958
despite pleading guilty to assaulting
two police officers and driving drunk.

24
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:58,341
Meehan's downfall from the pinnacle
of world football has been swift,

25
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:03,467
since match-fixing accusations ended
the career of one of our finest players.

26
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,553
The judge showed little sympathy
for his pleas of mitigation,

27
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,766
imposing the maximum sentence.

28
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:13,021
Meehan showed no emotion
as he was led away.

29
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,520
The former star will serve his sentence
at Longmarsh High Security Prison...

30
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:21,485
...famous for its rehabilitation programme,

31
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:24,733
reformed characters,

32
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,366
and modern conditions.

33
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,967
Open!

34
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,848
That's it. Get out!

35
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:49,844
Come on!

36
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:52,556
- Get away from the van.
- All right.

37
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:58,898
Shut it! This is a category B nick,
not Butlins. Do you understand?

38
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,316
You're nothing in here.
Do you hear me? Nothing. Move out.

39
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,697
May the good Lord be with you.

40
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,698
He's a pretty boy.

41
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:13,998
Coming in.

42
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:17,538
Straight down the stairs.

43
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:20,204
Prisoner on the move.

44
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:23,586
Stay behind the line. Stand there.

45
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:27,260
- Valuables?
- Prisoner Meehan 041 1 2.

46
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,059
Sign it.

47
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:39,359
Here's your designer gear
for the next three years. Enjoy.

48
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:43,275
What are you waiting for?
Come on, move it.

49
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,596
Captained his country,
and he ends up in here?

50
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:20,900
73 caps for England,
and you sell your country out in a game.

51
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,689
That's un-bloody-English, that is.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,158
Chief.

53
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,997
I'm the chief officer of this prison.

54
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:24,583
You call me "Mr Burton, sir".

55
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:28,960
You call him Mr Ratchett
and him Mr Hayter.

56
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:32,754
Anybody in this uniform,
you call mister, right?

57
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:34,889
Right.

58
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,348
Mr Burton, sir.

59
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:43,765
Sometime tomorrow,
governor wants a word.

60
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:49,068
He wants you to coach my football team.

61
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:53,108
Little word of advice.

62
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:59,996
You're gonna smile nicely and say no.

63
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,243
- Move it!
- All right!

64
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:08,540
What did you say? That's "Mr Hayter, sir"
to you. Do you understand?

65
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:12,466
I think you need a little reminder
of Mr Burton's orders.

66
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:22,552
You won't coach our football team.

67
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,773
OK?

68
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:31,271
Stand there where I can see you.

69
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:36,320
Meehan, stow your kit top right.

70
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:40,493
All right, lads? New cellmate for you.
I'm sure you recognise him.

71
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:44,415
He used to be a somebody
once upon a time.

72
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:54,303
Got plenty of time
to get to know your new playmates.

73
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,678
Work assignment. C wing.

74
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,890
Got you an apprentice.
He used to be a sweeper.

75
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:10,602
- Comedian.
- Enjoy it, Meehan.

76
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:16,700
- I've got some advice for you.
- Thanks. I'm short on advice today.

77
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:19,158
This will change your life.

78
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,829
Do you see that?
Be very careful of those.

79
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,919
Some of the boys have a pony in the night,
wrap it and airmail it out the window.

80
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:31,248
Here, use this.

81
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:37,468
Glamorous job.
Stick it in the bin and follow me, OK?

82
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:41,598
Come on!

83
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,723
Do you know who that is?

84
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:51,024
Meehan! Here.

85
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,602
Not the muscle, the other one.

86
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:59,321
- Christ, he's got old.
- 30 years will do that to you.

87
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:04,287
Still thinks he's Al Capone.
You'd better go over.

88
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:15,296
- You know who I am?
- Charlie Sykes.

89
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:20,379
- I run this nick.
- I've been told.

90
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,311
I lost a great deal of money on an
England/Germany game a few years back,

91
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:33,310
after one of the Englanders
gave away a very suspect penalty

92
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:36,025
after 72 minutes of playing time.

93
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:43,953
So I think that you owe me.

94
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:54,335
Come on, superstar. Tour's not over.

95
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,961
You know,
it's not gonna be easy for you in here.

96
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:02,174
What's everyone's problem?

97
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:04,638
You really want to know?

98
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,271
Most of the guys in here have nothing,
never had to start with.

99
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,268
But you, you had everything
they ever dreamed of,

100
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,817
and threw it all away.

101
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:24,485
Hey!

102
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:51,648
The superstar! Danny Meehan.

103
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:55,149
It's the thingy, the... fuckin' hell...

104
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:58,688
...the Mean Machine!
I bet you've got a few stories.

105
00:10:58,864 --> 00:11:03,407
All the, you know,
the pussy and all that thing.

106
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:07,622
- Funnily enough, no.
- Yeah? So what, big shot?

107
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,001
I know all about fame.
I was a face myself. I was the man.

108
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:15,538
The late '80s, all around the raves,
all that, fucking... voom!

109
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,921
I was the top fucking kiddy.

110
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:19,752
My food?

111
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,798
Danny boy.

112
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:28,264
Anything you need,
I'm a one-stop shop, OK?

113
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,855
Anything you want, I can get it for you.

114
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:45,118
I've just had that from Mr Fix lt,
throwing the beans.

115
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:49,579
Nitro? Keep away from him, mate.
Gets all in with all the newcomers,

116
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:53,414
- So that he can hustle them.
- And what's your angle?

117
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:56,255
If you want any of life's little luxuries -

118
00:11:56,422 --> 00:12:00,502
chocolate, toothpaste, soft toilet paper -

119
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:04,460
- Massive is your man.
- Massive?

120
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:07,390
It's ironic.

121
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:12,185
- All right, Raj, you be black.
- No, I'll be white.

122
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:14,845
Just chill. You've got a black nose.

123
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:19,187
You saying I'm black? That makes me
the first Iranian from Babylon.

124
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:22,854
The neighbourhood celeb's in town.

125
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:25,487
- Put the kettle on.
- Would you like any biscuits?

126
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,281
- I never asked to be put in here.
- And we did?

127
00:12:28,454 --> 00:12:31,739
- I don't need this.
- You don't need this?

128
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:38,918
Let me tell you what we don't need.
We don't need you, another body, in here.

129
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:44,001
Ain't nothing personal, pal.
It's just... I don't fuckin' like you.

130
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:48,306
- Our star looks beat, Trojan.
- Yeah, he needs to chill.

131
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:51,558
- Yeah, him have a hard day at work.
- Any requests, star?

132
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,960
The legendary Broadhurst Monk.

133
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:29,591
Shipped in about six months ago,
but they still have him on the special unit.

134
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,509
Why?

135
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:35,598
Apparently,
he killed 23 men with his bare hands.

136
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:41,269
- Maybe I should take up karate.
- That was before he took up karate.

137
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:48,523
They don't mess with him, not even
the screws, not even when he's cuffed up.

138
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,829
- Is that the famous footballer?
- Ex-footballer.

139
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:00,493
He's just a number now.

140
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:02,584
Chief.

141
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:04,548
Stand there.

142
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:08,924
Danny Meehan.

143
00:14:09,096 --> 00:14:11,421
Well, it is a pleasure to meet you.

144
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:15,217
I'm a big football fan. Big.

145
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:19,764
What do you think of amateur football?

146
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,610
It's amateur.

147
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:29,648
Yes. Well, I'm sure we're not a match for
the pro's, but we do have our own team.

148
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:32,862
Southern Division, semi pro's.

149
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:37,331
And we have a chance of winning
the division this year, getting promotion.

150
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:43,834
We have been runners-up before,
but first is first, and second is nowhere.

151
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:50,340
I want you to train the team,
use your professional experience.

152
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:55,929
Well, I haven't played football for years,
and...

153
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:59,186
I'm a little bit
out of condition at the moment.

154
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:08,819
I pulled a lot of strings
to get you assigned to my prison.

155
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,658
I'm sorry.

156
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm just not your man.

157
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,499
We'll stick a pin in it for now.

158
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:21,948
Out.

159
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:27,340
- Mr Burton, a quick word, if I may.
- Sir?

160
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:30,260
I've spent a fortune on this team,
for no return.

161
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,135
I am the coach of this team...

162
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:35,424
With the money I spent
we could have won the World Cup.

163
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:38,885
You can't put a prisoner
in charge of the guards' team.

164
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:41,634
Just get it done. Please.

165
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:48,063
- I wouldn't get too close, miss.
- Why? You're not dangerous, are you?

166
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:51,107
Only if you've got the ball, miss.

167
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:57,574
Hey, Danny boy. I can get you anything,
anything that's not on the menu.

168
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:03,960
- Is that stink you, Meehan?
- Don't you poke me again.

169
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:08,333
Don't you start growing a spine, footballer.

170
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:09,788
Bollocks!

171
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:19,139
Hands behind your neck.

172
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,975
Hands behind your neck.

173
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:30,104
Let go of my neck. Let go of me.

174
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,437
Let go of me.

175
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,039
Pack it in.

176
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,835
It wasn't me!

177
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:55,635
It's not me, you bastards.

178
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:10,766
Razzle Dazzle.
Three o'clock, Kempton Park.

179
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,482
L5,000, please. To win.

180
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:21,949
All this lovely fresh air.

181
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:26,203
Wouldn't you rather be
out there on the pitch, coaching?

182
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:30,588
I just wanna keep my head down.
Do my 1 2 months and I'm going home.

183
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:34,588
1 2 months, yes, but that's with parole.

184
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,251
And that's before
you assaulted another inmate

185
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:39,552
- And attacked my staff.
- Wait a minute...

186
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:44,718
Three years, that's your sentence.
So you could be with us for some time.

187
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,318
Take him back to solitary.

188
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:13,545
- Have a nice week's holiday?
- Yeah, lovely.

189
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,874
- There is a way out.
- What?

190
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,634
Listen, convince the governor
the best way to train the guards

191
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:25,475
is to play a tough match against a team
of cons with you as the captain.

192
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:30,140
Pro's always have a pre-season friendly.

193
00:18:32,818 --> 00:18:35,356
What do you think, Mr Burton?

194
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:42,653
Could be a win/win for everybody.

195
00:18:42,828 --> 00:18:45,153
Could this work, Meehan?

196
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:49,328
Yeah, but I need time to prep,
and I pick my own team.

197
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:56,085
I could get a real FA ref. There's one
at my golf club. That'll be good.

198
00:18:56,258 --> 00:19:00,552
One more thing: what goes on
on the pitch stays on the pitch.

199
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:05,892
- Deal?
- Goes without saying.

200
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:10,433
I am a marketing genius.

201
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:18,861
You'd better get yourself some rest,
superstar. Busy day tomorrow.

202
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:21,024
We'll see.

203
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:26,992
- Remember, anything you need.
- I'm fine, thanks.

204
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:30,035
- Yeah? That's not what I heard.
- What?

205
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:32,415
I could have been a pro. I was very good.

206
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:36,880
They were gonna take me on, only I had
a bit of trouble and blah blah blah.

207
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,421
The old knees, I suppose, yeah?

208
00:19:41,428 --> 00:19:43,587
Bomb-making.

209
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,592
Otherwise, you know...

210
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:50,266
Well, I'm sure
it was a big loss to the game.

211
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:52,763
I've gotta go, but I'll catch you later.

212
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:58,357
All right, Nitro?

213
00:19:58,529 --> 00:19:59,940
Dickhead.

214
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:04,899
Yes, Razzle Dazzle. Came second?

215
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:07,117
What's the problem, darlin'?

216
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:10,372
- That's not possible.
- It's very possible, sweets.

217
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,415
That's not possible.

218
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:18,457
I think you owe me five G, darlin'.
Have a nice day.

219
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:21,633
So, what happened to your marketing?

220
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:25,420
It's early days yet.
You've got to give it a bit of time, Dan.

221
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:28,171
Danny, over here, mate.

222
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,058
Here we go.

223
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:36,353
Yes. Now, I can say I've had a kick-about
with Danny the "Mean Machine".

224
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:39,894
Burnin' in me head!
Burnin' in me head!

225
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:45,032
It's all right. I'll go and get it.

226
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:51,989
Found a new bum chum, have we?

227
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:56,495
Makes you feel big, does he?
He's just using you.

228
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,964
Once he finds his feet in here,
he'll dump you on your fat, black arse.

229
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,292
You jumped up little shit.

230
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:06,221
Mr Ratchett, sir,
whilst I don't wish to be rude,

231
00:21:06,388 --> 00:21:12,509
I do believe that you watched too many
Tarzan films as an impressionable child.

232
00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:16,731
Don't you get smart with me.
Do you understand?

233
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:19,686
Now get out of my sights.

234
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,658
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

235
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,536
Sykes' boys look pretty useful.

236
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,921
Don't even think about it. Who do you think
has been stopping everyone from playing?

237
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:05,482
I loved your work, man.

238
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,565
Sorry?

239
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:12,202
I never believed any of the talk.
I can't believe it. Look. Here you are.

240
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:14,952
Cheers.

241
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,118
That buys you three across, mate.

242
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:23,415
- Then you can teach me.
- Have a nice one.

243
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:26,046
Will you teach me, yeah?

244
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:28,590
Teach you what?

245
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:34,433
All that, you know.
All them soccer skills. All that.

246
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,812
Sorry, do what?

247
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:42,936
You know, like the pro's. All that caper.

248
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:45,693
Yeah?

249
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:47,939
I gotta go, but we'll stick a pin in it, all right?

250
00:22:48,115 --> 00:22:50,902
Yeah, lovely. We'll stick a pin in it. Lovely.

251
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:53,069
Fan club.

252
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:55,452
Bloody stalker.

253
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:59,665
- What's three across?
- What?

254
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:03,335
I just saw a bloke pay money
for a strip of crossword.

255
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:05,498
Ah, Sykes!

256
00:23:05,674 --> 00:23:08,628
Yeah, three across, four letters:

257
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:10,879
acid.

258
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:17,058
The governor lets Sykes get his "Racing
Times" and other papers special delivery.

259
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:23,266
He thinks it helps Sykes work out form
and give him tips.

260
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:26,692
He doesn't know
that they're pre-soaked in acid.

261
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:29,982
He's actually smuggling
Sykes' drugs in for him.

262
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:35,697
It came second, and it cost me L5,000.

263
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:38,409
You must have made the wrong bet.

264
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,877
W for win.

265
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,336
Win.

266
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,922
It's got smudged in the rain.

267
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:53,923
EW.

268
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,975
EW means each way.

269
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:06,400
It's a fucking disgrace if you ask me.

270
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:10,862
Meehan fraternising
with that shower of shit.

271
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,605
What do you want, Tompkinson?

272
00:24:13,784 --> 00:24:15,278
I was thinking. I know.

273
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:19,071
I know that I can help you,
Mr Ratchett, sir.

274
00:24:19,248 --> 00:24:23,032
- Information and all, whatever.
- Help yourself, more like.

275
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,125
I'm sick of this place.
I need to get a transfer.

276
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:29,504
HMP Silver Sands.

277
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:33,969
Away from the influence
of all these criminals, sir.

278
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:37,718
You keep me posted.

279
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:50,437
Oh, look. A monkey learning new tricks.

280
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:55,738
- Why don't you leave me alone?
- Because I don't like uppity coons.

281
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:59,492
- Listen, man...
- No, you listen!

282
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:04,456
- You animal!
- Animal? You call me a fucking animal?

283
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:07,034
I'll open you up like a tin of beans.

284
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:10,213
Hey, stop him! Someone stop him!

285
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:15,303
You fucking scum!

286
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:22,100
Are you all right?
He needs a doctor! Just get a doctor!

287
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:56,000
That fucking Meehan!

288
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,120
Mr Burton. Have you missed me?

289
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:35,215
You might be the governor's pet project,
but don't push it.

290
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:49,097
It's called sunlight, Meehan. Think of it
as a privilege which can be withdrawn.

291
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:51,312
Danny boy...

292
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:55,899
Well, come on then, star.

293
00:26:58,032 --> 00:27:01,732
They're saying thanks for saving Massive.

294
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:06,074
Where's your manners?
What would your old mum say?

295
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:07,908
Fuck me!

296
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,290
- Wish I'd met her.
- Let's see how good you are.

297
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:13,830
Sort yourselves out. Skins v shirts.

298
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,301
- What's that?
- I'm your manager.

299
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:21,672
- Since when?
- Don't bother giving me no orders, yeah?

300
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:24,967
- Stop bitching, bitch.
- Dan, have a word.

301
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:28,594
Shut it, Massive.
Lads, want a game?

302
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:30,562
Fuck off!

303
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:32,973
Come on. Plenty of room over there.

304
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,729
Up, Troj!

305
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,066
Come on!

306
00:27:44,703 --> 00:27:46,613
Come on!

307
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:54,374
Yes, yes! Trojan, it's down!

308
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:05,595
- What do you think?
- Bring your clipboard.

309
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:08,429
Five.

310
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,938
Three.

311
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:19,522
A generous one.

312
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:23,990
Seven. You missed two.

313
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:33,835
- Ten.
- Eight. My mum could have scored that.

314
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,161
- Still.
- Yeah, I know.

315
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,749
We'll try a fitness test.

316
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:44,215
One: left hand down. Two: right hand
down. Three: both hands. Four: clap.

317
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,546
Five: up. Run.

318
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:48,052
Bollocks.

319
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:51,143
One, two, three...

320
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,435
I wouldn't mind a crack at the guards.

321
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:59,062
- I'm sorry? I missed that.
- Just saying. Be a laugh.

322
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,483
That's the Scots all over, innit?
On the firm when it suits them,

323
00:29:04,658 --> 00:29:09,451
and the next minute
they're all misty-eyed and independent.

324
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,991
- I was only saying.
- And I'm saying no.

325
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:17,378
I think we're going to have to work
on the stamina, lads.

326
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,377
I'll pay at the end of the month.

327
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:28,176
No, sweets. It's cash on the nail.

328
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:32,429
- I haven't got it.
- Sell the nice new Saab then, love.

329
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:36,897
- How do you know about that?
- Pay us or we'll torch the motor.

330
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:40,351
You can pay us out of the insurance.
There you go. Sorted.

331
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:45,147
- I was told that you were reasonable.
- Reasonable, sweetheart?

332
00:29:45,324 --> 00:29:49,238
Reasonable is how come
you ain't sitting in your own piss

333
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:53,623
wondering how to get up
with smashed knees and elbows, OK?

334
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,700
Big kiss.

335
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:13,381
Looking forward to getting a thrashing?

336
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,428
If it means getting out of here early,
I'll take another beating.

337
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:21,355
Who said anything about a beating?
I'm talking about the match.

338
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:23,982
Come on! I've seen your lot in action.

339
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:31,988
I don't run my ship like that.
Are you making a complaint?

340
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:33,158
No.

341
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,200
Lock it up!

342
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,876
What's the matter?

343
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:50,089
Did you have a nice chat
with your chum Burton?

344
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:52,303
Ain't you got any hobbies?

345
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:55,725
- You sleep with one eye open, son.
- Whatever.

346
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:29,375
Hello, Danny boy.
Nitro.

347
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:32,673
I've been wondering.
You need a manager. You know, the...

348
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,007
...the tactics and all that.
Well, I am the bollocks.

349
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,308
Massive's manager.

350
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,607
Yeah, I know, but I'm better than him
because I had trials, didn't I.

351
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,692
We all had trials. That's why we're here.

352
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:50,025
Fuck off! Fuck off!

353
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:55,161
Football trials, yeah?
I could be the physio.

354
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:59,955
No, no, I could be the pharmacist. Get
the lads pepped up and all that bollocks.

355
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,913
I don't think so, mate.

356
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:08,464
Good job he likes you.
He blew up five people, he didn't.

357
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:13,462
They're slags. They won't even
let me in their poxy squad.

358
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:18,431
I don't give a fuck about their poxy squad,
do you understand me?

359
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:21,140
If you want out of this fucking prison,

360
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:25,774
you gotta come up with something
to spoil their little party. Otherwise...

361
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:27,521
...you're fucked.

362
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,438
OK, relax.

363
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:33,397
Be in the atrium
1 1 o'clock tomorrow morning.

364
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,485
- Mr Burton.
- Thank you.

365
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:37,737
It's only a paper.

366
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:41,863
One down, two words, you're nicked.

367
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:47,463
Do you know the penalty for possession of
illegal substances in a prison? Search him.

368
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,259
- What are you looking at, freak?
- You were grassed up.

369
00:32:56,557 --> 00:33:00,008
That dodgy Meehan
is getting well pally with Mr Burton.

370
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,511
I've seen them talking.

371
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,786
- What are you doing?
- No one likes a grass.

372
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:25,829
- What do you mean?
- The big man's right.

373
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:28,292
We'll see what we can do
about them beady eyes.

374
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,797
- Chiv, you know it wasn't me!
- You know it's not me!

375
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:36,297
Which one am I going to burst?
You choose-the left or the right?

376
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,963
- For fuck's sake!
- Go on, pop it!

377
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:41,466
- Hold him!
- Hurry up, Jock bastard.

378
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:45,262
- Who are you calling a Jock bastard?
- You!

379
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:52,900
- I cut myself shaving.
- Nosebleed. It's the altitude.

380
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,648
You want to get that seen to.

381
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:06,496
All right, that's a yellow card, gentlemen.
Behave yourselves.

382
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:16,881
You wanna be more careful with this.

383
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:23,394
You could have had my eye out.

384
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,482
Hey, big-un, here.

385
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,691
It's Chiv.

386
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:40,111
Get him, Tone.

387
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:49,124
Thanks, by the way.

388
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,331
You saved me a lot of grief back there.

389
00:34:52,506 --> 00:34:56,207
- Sorry about the...
- That's all right.

390
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:00,299
- Anyway, you need a few more players.
- What about your lot?

391
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,798
I don't think so.
Not against Sykes' word.

392
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,300
Not that some of them
wouldn't be up for it.

393
00:35:05,477 --> 00:35:07,351
What makes you bulletproof?

394
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:10,771
He's not. But he's pally
with the bloke that Sykes is cagey about.

395
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:14,939
- Who?
- The Monk. That dude is beyond mental.

396
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:19,691
And so are his pals on the outside.
Sykes, he wants a smooth flow.

397
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:24,908
All he really cares about is profit.

398
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:31,957
- What money?
- You're a betting man. We'll make a deal.

399
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:39,299
Let your lads play. Win or lose,
you call the result. Bet accordingly.

400
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:46,550
Back to your fixing
the match routine, right?

401
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:50,428
Now, listen. It's like this -

402
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:56,193
I'd never take a bet against England, and I
wouldn't bet the screws against the cons.

403
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,986
Capisce?

404
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,069
Then we can play to win.

405
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,986
- Would you think about it?
- Yes, I'll think about it.

406
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:11,328
But right now I'm thinking
you're polluting my air.

407
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,127
Now go away.

408
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:17,214
- How did it go?
- It didn't.

409
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:20,834
Here, Dan. Dan, um...

410
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:24,974
- I've been thinking.
- Leave the thinking to me.

411
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,596
Yeah, yeah, of course, Dan, yeah.

412
00:36:29,895 --> 00:36:33,311
Well, what it is, Dan...

413
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,194
What, what...

414
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,397
I was wondering if...

415
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,574
Wondering what, Billy?

416
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,160
Can I be in the team?

417
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,163
The squad, Billy. You can be in the squad.

418
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,634
- I won't let you down, Dan.
- All right.

419
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:15,476
Yes! The squad, yes!
Come on, well in, Bill. Well done!

420
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:19,813
Yeah, squad, squad! Well in!

421
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,609
You told me they were reasonable.

422
00:37:23,782 --> 00:37:26,653
They are, but they're businessmen.

423
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,579
You got me into this,
and you can get me out.

424
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,198
Hey! I opened the door,
you walked through it.

425
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:37,503
You've been making money ever since.
So, why haven't you got it?

426
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:44,041
It is just a temporary cash flow problem.
The team is bleeding me dry.

427
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,138
Well, get it sorted.
Because this lot have a bad habit

428
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,676
of turning cash flow problems
into blood flow problems.

429
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:57,065
I used to do double this just for a warm-up.

430
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,724
Anno Domini, mate.

431
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:05,608
I used to be able to piss in one go and then
forget about it for the rest of the morning.

432
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,740
Bloody hell.

433
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:12,241
You never did say how come it ain't
done your nut in, being in so long.

434
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:15,534
Only does your nut in
if you don't think you should be here.

435
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:18,414
Look at me. Sweet old geezer?

436
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:22,585
A bit bumbly,
full of jail-block wisdom,

437
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:27,883
cornerstone of the nick,
put in with the foundations, right?

438
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,095
Right.

439
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:34,928
I didn't get to be the oldest lag
for breaking windows.

440
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,603
Villains spend their lives
shitting themselves

441
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,526
that other criminals
are going to see to them.

442
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:46,486
So they get their retaliation in first
and twice as nasty.

443
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:52,989
A bloke was coming after me,
so I...

444
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:58,449
I went around to his digs
and lobbed a grenade in the window.

445
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:02,079
Left over after the war,
you know, army surplus.

446
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:09,628
I didn't know, but he had his little nipper
and his bird in there with him.

447
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:13,506
The house went up
like Guy Fawkes' Night.

448
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,267
No one came out.

449
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:24,021
He'd barricaded the door with furniture
in case I came around.

450
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,445
By the time they got in,
the screaming had stopped.

451
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:36,330
1 3 months old,
learning to walk, apparently.

452
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:45,083
Nothing I can do
is ever going to make up for that, is it?

453
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,188
- You're on.
- What's that, a joke?

454
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:12,447
I'm not famous for my sense of humour.
I know Nitro is the grass, not you.

455
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:18,454
- One thing: you fight one of my boys.
- Fight?

456
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:24,662
A little earner I stage now and then.
I can't be seen to be giving you a free ride.

457
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,254
- Fight who?
- Fight him.

458
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:32,589
- Soft as puppy shit, Nick is.
- I'm an ex-footballer, not a boxer.

459
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,922
So? Kick him.

460
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,471
An eye for an eye, you bastard.

461
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,567
- Fucking eye for a fucking...
- Boo!

462
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:52,824
- Don't you do that again.
- Calm down, silly bollocks.

463
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,277
You seem to be making
more enemies by the minute.

464
00:40:56,453 --> 00:41:02,040
Yeah? Well, I want out of this shit house!

465
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,080
Please! Please!

466
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,420
You're half way home, son.
I'm taking you down to segregation now.

467
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,918
- That's why I'm here.
- Yeah?

468
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:18,302
- Yeah.
- Just give me a transfer, sir, please.

469
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:23,517
Please, please. Silverino Sands, yeah?

470
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,310
I will do anything, Mr Ratchett.

471
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,321
I will do anything, Mr Ratchett.

472
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,282
You owe me for this. Out, now!

473
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,289
We have a small change of plan.

474
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:52,504
Nick has come over all poorly.
So I had to bring in a substitute.

475
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,086
Walk away, Danny. Walk away.

476
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:02,057
Mass, this is the only way
we're gonna get these boys to play.

477
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,970
In the dirty brown corner,

478
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:11,818
with a record of 35 and 0
all coming by the way of the big KO.

479
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:16,696
The heavy duty
champion of the penal world

480
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:22,028
Ketch, the Black Country Bastard.

481
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,377
Come on. Come on.

482
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,456
And in the other,
equally dirty brown corner,

483
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:36,631
we have the challenger,
formerly known as the "Mean Machine" -

484
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:42,723
Danny "I've had more backhanders
than Boris bleeding Becker" Meehan!

485
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,301
Yeah!

486
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,854
Gentlemen, it's alternate punches,

487
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:58,568
followed by one mug
of five-star prison cognac. Cheers.

488
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:05,869
No using your left hand, no butting,
biting, spitting, poking or kissing, you.

489
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:10,335
It's show time!

490
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,712
First head to hit the table loses.

491
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,841
First punch to the challenger.

492
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,600
Is he trying to kiss me or what?

493
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,606
Yeah!

494
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,323
Come on, Danny, wake up!

495
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,498
He fucking...

496
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,934
Focus, Danny.

497
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,443
By the way, I'm in here for GBH.

498
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,067
And again, come on!

499
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,285
Keep your head up.

500
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,914
I'm in here for drunken assault.

501
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,281
Yeah!

502
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,384
First, I'd like to welcome Mr Sykes' boys.

503
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,721
Watch this.

504
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:33,468
Go on.

505
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,434
Hey!

506
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:44,857
OK, if you wanna do that, join a circus.
It's no good to us.

507
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,525
We need 1 1 men
to play as a team. Right?

508
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,028
- Right!
- Yes!

509
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,206
That's lovely, Dan. Well in. Right!

510
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,118
OK, positions. I play centre midfield.

511
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:01,922
Let's have all midfield players behind me,
defenders to me left, strikers to me right.

512
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,627
Come on, lads, come on.

513
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,513
Terrific. Let's move on.

514
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,815
That's good. Now pass it.

515
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,487
Pass it, Trojan.

516
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,067
Pass it!

517
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:33,159
Trojan, it's a team game.
Pass to our team.

518
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,749
He's too greedy.

519
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,621
OK, fellas. Now, the key
to set pieces is concentration,

520
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,955
calculation, teamwork.

521
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,711
With corners it's about movement,

522
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,130
drawing defenders out of position.

523
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,471
When it comes to defending,
it's about tackling,

524
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,353
finesse,

525
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,856
calculation.

526
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:07,023
Remember these simple rules, and we're
in with a chance. Any questions?

527
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,613
Lovely story.

528
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,069
Yeah.

529
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:20,411
We still need a goalkeeper.
Somebody to boss the defence about.

530
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:24,835
There's one man I know who could
boss our def... No, no. Fuck that.

531
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,879
- That's not even worth thinking about.
- Who?

532
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,588
- No, no, you'll laugh your head off.
- Who?

533
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,719
- The Monk.
- Monk? Can he play?

534
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,013
They say he could have turned pro,
before he turned mad.

535
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:41,225
- How mad is he?
- He's the Jock that even the Jocks fear.

536
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,567
- What did he do?
- Something very dark up in Glasgow.

537
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,109
I heard he ate Hannibal the Cannibal.

538
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,365
Not even the Pope
could get him out of the special wing.

539
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,321
The Monk is in the high security wing.

540
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:58,122
So do me a favour. Maybe I can
help you with Barry the Bookie.

541
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,119
I'm listening.

542
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,785
Bet the game, your guards to win.

543
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,039
Price is right, we'll make a killing.

544
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:09,296
You pay off Barry,
and have some left.

545
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,257
Take the missus to Malaga.

546
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:20,641
- This is so illegal.
- I think criminal's the word.

547
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,102
All right, big man? Sound.

548
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:29,986
Danny Meehan,
he's all right, know what I mean?

549
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,233
He's got a wee favour to ask you.

550
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,822
- Hello, Mr Monk. Can you play football?
- Aye.

551
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:41,410
Good. Would you like to play with us?

552
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,044
Nah.

553
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,212
We're playing the guards.

554
00:48:55,891 --> 00:49:00,055
- Aye. Then I'm with you.
- Sound.

555
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,268
Thanks a lot, Mr Monk.

556
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,895
OK, let's try it. Troj, you take the corner.

557
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,144
It's my ball. Mouse's ball, Troj.

558
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:13,072
Come on, Troj. Yeah, yeah.
To me, Troj.

559
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:17,192
It's Mouse's ball. My ball. Yeah.

560
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:26,082
- He's broke my bloody nose.
- Let me have a look.

561
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,708
What?

562
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,589
- He did that on purpose.
- No, he didn't.

563
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,680
- Yes, he did.
- Tell him...

564
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,425
Tell him it was an accident.

565
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,558
Right, it was an accident.

566
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:49,939
- Now, get yourself off over the back there.
- He said it was an accident.

567
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:57,987
You're not worried about the opposition,
are you, Mr Burton?

568
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:02,705
A team of life's losers led by a man
who can be bought and sold?

569
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:07,537
I don't think so.
Not when the game's about character.

570
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,286
We'll give you a match.

571
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:14,298
You'll give us a game.
Doubt whether you can match us.

572
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,222
We'll see.

573
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:31,818
One, two, three...
Look up, pass it. Look up again.

574
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:36,151
Well done! Let the ball do the work.
As the ball's coming to you, look up.

575
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,365
Start again. Spread out.

576
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,780
Up, down...

577
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,625
Up, down...

578
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,878
Come on.

579
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,464
One, two, three, four...

580
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:04,852
And left, and right.
And left, and right...

581
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:09,148
Hurry it up there.
I told you two to keep the centre tight.

582
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,685
I've always told you
to wear tie-ups on your socks.

583
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:16,859
Now you, get over there and mark up.
And you, bugger off.

584
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:34,792
Now listen, Daniel,
I'm not putting you under pressure, right.

585
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:39,546
I'm burning up phone cards, taking bets
from prisons up and down the country.

586
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,465
Oh, no.

587
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,516
Despite what the governor thinks,
I'm betting us to win.

588
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,095
So my arse is on the line.

589
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:52,108
And by my arse, I mean your arse.

590
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,979
- OK, I need a volunteer.
- Yeah.

591
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,361
- Dan.
- Yeah, all right, Bill.

592
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,821
Help Monk and Chiv
with their demonstration.

593
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,902
- Lovely.
- Cheers.

594
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,578
Aye, right. So, we are the cons.

595
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:09,204
And they are screws.

596
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:13,837
So if anybody's gonna play dirty,
it's gonna be they fuckers.

597
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:18,218
Here's one or two wee examples,
just to keep us a step ahead.

598
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:22,383
Numero uno:
the accidental treading on the toe.

599
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,226
It's an obvious one, but it works.

600
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,270
Ah, fuck!

601
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:33,639
Numero...

602
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,068
...two.

603
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:40,689
Right, daftie, run towards The Monk.

604
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:46,075
- What now?
- On you go, half pace?

605
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,665
The cunningly titled "elbow in the face".

606
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,458
Very effective, but you tend to get sent off.

607
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:58,383
So if you use it,
make sure the ref's not looking.

608
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,801
- Number four.
- Wait. What happened to number three?

609
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,512
Number four: when you're helping him up,

610
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,554
grab the hairs under his armpits
and twist them round.

611
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,852
- Hurts like a bastard, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

612
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,779
- Number five.
- Wait, I'm gonna sit down.

613
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:23,114
I don't wanna hog it.
Let one of these lot have a go.

614
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:26,783
You're all right. You're the man.
You're hard. Get in there.

615
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:33,290
Yeah, as it happens, yeah.
No, go on, yeah.

616
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:57,101
And finally, the piece de résistance,
number 23.

617
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:01,487
I can't. Monk, stop, I'm in a bad way, mate.

618
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,277
Monk, I can't breathe.

619
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,029
Ah, fuck!

620
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,414
The guillotine.

621
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,705
Come on, let's move on.

622
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:18,085
Get yourself up.
You're making the place look untidy.

623
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,462
- Was that all right though?
- Cream.

624
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:21,628
Well done.

625
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,920
Finish with a bit of shooting practice.
Troj, you lay them off.

626
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,384
Massive, marks out of ten.

627
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:33,805
You've done well with that lot.

628
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,268
Passes the time, Doc.

629
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:41,149
You know,
it's not a crime to admit enjoying it.

630
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:44,942
You're becoming a sentimental old fart.

631
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:50,900
That bloody Meehan.
Who does he think he is?

632
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,492
Don't you worry about Meehan.
I've got something sorted for him.

633
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,625
Mr Popular. Time to meet your friends.

634
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,797
You can't put me back on the wing.

635
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:08,262
- You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
- Sykes will fucking kill me.

636
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,672
You know the itch I want scratching.

637
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,341
I don't want Meehan on that pitch,
understand?

638
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,433
OK. I know what needs to be done.

639
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,729
Nice and easy.

640
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,814
Right down the middle.

641
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:27,732
And a one, and a two.

642
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:31,569
And a three.

643
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,946
Good shot. Good shot.

644
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,954
Where have you been? The governor's
been waiting. I'll take him in.

645
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:43,708
OK, miss.

646
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:47,334
I've thought of a way I can really help you.

647
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:52,138
- The sad old twat videos all their games.
- Really?

648
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:57,100
And I've written some pointers.
My own little dossier on the guards.

649
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:02,266
I'm sure you'll find it very interesting.
Now hurry up, we haven't got much time.

650
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:04,815
Quicker.

651
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:13,234
One thing. This is strictly sex.
I ain't gonna respect you after.

652
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:16,579
- Don't blame you.
- Girls like to brag down the pub as well.

653
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,207
I've heard.

654
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,583
What? Easy.

655
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:28,885
- Change her oil, did you?
- Gentlemen should never kiss and tell.

656
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,009
- I'd better go home.
- Massive?

657
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,765
Inside information on the opposition.
Read it carefully. It's important.

658
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:47,272
All right, Danny.
There's a meeting in Mr Sykes' cell.

659
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:06,461
All right, lads.
A bit of wind-up material on the opposition.

660
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,589
Ketch, this one's for you.

661
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,630
You know how Ratchett's
going on about his dodgy knee?

662
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,263
It's the right one.

663
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,268
This one is dynamite.

664
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:25,732
Marsden's daughter, Donna, has been
known to dabble in class A drugs.

665
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,273
Let him know about it at the right time.

666
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:32,313
Here we go, Danny boy.

667
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,193
And now for our secret weapon.

668
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,455
- Danny, tape.
- Oh, shit, I forgot it.

669
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:44,836
- I left it in my locker.
- I'll get it. Need a slash anyway.

670
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:47,673
Cheers, Doc. Sorry, boss.

671
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,790
That's right, get the old boy working.

672
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:08,311
Danny, why did you do it?

673
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,402
Throw that game.

674
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:16,362
Fuck me, Jerome, you do talk too much.

675
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:21,611
- Sorry.
- No, you're all right.

676
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:27,170
It's funny,
but when you're in that football world,

677
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,876
you just don't realise
what it means to people.

678
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:34,841
You only find out how disappointed
they are, when you let them down.

679
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:40,007
I was 16 when I signed pro forms.
Thought I was the business.

680
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,062
Didn't take long
for standards to start slipping.

681
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,938
Cars, booze, bad tips for slow horses...

682
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:54,982
You think you can handle it,
then bang, very soon it's handling you.

683
00:58:55,157 --> 00:59:00,068
Before I was picking up trophies,
I was 425 grand down...

684
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:06,490
...to men nasty enough... Well, even they
would have put the wind up Mr Sykes.

685
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,870
But they did give me two choices.

686
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:16,298
A wheelchair for life, or a deliberate
penalty against the Germans.

687
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:20,967
It's not as if I've prospered.

688
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,549
Look where I've ended up.

689
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:30,389
But I'll tell you something -
I didn't start off out as a youngster,

690
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:32,893
Iooking to sell my country out.

691
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,777
None of us planned
to be here, mate.

692
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:40,567
Och, away tae fuck, man.
You were a hero in Scotland.

693
00:59:56,635 --> 01:00:00,254
Sign it, and I'll ship you straight out of here.

694
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,634
OK.

695
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:07,850
Even down here you ain't safe from Sykes.
He's put a price on you, sunshine.

696
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:12,066
- Killing Doc, that was a big mistake.
- Fuck him.

697
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:18,023
Where am I off to, boys? HMP Silver
Sands, where all the toffs go? Whatever.

698
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,741
- Not exactly, no.
- No?

699
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:26,240
No. You're catching the ghost train
out of here to the funny farm.

700
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,075
To the funny farm.

701
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,037
Her Majesty's Prison - Broadhurst.

702
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,205
What? I'm gonna get you! Yeah!

703
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,873
I'm gonna find your house.
I'm gonna blow it up.

704
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:41,587
No, you won't. By the time
the orderlies have finished with you,

705
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:44,171
you won't be able to blow your nose!

706
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:50,813
Go on, get in there.

707
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,521
I'm gonna get you!

708
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:20,416
I reckon you're quits now, old man.

709
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:22,104
Mean Machine, Mean Machine...

710
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:41,918
No, don't you worry about the car.
I'd have my bloody house on this one.

711
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,800
Done deal, darlin'.

712
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:45,250
Yes.

713
01:02:47,014 --> 01:02:48,389
Wanker.

714
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:53,720
OK, gentlemen.
You've got 90 minutes to show them

715
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:58,688
that when it comes to physical
and mental strength, they can't touch us.

716
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:04,779
Most of them are gonna want to
mix it up out there. Don't get involved.

717
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:09,278
All right, lads. You wanna be nothing,

718
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:14,364
numbers, prisoners, that's fine.

719
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:18,207
But you win today, you'll have
something you remember forever.

720
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:20,667
Talk about it over and over

721
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:25,798
because there are cons that are pig sick
at not being here in your shoes.

722
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:29,255
Just to have one crack
at those bastards next door.

723
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:34,177
Let's win, and let's win well.

724
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,679
Lose and they'll never let you forget it.

725
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:44,770
Run your guts out, and you'll have
something in here they can never touch.

726
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:50,866
No parole boards,
judges or nutcase governors.

727
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,079
They've got one good player,
but he's had his moment.

728
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,041
And this is a team game.

729
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,045
Now ask yourselves one question...

730
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:05,714
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

731
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:07,758
- Are we?
- Yes.

732
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,300
- Well, come on!
- Yeah!

733
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:14,684
I'm looking at each and every one
of you lads to get out there

734
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:19,478
and show them who's boss. Come on!

735
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:23,598
Hold up for Mr Sykes.

736
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:32,947
Doc was a different generation,
and he saved all his life.

737
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,952
But before he died,
he had me sort out these.

738
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:44,249
Come and get them, lads!

739
01:04:44,423 --> 01:04:47,792
Good afternoon, I'm Bob Likely.
You join us live from the recreation field.

740
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:50,839
I'm Bob Carter, and thanks
again to our esteemed governor...

741
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:53,421
- Wanker.
...for providing the splendid facilities

742
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,553
that are here today as part
of his rehabilitation campaign.

743
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:59,811
And for our audience, cooped up inside,
here's a weather report.

744
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,522
It's a beautiful day.

745
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:05,558
And what a day it is!
And the waiting's over.

746
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:08,405
The guards are out first,
fronted by Mr Burton.

747
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:18,947
And here comes the Mean Machine,

748
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:23,122
led out by our most famous son,
Danny Meehan.

749
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:26,795
- Don't worry. The boys are well up for it.
- I'm not worried.

750
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:30,968
- Where did they get that kit?
- Cheeky bastards.

751
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:39,137
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

752
01:05:49,196 --> 01:05:50,690
Skip.

753
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:55,985
- Your call.
- Heads.

754
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:01,159
- As we are, then.
- OK.

755
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:07,377
This is the one.
Take your chances.

756
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:09,706
Don't start anything.
If they do, finish it. OK?

757
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:12,635
- Yes!
- Come on, lads!

758
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:19,559
- Let's wipe the floor with this shite.
- Simple ball every time.

759
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:28,226
Boy, Mr Sykes, you look the part.
All you need now is a...

760
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:33,192
It's the one we've all been waiting for.

761
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:36,569
Longmarsh prison guards
versus Longmarsh prison cons.

762
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:39,116
It's the cons to kick off, Bob.

763
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,623
It's a free kick to the cons.

764
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:58,797
Ketch has just floored Mr Ratchett.

765
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,255
What's the matter?

766
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:01,845
Shut up, you pussy!

767
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:04,475
You fucking bastard!

768
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:07,138
Well done, Ketch. Just be subtle.

769
01:07:07,316 --> 01:07:09,439
Which one's he then?

770
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:14,194
Come on, take him out, son!

771
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:17,069
And Trojan evades Marsden brilliantly.

772
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:20,078
If only he could have done that
the night he got nicked.

773
01:07:21,163 --> 01:07:23,239
The keeper plays it long.

774
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:25,574
Walker brings it down to the halfway line.

775
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:27,791
It's a misplaced pass to Jerome McFife,

776
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:30,369
but the ever observant Mr Burton
kicks it back to the guards.

777
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:33,003
It's a neat one-two. Walker to Burton.

778
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:37,173
Back to Walker. He shoots.
Just past the post!

779
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:38,626
Almost.

780
01:07:38,806 --> 01:07:40,798
That was a bit too close for comfort.

781
01:07:40,975 --> 01:07:43,181
Too fucking close for my liking.

782
01:07:43,352 --> 01:07:44,977
Get up there!

783
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:47,981
Monk plays it out to Meehan.
Meehan has the ball in the centre.

784
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:49,607
Goes forward unchallenged.

785
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:52,349
Burton takes Meehan's legs away.
Meehan does not look happy.

786
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:56,064
Now that's it, Burton!

787
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:01,119
What's the matter with the rest of you?

788
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:05,154
You four stand there. Split on my run.
I wanna try something.

789
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:10,125
Meehan to take it.
Looks like he might chip this one.

790
01:08:16,427 --> 01:08:18,503
Right in Ratchett's crown jewels.

791
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:22,297
It'll take more than magic sponge
to take the sting out of that.

792
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:25,012
Fuck... me!

793
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:27,392
Ref, that was bloody deliberate!

794
01:08:27,563 --> 01:08:31,181
Free kick. Handball.
Protect yourself at all times.

795
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:35,145
Ten yards! Ten!

796
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:37,728
Come away!

797
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:56,128
Right in his carrots and onions.

798
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,842
No nookie for Mr Ratchett.

799
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:00,050
No nookie for Mrs Ratchett neither.

800
01:09:00,221 --> 01:09:02,178
Play on!

801
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:04,506
Just goes to show,
lightning can strike twice.

802
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:05,928
Abso-fucking-lutely.

803
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,305
23 minutes of the first half to go,
and it's getting heated out there.

804
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,053
Yeah, Bob. Very rock'n'roll.

805
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:26,490
Fuckin' hell!

806
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:30,282
- He's gotta get back in goal.
- I ain't telling him.

807
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:42,128
- Piss off, you Scotch bastard!
- How's your daughter, by the way?

808
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:46,598
Donna. Still hanging about
on street corners to feed the habit?

809
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:50,552
What's up with you?

810
01:10:06,954 --> 01:10:08,662
Christ's sake!

811
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:20,254
That's it, fellas, good teamwork.

812
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:27,798
- That was a hard but a fair tackle.
- Yeah, it was a fair challenge.

813
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:30,217
But that wasn't.

814
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:33,348
This could be dangerous for the cons.

815
01:10:33,522 --> 01:10:35,147
It's a free kick.

816
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:36,940
Don't think I didn't see it.

817
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:40,810
Ketch has took a strop. And the guards
look determined to convert this.

818
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:42,696
Make it count!

819
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:13,260
The Monk's collected it cleanly.

820
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:17,731
The Monk-calm and calculated.
Looks like the therapy's paying off.

821
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,898
Once again, Monk's played it
to Trojan, who's again switched to the left.

822
01:11:22,071 --> 01:11:24,194
He must be ambidextrous.

823
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:27,531
I don't know, but he can use both feet.

824
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:46,841
- Goal!
- Yeah!

825
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:52,966
Goal!

826
01:11:57,731 --> 01:11:59,523
Yeah!

827
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:06,236
- Beauty! You beauty!
- Go on, my son.

828
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,285
We're all over them.

829
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:18,957
- One-nil to the Mean Machine.
- It's the guards to kick off.

830
01:12:19,128 --> 01:12:21,453
- It's getting tough.
- You can say that again.

831
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:25,794
- It's getting tough out there, Bob.
- Never mind, Bob.

832
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:35,977
Oh no, it looks like the Monk's at it again.

833
01:12:36,145 --> 01:12:38,102
Pass it!

834
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:55,787
- Do that again and I'll rip your head off.
- Ref, did you hear that?

835
01:12:56,457 --> 01:12:59,577
I'm not worried. He said it to you, not me.

836
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:01,329
Let's go, sonny.

837
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:06,539
- What's he doing?
- You're the skipper, you tell him.

838
01:13:06,717 --> 01:13:08,211
Bollocks.

839
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,507
Hold on.

840
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:13,844
Fucker!

841
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:16,589
It's kicked off. Let's just try and keep calm.

842
01:13:16,769 --> 01:13:21,229
- Referee!
- Go on, get in there. Go on, chin him!

843
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,893
This isn't a football match!

844
01:13:23,067 --> 01:13:25,273
- Do him!
- Go on, do him!

845
01:13:25,444 --> 01:13:27,484
- This is bollocks!
- Do him!

846
01:13:27,655 --> 01:13:29,279
Who are you hitting?

847
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:34,240
This is bollocks!
What's going on here?

848
01:13:35,621 --> 01:13:38,077
- You want some? Come on.
- Any day.

849
01:13:38,249 --> 01:13:40,075
Where are you, referee?

850
01:13:42,253 --> 01:13:45,622
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Calm down, everybody! Come on!

851
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:49,748
- Ref, how long?
- Bollocks, that'll do.

852
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:54,339
Half-time, come on.

853
01:13:55,891 --> 01:14:00,886
One-nil to the Mean Machine, one-nil: : :

854
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:08,356
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You're supposed to throw this game.

855
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:11,732
Yeah, they don't seem
to be taking notice of me.

856
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:14,149
Youthful exuberance.

857
01:14:14,994 --> 01:14:16,452
Shame.

858
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:19,655
It would have worked out nice.

859
01:14:19,832 --> 01:14:22,323
What do you think
Danny will say in the dressing room?

860
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:26,369
I think he'll be saying
there's only 45 minutes left to play.

861
01:14:26,547 --> 01:14:27,745
Yeah.

862
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:38,303
Settle down, boys. Have a listen.
We ain't won nothing yet.

863
01:14:38,475 --> 01:14:42,307
All we've got is one goal.
Now this half is when we're gonna earn it.

864
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:47,106
Midfield, tuck in,
get round behind the ball. Monk?

865
01:14:47,276 --> 01:14:51,404
Good work, Monk, just don't leave us
exposed at the back, all right?

866
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:55,946
- Mouse?
- It's my nose.

867
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:59,617
- Bill, you come on for Mouse.
- Where am I playing?

868
01:14:59,788 --> 01:15:03,240
You take his place in midfield.
Frenchie, have a look at his nose.

869
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:07,118
OK, we've botched it, but we're
one-nil down. Mr Hayter, when the...

870
01:15:07,296 --> 01:15:09,502
You think about it!

871
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:16,008
We're getting beaten
by a bunch of worthless criminals.

872
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:20,225
- I'm doing my half-time talk, sir.
- Sit down.

873
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:22,848
Have you forgotten who they are?

874
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:27,314
They're the dregs of society,
and they're in the next dressing room.

875
01:15:27,483 --> 01:15:30,270
And they're laughing at you right now.

876
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,734
Just remember this:

877
01:15:33,906 --> 01:15:38,698
every man here is playing for his job.

878
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:42,533
Including you.

879
01:15:47,086 --> 01:15:51,463
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

880
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:54,467
- What's going on?
- You wanted a game.

881
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:57,589
Yes, but you never
said anything about winning.

882
01:15:57,763 --> 01:16:01,049
You never said nothing about losing either.

883
01:16:01,225 --> 01:16:04,309
Before leaving us,
Nitro wrote a confession.

884
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:06,969
He admitted killing Doc.

885
01:16:07,147 --> 01:16:11,525
He said you knew about it,
and you sent Doc to your cell.

886
01:16:11,694 --> 01:16:15,941
Now that's accessory to murder,

887
01:16:16,115 --> 01:16:18,487
and that's 20 years.

888
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,200
You'll never get that to stick.

889
01:16:22,371 --> 01:16:25,407
One whiff of this will kill you
with the parole board.

890
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:28,252
You could be with us for some time.

891
01:16:28,419 --> 01:16:32,915
So I think it's in everyone's interest

892
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:35,248
if you lose this game.

893
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:40,048
- I can't do that.
- You've done it before.

894
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:05,824
You had everything they ever dreamed of,

895
01:17:05,998 --> 01:17:08,869
and you threw it all away.

896
01:17:37,363 --> 01:17:40,399
Meehan has given it away again.

897
01:17:41,784 --> 01:17:44,405
For fuck's sake, Danny, I was open.

898
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,370
I didn't see you.

899
01:17:51,919 --> 01:17:54,077
Looks like he's in a world of his own.

900
01:17:54,255 --> 01:17:56,461
Wake up, Meehan.

901
01:17:58,634 --> 01:18:00,461
The ball's played out to the left.

902
01:18:00,636 --> 01:18:04,301
Hibert picks it up
and moves forward to the 1 8-yard box.

903
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:06,133
The defender cuts inside.

904
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:09,179
He plays it to Hayter,
who knocks it through for Downes.

905
01:18:09,353 --> 01:18:11,429
Oh no,
he's been brought down in the area.

906
01:18:11,605 --> 01:18:13,598
Could be a penalty.

907
01:18:13,774 --> 01:18:17,060
The ref's waved play on.
What goes through Monk's head?

908
01:18:17,236 --> 01:18:21,103
- Scary thought.
- I'd hate to think what he dreams about.

909
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:53,428
It's getting naughty out there.

910
01:18:53,606 --> 01:18:55,266
Positively brutal.

911
01:18:55,441 --> 01:18:58,014
Are they fighting or doing the tango?

912
01:18:58,194 --> 01:19:00,981
No, they're definitely fighting, Bob.

913
01:19:20,049 --> 01:19:23,833
Billy's chasing the ball like a terrier.

914
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:28,256
Shame he hasn't got
the skill to match his enthusiasm.

915
01:19:28,432 --> 01:19:32,264
- Shame he's fucking useless, Bob.
- Abso-fucking-lutely, Bob.

916
01:19:42,196 --> 01:19:43,773
Ratchett's taken out Cigs.

917
01:19:43,948 --> 01:19:46,521
Looks like the guards
aren't taking any prisoners. You get it?

918
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,618
Whatever, Bob.

919
01:19:56,544 --> 01:19:59,165
You, fuckin' watch it.

920
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:02,043
No, you fuckin' watch it,
you fat bastard Indian!

921
01:20:06,428 --> 01:20:09,216
That's going a bit too far, innit?

922
01:20:10,975 --> 01:20:14,474
- He took a dive!
- Number 7, violent conduct. Off the park.

923
01:20:14,645 --> 01:20:16,887
It was a dive, look!

924
01:20:17,064 --> 01:20:19,389
- Come on. Do one, now.
- Fuck off!

925
01:20:19,567 --> 01:20:22,733
The cons are down to ten men.

926
01:20:22,903 --> 01:20:25,062
It's an early bath for Raj,

927
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:28,026
which is really gonna put
pressure on the Mean Machine.

928
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,865
It's disappointing.
It's not gonna be easy out there.

929
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:37,328
That's right. And they're taking full
advantage of the extra man on the pitch.

930
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:39,743
Walker's through ball to Mr Gayle,

931
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,788
who plays it, and Hayter, and Monk...
Superb save, way down to his left.

932
01:20:43,966 --> 01:20:45,377
All right!

933
01:20:45,551 --> 01:20:48,220
29 minutes, still one-nil,
and the cons are holding out.

934
01:20:48,387 --> 01:20:51,174
And the Monk's going
on another walk-about.

935
01:20:51,348 --> 01:20:54,385
But this time
he plays it safe to Trojan out wide.

936
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:05,065
- All Troj has to do is look up.
- And pass it.

937
01:21:05,237 --> 01:21:07,942
- Pass it.
- Pass it.

938
01:21:08,115 --> 01:21:10,357
- Pass it.
- Pass it.

939
01:21:10,534 --> 01:21:12,776
Pass the fucking ball!

940
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:28,089
Yes!

941
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,834
Goal!

942
01:21:31,013 --> 01:21:34,263
Two-nil for the cons, ten men down,

943
01:21:34,433 --> 01:21:40,103
their liberty taken away from them,
locked in a cell for 23 hours a day.

944
01:21:40,272 --> 01:21:43,107
and today, our boys had their day.

945
01:21:45,986 --> 01:21:48,940
What's up with you?

946
01:21:50,199 --> 01:21:52,772
For the last hour of my life,

947
01:21:52,952 --> 01:21:54,660
I have been free!

948
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:57,498
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

949
01:21:57,665 --> 01:22:01,199
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

950
01:22:01,377 --> 01:22:03,369
Yes!

951
01:22:05,172 --> 01:22:08,209
It's the guards to kick off.

952
01:22:08,968 --> 01:22:13,546
Mr Williams lays it back for Mr Hibert,
who whips a beautiful ball into the box.

953
01:22:13,722 --> 01:22:16,344
Monk's got it covered. Safe as houses.

954
01:22:16,517 --> 01:22:20,645
- You've gotta love the Monk.
- Gotta love the Monk.

955
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,913
What's Monk doing?
He's left an empty net!

956
01:22:43,669 --> 01:22:45,792
He's lost the fuckin' ball!

957
01:22:45,963 --> 01:22:48,371
He's lost the fuckin' plot.

958
01:22:54,305 --> 01:22:57,306
Guards' goal. Two-one.

959
01:22:57,474 --> 01:22:59,551
Yes!

960
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:05,521
Hey! Stop fucking about back here!

961
01:23:05,691 --> 01:23:08,099
Get the ball up the park!

962
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,775
All right. My fault.

963
01:23:14,074 --> 01:23:16,565
It's no longer just a game out there.

964
01:23:16,744 --> 01:23:19,032
There's a match on now.

965
01:23:21,415 --> 01:23:23,988
- Have a word, Dan.
- Fuck off, Trojan.

966
01:23:25,544 --> 01:23:28,214
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, boys.

967
01:23:31,342 --> 01:23:33,381
The cons kick off.

968
01:23:33,552 --> 01:23:38,380
But what is he doing?
He's given it straight away.

969
01:23:38,557 --> 01:23:41,677
He's hit the bar.

970
01:23:41,852 --> 01:23:46,561
You see, there's no cohesion,
there's no character.

971
01:23:47,942 --> 01:23:49,981
The Mean Machine need their star player

972
01:23:50,152 --> 01:23:52,359
to pick up his game now.

973
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:57,191
- What is Meehan doing anyway?
- It's like he's not even on the pitch.

974
01:24:00,287 --> 01:24:03,490
What's up with you?
I never touched you.

975
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:06,583
Looks like Danny's injured.

976
01:24:06,752 --> 01:24:10,417
You're cheating now.
Once a loser, always a loser.

977
01:24:10,589 --> 01:24:13,792
- Dan, where did you get hit?
- Down there.

978
01:24:13,968 --> 01:24:16,340
Doesn't look too clever, boys.

979
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,181
- I can't see anything.
- Let's get him up.

980
01:24:19,348 --> 01:24:22,966
Come on.
Don't put no weight on it, Dan.

981
01:24:23,143 --> 01:24:26,228
Meehan's leaving the pitch.
Let's hope they bring a sub on.

982
01:24:26,397 --> 01:24:30,264
- It's 1 1 against 9 out there.
- All right, got it.

983
01:24:30,442 --> 01:24:32,684
- Get it fixed.
- OK, we got it.

984
01:24:32,862 --> 01:24:34,984
Shove up and shut up.

985
01:24:36,448 --> 01:24:39,402
The guards are moving the ball nicely.

986
01:24:39,577 --> 01:24:41,201
Neat passing.

987
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:44,573
But the cons
are determined not to give up.

988
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:50,412
There's nothing wrong with that leg,
is there?

989
01:24:54,133 --> 01:24:58,296
- Why don't people just let me play?
- Didn't think you'd sell us out.

990
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:03,216
Not after the big "it's your time" speech.

991
01:25:08,731 --> 01:25:13,143
- Is there something I should know?
- He's fucked something up.

992
01:25:15,321 --> 01:25:17,562
Could be a strain.

993
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:30,491
It's getting tough.
The guards are putting the pressure on.

994
01:25:30,669 --> 01:25:34,418
Fuckin' hell, Massive, help us out.
We've only got nine men on!

995
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:37,425
Get a sub on.

996
01:25:41,055 --> 01:25:43,131
Walker to Marsden.

997
01:25:48,896 --> 01:25:51,351
Downs, wide to Hibert.

998
01:25:51,524 --> 01:25:53,730
Hibert clips it forward.

999
01:25:55,444 --> 01:25:57,022
Walker brings it down.

1000
01:25:57,196 --> 01:25:59,023
The cons are swamped at the back.

1001
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:01,867
Ratchett's free in the area.

1002
01:26:02,034 --> 01:26:04,074
Oh, no!

1003
01:26:04,245 --> 01:26:06,486
Yes! Yes!

1004
01:26:06,664 --> 01:26:11,741
- Two-fucking-two.
- Good one! Good one!

1005
01:26:13,003 --> 01:26:15,957
Thanks, Danny Meehan.

1006
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:20,718
Two-two.

1007
01:26:20,886 --> 01:26:23,377
Right, now a third. Get up there!

1008
01:26:23,556 --> 01:26:26,510
Ref. Sub.

1009
01:26:35,818 --> 01:26:39,981
- Mass, look...
- It's your life.

1010
01:26:43,659 --> 01:26:45,865
Ratchett's brought down Billy the Limpet.

1011
01:26:46,036 --> 01:26:48,112
And that's like kicking a puppy dog.

1012
01:26:54,378 --> 01:26:56,869
Give me my boot.

1013
01:26:59,258 --> 01:27:02,378
Yes! Ref! Ref!

1014
01:27:03,345 --> 01:27:05,385
I'm coming back on.

1015
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:07,513
- Sit down.
- Forget it, Meehan.

1016
01:27:07,683 --> 01:27:09,261
Who's coming on?

1017
01:27:09,435 --> 01:27:10,431
- Me.
- Him.

1018
01:27:10,603 --> 01:27:13,888
- I am.
- You're playing like crap and you know it.

1019
01:27:14,064 --> 01:27:16,520
- Who's in charge here?
- On you go.

1020
01:27:16,692 --> 01:27:19,646
- I'm in charge. Danny's coming on.
- Hold it!

1021
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,979
- Listen, I'm the owner.
- You?

1022
01:27:22,156 --> 01:27:23,615
- Yes.
- The owner?

1023
01:27:23,782 --> 01:27:27,365
- Yes.
- Behave. Manager's decision. You, on.

1024
01:27:31,373 --> 01:27:33,615
The great Meehan returns to the pitch.

1025
01:27:33,792 --> 01:27:39,297
Yeah, that's all we need. If he carries on
playing like he did before he went off,

1026
01:27:39,465 --> 01:27:42,916
we may as well all go home now, Bob.

1027
01:27:52,561 --> 01:27:55,099
Ketch knocks it out wide to Trojan.

1028
01:27:55,272 --> 01:27:59,104
It's amazing. The guards still find it hard
to deal with this man.

1029
01:27:59,276 --> 01:28:01,602
I'm with you here if you want.

1030
01:28:01,779 --> 01:28:05,064
Shoot! Shoot! Pass it, I'm on! Pass it here!

1031
01:28:05,241 --> 01:28:08,360
Trojan plays it into the centre.

1032
01:28:08,536 --> 01:28:10,694
I'm free there!

1033
01:28:10,871 --> 01:28:14,157
- Well, I didn't see you, did I?
- Really?

1034
01:28:16,836 --> 01:28:18,958
Chiv, pass it!

1035
01:28:19,755 --> 01:28:22,376
Chiv, pass it!

1036
01:28:35,855 --> 01:28:39,188
Oh, God. That was a meeting of minds.
Not a pretty sight.

1037
01:28:39,358 --> 01:28:41,766
Meehan's trying to redeem himself.

1038
01:28:41,944 --> 01:28:45,111
Yeah, but he's gonna have to do
a lot of work to manage that.

1039
01:28:45,281 --> 01:28:47,688
Meehan is now everywhere.

1040
01:28:47,867 --> 01:28:51,236
He is bobbing and weaving, Bob.

1041
01:28:52,288 --> 01:28:55,289
No way was that offside.

1042
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,928
That's the way it's done, pal.

1043
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:16,267
The ball's pushed high
into the guards' half. Cigs pulls it down.

1044
01:29:16,437 --> 01:29:18,726
Shoots. What a goal!

1045
01:29:18,898 --> 01:29:21,733
- The Mean Machine are in front again.
- There's a flag.

1046
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:26,064
- God bless the Mean Machine.
- Keep your shirt on.

1047
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:29,903
- Wait a minute...
- There's something going on.

1048
01:29:30,075 --> 01:29:33,361
- They're still celebrating.
- It's been disallowed.

1049
01:29:33,537 --> 01:29:36,622
The ref has gone to the linesman.

1050
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:38,748
There's confusion on the pitch.

1051
01:29:38,918 --> 01:29:41,622
- There certainly is.
- They're conferring.

1052
01:29:41,795 --> 01:29:46,457
Surely not! Now, if this stands,
it's a free kick to the guards,

1053
01:29:46,634 --> 01:29:50,501
- 35 yards out from the goal.
- Get up, you bloody tart.

1054
01:29:50,679 --> 01:29:53,597
OK, let's get him off.

1055
01:29:53,766 --> 01:29:57,217
It's in a goal scoring position
if I've ever seen one.

1056
01:29:57,394 --> 01:29:59,636
We're in the dying seconds
of the game. It's two-two.

1057
01:29:59,813 --> 01:30:02,518
Lee, get changed. You're on, mate. Ref!

1058
01:30:02,691 --> 01:30:04,933
Mr Ratchett, are you all right, sir?

1059
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:09,354
Obviously not.
All right, take him away.

1060
01:30:09,532 --> 01:30:15,202
- Are you gonna do nothing about that?
- It's a free kick, now take it.

1061
01:30:15,371 --> 01:30:18,787
- How long?
- Just moving into injury time.

1062
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:21,994
This is it. If he scores now, it's all over.

1063
01:30:22,169 --> 01:30:23,996
All right, stick it in.

1064
01:30:24,171 --> 01:30:27,540
Prison warder Mr Gayle, will take it.

1065
01:30:28,259 --> 01:30:32,126
He curls it.
It's heading to the top right-hand corner.

1066
01:30:36,183 --> 01:30:37,808
No!

1067
01:32:04,688 --> 01:32:06,064
Yeah!

1068
01:32:19,078 --> 01:32:21,569
Guards of Pentonville,
guards of Wandsworth...

1069
01:32:21,747 --> 01:32:24,665
...Walton nick in Liverpool...
...policemen of Britain...

1070
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:27,918
traffic wardens and parole officers,
wheel clampers,

1071
01:32:28,087 --> 01:32:32,962
your boys have taken a hell
of a beating today. A hell of a beating.

1072
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:29,688
Mean Machine!

1073
01:33:31,442 --> 01:33:33,684
Mean Machine, Mean Machine...

1074
01:33:34,528 --> 01:33:38,396
Mean Machine, Mean Machine...

1075
01:33:58,385 --> 01:34:01,671
Burnin' me head out!
Burnin' me head out!

1076
01:34:01,847 --> 01:34:03,970
All down, Danny, all down there.

1077
01:34:04,141 --> 01:34:07,308
- You're all right, Dan.
- Take that.

1078
01:34:07,478 --> 01:34:10,265
- I told you I wouldn't let you down.
- Well done!

1079
01:34:14,652 --> 01:34:18,863
Ruin my life,
I'm gonna fucking ruin your life.

1080
01:34:19,782 --> 01:34:23,482
No. You're not stitching anyone up.
Not on my watch.

1081
01:34:24,745 --> 01:34:28,196
What are you gonna do about it?
Your job, your pension...

1082
01:34:28,374 --> 01:34:30,082
My arse.

1083
01:34:32,002 --> 01:34:33,710
Good game.

1084
01:34:37,049 --> 01:34:39,920
Jesus, what was that?

1085
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:44,338
Looks like your Saab.

1086
01:34:44,515 --> 01:34:49,141
And what he said goes for me and all,
and Barry the Bookie too.

1087
01:34:51,814 --> 01:34:53,474
Nice one, Danny!

1088
01:34:59,071 --> 01:35:02,606
I want him in solitary,

1089
01:35:02,783 --> 01:35:07,611
and I'm the governor,
and that's an order. OK?

1090
01:35:07,788 --> 01:35:10,077
Shut up!

1091
01:35:14,044 --> 01:35:17,045
Stick that in your trophy cabinet.
